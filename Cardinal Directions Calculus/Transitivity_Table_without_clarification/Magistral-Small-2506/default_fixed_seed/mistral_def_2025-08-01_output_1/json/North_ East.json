{"prompt": "Let North and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "North, Northeast, Southeast\n\n(Possible relations because x is north of y, and y is east of z. So x could be directly north of z(if y and z are aligned east-west), or northeast of z (if y is a bit south of x), depending on the y/z alignment, and southeast if x is aligned to the south east from z)", "elapsed-time": 0.8828542232513428, "reasoning-tokens": "0", "completion-tokens": "0"}
