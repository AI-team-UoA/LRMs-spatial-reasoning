(Possible relations because x is north of y, and y is east of z. So x could be directly north of z(if y and z are aligned east-west), or northeast of z (if y is a bit south of x), depending on the y/z alignment, and southeast if x is aligned to the south east from z)

West is not possible, because a region that is west of z could be anywhere in the Western Hemisphere (assuming you are on Earth), and Northeast implies a positivie longitude change (if you're on Earth) or positive direction on the map (if you're on a global map).

For more context, look at a map of Earth. If y is west of z, and x is northeast of y, then x could be almost anywhere east and slightly south of z, but not quite directly south or southeast. However, it is possible for x to be southeast of z if the northeast movement from y to x compensates for the west movement from y to z.

(Possible relations are East as the most likely given that East and Southeast both point in directions with a positive x-component(assuming the plane is structured with increasing y going North and increasing x going East) and Southeast is Southeast, suggesting are likely y component is slower than x component.)
