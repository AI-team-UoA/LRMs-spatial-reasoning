PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

Southeast

West is not possible, because a region that is west of z could be anywhere in the Western Hemisphere (assuming you are on Earth), and Northeast implies a positivie longitude change (if you're on Earth) or positive direction on the map (if you're on a global map).

For more context, look at a map of Earth. If y is west of z, and x is northeast of y, then x could be almost anywhere east and slightly south of z, but not quite directly south or southeast. However, it is possible for x to be southeast of z if the northeast movement from y to x compensates for the west movement from y to z.
