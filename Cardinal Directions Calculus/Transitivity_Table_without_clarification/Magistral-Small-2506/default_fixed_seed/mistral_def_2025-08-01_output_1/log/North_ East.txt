PROMPT: Let North and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

North, Northeast, Southeast

(Possible relations because x is north of y, and y is east of z. So x could be directly north of z(if y and z are aligned east-west), or northeast of z (if y is a bit south of x), depending on the y/z alignment, and southeast if x is aligned to the south east from z)
