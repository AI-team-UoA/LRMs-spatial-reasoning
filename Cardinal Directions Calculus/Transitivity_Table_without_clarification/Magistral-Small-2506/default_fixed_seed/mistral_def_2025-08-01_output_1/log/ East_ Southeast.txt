PROMPT: Let  East and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

East, Southeast, Northeast

(Possible relations are East as the most likely given that East and Southeast both point in directions with a positive x-component(assuming the plane is structured with increasing y going North and increasing x going East) and Southeast is Southeast, suggesting are likely y component is slower than x component.)
