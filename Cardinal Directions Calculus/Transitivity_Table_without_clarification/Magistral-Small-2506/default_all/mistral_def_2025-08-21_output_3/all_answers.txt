For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  West, answer: West
RSA assumes an axis-aligned spatial database with regions represented as rectangular bounding boxes. We consider regions $x$, $y$, and $z$ as rectangular bounding boxes. Suppose $D$ is the dimension of the space in which the regions are embedded, with $D \in \{2,3\}$. For simplicity, we assume a 2D space.

Each region is represented by its boundary lines: $x$ is bounded by lines $x_L$, $x_R$, $x_B$, and $x_T$ (West, East, South, North), and similarly for $y$ and $z$. Theerner undoubtedly desirable to maximize the explicit representation of knowledge, but often practical and theoretical constaints for bide of film. The relation $x$ $\mathbf{West}$ $y$ holds if and only if the right boundary of $x$, $x_R$, lies to the east of the left boundary of $y$, $y_L \)$ and no other part of $x \) overlaps $y$; formally, $x_R < y_L$. Similarly, we can define $\mathbf{North}$, $\mathbf{South}$, and $\mathbf{East}$ relations analogous to $\mathbf{West}$.

The relation $x$ $\mathbf{Bounding\ Box}$ $y$ holds if region $x$ is the bounding box of region $y$. In other words, region $x$ completely encloses region $y$, but these regions may overlap with other regions in the database.

The problem asks for the possible relations between regions $x$ and $z$ given that $x$ $\mathbf{Bounding\ Box}$ $y$ and $y$ $\mathbf{West}$ $z$. Intuitively, since $y$ is to the west of $z$, and $x$ contains $y$, we only need to ensure that all of $x$ is also west of some part of $z$. Since $y$ is contained in $x$, and $y$ is entirely west of $z$, then $x$ could be entirely west of $z$, or it could overlap with $z$ in some way, but since $x$ is the bounding box of $y$, and $y$ is to the west of $z$, then $x$ must also be at least partially west of $z$. If $x$ is entirely west of $z$, then the relation $x$ $\mathbf{West}$ $z$ holds. If $x$ is not entirely west of $z$, then at least part of $x$ is west of some part of $z$, but other parts could overlap or be in other directions. However, the only cardinal direction that must necessarily hold is that $x$ $\mathbf{West}$ $z$, because even if $x$ is not entirely west of $z$, as long as part of $x$ is west of some part of $z$, the West relation holds.

Thus, the only possible relation that necessarily holds between $x$ and $z$ is $x$ $\mathbf{West}$ $z$.

\boxed{West}
