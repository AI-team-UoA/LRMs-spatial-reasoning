For r1: North, r2: North, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations and the given conditions:

- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\).

The possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:

- **North**: If \(x\) is directly above \(z\) with horizontal overlap (e.g., aligned vertically or partially overlapping horizontally).
- **Northwest**: If \(x\) is above and entirely to the west of \(z\) (no horizontal overlap, \(x\) shifted left).
- **Northeast**: If \(x\) is above and entirely to the east of \(z\) (no horizontal overlap, \(x\) shifted right).

These relations arise because:
- The vertical stacking ensures \(x\) is above \(z\).
- Horizontally, \(x\) can be aligned, left-shifted, or right-shifted relative to \(z\), given no constraints from the intermediate \(y\)'s horizontal position.

Thus, the possible relations are: **North, Northwest, Northeast**.
For r1: North, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is North of region y: x is entirely above y (min y-coordinate of x > max y-coordinate of y).
- Region y is Northeast of region z: y is entirely above and entirely to the east of z (min y-coordinate of y > max y-coordinate of z and min x-coordinate of y > max x-coordinate of z).

Combining these:
- **Vertical relation between x and z**: Since x is above y and y is above z, x is entirely above z (min y-coordinate of x > max y-coordinate of y > max y-coordinate of z). Thus, x has a northern component relative to z.
- **Horizontal relation between x and z**:
  - **Case 1: x is entirely to the east of z** (min x-coordinate of x > max x-coordinate of z). This can occur if x is positioned such that it is east of y (or even if not, as long as it is east of z). Then, x is above and east of z → **Northeast**.
  - **Case 2: x is entirely to the west of z** (max x-coordinate of x < min x-coordinate of z). This can occur if x is west of y, and since y is east of z, x is west of z. Then, x is above and west of z → **Northwest**.
  - **Case 3: x overlaps horizontally with z** (min x-coordinate of x ≤ max x-coordinate of z and max x-coordinate of x ≥ min x-coordinate of z). This can occur if x spans horizontally over z's projection. Then, x is directly above z → **North**.

**Bounding Box** is not possible because x is entirely above z (no vertical overlap or containment). **South**, **Southeast**, **Southwest**, **East**, and **West** are impossible due to the vertical northern relation.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **North**, **Northeast**, and **Northwest**.
For r1: North, r2:  Southeast, answer: Given that region x is North of region y and region y is Southeast of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the composition of these relations. The composition of "North" and "Southeast" results in the possible relations being Northeast, East, or Southeast. This is because:

- The position of y southeast of z means y is east and south of z.
- The position of x north of y means x is directly north of y, but with a possible small east-west deviation.
- Relative to z, x will always have an east component due to y's position, but the north-south component can vary:
  - If x is sufficiently north of y and y is not too far south of z, x can be Northeast of z.
  - If the north-south displacement between x and z is minimal compared to the east-west displacement, x can be East of z.
  - If y is far south of z and x is close to y, x can be Southeast of z.

The relations North, South, Northwest, West, Southwest, and Bounding Box are not possible because:
- North would require x to be directly north of z with minimal east component, but the east component from y's position prevents this.
- South would require x to be directly south of z, but x is north of y and y is south of z, so x is never directly south.
- West or southwest/northwest directions are impossible since both relations contribute an east component.
- Bounding Box is not applicable as there is no indication of region overlap or containment.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northeast, East, and Southeast.

**Final Answer:**  
- Northeast  
- East  
- Southeast
For r1: North, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is North of region y, meaning x is at a higher latitude than y.
- Region y is South of region z, meaning z is at a higher latitude than y (since South of z implies z is North of y).

Both x and z are north of y, but their relative positions can vary. The possible relations between x and z (position of x relative to z) are determined by their latitude and longitude differences:
- If x has a higher latitude than z, then x is **North** of z.
- If x has a lower latitude than z, then x is **South** of z.
- If x and z have the same latitude, and x is east of z, then x is **East** of z; if west, **West** of z.
- If x has a higher latitude and is east of z, then x is **Northeast** of z.
- If x has a higher latitude and is west of z, then x is **Northwest** of z.
- If x has a lower latitude and is east of z, then x is **Southeast** of z.
- If x has a lower latitude and is west of z, then x is **Southwest** of z.

All eight cardinal directions are possible because:
- The latitude of x and z can vary independently (both above y's latitude).
- The longitude of x and z can vary independently.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- **North**
- **Northeast**
- **East**
- **Southeast**
- **South**
- **Southwest**
- **West**
- **Northwest**

**Bounding Box** is not applicable here, as it typically denotes containment or overlap, which is not implied by the directional relations given.
For r1: North, r2:  East, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given—region \(x\) is North of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is East of region \(z\)—the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be determined by considering the relative positions. Here, \(x\) being North of \(y\) means \(x\) is vertically above \(y\), and \(y\) being East of \(z\) means \(y\) is horizontally to the right of \(z\). The position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on the horizontal alignment of \(x\) with respect to \(y\) and \(z\):

- If \(x\) is directly aligned vertically above \(z\) (same horizontal position as \(z\)), then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is horizontally to the right of \(z\) (aligned with \(y\)'s horizontal position), then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is horizontally to the left of \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).

No other relations are possible under these constraints, as \(x\) must be North of \(y\) (ensuring it is not South, Southeast, or Southwest of \(z\)) and \(y\) is East of \(z\) (limiting horizontal possibilities).

**Possible relations: North, Northeast, Northwest**
For r1: North, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the composition of cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly above \(y\) (minimal east-west deviation).
- Region \(y\) is Northwest of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is above and to the west of \(z\) (angled northwest).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by combining these displacements:

1. **North**: If the northward displacement from \(y\) to \(x\) is dominant and the westward component from \(z\) to \(y\) is minimal, \(x\) can be directly North of \(z\).
2. **Northwest**: If both displacements contribute significantly to a northwest direction, \(x\) can be Northwest of \(z\).
3. **West**: If the westward displacement from \(z\) to \(y\) is substantial and the northward step from \(y\) to \(x\) is relatively small, \(x\) can be West of \(z\) (as the net movement emphasizes west).

Thus, the possible relations are **North**, **Northwest**, and **West**.
For r1: North, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations—region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is West of region \(z\)—the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary depending on the specific positions and extents of the regions. Here is a breakdown of the possibilities:

- **Northwest (NW)**: \(x\) is entirely west and north of \(z\).  
  Example: \(z\) at (20-30, 20-30), \(y\) at (5-15, 0-10), \(x\) at (10-18, 15-25). Here, \(x\) is west (max \(x\)-coordinate 18 < min \(z\)-x 20) and north (min \(x\)-y 15 > max \(z\)-y 10? No, wait: in this example, \(z\) is at y=20-30, so \(x\) at y=15-25 is not entirely above; adjust: let \(z\) be (20-30, 0-10), then \(x\) at (10-18, 15-25) is north (min \(x\)-y=15>10) and west (max \(x\)-x=18<20).

- **North (N)**: \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) and horizontally overlaps with \(z\).  
  Example: \(z\) at (20-30, 0-10), \(y\) at (5-15, 0-10), \(x\) at (22-28, 15-25). Here, \(x\) is north (min \(x\)-y=15>10) and horizontally within (min \(z\)-x=20 ≤ min \(x\)-x=22 and max \(x\)-x=28 ≤ max \(z\)-x=30).

- **Northeast (NE)**: \(x\) is entirely east and north of \(z\).  
  Example: \(z\) at (20-30, 0-10), \(y\) at (5-15, 0-10), \(x\) at (31-40, 15-25). Here, \(x\) is east (min \(x\)-x=31>30) and north (min \(x\)-y=15>10).

- **West (W)**: \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) and vertically overlaps with \(z\).  
  Example: \(z\) at (20-30, 15-25), \(y\) at (5-15, 0-10), \(x\) at (10-18, 16-20). Here, \(x\) is west (max \(x\)-x=18<20) and vertically overlaps (min \(x\)-y=16 < max \(z\)-y=25 and max \(x\)-y=20 > min \(z\)-y=15).

- **East (E)**: \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) and vertically overlaps with \(z\).  
  Example: \(z\) at (20-30, 0-20), \(y\) at (5-15, 0-10), \(x\) at (31-40, 15-20). Here, \(x\) is east (min \(x\)-x=31>30) and vertically overlaps (min \(x\)-y=15 < max \(z\)-y=20 and max \(x\)-y=20 > min \(z\)-y=0).

- **Southwest (SW)**: \(x\) is entirely west and south of \(z\).  
  Example: \(z\) at (20-30, 20-30), \(y\) at (5-15, 0-10), \(x\) at (10-18, 0-18). Here, \(x\) is west (max \(x\)-x=18<20) and south (max \(x\)-y=18<20).

- **South (S)**: \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) and horizontally overlaps with \(z\).  
  Example: \(z\) at (20-30, 20-30), \(y\) at (5-15, 0-10), \(x\) at (22-28, 0-18). Here, \(x\) is south (max \(x\)-y=18<20) and horizontally within (min \(z\)-x=20 ≤ min \(x\)-x=22 and max \(x\)-x=28 ≤ max \(z\)-x=30).

- **Southeast (SE)**: \(x\) is entirely east and south of \(z\).  
  Example: \(z\) at (20-30, 20-30), \(y\) at (5-15, 0-10), \(x\) at (31-40, 0-18). Here, \(x\) is east (min \(x\)-x=31>30) and south (max \(x\)-y=18<20).

- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) is contained within the minimal bounding box of \(z\) (i.e., the smallest rectangle enclosing \(z\)).  
  Example: \(z\) at (20-30, 20-30), \(y\) at (5-15, 0-10), \(x\) at (22-28, 22-28). Here, \(x\) is within \(z\)'s bounds horizontally (20≤22, 28≤30) and vertically (20≤22, 28≤30), and the relations \(x\) North of \(y\) (min \(x\)-y=22>10) and \(y\) West of \(z\) (max \(y\)-x=15<20) hold.

Thus, all cardinal directions and the bounding box relation are possible between \(x\) and \(z\) under the given constraints.

**Final Answer**  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box.
For r1: North, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is North of region y, meaning x is directly north of y (same x-coordinate, higher y-coordinate if points are considered).
- Region y is Southwest of region z, meaning y is both south and west of z (lower x-coordinate and lower y-coordinate relative to z).

The possible relations between region x and region z depend on the relative positions:
- If x is only slightly north of y (so x's y-coordinate is still negative relative to z), then x is Southwest of z.
- If x is such that its y-coordinate is at the same level as z's origin (y-coordinate = 0 relative to z), then x is West of z.
- If x is far north of y (so x's y-coordinate is positive relative to z), then x is Northwest of z.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

These are the only possible cardinal direction relations, as other directions (e.g., North, South, East) are not feasible given the constraints.

**Final Answer:**  
Southwest, West, Northwest
For r1: North, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **North** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is entirely above the northern boundary of \(y\) (i.e., the minimum y-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of \(y\)), and \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(y\) (i.e., the horizontal extent of \(x\) is between the western and eastern boundaries of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(z\). This means \(y\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing \(z\), so the bounding box of \(z\) (its minimum x, maximum x, minimum y, maximum y) is identical to that of \(y\).

Given that \(y\) is the bounding box of \(z\):
- The northern boundary of \(z\) (its maximum y-coordinate) is the same as that of \(y\).
- The horizontal extent (western and eastern boundaries) of \(z\) is the same as that of \(y\).

Since \(x\) is **North** of \(y\):
- \(x\) is entirely above the northern boundary of \(y\), which is the same as the northern boundary of \(z\).
- \(x\) is horizontally within the extent of \(y\), which is the same as the horizontal extent of \(z\).

Thus, \(x\) must be entirely above the northern boundary of \(z\) and horizontally within the extent of \(z\). This corresponds exactly to the **North** relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

No other cardinal direction (e.g., Northeast, Northwest) is possible because:
- **Northeast** or **Northwest** would require \(x\) to be partially or entirely outside the horizontal extent of \(z\) (e.g., to the east or west), but \(x\) is confined within the horizontal bounds of \(y\) (and hence \(z\)) due to the **North** relation with \(y\).
- Other directions like **East**, **West**, **South**, etc., do not satisfy the vertical positioning (above \(z\)).

Therefore, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **North**.

**Answer: North**
For r1:  Northeast, r2: North, answer: Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(x\) is entirely above and to the right of \(y\), so:
    - \(\text{min}_x(x) \geq \text{max}_x(y)\) (horizontal: \(x\) starts at or to the right of \(y\)'s right boundary)
    - \(\text{min}_y(x) \geq \text{max}_y(y)\) (vertical: \(x\) is above \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is **North** of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(y\) is entirely above \(z\), so:
    - \(\text{min}_y(y) \geq \text{max}_y(z)\) (vertical: \(y\) is above \(z\)).
  - There is horizontal overlap between \(y\) and \(z\), so:
    - \(\text{max}_x(y) \geq \text{min}_x(z)\) and \(\text{min}_x(y) \leq \text{max}_x(z)\) (their horizontal projections intersect).

From these:
- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - \(\text{min}_y(x) \geq \text{max}_y(y) \geq \text{max}_y(z)\), so \(\text{min}_y(x) \geq \text{max}_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is above \(z\).

- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - From \(x\) being Northeast of \(y\): \(\text{min}_x(x) \geq \text{max}_x(y)\).
  - From the overlap of \(y\) and \(z\): \(\text{max}_x(y) \geq \text{min}_x(z)\), so \(\text{min}_x(x) \geq \text{min}_x(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) starts at or to the right of \(z\)'s left boundary).
  - However, the right boundary of \(x\) (\(\text{max}_x(x)\)) is unconstrained relative to \(z\)'s right boundary (\(\text{max}_x(z)\)). Two cases arise:
    1. **If \(\text{min}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(z)\)**:
       - \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) (since its left boundary is to the right of \(z\)'s right boundary).
       - Combined with \(x\) being above \(z\), this implies \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
    2. **If \(\text{min}_x(x) \leq \text{max}_x(z)\)**:
       - Here, \(x\) starts within \(z\)'s horizontal bounds. If \(x\)'s right boundary is within or extends beyond \(z\)'s bounds, but \(x\) is above \(z\), and if the entire horizontal span of \(x\) is considered within \(z\)'s horizontal limits (i.e., \(\text{max}_x(x) \leq \text{max}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) would be **North** of \(z\). Even if \(\text{max}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(z)\), the starting point being within \(z\)'s bounds and the vertical condition can still support the **North** relation in some interpretations, but the definite case for North is when \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s bounds.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **North** (if \(x\) is above \(z\) and horizontally overlaps or is contained within \(z\)'s horizontal span).
- **Northeast** (if \(x\) is above and entirely to the right of \(z\)).

Other directions (e.g., Northwest, West, etc.) are impossible because:
- \(x\) cannot be to the left of \(z\) (since \(\text{min}_x(x) \geq \text{min}_x(z)\)).
- Vertical positioning rules out South, Southeast, etc.
- Bounding Box (containment) is not applicable as \(x\) is above \(z\).

**Answer: North, Northeast**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely north and entirely east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely north and entirely east of \(z\).

From these:
1. **North component**:  
   - Since \(x\) is north of \(y\) and \(y\) is north of \(z\), \(x\) must be north of \(z\).
2. **East component**:  
   - Since \(x\) is east of \(y\) and \(y\) is east of \(z\), \(x\) must be east of \(z\).

Therefore, \(x\) is both north and east of \(z\), which corresponds to the **Northeast** relation. No other cardinal direction (e.g., North, East, Northwest, etc.) or the Bounding Box relation satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

**Possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\): Northeast**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast (NE)** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast (SE)** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is both south and east of \(z\).

### Analysis:
1. **East-West Component**:
   - From \(x\) NE of \(y\): \(x\) is east of \(y\).
   - From \(y\) SE of \(z\): \(y\) is east of \(z\).
   - Therefore, \(x\) is east of \(z\) (transitivity in the east direction).

2. **North-South Component**:
   - From \(x\) NE of \(y\): \(x\) is north of \(y\).
   - From \(y\) SE of \(z\): \(y\) is south of \(z\), so \(z\) is north of \(y\).
   - Comparing \(x\) and \(z\):
     - The north-south relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is not fixed. It depends on the specific positions:
       - If \(x\) is north of \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northeast (NE)** of \(z\).
       - If \(x\) is south of \(z\), then \(x\) is **Southeast (SE)** of \(z\).
       - If \(x\) is at the same latitude as \(z\) (vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounding box), then \(x\) is **East (E)** of \(z\).

### Possible Relations:
- **Northeast (NE)**: \(x\) is north and east of \(z\).
- **Southeast (SE)**: \(x\) is south and east of \(z\).
- **East (E)**: \(x\) is east of \(z\) and vertically within the range of \(z\) (same north-south alignment).

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **Northeast, Southeast, and East**.

**Answer: Northeast, Southeast, East**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\): \(x\) is north and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\): \(y\) is south of \(z\) (i.e., directly south or possibly with an east/west offset).

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the relative positions:

1. **Coordinate analysis** (assuming a Cartesian system with \(z\) at origin for simplicity):
   - \(y\) is south of \(z\) → Position of \(y\): \((a, -b)\) where \(b > 0\) (south implies negative y-direction), and \(a\) can be any real number (east/west offset).
   - \(x\) is northeast of \(y\) → Position of \(x\) relative to \(y\): \((c, d)\) where \(c > 0\) (east) and \(d > 0\) (north). Thus, absolute position of \(x\): \((a + c, -b + d)\).

2. **Position of \(x\) relative to \(z\)**:
   - East-west displacement: \(a + c\) (can be positive, negative, or zero).
   - North-south displacement: \(-b + d\) (can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on \(d > b\), \(d < b\), or \(d = b\)).

3. **Possible directional outcomes**:
   - **East-west positive (\(a + c > 0\)) and north-south positive (\(-b + d > 0\))**: \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
   - **East-west positive (\(a + c > 0\)) and north-south negative (\(-b + d < 0\))**: \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).
   - **East-west positive (\(a + c > 0\)) and north-south zero (\(-b + d = 0\))**: \(x\) is **East** of \(z\).
   - **East-west negative (\(a + c < 0\)) and north-south positive (\(-b + d > 0\))**: \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).
   - **East-west negative (\(a + c < 0\)) and north-south negative (\(-b + d < 0\))**: \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
   - **East-west negative (\(a + c < 0\)) and north-south zero (\(-b + d = 0\))**: \(x\) is **West** of \(z\).
   - **East-west zero (\(a + c = 0\)) and north-south positive (\(-b + d > 0\))**: \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).
   - **East-west zero (\(a + c = 0\)) and north-south negative (\(-b + d < 0\))**: \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).
   - **East-west zero (\(a + c = 0\)) and north-south zero (\(-b + d = 0\))**: \(x\) and \(z\) share the same centroid or overlap, leading to a **Bounding Box** relation (indicating no single cardinal direction applies due to coincidence or containment).

All scenarios are achievable by varying \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) (with \(b > 0\), \(c > 0\), \(d > 0\), and \(a\) arbitrary). Thus, every cardinal direction and the bounding box are possible.

**Possible relations**:  
North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  East, answer: Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the composition of these directions. 

- **Northeast** of \(y\) means \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\).
- **East** of \(z\) means \(y\) is directly east of \(z\) (same north-south alignment as \(z\), but east).

Considering the positions:
- Place \(z\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- \(y\) is east of \(z\), so \(y\) is at \((a, 0)\) for some \(a > 0\).
- \(x\) is northeast of \(y\), so \(x\) is at \((b, c)\) where \(b > a\) (east of \(y\)) and \(c > 0\) (north of \(y\)).

The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((b, c)\) with \(b > a > 0\) and \(c > 0\). The direction from \(z\) to \(x\) depends on the angle \(\theta = \arctan(c/b)\):
- If \(\theta \leq 22.5^\circ\), \(x\) is **East** of \(z\) (east-dominant).
- If \(22.5^\circ < \theta < 67.5^\circ\), \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
- \(\theta\) cannot reach \(67.5^\circ\) or above due to the constraints (since \(b > a > 0\) and \(c = k \cdot (b - a)\) with \(k\) in the range for northeast of \(y\), \(\theta < 67.5^\circ\)).

Thus, the possible relations are:
- **East** (when \(\theta \leq 22.5^\circ\)).
- **Northeast** (when \(22.5^\circ < \theta < 67.5^\circ\)).

No other cardinal relations (like North or Southeast) are possible under these constraints.

**Possible relations: East, Northeast**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region x is **Northeast** of region y. This means x is both north and east of y.
- Region y is **Northwest** of region z. This means y is both north and west of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. **Vertical Component (North-South):**  
   Since x is north of y and y is north of z, x must be north of z. Thus, any relation between x and z must include a northern component (i.e., it cannot be south, southeast, southwest, or directly south).

2. **Horizontal Component (East-West):**  
   - x is east of y, and y is west of z.  
   - The horizontal position of x relative to z depends on the exact positions:  
     - If x is sufficiently far east, it could be east of z (leading to **Northeast**).  
     - If x is not far enough east, it could be west of z (leading to **Northwest**).  
     - If x aligns vertically with z (same east-west position), it would be directly **North**.

Given these possibilities, the relations between x and z can be:
- **Northwest** (if x is west of z and north of z).  
- **North** (if x has the same east-west position as z but is north).  
- **Northeast** (if x is east of z and north of z).

No other relations are possible due to the northern constraint. Thus, the possible relations are **Northwest, North, Northeast**.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely east and north of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **West** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely west of \(z\) (so \(z\) is east of \(y\)).

The relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the relative positions of their minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs). The constraints are:
- \(x\) starts east of \(y\)'s east edge: \(\text{min}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(y)\).
- \(x\) starts north of \(y\)'s north edge: \(\text{min}_y(x) > \text{max}_y(y)\).
- \(z\) starts east of \(y\)'s east edge: \(\text{min}_x(z) > \text{max}_x(y)\).

However, there are no constraints on:
- The relative \(x\)-positions between \(x\) and \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) could be west, east, or overlapping with \(z\) in \(x\)).
- The relative \(y\)-positions between \(x\) and \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) could be north, south, or overlapping with \(z\) in \(y\)).

Thus, all cardinal directions and bounding box are possible, as verified by examples:

- **Northwest**: \(x\) west and north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [0,15]\)).
- **North**: \(x\) overlapping in \(x\) and north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,5] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([4,6] \times [0,15]\)).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) east and north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6,7] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([3,5] \times [0,15]\)).
- **West**: \(x\) west and overlapping in \(y\) with \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [19,22]\)).
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) overlapping with \(z\) in both \(x\) and \(y\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,5] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([4,6] \times [25,35]\)).
- **East**: \(x\) east and overlapping in \(y\) with \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6,7] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([3,5] \times [25,35]\)).
- **Southwest**: \(x\) west and south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [31,40]\)).
- **South**: \(x\) overlapping in \(x\) and south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,5] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([4,6] \times [31,40]\)).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) east and south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6,7] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([3,5] \times [31,40]\)).

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are all: **North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is **Northeast** of region y, meaning x is entirely within the northeast sector of y's bounding box (above and to the right of y's center).
- Region y is **Southwest** of region z, meaning y is entirely within the southwest sector of z's bounding box (below and to the left of z's center).

The possible relations between x and z depend on the relative positions and sizes of the regions. Since the exact distances and sizes are not specified, multiple relations are possible:

- **Northeast**: If x is far enough northeast of y and y is close to z's southwest, x may end up northeast of z.
- **East**: If x is primarily east of y and y is south of z, x could be directly east of z.
- **Southeast**: If x is southeast relative to y (though x is northeast of y, which is strictly northeast, but in composition, it can lead to southeast of z if vertical alignment shifts).
- **South**: If x is slightly northeast of y and y is far southwest of z, x might be south of z.
- **Southwest**: If y is far southwest of z and x is very close to y (barely northeast), x could remain in z's southwest sector.
- **West**: Similar to southwest but with horizontal alignment, x might be west of z.
- **Northwest**: If x is northwest relative to y (though x is northeast of y, the composition with y's southwest position can result in northwest of z).
- **North**: If x is primarily north of y and y is west of z, x could be north of z.
- **Bounding Box**: It is possible for x to be inside z's bounding box (e.g., if y is close to z and x is close to y, x may lie within z's bounding box without being in any specific directional sector).

Thus, all given relations are possible between x and z due to the variability in the positions and extents of the regions. The relations are: **North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Given that region \(x\) is Northeast of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is the Bounding Box of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is determined as follows:

- **Northeast relation**: \(x\) is entirely in the northeast sector relative to the minimal bounding rectangle (MBR) of \(y\). This means \(x\) lies strictly to the east of the eastern boundary of \(y\) and strictly to the north of the northern boundary of \(y\).
- **Bounding Box relation**: \(y\) is the MBR of \(z\), meaning \(z\) is entirely contained within \(y\), and the MBR of \(z\) is exactly \(y\). Thus, the boundaries of \(y\) and the MBR of \(z\) are identical.

Since the MBR of \(z\) is the same as \(y\), the cardinal direction sectors around \(z\) (defined by its MBR) are identical to those around \(y\). Therefore:
- \(x\) lies strictly to the east of the eastern boundary of the MBR of \(z\) (which is the same as that of \(y\)).
- \(x\) lies strictly to the north of the northern boundary of the MBR of \(z\) (which is the same as that of \(y\)).

Consequently, \(x\) is entirely within the northeast sector relative to the MBR of \(z\), so the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **Northeast**.

No other cardinal direction relations (North, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest) are possible because:
- \(x\) cannot be in the north sector (which requires being directly above the MBR of \(z\) but within its horizontal bounds) or the east sector (which requires being directly to the right of the MBR of \(z\) but within its vertical bounds), as \(x\) is both north and east of the boundaries.
- Other directions (e.g., South, West) are opposite and impossible given the Northeast placement.
- **Bounding Box** is not possible, as \(x\) is outside the MBR of \(z\) (since it is Northeast of \(y\), which is that MBR).

Thus, the only possible relation is **Northeast**.
For r1:  Southeast, r2: North, answer: The relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the eight cardinal directions, based on the given relations and possible configurations:

- Region \(x\) is Southeast of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is positioned to the southeast relative to \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is positioned to the north relative to \(z\).

By considering the relative positions:
- \(x\) is southeast of \(y\), so \(x\) is south and east of \(y\).
- \(y\) is north of \(z\), so \(z\) is south of \(y\), with a possible small east-west displacement bounded by the North relation.

The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) depends on the specific distances and displacements:
- **North**: When \(z\) is sufficiently far south of \(y\) and \(x\) is close to directly south or slightly east/west relative to \(z\).
- **Northeast**: When \(x\) is east and north of \(z\).
- **East**: When \(x\) is directly east of \(z\).
- **Southeast**: When \(x\) is east and south of \(z\).
- **South**: When \(x\) is directly south of \(z\).
- **Southwest**: When \(x\) is west and south of \(z\).
- **West**: When \(x\) is directly west of \(z\).
- **Northwest**: When \(x\) is west and north of \(z\).

Each direction is achievable by adjusting the distances between regions while respecting the given relations. For example:
- **Northwest**: If \(x\) is very close to south of \(y\) (small east component) and \(z\) is south of \(y\) with a small east displacement, then \(x\) can be northwest of \(z\).

Thus, all eight cardinal directions are possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Possible relations**:  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is Southeast (SE) of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is east and south of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is Northeast (NE) of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is east and north of \(z\).

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the relative positions:
1. Since \(y\) is NE of \(z\), \(y\) has a greater eastward (positive x) and northward (positive y) displacement from \(z\).
2. Since \(x\) is SE of \(y\), \(x\) has a greater eastward displacement from \(y\) and a southward (negative y) displacement relative to \(y\).

Combining these:
- The eastward displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) is the sum of the eastward displacement from \(z\) to \(y\) and from \(y\) to \(x\), so \(x\) is always east of \(z\).
- The north-south displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) depends on the specific magnitudes:
  - If the southward displacement of \(x\) from \(y\) is less than the northward displacement of \(y\) from \(z\), \(x\) remains north of \(z\) (resulting in **Northeast**).
  - If the southward displacement of \(x\) from \(y\) exactly cancels the northward displacement of \(y\) from \(z\), \(x\) is at the same latitude as \(z\) (resulting in **East**).
  - If the southward displacement of \(x\) from \(y\) exceeds the northward displacement of \(y\) from \(z\), \(x\) ends up south of \(z\) (resulting in **Southeast**).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **Northeast** (if \(x\) is north and east of \(z\))
- **East** (if \(x\) is directly east of \(z\))
- **Southeast** (if \(x\) is south and east of \(z\))

No other cardinal directions are possible because \(x\) must be east of \(z\) in all cases, and the north-south position varies as described.

**Final Answer:** Northeast, East, Southeast
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided, if region \(x\) is Southeast of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is Southeast of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be derived through composition. The composition of two Southeast relations can result in one of three directions, depending on the relative positions:

- **East**: If the eastward displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) is significantly larger than the southward displacement.
- **Southeast**: If the eastward and southward displacements are comparable.
- **South**: If the southward displacement is significantly larger than the eastward displacement.

These outcomes arise because the combined vector from \(z\) to \(x\) (via \(y\)) can fall into different directional sectors relative to \(z\), specifically:
- Between 67.5° and 112.5° from north (East).
- Between 112.5° and 157.5° from north (Southeast).
- Between 157.5° and 202.5° from north (South).

Thus, the possible relations are:

- East
- Southeast
- South
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  South, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Southeast** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the positions:

1. Since \(y\) is directly **South** of \(z\), \(y\) is located below \(z\).
2. \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(y\), meaning \(x\) is to the southeast relative to \(y\) (i.e., both east and south of \(y\)).

Combining these:
- The movement from \(z\) to \(y\) is directly south.
- The movement from \(y\) to \(x\) is southeast (south and east).
- Thus, the overall displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) has:
  - An eastward component (from the movement \(y\) to \(x\)).
  - A southward component (from both \(z\) to \(y\) and \(y\) to \(x\)).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the relative magnitudes of these components:

- **Southeast**: If the eastward component is comparable to the southward component (i.e., the angle from \(z\) to \(x\) is approximately 45° south of east). For example:
  - \(z\) at (0,0), \(y\) at (0,-1), \(x\) at (1,-1.5): vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is (1, -1.5), indicating southeast.
- **South**: If the southward component dominates significantly (i.e., the angle is closer to due south, but still with an eastward offset). For example:
  - \(z\) at (0,0), \(y\) at (0,-1), \(x\) at (0.5,-3): vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is (0.5, -3), indicating south.

The relation **East** is not possible because the southward component from \(z\) to \(x\) is always present (due to \(y\) being south of \(z\) and \(x\) being south of \(y\)) and cannot be negligible compared to the eastward component. Similarly, other directions like **Northeast**, **Northwest**, **West**, **Southwest**, or **North** are excluded because the displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) always has a positive eastward component and a negative southward component.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:

- **Southeast**
- **South**
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region x is Southeast of region y: x is both south and east of y.
- Region y is East of region z: y is east of z, implying no specific north-south relation between y and z.

Considering the relative positions:

1. **Longitude (east-west):**
   - Since y is east of z, z is west of y.
   - Since x is east of y (as part of Southeast), x is east of y and thus east of z (as z is west of y).

2. **Latitude (north-south):**
   - x is south of y (as part of Southeast).
   - The latitude of z relative to y is unspecified (could be north, same, or south).

Possible latitude scenarios for z relative to y:

- **Case 1: z is at the same latitude as y.**
  - Then x is south of y (and thus south of z).
  - Result: x is southeast of z (east and south).

- **Case 2: z is north of y.**
  - Then x is south of y, so z is north of x.
  - Result: x is southeast of z (east and south, since z is north of y and x is south of y).

- **Case 3: z is south of y.**
  - Then both z and x are south of y, but their relative latitudes vary:
    - **Subcase 3a:** x is south of z.
      - Result: x is southeast of z (east and south).
    - **Subcase 3b:** x is at the same latitude as z.
      - Result: x is east of z.
    - **Subcase 3c:** x is north of z.
      - Result: x is northeast of z (east and north).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Southeast** (from Cases 1, 2, and 3a),
- **East** (from Case 3b),
- **Northeast** (from Case 3c).

Other relations like North, South, West, etc., are impossible because:
- x is always east of z (longitude constraint).
- x cannot be directly north or south of z without the east component, which is always present.

Therefore, the possible relations are **Southeast, East, Northeast**.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Southeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is south and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is north and west of \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the relative positions derived from these constraints. The combination allows for multiple scenarios:

1. **Northwest (NW)**: \(x\) could be west and north of \(z\).
2. **Northeast (NE)**: \(x\) could be east and north of \(z\).
3. **Southwest (SW)**: \(x\) could be west and south of \(z\).
4. **Southeast (SE)**: \(x\) could be east and south of \(z\).
5. **North (N)**: \(x\) could be directly north of \(z\) (overlap in east-west).
6. **South (S)**: \(x\) could be directly south of \(z\) (overlap in east-west).
7. **East (E)**: \(x\) could be directly east of \(z\) (overlap in north-south).
8. **West (W)**: \(x\) could be directly west of \(z\) (overlap in north-south).
9. **Bounding Box**: The MBRs of \(x\) and \(z\) might overlap in both axes.

Thus, all nine relations are possible due to the flexibility in the relative positioning (e.g., varying distances and alignments).

**Possible relations**:  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **Southeast** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **West** of region \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the composition of these directions. The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) can be analyzed as follows:

- Starting from \(z\), \(y\) is directly west, so \(y\) has a position west of \(z\).
- From \(y\), \(x\) is southeast, meaning \(x\) is both south and east of \(y\).

The net displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) depends on the relative magnitudes of the movements:
- **East component**: Movement east from \(y\) to \(x\) may counteract or exceed the west displacement from \(z\) to \(y\).
- **South component**: Movement south from \(y\) to \(x\) is consistent.

This results in five possible sectors for \(x\) relative to \(z\):

1. **East**: If the eastward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) is dominant and the south component is minimal.
2. **Southeast**: If the eastward and south components are significant, with a bearing between 112.5° and 157.5°.
3. **South**: If the east-west components balance (net zero east-west displacement) or the south component dominates.
4. **Southwest**: If the westward net displacement is significant with a substantial south component, bearing between 202.5° and 247.5°.
5. **West**: If the westward net displacement is dominant and the south component is minimal, bearing between 247.5° and 292.5°.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West**.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is Southeast of region y, meaning x is to the east and south of y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z, meaning y is to the west and south of z.

The position of x relative to z depends on the exact distances:
1. **South**: If the eastward movement from y to x exactly balances the westward position of y from z, x is directly south of z.
2. **Southeast**: If the eastward movement from y to x is greater than the westward offset of y from z, x is east and south of z.
3. **Southwest**: If the eastward movement from y to x is less than the westward offset of y from z, x is west and south of z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **South, Southeast, Southwest**.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is **Southeast** of region y, meaning x is entirely to the south and east of y.
- Region y is the **Bounding Box** of region z, meaning y is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing z, so z is entirely within y.

Since z is entirely within y, and x is southeast of y, x must be southeast of every point in z. Therefore:
- x is entirely to the south of z (because x is south of y, and z is within y).
- x is entirely to the east of z (because x is east of y, and z is within y).

Thus, the only possible relation between region x and region z is **Southeast**.

**Final Answer: Southeast**
For r1:  South, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is South of region \(y\), meaning \(y\) is North of \(x\).
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\), meaning \(z\) is South of \(y\).

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are located south of \(y\), but their relative positions to each other are not constrained by the given information. Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary depending on their exact positions relative to \(y\). For example:
- If \(z\) is northwest of \(x\), the relation is Northwest.
- If \(z\) is directly north of \(x\), the relation is North.
- If \(z\) is northeast of \(x\), the relation is Northeast.
- If \(z\) is east of \(x\), the relation is East.
- If \(z\) is southeast of \(x\), the relation is Southeast.
- If \(z\) is directly south of \(x\), the relation is South.
- If \(z\) is southwest of \(x\), the relation is Southwest.
- If \(z\) is west of \(x\), the relation is West.

Thus, all eight cardinal directions are possible between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **North**
- **Northeast**
- **East**
- **Southeast**
- **South**
- **Southwest**
- **West**
- **Northwest**

The "Bounding Box" relation is not applicable here, as the relations are purely directional and not based on bounding regions.
For r1:  South, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly south or within the south sector (bearing between 157.5° and 202.5° from \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is northeast of \(z\) (both east and north of \(z\)).

The composition of these relations yields multiple possibilities for the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) due to the positional flexibility:

- **Northeast**: If \(x\) is slightly south of \(y\) but still north and east of \(z\) (e.g., \(y\) at (1,1), \(x\) at (1,0.5) relative to \(z\) at (0,0)).
- **East**: If \(x\) is directly south of \(y\) and ends up due east of \(z\) (e.g., \(y\) at (1,1), \(x\) at (1,0)).
- **Southeast**: If \(x\) is south of \(y\) and further south, remaining east of \(z\) (e.g., \(y\) at (1,1), \(x\) at (1,-1)).
- **South**: If \(x\) is south of \(y\) and west/east movements balance to place it directly south of \(z\) (e.g., \(y\) at (2,2), \(x\) at (0,-1), bearing ~180° from \(z\)).
- **Southwest**: If \(x\) is south of \(y\) with significant west movement, placing it southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(y\) at (3,2), \(x\) at (-1,-1)).

Other relations (North, Northwest, West) are not possible because:
- \(x\) must be south of \(y\), which is northeast of \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\) in a way that yields **North** or **Northwest**.
- **West** alone is not observed; movements要么 yield **Southwest** or other relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest**.

**Answer:** Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest
For r1:  South, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is South of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- **South**: If region x is far south of region y, the east component becomes negligible relative to the south component, making x directly South of z.
- **Southeast**: If region x is close to region y, the position retains the southeast influence from y relative to z.

These are the only possible relations, as the east component from y's position ensures x cannot be directly East, West, North, or other directions. "Bounding Box" is not applicable here, as the relations imply disjoint regions with no overlap.

**Possible relations: South, Southeast**
For r1:  South, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is South of region \(y\): This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(y\)), and their horizontal projections (x-axis intervals) overlap.
- Region \(y\) is South of region \(z\): Similarly, \(y\) is entirely below \(z\), and their horizontal projections overlap.

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy:
1. **Vertical alignment**: Since \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is below \(z\), \(x\) is necessarily below \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\)).
2. **Horizontal alignment**: The horizontal projections of \(x\) and \(z\) may or may not overlap, depending on the positions:
   - **Overlap**: If the horizontal intervals of \(x\) and \(z\) overlap (i.e., they share some x-axis range), then \(x\) is directly **South** of \(z\).
   - **No overlap, \(x\) to the left of \(z\)**: If the entire horizontal interval of \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) (i.e., the maximum x-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum x-coordinate of \(z\)), then \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
   - **No overlap, \(x\) to the right of \(z\)**: If the entire horizontal interval of \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) (i.e., the minimum x-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of \(z\)), then \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **South** (if horizontal projections overlap),
- **Southwest** (if \(x\) is left of \(z\)),
- **Southeast** (if \(x\) is right of \(z\)).

No other cardinal directions are possible because \(x\) must be below \(z\), ruling out North, Northeast, Northwest, etc., and "Bounding Box" is not needed as the relations are specific cardinal directions.

**Answer: South, Southeast, Southwest**
For r1:  South, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations—region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\)—the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary depending on the relative positions. Through careful consideration of bounding boxes and directional constraints, all nine relations (including the bounding box overlap) are possible. Examples for each case demonstrate this:

- **North**: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([1,2] \times [2,3]\), \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [1.1,1.9]\).
- **Northeast**: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(x\) at \([2,3] \times [1.1,1.9]\).
- **East**: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(x\) at \([2,3] \times [0,1]\).
- **Southeast**: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [-1,0]\), \(x\) at \([2,3] \times [-2,-1]\).
- **South**: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [-2,-1]\).
- **Southwest**: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([-1,0] \times [-2,-1]\).
- **West**: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(x\) at \([-1,0] \times [0,1]\).
- **Northwest**: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(x\) at \([-1,0] \times [1,2]\).
- **Bounding Box**: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [1,2]\), \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all cardinal directions and the bounding box overlap.

**Answer: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**
For r1:  South, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is **South** of region y: This means x is directly below y (same horizontal position, vertical position decreased).
- Region y is **Northwest** of region z: This means y is above and to the left of z.

To determine possible relations between x and z:

1. **Horizontal position**: Since y is to the left of z (from y being Northwest of z), and x has the same horizontal position as y (from x being South of y), x is also to the left of z.
2. **Vertical position**: 
   - The vertical position of y is above z.
   - The vertical position of x is below y but can vary relative to z:
     - If x is above z (e.g., if the vertical drop from y to x is small), then x is to the left and above z, resulting in **Northwest**.
     - If x is at the same vertical level as z (e.g., if the vertical drop from y to x places it exactly at z's level), then x is directly to the left of z, resulting in **West**.
     - If x is below z (e.g., if the vertical drop from y to x is large), then x is to the left and below z, resulting in **Southwest**.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **Southwest**

**Bounding Box** is not possible because x is entirely to the left of z (no horizontal overlap), and the vertical position may not align for overlap. Other directions like North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and East are excluded because x is always to the left of z and cannot be to the right or directly above/below without conflicting with the given relations.
For r1:  South, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is South of region y, meaning x is directly south of y with the same x-range.
- Region y is West of region z, meaning y is directly west of z with the same y-range.

To determine the relation between x and z:
- Since y is west of z and shares the same y-range as z, y is positioned to the left of z at the same vertical level.
- Since x is south of y and shares the same x-range as y, x is positioned below y at the same horizontal level.
- Therefore, relative to z, x is both south and west, resulting in the Southwest relation.

This relation holds definitively under the standard cardinal direction model, where "South" and "West" are pure directions implying alignment in the respective ranges. No other relations (e.g., South, West, or Bounding Box) are possible given the constraints.

**Possible relation: Southwest**
For r1:  South, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations, region \(x\) is South of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is Southwest of region \(z\). The displacement from \(z\) to \(y\) has components west and south, and the displacement from \(y\) to \(x\) is directly south. The total displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) is the vector sum, resulting in both west and south components relative to \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the ratio of the west displacement to the south displacement:
- If the west component is relatively small, \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).
- If the west component is moderate, \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
- If the west component is relatively large, \(x\) is **West** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are:
- **South**
- **Southwest**
- **West**

These are derived from the 8-sector cardinal direction model, where the bearing from \(z\) to \(x\) falls within the sectors for South (157.5° to 202.5°), Southwest (202.5° to 247.5°), or West (247.5° to 292.5°), depending on the specific displacements.
For r1:  South, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of \(y\) (i.e., the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\)) and horizontally within the MBR of \(y\) (i.e., the horizontal interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is **Bounding Box** of region \(z\), meaning \(z\) is entirely contained within the MBR of \(y\) (i.e., both horizontally and vertically, \(z\) lies within the bounds of \(y\)).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is fixed:  
- Since \(x\) is below \(y\) (\(x_{\text{max}\_y < y_{\text{min}\_y}\)) and \(z\) is inside \(y\) (\(z_{\text{min}\_y \geq y_{\text{min}\_y}\)), it follows that \(x_{\text{max}\_y < y_{\text{min}\_y} \leq z_{\text{min}\_y}\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (i.e., \(x_{\text{max}\_y < z_{\text{min}\_y}\)).

Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are contained within the MBR of \(y\), but their relative positions can vary:  
- If \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (i.e., the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\), or \(x_{\text{max}\_x < z_{\text{min}\_x}\)), then \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).  
- If \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) (i.e., the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\), or \(x_{\text{min}\_x > z_{\text{max}\_x}\)), then \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).  
- If \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\) (i.e., \(z_{\text{min}\_x \leq x_{\text{min}\_x}\) and \(x_{\text{max}\_x} \leq z_{\text{max}\_x}\)), then \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).  

These arrangements are possible under the given constraints. Other relations (e.g., North, East, West, etc.) are not possible because \(x\) is below \(z\) and cannot overlap vertically above or be horizontally aligned without being left, right, or contained. The **Bounding Box** relation is impossible as \(x\) is below \(z\) and disjoint vertically.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **South**, **Southwest**, and **Southeast**.  

**Answer: South, Southwest, Southeast**
For r1:  East, r2: North, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations—region x is East of region y, and region y is North of region z—the possible relation between region x and region z is Northeast.

This is derived from the composition of the relations:  
- x being East of y implies that x is to the east relative to y.  
- y being North of z implies that y is to the north relative to z.  
Combining these, x is positioned to the northeast of z, as it inherits the eastern component from its relation with y and the northern component from y's relation with z.

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., Southeast, South, etc.) are possible under these constraints, as they would conflict with the given relations. For instance:  
- x cannot be South of z because y is North of z, and x is related to y with no southern component implied.  
- Similarly, other directions like West or Southwest are inconsistent with the East relation between x and y.

Thus, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is **Northeast**.
For r1:  East, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **East** of region y: This means x is entirely to the east of y, so the left boundary of x is to the east of the right boundary of y.
- Region y is **Northeast** of region z: This means y is entirely north and east of z, so y is above the top boundary of z and to the east of the right boundary of z.

Considering the spatial constraints:
- **East-West**: Since x is east of y and y is east of z, x must be east of z. Specifically, the left boundary of x is to the east of the right boundary of z. Thus, x is **East** of z.
- **North-South**: The vertical position of x relative to z is not directly constrained. Therefore, x can be:
  - **Entirely north of z**: If the bottom boundary of x is at or above the top boundary of z, then x is both north and east of z, making the relation **Northeast**.
  - **Entirely south of z**: If the top boundary of x is at or below the bottom boundary of z, then x is both south and east of z, making the relation **Southeast**.
  - **Vertically overlapping or adjacent to z**: If x overlaps with z vertically or is exactly adjacent (e.g., top of z equals bottom of x), then x is only **East** of z (since it is east but not entirely north or south).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **East** (if vertically overlapping or adjacent)
- **Northeast** (if entirely north)
- **Southeast** (if entirely south)

Other relations (e.g., North, South, West, Northwest, Southwest) are not possible because x must be east of z, and the vertical positioning only allows the above cases. Bounding Box is not a cardinal direction relation and does not apply.

**Answer: East, Northeast, Southeast**
For r1:  East, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is **East** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast** of region \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be determined by considering the relative positions. Let \(z\) be at the origin. Then:
- \(y\) is southeast of \(z\), so \(y\) is positioned such that it has both east and south components relative to \(z\).
- \(x\) is east of \(y\), so \(x\) is shifted further east from \(y\).

The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) combines these displacements:
- The southeast displacement from \(z\) to \(y\) contributes a vector with positive east and negative south components.
- The east displacement from \(y\) to \(x\) adds a positive east component.

Thus, the net vector from \(z\) to \(x\) has:
- A strong east component (due to both displacements).
- A south component (from \(y\)'s position).

The direction of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on the magnitudes:
- If the eastward shift from \(y\) to \(x\) is large compared to the southeast shift from \(z\) to \(y\), the south component becomes relatively small, resulting in \(x\) being **East** of \(z\).
- If the eastward shift is smaller, the south component remains significant, resulting in \(x\) being **Southeast** of \(z\).

Both scenarios are possible, leading to the relations:
- **East**
- **Southeast**

Other directions (e.g., North, Northeast, South, etc.) are not possible because the combined displacements keep \(x\) in the east-southeast quadrant relative to \(z\).

**Possible relations: East, Southeast**
For r1:  East, r2:  South, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is East of region y, meaning x is directly east of y (same y-coordinate, x has higher x-coordinate).
- Region y is South of region z, meaning y is directly south of z (same x-coordinate, y has lower y-coordinate).

The composition of these relations results in region x being Southeast of region z. This is because:
- From z, moving south to y and then east to x places x in the southeast quadrant relative to z.
- The centroid of x relative to z has a positive x-displacement (east component) and a negative y-displacement (south component), confirming the southeast direction.

Given the pure cardinal directions specified (no mixed or approximate relations), the only possible relation between region x and region z is Southeast. Other relations like East, South, or Bounding Box are not possible due to the defined constraints.

**Possible relation: Southeast**
For r1:  East, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is East of region \(y\): \(x\) lies entirely to the east of \(y\) (i.e., the minimum x-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is East of region \(z\): \(y\) lies entirely to the east of \(z\) (i.e., the minimum x-coordinate of \(y\) is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of \(z\)).

This implies that \(x\) lies entirely to the east of \(z\) (since \(x\) is east of \(y\), which is east of \(z\)). However, the vertical (north-south) relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) is not constrained by the given relations. Therefore, the possible vertical alignments are:

1. **East**: If \(x\) and \(z\) have vertical overlap (i.e., their y-coordinate ranges intersect).  
   Example: \(x\) is directly east of \(z\) with some vertical overlap.

2. **Northeast**: If \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (i.e., the minimum y-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of \(z\)).  
   Example: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).

3. **Southeast**: If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\)).  
   Example: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).

No other cardinal directions are possible because \(x\) must be east of \(z\) horizontally, ruling out West, Northwest, Southwest, North, and South. The "Bounding Box" relation is not applicable here, as \(x\) is strictly east of \(z\) and not containing or contained vertically.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
East, Northeast, Southeast
For r1:  East, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **East** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is to the east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is to the northwest of \(z\) (i.e., both north and west of \(z\)).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the relative positions:

1. Since \(y\) is northwest of \(z\), \(y\) is located north and west of \(z\).
2. \(x\) is east of \(y\), so \(x\) is to the east of \(y\)'s position.

The position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on how far east \(x\) is from \(y\):

- If \(x\) is only slightly east of \(y\) (but still west of \(z\)), \(x\) remains northwest of \(z\) (since it retains the north component from \(y\) and is still west of \(z\)).
- If \(x\) is directly east of \(y\) such that it aligns vertically with \(z\) but north, \(x\) is north of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is far enough east of \(y\) to be east of \(z\), \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) (since it is north of \(z\) due to \(y\)'s position and east of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **Northwest** (if \(x\) is still west of \(z\)),
- **North** (if \(x\) is directly north of \(z\)),
- **Northeast** (if \(x\) is east of \(z\)).

No other relations are possible given the constraints. The answer does not include "Bounding Box" as it is not a directional relation and is not applicable here.

**Answer:** Northwest, North, Northeast
For r1:  East, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is East of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is West of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary due to the lack of constraints on north-south positioning and the possibility of overlapping or coincident regions. Here's the reasoning:

- **East-West component**:  
  - \(x\) is East of \(y\) implies \(x\) is to the east of \(y\).  
  - \(y\) is West of \(z\) implies \(y\) is to the west of \(z\).  
  - This means both \(x\) and \(z\) are east of \(y\), but their relative east-west positions to each other are not fixed. Specifically:  
    - \(x\) could be east of \(z\) (if the eastern part of \(x\) is east of the western part of \(z\)).  
    - \(x\) could be west of \(z\) (if the western part of \(x\) is west of the eastern part of \(z\)).  
    - \(x\) and \(z\) could share the same longitude (if their east-west positions align).  

- **North-South component**:  
  - There are no constraints on the north-south relationship between \(x\) and \(z\). Thus:  
    - \(x\) could be north of \(z\).  
    - \(x\) could be south of \(z\).  
    - \(x\) and \(z\) could share the same latitude.  

- **Combined relations**:  
  - Depending on the east-west and north-south alignments, all eight cardinal directions are possible:  
    - **East**: \(x\) east of \(z\) with no north-south offset.  
    - **West**: \(x\) west of \(z\) with no north-south offset.  
    - **North**: \(x\) north of \(z\) with same longitude.  
    - **South**: \(x\) south of \(z\) with same longitude.  
    - **Northeast**: \(x\) east and north of \(z\).  
    - **Northwest**: \(x\) west and north of \(z\).  
    - **Southeast**: \(x\) east and south of \(z\).  
    - **Southwest**: \(x\) west and south of \(z\).  

- **Bounding Box**:  
  - If the regions \(x\) and \(z\) overlap (e.g., their bounding boxes intersect) or are coincident, no single cardinal direction applies, and the relation is "Bounding Box". This is possible since the constraints do not prevent overlap.  

Thus, every cardinal direction and the "Bounding Box" relation is possible. The complete list of possible relations is:  
**North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**.
For r1:  East, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given, where region \(x\) is East of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is Southwest of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can vary depending on the relative positions. The East relation from \(y\) to \(x\) allows \(x\) to be positioned within a 45° cone eastward from \(y\) (spanning from 67.5° to 112.5° clockwise from north). The Southwest relation from \(z\) to \(y\) places \(y\) in a 45° cone southwest from \(z\) (202.5° to 247.5°).

Through vector composition, the direction from \(z\) to \(x\) can cover all possible sectors. For example:
- If \(y\) is close to \(z\) and \(x\) is slightly east of \(y\), \(x\) may be Southwest of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is far east of \(y\), it can be East, Southeast, or Northeast of \(z\).
- Adjusting the distance and angle, \(x\) can also be North, South, West, or Northwest of \(z\).

Thus, all eight cardinal directions are possible:
- **North**
- **Northeast**
- **East**
- **Southeast**
- **South**
- **Southwest**
- **West**
- **Northwest**

The "Bounding Box" relation is not applicable here, as the relations are directional and the scenarios do not necessitate a bounding box for point-based reasoning. The possible relations are the cardinal directions listed.
For r1:  East, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **East** of region \(y\). This means:
  - \(x\) lies entirely to the east of \(y\) (i.e., the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\)).
  - In the 9-tile model, \(x\) must also be within the vertical extent (north-south boundaries) of \(y\), as "East" is a single-tile relation requiring full vertical alignment.

- Region \(y\) is **Bounding Box** of region \(z\). This means:
  - The minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of \(z\) is exactly the MBR of \(y\). Thus, \(z\) is contained within \(y\)'s MBR, and the spatial extents (east, west, north, south boundaries) of \(y\) and \(z\) are identical.

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Horizontal (east-west) relation**:
   - Since \(x\) is east of \(y\) and \(y\)'s eastern boundary equals \(z\)'s eastern boundary (because \(y\) is the MBR of \(z\)), \(x\) must lie entirely to the east of \(z\)'s eastern boundary. Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical (north-south) relation**:
   - Because \(x\) is **East** of \(y\), \(x\) must lie within the vertical (north-south) boundaries of \(y\) (as per the 9-tile model definition of "East").
   - Since \(y\) is the MBR of \(z\), the vertical boundaries of \(z\) are identical to those of \(y\). Therefore, \(x\) also lies within the vertical boundaries of \(z\).

3. **Resulting relation**:
   - \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\) and within \(z\)'s vertical extent. This fits the definition of the **East** tile in the 9-tile model relative to \(z\).

### Conclusion:
The only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **East**.

- **No other relations are possible**:
  - **Northeast/Southeast**: Would require \(x\) to be entirely north/south of \(z\)'s vertical extent, but \(x\) is constrained to be within \(z\)'s vertical bounds.
  - **North/South/West/Southwest/Northwest**: Contradict the eastward positioning.
  - **Bounding Box**: Requires identical MBRs, but \(x\) is east of \(z\) and cannot share the same MBR.

**Answer: East**
For r1:  Northwest, r2: North, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both North and West of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **North** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly North of \(z\) with no East-West deviation.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the relative positions:

1. **North**: If the North component dominates (i.e., the vertical distance from \(z\) to \(x\) is significantly larger than the West component), \(x\) can be directly North of \(z\).  
   Example: \(z\) at (0,0), \(y\) at (0,10), \(x\) at (-1,20). The bearing from \(z\) to \(x\) is nearly 0° (North).

2. **Northwest**: If both North and West components are comparable, \(x\) is Northwest of \(z\).  
   Example: \(z\) at (0,0), \(y\) at (0,5), \(x\) at (-5,10). The bearing from \(z\) to \(x\) is ≈315° (Northwest).

3. **West**: If the West component dominates (i.e., the horizontal distance West is significantly larger than the North component), \(x\) can be West of \(z\).  
   Example: \(z\) at (0,0), \(y\) at (0,1), \(x\) at (-100,2). The bearing from \(z\) to \(x\) is ≈270° (West).

These cover all possibilities, as the relations must account for the combined North (from \(y\) to \(z\) and \(x\) to \(y\)) and West (from \(x\) to \(y\)) components. No other cardinal directions (e.g., East, South, Southwest, etc.) are possible because \(x\) is consistently North and West relative to \(y\), and \(y\) is North of \(z\).

**Possible relations**: North, Northwest, West.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\):  
  This means \(x\) is **west** and **north** of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\):  
  This means \(y\) is **east** and **north** of \(z\).

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Vertical (north-south) component**:  
   - \(y\) is north of \(z\) (from \(y\) Northeast of \(z\)).  
   - \(x\) is north of \(y\) (from \(x\) Northwest of \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(x\) must be **north** of \(z\) (transitivity of north).  

2. **Horizontal (east-west) component**:  
   - \(x\) is west of \(y\) (from \(x\) Northwest of \(y\)).  
   - \(y\) is east of \(z\) (from \(y\) Northeast of \(z\)).  
   The horizontal position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) can vary:  
     - If \(x\) is **west** of \(z\): then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).  
     - If \(x\) has the **same east-west position** as \(z\): then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).  
     - If \(x\) is **east** of \(z\): then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).  

### Possible relations:
- **Northwest** of \(z\): when \(x\) is west of \(z\).  
- **North** of \(z\): when \(x\) aligns horizontally with \(z\).  
- **Northeast** of \(z\): when \(x\) is east of \(z\).  

These cover all feasible cases based on the constraints. Other cardinal directions (e.g., South, Southwest) are impossible due to the north transitivity.  

**Answer: Northwest, North, Northeast**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely north and west of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely south and east of \(z\).

### Horizontal Analysis:
- Since \(x\) is west of \(y\) and \(y\) is east of \(z\), \(x\) must be west of \(z\). Specifically, the entire region \(x\) lies to the west of \(z\), establishing that \(x\) is **west** of \(z\).

### Vertical Analysis:
- \(x\) is north of \(y\), and \(y\) is south of \(z\). However, the relative vertical position between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the distances:
  - If the northward extent of \(x\) relative to \(y\) is greater than the southward extent of \(y\) from \(z\), \(x\) could be north of \(z\).
  - If the northward extent is less, \(x\) could be south of \(z\).
  - If there is vertical overlap (i.e., neither entirely north nor south), the vertical relation is indeterminate for pure north/south.

### Combined Relations:
- **Northwest**: If \(x\) is both north and west of \(z\).
- **Southwest**: If \(x\) is both south and west of \(z\).
- **West**: If \(x\) is west of \(z\) but vertically overlaps with \(z\) (not entirely north or south), or if the vertical alignment results in no net north/south displacement.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northwest**, **West**, and **Southwest**.

**Final Answer: Northwest, West, Southwest**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  South, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is to the northwest of \(y\) (i.e., west and north of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly south of \(z\) (i.e., aligned horizontally and below \(z\)).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal Component**:
   - Since \(y\) is south of \(z\), \(y\) is horizontally aligned with \(z\) (same east-west alignment).
   - \(x\) is northwest of \(y\), so \(x\) is west of \(y\).
   - Therefore, \(x\) must be west of \(z\) (since \(y\) and \(z\) are aligned).

2. **Vertical Component**:
   - \(y\) is south of \(z\), so \(y\) is below \(z\).
   - \(x\) is northwest of \(y\), so \(x\) is above \(y\).
   - The vertical position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on the distances:
     - If the northward distance from \(y\) to \(x\) is **greater** than the southward distance from \(z\) to \(y\), then \(x\) ends up above \(z\) (north component).
     - If it is **less**, \(x\) ends up below \(z\) (south component).
     - If it is **equal**, \(x\) is at the same vertical level as \(z\) (aligned vertically).

Combining the horizontal and vertical components:
- **West** if \(x\) is vertically aligned with \(z\).
- **Northwest** if \(x\) is above \(z\).
- **Southwest** if \(x\) is below \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northwest**, **West**, and **Southwest**. No other relations are possible given the constraints.

**Answer: Northwest, West, Southwest**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is to the northwest relative to \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly east of \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the relative positions:

1. **Positioning**:
   - Place \(z\) at the origin for reference.
   - Since \(y\) is east of \(z\), \(y\) is positioned to the right (positive x-direction) of \(z\).
   - Since \(x\) is northwest of \(y\), \(x\) is above and to the left of \(y\) (negative x-direction and positive y-direction relative to \(y\)).

2. **Combined effect**:
   - The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) combines:
     - The eastward shift from \(z\) to \(y\) (positive x-component).
     - The northwest shift from \(y\) to \(x\) (negative x-component and positive y-component).
   - The net direction depends on the magnitudes:
     - If the eastward shift (from \(z\) to \(y\)) is large, \(x\) may end up northeast or east of \(z\).
     - If the northwest shift (from \(y\) to \(x\)) dominates, \(x\) may end up northwest of \(z\).
     - Intermediate cases can place \(x\) directly north of \(z\).

3. **Possible relations**:
   - **North**: If the net x-component is zero (e.g., the east shift balances the west component of the northwest shift), \(x\) is directly north of \(z\).
   - **Northeast**: If the net x-component is positive and the y-component is positive (e.g., moderate east shift and moderate northwest shift), \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).
   - **East**: If the east shift is very large compared to the northwest shift, \(x\) ends up primarily east of \(z\), with a slight north component.
   - **Northwest**: If the northwest shift dominates (e.g., \(y\) is close to \(z\) eastward, but \(x\) is far northwest of \(y\)), \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **North**, **Northeast**, **East**, and **Northwest**.

**Final Answer**:  
North, Northeast, East, Northwest
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is Northwest of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is Northwest of region \(z\).

The composition of two Northwest relations results in possible relations that depend on the relative positioning. Specifically, the vector from \(z\) to \(x\) combines the northwest vector from \(z\) to \(y\) and the northwest vector from \(y\) to \(x\). This can yield:

1. **North**: If the north component dominates (e.g., \(x\) is significantly north of \(y\), and \(y\) is slightly northwest of \(z\), leading to \(x\) being primarily north of \(z\)).
2. **Northwest**: If the combined vectors align directly northwest (e.g., \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are collinear in a northwest direction).
3. **West**: If the west component dominates (e.g., \(x\) is significantly west of \(y\), and \(y\) is slightly northwest of \(z\), leading to \(x\) being primarily west of \(z\)).

These possibilities arise because the northwest direction (45° between north and west) can decompose into varying north and west components. The composition table for cardinal directions (e.g., in qualitative spatial reasoning) confirms that:
\[
\text{Northwest} \circ \text{Northwest} = \{\text{North}, \text{Northwest}, \text{West}\}
\]

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:

- **North**
- **Northwest**
- **West**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest (NW)** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is located in the direction that is both north and west relative to \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **West (W)** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly west of \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vector Representation**:
   - Place \(z\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Since \(y\) is west of \(z\), \(y\) is at \((-1, 0)\).
   - Since \(x\) is northwest of \(y\), \(x\) is at a point \((-1 + a, b)\), where \(a < 0\) (westward from \(y\)) and \(b > 0\) (northward from \(y\)).

2. **Direction from \(z\) to \(x\)**:
   - The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((-1 + a, b)\), with \(a < 0\) and \(b > 0\).
   - Thus:
     - The \(x\)-component is negative (less than \(-1\)), indicating west.
     - The \(y\)-component is positive, indicating north.
   - The exact direction depends on the magnitude of \(a\) and \(b\):
     - If the angle of the vector \((-1 + a, b)\) falls within \([112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]\) (relative to east, counterclockwise), it is **Northwest**.
     - If the angle falls within \((157.5^\circ, 180^\circ]\), it is **West**.

3. **Feasibility**:
   - **Northwest Example**: If \(a = -1\) and \(b = 2.414\) (corresponding to angle \(112.5^\circ\) from \(y\)), the vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((-2, 2.414)\). The angle is \(\approx 129.8^\circ\), which is within \([112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]\), so **NW**.
   - **West Example**: If \(a = -0.1\) and \(b = 0.0414\) (corresponding to angle \(157.5^\circ\) from \(y\)), the vector is \((-1.1, 0.0414)\). The angle is \(\approx 177.8^\circ\), which is within \((157.5^\circ, 180^\circ]\), so **W**.

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northwest (NW)** and **West (W)**.

**Final Answer: Northwest, West**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is Northwest of region y: x is north and west of y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z: y is south and west of z.

The relative positions can be analyzed as follows:

1. **West-East Component**:
   - x is west of y (from x Northwest of y).
   - y is west of z (from y Southwest of z).
   - Therefore, x is west of z (transitivity in the west direction).

2. **North-South Component**:
   - x is north of y (from x Northwest of y).
   - y is south of z (from y Southwest of z).
   - The north-south relation between x and z depends on the specific coordinates:
     - If x is north of z (y-coordinate of x > y-coordinate of z), then x is **Northwest** of z (west and north).
     - If x is south of z (y-coordinate of x < y-coordinate of z), then x is **Southwest** of z (west and south).
     - If x and z share the same latitude (y-coordinate of x = y-coordinate of z), then x is **West** of z (only west, no north/south component).

Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northwest** (if x is north of z),
- **Southwest** (if x is south of z),
- **West** (if x and z are at the same latitude).

No other cardinal directions (e.g., North, South, East, Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, or Bounding Box) are possible due to the definite west component and variable north-south alignment.

**Answer: Northwest, Southwest, West**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is entirely above and to the left of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Bounding Box** of region \(z\). This means \(y\) completely surrounds \(z\), so \(z\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\).

Given that \(z\) is entirely inside \(y\), and \(x\) is to the northwest of \(y\), the entire region \(z\) must lie to the southeast of \(x\). Therefore, \(x\) must be **Northwest** of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., North, Northeast, etc.) or the Bounding Box relation are possible, as \(x\) is outside \(y\) (and thus outside \(z\)), and the directional constraint is consistent.

**Possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\):**  
Northwest
For r1:  West, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is West of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is North of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can vary due to the lack of constraints on the horizontal position of \(y\) relative to \(z\) and the vertical position of \(x\) relative to \(y\) and \(z\). All nine cardinal direction relations are possible, as demonstrated by specific configurations:

- **Northwest**: \(x\) is west and north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left and above \(z\)).
- **North**: \(x\) is north of \(z\) with horizontal overlap.
- **Northeast**: \(x\) is east and north of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) with vertical overlap.
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) overlaps with \(z\) horizontally and vertically.
- **East**: \(x\) is east of \(z\) with vertical overlap.
- **Southwest**: \(x\) is west and south of \(z\).
- **South**: \(x\) is south of \(z\) with horizontal overlap.
- **Southeast**: \(x\) is east and south of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations include all cardinal directions and the bounding box option.

**Answer**:  
North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  West, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the composition of these relations. Through geometric analysis:

- If \(x\) is directly west of \(y\) and \(y\) is northeast of \(z\), the position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) can vary depending on the specific distances involved.
- Possible relative positions of \(x\) to \(z\) include:
  - **North**: When \(x\) is primarily north of \(z\) with minimal horizontal offset.
  - **Northeast**: When \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) is slightly west of \(y\) but still in the northeast quadrant relative to \(z\)).
  - **Northwest**: When \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) is significantly west of \(y\), placing it in the northwest quadrant relative to \(z\)).
  - **West**: When \(x\) is directly west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) is far west of \(y\), aligning it west of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

**North, Northeast, Northwest, West**
For r1:  West, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast** of region \(z\).

The possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are determined by the composition of these directions. The displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) involves moving southeast to \(y\) and then west to \(x\), resulting in a net southward displacement and a variable east-west displacement:

- If the westward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) is less than the eastward component from \(z\) to \(y\), \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).
- If the westward movement equals the eastward component, \(x\) is directly south of \(z\).
- If the westward movement is greater than the eastward component but not excessively so, \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).
- If the westward movement is significantly larger, \(x\) is west of \(z\) (with a south component, but the direction is classified as **West** due to the dominance).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **Southeast**
- **South**
- **Southwest**
- **West**

**Final Answer: Southeast, South, Southwest, West**
For r1:  West, r2:  South, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given—region x is **West** of region y and region y is **South** of region z—the possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the composition of directions. The composition "West of y and y is South of z" results in three possible relations for x relative to z:

1. **Southwest**: If x is entirely south and west of z. For example, if y is directly south of z and x is directly west of y, then x would be southwest of z.
2. **West**: If x is horizontally aligned to the west of z, with vertical alignment such that x spans the same north-south range as z or overlaps partially without being entirely north or south. For instance, if y is south of z and slightly east, and x is west of y but vertically aligned with z, then x is west of z.
3. **Northwest**: If x is entirely north and west of z. For example, if y is south of z and east, and x is west of y but positioned north of z, then x would be northwest of z.

Thus, the possible relations are **Northwest**, **West**, and **Southwest**. 

**Answer: Northwest, West, Southwest**
For r1:  West, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is West of region y, meaning x is entirely to the west of y.
- Region y is East of region z, meaning y is entirely to the east of z, so z is west of y.

This implies that both x and z are west of y, but their relative positions to each other are not constrained. The possible relations between x and z can vary due to:
- **Horizontal displacement**: x could be west of z, east of z, or their minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) might overlap horizontally.
- **Vertical displacement**: No constraints are given, so x could be north, south, or at the same latitude as z, or their MBRs might overlap vertically.

Thus, all cardinal directions are possible depending on the vertical alignment:
- If x is west of z and north of z: **Northwest**
- If x is west of z and south of z: **Southwest**
- If x is east of z and north of z: **Northeast**
- If x is east of z and south of z: **Southeast**
- If x is directly north of z (same longitude): **North**
- If x is directly south of z (same longitude): **South**
- If x is directly west of z (same latitude): **West**
- If x is directly east of z (same latitude): **East**

Additionally, if the MBRs of x and z overlap either horizontally, vertically, or both, the relation is not a single cardinal direction but involves overlap, leading to the **Bounding Box** relation.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z include all eight cardinal directions and Bounding Box:
- **North**
- **Northeast**
- **Southeast**
- **South**
- **East**
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **Southwest**
- **Bounding Box**
For r1:  West, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly to the west of \(y\) (same latitude, leftward).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is both north and west of \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Relative Positions**:
   - Place \(z\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Since \(y\) is **Northwest** of \(z\), \(y\) is at \((-a, b)\) where \(a > 0\) (west displacement) and \(b > 0\) (north displacement). The ratio \(a/b\) must be in \([ \tan(22.5^\circ), \tan(67.5^\circ) ] \approx [0.414, 2.414]\) for the **Northwest** relation.
   - Since \(x\) is **West** of \(y\), \(x\) is at \((-a - c, b)\) where \(c > 0\) (additional west displacement from \(y\)).

2. **Vector from \(z\) to \(x\)**:
   - Displacement: \((-(a + c), b)\).
   - Bearing (angle from north, clockwise):  
     \[
     \theta = \text{atan2}(\Delta \text{east}, \Delta \text{north}) = \text{atan2}(-(a + c), b)
     \]
     Convert to degrees and adjust to \([0^\circ, 360^\circ)\):  
     \[
     \theta_{\text{deg}} = \left(360^\circ - \arctan\left(\frac{a + c}{b}\right) \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}\right) \mod 360^\circ.
     \]
   - The value of \(\theta_{\text{deg}}\) depends on \(\frac{a + c}{b}\):
     - As \(\frac{a + c}{b}\) increases, \(\theta_{\text{deg}}\) decreases from near \(337.5^\circ\) toward \(270^\circ\).

3. **Cardinal Direction Sectors**:
   - **Northwest**: \(292.5^\circ \leq \theta < 337.5^\circ\).
   - **West**: \(247.5^\circ \leq \theta < 292.5^\circ\) (since \(270^\circ\) is west, and the sector spans \(45^\circ\) on either side).
   - **North**: \(337.5^\circ \leq \theta \leq 360^\circ\) or \(0^\circ \leq \theta < 22.5^\circ\), but \(\theta\) here is always \(< 337.5^\circ\) (as \(c > 0\) ensures \(\frac{a + c}{b} > \frac{a}{b} \geq 0.414\), so \(\theta < 337.5^\circ\)).

4. **Possible \(\theta_{\text{deg}}\)**:
   - \(\frac{a + c}{b}\) ranges from just above \(0.414\) to infinity.
   - **Northwest**: When \(\frac{a + c}{b}\) is moderate (e.g., \(1\)), \(\theta \approx 315^\circ\) (within \(292.5^\circ\) to \(337.5^\circ\)).
     - Example: \(a = 1, b = 1, c = 0.5\) → \(\frac{1.5}{1} = 1.5\), \(\theta \approx 303.7^\circ\) (Northwest).
   - **West**: When \(\frac{a + c}{b}\) is large (e.g., \(> 2.414\)), \(\theta < 292.5^\circ\).
     - Example: \(a = 2.4, b = 1, c = 10\) → \(\frac{12.4}{1} = 12.4\), \(\theta \approx 274.7^\circ\) (West).
   - **North** is impossible because \(\theta\) cannot reach \(337.5^\circ\) or higher (as \(c > 0\) prevents \(\frac{a + c}{b}\) from being small enough).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northwest** and **West**. 

**Answer: Northwest, West**
For r1:  West, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations:  
- Region x is West of region y, meaning x is entirely to the left of y (x's maximum x-coordinate < y's minimum x-coordinate).  
- Region y is West of region z, meaning y is entirely to the left of z (y's maximum x-coordinate < z's minimum x-coordinate).  

This implies x is entirely to the left of z (x's maximum x-coordinate < z's minimum x-coordinate). The vertical relationship between x and z is unconstrained by the given West relations. Therefore, the possible vertical scenarios are:  

1. **West**: If the vertical projections of x and z overlap (x's y-interval overlaps with z's y-interval).  
2. **Northwest**: If x is entirely above z (x's minimum y-coordinate > z's maximum y-coordinate).  
3. **Southwest**: If x is entirely below z (x's maximum y-coordinate < z's minimum y-coordinate).  

No other relations are possible because the horizontal condition (x left of z) is fixed, and vertical variations only lead to these three cases.  

**Possible relations**: West, Northwest, Southwest.
For r1:  West, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\), meaning the direction from \(y\) to \(x\) falls within the angular range of \(157.5^\circ\) to \(202.5^\circ\) (using standard mathematical angles with \(0^\circ\) as East, increasing counterclockwise).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\), meaning the direction from \(z\) to \(y\) falls within \(202.5^\circ\) to \(247.5^\circ\).

The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is the sum of the vector from \(z\) to \(y\) and the vector from \(y\) to \(x\). The possible angles for the resultant vector from \(z\) to \(x\) are analyzed as follows:

- **Minimum angle case**:  
  - Vector \(z \to y\) at \(202.5^\circ\) (boundary) and vector \(y \to x\) at \(157.5^\circ\) (boundary) yields a resultant angle of \(180^\circ\) (West).
- **Maximum angle case**:  
  - Vector \(z \to y\) at \(247.5^\circ\) (boundary) and vector \(y \to x\) at \(202.5^\circ\) (boundary) yields a resultant angle of \(225^\circ\) (Southwest).
- **Intermediate cases**:  
  - Combinations (e.g., \(z \to y\) at \(247.5^\circ\) and \(y \to x\) at \(180^\circ\)) yield angles between \(180^\circ\) and \(225^\circ\).

The resultant angles range from \(180^\circ\) to \(225^\circ\), which corresponds to:
- **West** for angles in \([180^\circ, 202.5^\circ)\).
- **Southwest** for angles in \([202.5^\circ, 225^\circ]\) (since \(202.5^\circ\) is the start of the Southwest cone).

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **West** and **Southwest**. No other relations (e.g., South, Bounding Box) are possible given the angular constraints.

**Answer: West, Southwest**
For r1:  West, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- **x is West of y**: This means that the entire region x is to the west of y. Horizontally, the maximum x-coordinate of x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of y, and vertically, there are no constraints (so x could be above, below, or overlapping y vertically).
- **y is Bounding Box of z**: This means that y is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing z, so z lies entirely within y's boundaries.

### Analysis of x and z:
- **Horizontal relation**: Since x is west of y (x_max < y_min_x) and z is inside y (y_min_x ≤ z_min_x), it follows that x_max < z_min_x. Thus, x is entirely to the west of z horizontally.
- **Vertical relation**: The vertical position of z is constrained by y (y_min_y ≤ z_min_y and z_max_y ≤ y_max_y), but x's vertical position relative to y is unconstrained (as West does not specify vertical alignment). Therefore, x could be:
  - **Entirely above z** (x_min_y > z_max_y), leading to **Northwest**.
  - **Entirely below z** (x_max_y < z_min_y), leading to **Southwest**.
  - **Vertically overlapping or aligned with z** (not entirely above or below), leading to **West**.

### Possible relations between x and z:
- **West**: If x and z vertically overlap or align.
- **Northwest**: If x is entirely above z.
- **Southwest**: If x is entirely below z.

### Excluded relations:
- **Bounding Box**: Impossible because x is west of z (x cannot contain z).
- **East, Northeast, Southeast, South, North**: Contradicted by the horizontal west relation (x_max < z_min_x).

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between region x and region z are **West**, **Northwest**, and **Southwest**.
For r1:  Southwest, r2: North, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is Southwest of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is south and west of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\), meaning \(z\) is south of \(y\).

Considering the positions relative to \(y\):
- \(x\) is southwest of \(y\): below and to the left of \(y\).
- \(z\) is south of \(y\): below \(y\), and horizontally aligned within the east-west bounds of \(y\) (since "North" implies no east-west deviation).

To determine the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **Horizontal relation**: \(x\) is west of \(y\), and \(z\) is within the east-west bounds of \(y\). Thus, \(x\) is west of \(z\), meaning \(z\) is east of \(x\).
- **Vertical relation**: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are south of \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other can vary:
  - If \(z\) is entirely above \(x\) (north of \(x\)), the relation is **Northeast** (east and north).
  - If \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (south of \(x\)), the relation is **Southeast** (east and south).
  - If \(z\) is within the same vertical band as \(x\) (neither entirely above nor below), the relation is **East** (directly east).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northeast**, **East**, and **Southeast**.

**Answer**: Northeast, East, Southeast
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations—region \(x\) is Southwest of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is Northeast of region \(z\)—the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary in both the horizontal (east-west) and vertical (north-south) axes. This independence allows for any combination of directional relationships between \(x\) and \(z\), including cases where they overlap or align. Specifically:

- **Horizontal possibilities**: 
  - \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) (leading to West, Southwest, or Northwest).
  - \(z\) is entirely west of \(x\) (leading to East, Southeast, or Northeast).
  - Overlap or alignment in the east-west direction (leading to North, South, or Bounding Box).
  
- **Vertical possibilities**:
  - \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (leading to South, Southeast, or Southwest).
  - \(z\) is entirely south of \(x\) (leading to North, Northeast, or Northwest).
  - Overlap or alignment in the north-south direction (leading to East, West, or Bounding Box).

Combining these, all nine cardinal direction relations and the Bounding Box are possible. Examples can be constructed for each case, confirming no restrictions arise from the given relations. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **North**
- **Northeast**
- **East**
- **Southeast**
- **South**
- **Southwest**
- **West**
- **Northwest**
- **Bounding Box**
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Southwest** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the west and south of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely to the east and south of \(z\).

From these:
- \(x\) is south of \(y\), and \(y\) is south of \(z\), so \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\)).
- For the east-west relation:
  - \(x\) is west of \(y\), so the maximum x-coordinate of \(x\) is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of \(y\).
  - \(y\) is east of \(z\), so the minimum x-coordinate of \(y\) is greater than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of \(z\).

The relative east-west positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
- If the entire \(x\) is to the **west** of \(z\) (i.e., the maximum x-coordinate of \(x\) is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of \(z\)), then \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
- If the entire \(x\) is to the **east** of \(z\) (i.e., the minimum x-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of \(z\)), then \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) overlaps \(z\) in the east-west direction (i.e., \(x\) lies entirely between the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of \(z\)), then \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Southwest**, **South**, and **Southeast**.

**Answer:** Southwest, South, Southeast
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  South, answer: Given that region x is Southwest of region y and region y is South of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z depend on the spatial extent and alignment of the regions, considering bounding boxes. The relations can be:

- **South**: This occurs when there is east-west overlap between the bounding boxes of x and z, meaning x is directly south of z with no significant east-west deviation.
- **Southwest**: This occurs when there is no east-west overlap between the bounding boxes of x and z, meaning x is both south and west of z.

The relations North, Northeast, Southeast, East, Northwest, West, and Bounding Box are not possible, as the given constraints (x Southwest of y and y South of z) ensure that x cannot be north, east, or in other diagonal directions relative to z. The "Bounding Box" option is not applicable here, as specific directional relations (South or Southwest) are determined based on the alignment.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are **South** and **Southwest**.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is **Southwest** of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **Southwest of \(y\)** implies \(x\) is west and south of \(y\):  
  - \(x\) has a smaller maximum x-coordinate than \(y\)'s minimum x-coordinate.  
  - \(x\) has a smaller maximum y-coordinate than \(y\)'s minimum y-coordinate.  
- **East of \(z\)** implies \(y\) is east of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box:  
  - \(y\) has a larger minimum x-coordinate than \(z\)'s maximum x-coordinate.  
  - \(y\)'s y-coordinate range is within \(z\)'s y-coordinate range.  

Considering these constraints, the relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary based on the relative positions:  

1. **West**: If \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\)'s maximum x-coordinate is less than \(z\)'s minimum x-coordinate) and vertically within \(z\)'s y-range.  
   - Example: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [0.5,0.5]\), \(x\) at \([-1,-0.5] \times [0.2,0.3]\).  

2. **East**: If \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\)'s minimum x-coordinate is greater than \(z\)'s maximum x-coordinate) and vertically within \(z\)'s y-range.  
   - Example: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [0.5,0.5]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,1.9] \times [0.2,0.3]\).  

3. **Southwest**: If \(x\) is entirely west and south of \(z\) (i.e., west and below \(z\)'s y-range).  
   - Example: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [0.5,0.5]\), \(x\) at \([-1,-0.5] \times [-2,-1]\).  

4. **South**: If \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\)'s maximum y-coordinate is less than \(z\)'s minimum y-coordinate) and horizontally within \(z\)'s x-range.  
   - Example: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [0.5,0.5]\), \(x\) at \([0.2,0.8] \times [-2,-1]\).  

5. **Southeast**: If \(x\) is entirely east and south of \(z\) (i.e., east and below \(z\)'s y-range).  
   - Example: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [0.5,0.5]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,1.9] \times [-2,-1]\).  

6. **Bounding Box**: If the bounding boxes of \(x\) and \(z\) overlap (e.g., horizontally, vertically, or both), indicating no single cardinal direction applies.  
   - Example: \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2,3] \times [0.5,0.5]\), \(x\) at \([0.5,1.5] \times [0.2,0.4]\) (overlap in x and y).  

Relations such as **North**, **Northeast**, and **Northwest** are impossible because \(x\) must be south of \(y\) (due to **Southwest**), and \(y\) is vertically within \(z\)'s range, so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\).  

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**East, West, Southwest, South, Southeast, Bounding Box**.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is **Southwest** of region y: This means x is south and west of y.
- Region y is **Northwest** of region z: This means y is north and west of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the relative positions:

1. **West Component**: 
   - y is west of z (from y being Northwest of z).
   - x is west of y (from x being Southwest of y).
   - Therefore, x must be west of z. This eliminates East, Northeast, Southeast, and South as possibilities.

2. **North-South Component**:
   - y is north of z (from y being Northwest of z).
   - x is south of y (from x being Southwest of y).
   - The net north-south position of x relative to z depends on the distances:
     - If the northward shift from z to y is greater than the southward shift from y to x, x could be **north** of z.
     - If the southward shift from y to x is greater, x could be **south** of z.
     - If the shifts balance, x could be at the same latitude as z (directly west).

Considering the west component and the possible north-south outcomes:

- If x is north of z and west of z, the relation is **Northwest**.
- If x is south of z and west of z, the relation is **Southwest**.
- If x is directly west of z (same latitude), the relation is **West**.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **Northwest**, **West**, and **Southwest**.

**Final Answer**: Northwest, West, Southwest
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Southwest** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is located in the direction approximately 225° from \(y\) (combining south and west components).
- Region \(y\) is **West** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly west of \(z\) (approximately 270° from \(z\)).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the vector composition:
- The displacement from \(z\) to \(y\) is purely westward.
- The displacement from \(y\) to \(x\) is southwestward (south and west components).
- The total displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) combines these: a westward shift from \(z\) to \(y\), followed by a southwestward shift from \(y\) to \(x\).

This results in \(x\) being located in a direction relative to \(z\) that can vary between **Southwest** and **West**, depending on the distances:
- If the southwestward leg from \(y\) to \(x\) is dominant, \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
- If the westward leg from \(z\) to \(y\) is dominant, \(x\) is **West** of \(z\).
- The bearing from \(z\) to \(x\) falls between 225° (Southwest) and 270° (West), and in the 8-direction cardinal system, this range is covered by the **Southwest** and **West** cones.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **Southwest** and **West**.

**Final Answer: Southwest, West**
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:
- Region \(x\) is Southwest of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is Southwest of region \(z\).

The Southwest relation implies that \(x\) is entirely to the south and west of \(y\), and \(y\) is entirely to the south and west of \(z\). By transitivity:
- \(x\) must be entirely to the south of \(z\) (since \(x\) is south of \(y\) and \(y\) is south of \(z\)).
- \(x\) must be entirely to the west of \(z\) (since \(x\) is west of \(y\) and \(y\) is west of \(z\)).

Therefore, \(x\) is both south and west of \(z\), which corresponds to the **Southwest** relation. No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., South, West, Southeast, etc.) or the Bounding Box relation is possible under this transitivity, as the conditions strictly satisfy Southwest.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is:
**Southwest**
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Given the relations:
- Region x is **Southwest** of region y: This means x is entirely to the south and west of y. Specifically, the entire region x lies below the southern boundary and to the left of the western boundary of y.
- Region y is the **Bounding Box** of region z: This means y is the minimum bounding rectangle that contains z, so z is entirely within y.

Since z is entirely within y, the boundaries of z are constrained by y's boundaries. Therefore:
- The western boundary of z is at or to the east of the western boundary of y (so the western boundary of z cannot be west of y's).
- The southern boundary of z is at or to the north of the southern boundary of y (so the southern boundary of z cannot be south of y's).

Because x is southwest of y:
- x lies entirely to the west of y's western boundary → thus, x is entirely to the west of z (since z is within y, its western boundary is not west of y's).
- x lies entirely to the south of y's southern boundary → thus, x is entirely to the south of z (since z is within y, its southern boundary is not south of y's).

Therefore, x must be entirely to the south and west of z, which corresponds to the **Southwest** relation between x and z.

No other cardinal direction relations or bounding box relation are possible, as:
- x cannot be north, east, or any other direction because it is strictly southwest.
- x cannot be the bounding box of z because x is disjoint from and outside z (since x is southwest of y and z is inside y).

Thus, the only possible relation is **Southwest**.

**Answer: Southwest**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region **x** is the **Bounding Box** of region **y**. This means **x** is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing **y**, so the northern, southern, eastern, and western boundaries of **x** exactly match the extents of **y**.
- Region **y** is **North** of region **z**. This implies:
  - The entire region **z** is below the southern boundary of **y** (i.e., **z** is entirely south of **y**).
  - The projections of **y** and **z** on the east-west axis overlap (a requirement for the **North** relation).

Since **x** has the same boundaries as **y**:
- The southern boundary of **x** is identical to the southern boundary of **y**.
- Therefore, **z** is entirely below the southern boundary of **x**.
- The east-west projections of **x** and **z** overlap (because **x** and **y** share the same east-west projection, and **y** and **z** have overlapping east-west projections by the **North** relation).

This configuration means **x** is **North** of **z**. The entire region **z** is south of **x**, and their east-west projections overlap, satisfying the definition of **North**. No other cardinal direction (e.g., **Northeast** or **Northwest**) is possible because **x** and **z** share the same east-west alignment as **y** and **z**, and there is no east-west offset.

**Possible relation between x and z: North**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is the **Bounding Box** of region y. This means x is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that completely encloses y, sharing the same northern, southern, eastern, and western boundaries as y.
- Region y is **Northeast** of region z. This means:
  - The entire region y is north of the northernmost point of z (i.e., the southern boundary of y is north of the northern boundary of z).
  - The entire region y is east of the easternmost point of z (i.e., the western boundary of y is east of the eastern boundary of z).

Since x is the bounding box of y, its boundaries are determined by the extreme points of y:
- Northern boundary of x = northern boundary of y.
- Southern boundary of x = southern boundary of y.
- Eastern boundary of x = eastern boundary of y.
- Western boundary of x = western boundary of y.

Given that y is northeast of z:
- The southern boundary of y (and thus x) is north of the northern boundary of z, so all points in x are north of the northernmost point of z.
- The western boundary of y (and thus x) is east of the eastern boundary of z, so all points in x are east of the easternmost point of z.

Therefore, region x is entirely **Northeast** of region z. No other cardinal direction relation is possible, as x cannot extend south or west beyond y's boundaries (which are strictly northeast of z).

**Possible relation: Northeast**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that contains \(y\). Therefore, the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of \(x\) is identical to the MBR of \(y\) (i.e., \(x\) and \(y\) share the same spatial extent in terms of their MBR).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast** of region \(z\). This implies:
  - The entire MBR of \(y\) is to the east of \(z\): the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\) (west edge) is greater than or equal to the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\) (east edge).
  - The entire MBR of \(y\) is to the south of \(z\): the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\) (north edge) is less than or equal to the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\) (south edge), assuming a coordinate system where \(y\) increases northward.

Since the MBR of \(x\) is the same as that of \(y\), the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) directly inherits the **Southeast** relation from \(y\) and \(z\):
- \(x\) is entirely to the east and south of \(z\), satisfying the conditions for **Southeast**.

No other cardinal direction relations are possible because:
- **East**, **South**, or **Southeast** would require partial or full alignment that conflicts with the strict east and south positioning (e.g., **East** alone would not account for the south requirement, and **South** alone would not account for the east requirement).
- Directions like **Northeast**, **North**, **Northwest**, **West**, **Southwest** imply positions that contradict the southeast placement.
- **Bounding Box** is not applicable between \(x\) and \(z\) because \(x\) is not the minimal containing rectangle of \(z\) (they are disjoint and spatially separated).

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **Southeast**.

**Answer: Southeast**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  South, answer: Given that region x is the Bounding Box of region y and region y is South of region z, we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- **Bounding Box of y (x)**: Region x is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle enclosing y. Thus, x has the same horizontal extent (east-west) and vertical extent (north-south) as y. The northern boundary of x equals the northernmost point of y, and the southern boundary of x equals the southernmost point of y.
- **y is South of z**: Region y is entirely below z. This means the entire region y lies south of the southernmost point of z. Specifically, the northern boundary of y (and thus of x) is below the southern boundary of z. Therefore, region x is entirely below z vertically.

The horizontal relation between x and z depends on the horizontal alignment of y and z, which is not constrained by the "South" relation:
- If y (and thus x) is entirely to the **west** of z, then x is **Southwest** of z.
- If y (and thus x) is entirely to the **east** of z, then x is **Southeast** of z.
- If y (and thus x) horizontally **overlaps** with z (i.e., their projections on the east-west axis overlap), then x is **South** of z.

No other cardinal directions are possible because x must be entirely south of z in all cases, and the horizontal relation can only be west, east, or overlap, leading exclusively to Southwest, Southeast, or South.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: **South, Southwest, Southeast**.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  East, answer: Given that region x is the Bounding Box of region y, and region y is East of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is East. Here's the reasoning:

- **Bounding Box (x of y)**: x is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that fully contains y. Thus, the western boundary of x is the same as the western boundary of y, and the eastern boundary of x is the same as the eastern boundary of y. Similarly, the northern and southern boundaries of x match the extremes of y in the north-south direction.
- **East (y of z)**: y is entirely to the east of z, meaning the minimum x-coordinate of y is greater than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of z. Additionally, for the relation to be strictly "East" (and not Northeast or Southeast), the vertical projections of y and z on the north-south axis must overlap. This overlap means that the range of y-coordinates of y intersects with the range of y-coordinates of z.

Since x has the same boundaries as y:
- The minimum x-coordinate of x (which equals that of y) is greater than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of z, so x is entirely to the east of z.
- The vertical projection of x (same as y) overlaps with that of z, ensuring that the relation is not Northeast or Southeast.

Therefore, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is **East**. Other relations like Northeast, Southeast, or Bounding Box do not apply because:
- **Northeast/Southeast**: Require x to be entirely north or entirely south of z, but the vertical overlap prevents this.
- **Bounding Box**: x is not the bounding box of z; z is outside x to the west.

Thus, the answer is **East**.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing \(y\), so \(x\) extends to the northernmost, southernmost, easternmost, and westernmost points of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\). This implies:
  - \(y\) is entirely north of \(z\): the southern boundary of \(y\) is north of the northern boundary of \(z\).
  - \(y\) is entirely west of \(z\): the eastern boundary of \(y\) is west of the western boundary of \(z\).

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- **North-South Direction**: Since \(y\) is entirely north of \(z\), the southernmost point of \(y\) (which is the southern boundary of \(x\)) is north of the northern boundary of \(z\). Thus, the entire \(x\) lies north of \(z\).
- **East-West Direction**: Since \(y\) is entirely west of \(z\), the easternmost point of \(y\) (which is the eastern boundary of \(x\)) is west of the western boundary of \(z\). Thus, the entire \(x\) lies west of \(z\).

Combining these, \(x\) must be entirely **northwest** of \(z\). There are no other possible relations because:
- The bounding box \(x\) does not extend beyond the extremes of \(y\), so it cannot overlap or cover \(z\) in any other direction.
- The constraints from \(y\) being northwest of \(z\) ensure \(x\) is strictly northwest.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is:
**Northwest**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that completely contains \(y\), so the spatial extent of \(x\) matches the extremes of \(y\) in both horizontal (east-west) and vertical (north-south) directions.
- Region \(y\) is **West** of region \(z\). This implies:
  - The entire region \(y\) lies to the west of \(z\) (i.e., the easternmost point of \(y\) is west of the westernmost point of \(z\)).
  - There is vertical overlap between \(y\) and \(z\) (i.e., their projections on the north-south axis overlap).

### Analysis of \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Horizontal Relationship**:
   - Since \(y\) is contained within \(x\), the eastern boundary of \(x\) is the same as the eastern boundary of \(y\).
   - Because \(y\) is west of \(z\), the eastern boundary of \(y\) (and thus \(x\)) is west of the western boundary of \(z\).
   - Therefore, every point in \(x\) lies to the west of every point in \(z\), satisfying the horizontal condition for \(x\) being west of \(z\).

2. **Vertical Relationship**:
   - The vertical extent of \(x\) is identical to that of \(y\) (since \(x\) is the bounding box of \(y\)).
   - The vertical overlap between \(y\) and \(z\) (required for \(y\) west of \(z\)) means the vertical extents of \(x\) and \(z\) also overlap.
   - Thus, the vertical overlap condition for \(x\) being west of \(z\) is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
- The relation \(x\) **West** of \(z\) holds based on the given conditions. No other cardinal direction (e.g., Northwest, Southwest) is possible because:
  - **Northwest/Southwest** would require \(x\) to be entirely north/south of \(z\), which would break the vertical overlap condition (necessary for the original \(y\) west of \(z\) relation).
  - **North/South/East** are inconsistent with the horizontal positioning (since \(x\) is west of \(z\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **West**.

**Answer: West**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that contains \(y\). Thus, \(x\) surrounds \(y\) in all directions, with boundaries defined by the extent of \(y\): \(x\) extends at least as far west, east, south, and north as \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely to the south and west of \(z\). Specifically:
  - The entire \(y\) lies west of \(z\): the easternmost point of \(y\) is west of the westernmost point of \(z\).
  - The entire \(y\) lies south of \(z\): the northernmost point of \(y\) is south of the southernmost point of \(z\).

Now, consider the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Since \(x\) is the bounding box of \(y\), its boundaries are determined by \(y\):
  - Western boundary of \(x\) \(\leq\) western boundary of \(y\).
  - Eastern boundary of \(x\) \(\geq\) eastern boundary of \(y\).
  - Southern boundary of \(x\) \(\leq\) southern boundary of \(y\).
  - Northern boundary of \(x\) \(\geq\) northern boundary of \(y\).
- Given \(y\) is southwest of \(z\):
  - Eastern boundary of \(y\) \(<\) western boundary of \(z\).
  - Northern boundary of \(y\) \(<\) southern boundary of \(z\).
- Combining these:
  - Eastern boundary of \(x\) \(\geq\) eastern boundary of \(y\) \(<\) western boundary of \(z\). Thus, the entire \(x\) lies west of \(z\).
  - Northern boundary of \(x\) \(\geq\) northern boundary of \(y\) \(<\) southern boundary of \(z\). Thus, the entire \(x\) lies south of \(z\).

Therefore, region \(x\) is entirely to the south and west of region \(z\), which corresponds to the **Southwest** relation. No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., South, West, or combinations like Southeast) are possible, as \(x\) does not extend east or north enough to alter this. The **Bounding Box** relation does not apply, as \(x\) does not contain \(z\) (since \(z\) is northeast of \(y\) and thus outside \(x\)).

**Possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\): Southwest**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given conditions:
- Region x is the Bounding Box of region y, meaning x is the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of y, so y is entirely contained within x.
- Region y is the Bounding Box of region z, meaning y is the MBR of z, so z is entirely contained within y.

Since y is the MBR of z and x is the MBR of y, it follows that x must be the MBR of z. This is because the MBR of y (which is x) is the same as the MBR of z when y is already the MBR of z. Thus:
- Region x is the Bounding Box of region z.

No other cardinal direction relations (North, Northeast, East, etc.) are necessarily applicable, as z is entirely contained within x, and no specific directional position (e.g., z being in the northern part of x) is implied or required by the conditions. The only definite relation is that x is the Bounding Box of z.

**Answer: Bounding Box**
