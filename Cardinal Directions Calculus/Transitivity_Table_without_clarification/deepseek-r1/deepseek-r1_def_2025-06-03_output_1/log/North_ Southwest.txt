PROMPT: Let North and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is North of region y, meaning x is directly north of y (same x-coordinate, higher y-coordinate if points are considered).
- Region y is Southwest of region z, meaning y is both south and west of z (lower x-coordinate and lower y-coordinate relative to z).

The possible relations between region x and region z depend on the relative positions:
- If x is only slightly north of y (so x's y-coordinate is still negative relative to z), then x is Southwest of z.
- If x is such that its y-coordinate is at the same level as z's origin (y-coordinate = 0 relative to z), then x is West of z.
- If x is far north of y (so x's y-coordinate is positive relative to z), then x is Northwest of z.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

These are the only possible cardinal direction relations, as other directions (e.g., North, South, East) are not feasible given the constraints.

**Final Answer:**  
Southwest, West, Northwest
