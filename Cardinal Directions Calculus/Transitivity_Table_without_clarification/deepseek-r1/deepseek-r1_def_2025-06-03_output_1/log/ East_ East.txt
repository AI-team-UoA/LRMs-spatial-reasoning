PROMPT: Let  East and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is East of region \(y\): \(x\) lies entirely to the east of \(y\) (i.e., the minimum x-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is East of region \(z\): \(y\) lies entirely to the east of \(z\) (i.e., the minimum x-coordinate of \(y\) is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of \(z\)).

This implies that \(x\) lies entirely to the east of \(z\) (since \(x\) is east of \(y\), which is east of \(z\)). However, the vertical (north-south) relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) is not constrained by the given relations. Therefore, the possible vertical alignments are:

1. **East**: If \(x\) and \(z\) have vertical overlap (i.e., their y-coordinate ranges intersect).  
   Example: \(x\) is directly east of \(z\) with some vertical overlap.

2. **Northeast**: If \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (i.e., the minimum y-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of \(z\)).  
   Example: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).

3. **Southeast**: If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\)).  
   Example: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).

No other cardinal directions are possible because \(x\) must be east of \(z\) horizontally, ruling out West, Northwest, Southwest, North, and South. The "Bounding Box" relation is not applicable here, as \(x\) is strictly east of \(z\) and not containing or contained vertically.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
East, Northeast, Southeast
