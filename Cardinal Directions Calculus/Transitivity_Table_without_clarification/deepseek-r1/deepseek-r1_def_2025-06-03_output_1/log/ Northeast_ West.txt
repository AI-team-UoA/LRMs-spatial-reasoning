PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely east and north of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **West** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely west of \(z\) (so \(z\) is east of \(y\)).

The relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the relative positions of their minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs). The constraints are:
- \(x\) starts east of \(y\)'s east edge: \(\text{min}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(y)\).
- \(x\) starts north of \(y\)'s north edge: \(\text{min}_y(x) > \text{max}_y(y)\).
- \(z\) starts east of \(y\)'s east edge: \(\text{min}_x(z) > \text{max}_x(y)\).

However, there are no constraints on:
- The relative \(x\)-positions between \(x\) and \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) could be west, east, or overlapping with \(z\) in \(x\)).
- The relative \(y\)-positions between \(x\) and \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) could be north, south, or overlapping with \(z\) in \(y\)).

Thus, all cardinal directions and bounding box are possible, as verified by examples:

- **Northwest**: \(x\) west and north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [0,15]\)).
- **North**: \(x\) overlapping in \(x\) and north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,5] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([4,6] \times [0,15]\)).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) east and north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6,7] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([3,5] \times [0,15]\)).
- **West**: \(x\) west and overlapping in \(y\) with \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [19,22]\)).
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) overlapping with \(z\) in both \(x\) and \(y\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,5] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([4,6] \times [25,35]\)).
- **East**: \(x\) east and overlapping in \(y\) with \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6,7] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([3,5] \times [25,35]\)).
- **Southwest**: \(x\) west and south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [31,40]\)).
- **South**: \(x\) overlapping in \(x\) and south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,5] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([4,6] \times [31,40]\)).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) east and south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6,7] \times [21,30]\), \(z\): \([3,5] \times [31,40]\)).

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are all: **North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**.
