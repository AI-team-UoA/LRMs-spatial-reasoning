PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is entirely above and to the left of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Bounding Box** of region \(z\). This means \(y\) completely surrounds \(z\), so \(z\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\).

Given that \(z\) is entirely inside \(y\), and \(x\) is to the northwest of \(y\), the entire region \(z\) must lie to the southeast of \(x\). Therefore, \(x\) must be **Northwest** of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., North, Northeast, etc.) or the Bounding Box relation are possible, as \(x\) is outside \(y\) (and thus outside \(z\)), and the directional constraint is consistent.

**Possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\):**  
Northwest
