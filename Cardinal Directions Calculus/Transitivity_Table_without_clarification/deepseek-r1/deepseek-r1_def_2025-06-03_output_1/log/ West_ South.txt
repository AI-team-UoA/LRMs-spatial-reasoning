PROMPT: Let  West and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given—region x is **West** of region y and region y is **South** of region z—the possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the composition of directions. The composition "West of y and y is South of z" results in three possible relations for x relative to z:

1. **Southwest**: If x is entirely south and west of z. For example, if y is directly south of z and x is directly west of y, then x would be southwest of z.
2. **West**: If x is horizontally aligned to the west of z, with vertical alignment such that x spans the same north-south range as z or overlaps partially without being entirely north or south. For instance, if y is south of z and slightly east, and x is west of y but vertically aligned with z, then x is west of z.
3. **Northwest**: If x is entirely north and west of z. For example, if y is south of z and east, and x is west of y but positioned north of z, then x would be northwest of z.

Thus, the possible relations are **Northwest**, **West**, and **Southwest**. 

**Answer: Northwest, West, Southwest**
