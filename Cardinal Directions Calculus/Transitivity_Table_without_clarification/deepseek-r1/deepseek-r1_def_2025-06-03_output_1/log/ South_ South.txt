PROMPT: Let  South and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is South of region \(y\): This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(y\)), and their horizontal projections (x-axis intervals) overlap.
- Region \(y\) is South of region \(z\): Similarly, \(y\) is entirely below \(z\), and their horizontal projections overlap.

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy:
1. **Vertical alignment**: Since \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is below \(z\), \(x\) is necessarily below \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\)).
2. **Horizontal alignment**: The horizontal projections of \(x\) and \(z\) may or may not overlap, depending on the positions:
   - **Overlap**: If the horizontal intervals of \(x\) and \(z\) overlap (i.e., they share some x-axis range), then \(x\) is directly **South** of \(z\).
   - **No overlap, \(x\) to the left of \(z\)**: If the entire horizontal interval of \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) (i.e., the maximum x-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum x-coordinate of \(z\)), then \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
   - **No overlap, \(x\) to the right of \(z\)**: If the entire horizontal interval of \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) (i.e., the minimum x-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of \(z\)), then \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **South** (if horizontal projections overlap),
- **Southwest** (if \(x\) is left of \(z\)),
- **Southeast** (if \(x\) is right of \(z\)).

No other cardinal directions are possible because \(x\) must be below \(z\), ruling out North, Northeast, Northwest, etc., and "Bounding Box" is not needed as the relations are specific cardinal directions.

**Answer: South, Southeast, Southwest**
