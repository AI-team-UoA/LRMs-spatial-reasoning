PROMPT: Let  East and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is East of region y, meaning x is directly east of y (same y-coordinate, x has higher x-coordinate).
- Region y is South of region z, meaning y is directly south of z (same x-coordinate, y has lower y-coordinate).

The composition of these relations results in region x being Southeast of region z. This is because:
- From z, moving south to y and then east to x places x in the southeast quadrant relative to z.
- The centroid of x relative to z has a positive x-displacement (east component) and a negative y-displacement (south component), confirming the southeast direction.

Given the pure cardinal directions specified (no mixed or approximate relations), the only possible relation between region x and region z is Southeast. Other relations like East, South, or Bounding Box are not possible due to the defined constraints.

**Possible relation: Southeast**
