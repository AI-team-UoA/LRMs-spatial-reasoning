PROMPT: Let  West and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:  
- Region x is West of region y, meaning x is entirely to the left of y (x's maximum x-coordinate < y's minimum x-coordinate).  
- Region y is West of region z, meaning y is entirely to the left of z (y's maximum x-coordinate < z's minimum x-coordinate).  

This implies x is entirely to the left of z (x's maximum x-coordinate < z's minimum x-coordinate). The vertical relationship between x and z is unconstrained by the given West relations. Therefore, the possible vertical scenarios are:  

1. **West**: If the vertical projections of x and z overlap (x's y-interval overlaps with z's y-interval).  
2. **Northwest**: If x is entirely above z (x's minimum y-coordinate > z's maximum y-coordinate).  
3. **Southwest**: If x is entirely below z (x's maximum y-coordinate < z's minimum y-coordinate).  

No other relations are possible because the horizontal condition (x left of z) is fixed, and vertical variations only lead to these three cases.  

**Possible relations**: West, Northwest, Southwest.
