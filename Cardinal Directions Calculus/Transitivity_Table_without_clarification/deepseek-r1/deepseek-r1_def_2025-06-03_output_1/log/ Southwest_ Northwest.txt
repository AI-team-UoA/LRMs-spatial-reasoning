PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is **Southwest** of region y: This means x is south and west of y.
- Region y is **Northwest** of region z: This means y is north and west of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the relative positions:

1. **West Component**: 
   - y is west of z (from y being Northwest of z).
   - x is west of y (from x being Southwest of y).
   - Therefore, x must be west of z. This eliminates East, Northeast, Southeast, and South as possibilities.

2. **North-South Component**:
   - y is north of z (from y being Northwest of z).
   - x is south of y (from x being Southwest of y).
   - The net north-south position of x relative to z depends on the distances:
     - If the northward shift from z to y is greater than the southward shift from y to x, x could be **north** of z.
     - If the southward shift from y to x is greater, x could be **south** of z.
     - If the shifts balance, x could be at the same latitude as z (directly west).

Considering the west component and the possible north-south outcomes:

- If x is north of z and west of z, the relation is **Northwest**.
- If x is south of z and west of z, the relation is **Southwest**.
- If x is directly west of z (same latitude), the relation is **West**.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **Northwest**, **West**, and **Southwest**.

**Final Answer**: Northwest, West, Southwest
