PROMPT: Let  South and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is South of region y, meaning x is directly south of y with the same x-range.
- Region y is West of region z, meaning y is directly west of z with the same y-range.

To determine the relation between x and z:
- Since y is west of z and shares the same y-range as z, y is positioned to the left of z at the same vertical level.
- Since x is south of y and shares the same x-range as y, x is positioned below y at the same horizontal level.
- Therefore, relative to z, x is both south and west, resulting in the Southwest relation.

This relation holds definitively under the standard cardinal direction model, where "South" and "West" are pure directions implying alignment in the respective ranges. No other relations (e.g., South, West, or Bounding Box) are possible given the constraints.

**Possible relation: Southwest**
