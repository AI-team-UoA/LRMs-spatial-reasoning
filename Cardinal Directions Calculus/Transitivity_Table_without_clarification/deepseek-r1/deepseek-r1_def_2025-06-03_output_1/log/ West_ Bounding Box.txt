PROMPT: Let  West and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- **x is West of y**: This means that the entire region x is to the west of y. Horizontally, the maximum x-coordinate of x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of y, and vertically, there are no constraints (so x could be above, below, or overlapping y vertically).
- **y is Bounding Box of z**: This means that y is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing z, so z lies entirely within y's boundaries.

### Analysis of x and z:
- **Horizontal relation**: Since x is west of y (x_max < y_min_x) and z is inside y (y_min_x ≤ z_min_x), it follows that x_max < z_min_x. Thus, x is entirely to the west of z horizontally.
- **Vertical relation**: The vertical position of z is constrained by y (y_min_y ≤ z_min_y and z_max_y ≤ y_max_y), but x's vertical position relative to y is unconstrained (as West does not specify vertical alignment). Therefore, x could be:
  - **Entirely above z** (x_min_y > z_max_y), leading to **Northwest**.
  - **Entirely below z** (x_max_y < z_min_y), leading to **Southwest**.
  - **Vertically overlapping or aligned with z** (not entirely above or below), leading to **West**.

### Possible relations between x and z:
- **West**: If x and z vertically overlap or align.
- **Northwest**: If x is entirely above z.
- **Southwest**: If x is entirely below z.

### Excluded relations:
- **Bounding Box**: Impossible because x is west of z (x cannot contain z).
- **East, Northeast, Southeast, South, North**: Contradicted by the horizontal west relation (x_max < z_min_x).

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between region x and region z are **West**, **Northwest**, and **Southwest**.
