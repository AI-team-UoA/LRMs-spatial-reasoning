PROMPT: Let  East and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **East** of region y: This means x is entirely to the east of y, so the left boundary of x is to the east of the right boundary of y.
- Region y is **Northeast** of region z: This means y is entirely north and east of z, so y is above the top boundary of z and to the east of the right boundary of z.

Considering the spatial constraints:
- **East-West**: Since x is east of y and y is east of z, x must be east of z. Specifically, the left boundary of x is to the east of the right boundary of z. Thus, x is **East** of z.
- **North-South**: The vertical position of x relative to z is not directly constrained. Therefore, x can be:
  - **Entirely north of z**: If the bottom boundary of x is at or above the top boundary of z, then x is both north and east of z, making the relation **Northeast**.
  - **Entirely south of z**: If the top boundary of x is at or below the bottom boundary of z, then x is both south and east of z, making the relation **Southeast**.
  - **Vertically overlapping or adjacent to z**: If x overlaps with z vertically or is exactly adjacent (e.g., top of z equals bottom of x), then x is only **East** of z (since it is east but not entirely north or south).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **East** (if vertically overlapping or adjacent)
- **Northeast** (if entirely north)
- **Southeast** (if entirely south)

Other relations (e.g., North, South, West, Northwest, Southwest) are not possible because x must be east of z, and the vertical positioning only allows the above cases. Bounding Box is not a cardinal direction relation and does not apply.

**Answer: East, Northeast, Southeast**
