PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\):  
  This means \(x\) is **west** and **north** of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\):  
  This means \(y\) is **east** and **north** of \(z\).

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Vertical (north-south) component**:  
   - \(y\) is north of \(z\) (from \(y\) Northeast of \(z\)).  
   - \(x\) is north of \(y\) (from \(x\) Northwest of \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(x\) must be **north** of \(z\) (transitivity of north).  

2. **Horizontal (east-west) component**:  
   - \(x\) is west of \(y\) (from \(x\) Northwest of \(y\)).  
   - \(y\) is east of \(z\) (from \(y\) Northeast of \(z\)).  
   The horizontal position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) can vary:  
     - If \(x\) is **west** of \(z\): then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).  
     - If \(x\) has the **same east-west position** as \(z\): then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).  
     - If \(x\) is **east** of \(z\): then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).  

### Possible relations:
- **Northwest** of \(z\): when \(x\) is west of \(z\).  
- **North** of \(z\): when \(x\) aligns horizontally with \(z\).  
- **Northeast** of \(z\): when \(x\) is east of \(z\).  

These cover all feasible cases based on the constraints. Other cardinal directions (e.g., South, Southwest) are impossible due to the north transitivity.  

**Answer: Northwest, North, Northeast**
