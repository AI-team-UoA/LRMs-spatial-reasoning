PROMPT: Let  East and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations—region x is East of region y, and region y is North of region z—the possible relation between region x and region z is Northeast.

This is derived from the composition of the relations:  
- x being East of y implies that x is to the east relative to y.  
- y being North of z implies that y is to the north relative to z.  
Combining these, x is positioned to the northeast of z, as it inherits the eastern component from its relation with y and the northern component from y's relation with z.

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., Southeast, South, etc.) are possible under these constraints, as they would conflict with the given relations. For instance:  
- x cannot be South of z because y is North of z, and x is related to y with no southern component implied.  
- Similarly, other directions like West or Southwest are inconsistent with the East relation between x and y.

Thus, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is **Northeast**.
