PROMPT: Let  West and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- Region x is West of region y: x is to the left of y.
- Region y is South of region z: y is below z.

The relative position of x with respect to z can be determined as follows:
- From z, moving to y is directly South.
- From y, moving to x is directly West.

Thus, the vector from z to x combines South and West components. The possible directions depend on the exact positions:
- If x is directly South of z (minimal West component), the relation is **South**.
- If x is directly West of z (minimal South component), the relation is **West**.
- In all other cases (non-zero South and West components), the relation is **Southwest**.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **South**
- **Southwest**
- **West**

These cover all scenarios based on the composition of the given cardinal directions.
