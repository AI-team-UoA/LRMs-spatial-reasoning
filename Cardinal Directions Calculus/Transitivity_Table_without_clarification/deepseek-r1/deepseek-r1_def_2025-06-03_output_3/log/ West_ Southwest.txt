PROMPT: Let  West and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is to the west of \(y\) (primarily horizontal, with no significant north/south deviation).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is to the southwest of \(z\) (south and west of \(z\)).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Since \(y\) is southwest of \(z\), \(z\) is northeast of \(y\).
- \(x\) is west of \(y\), so \(x\) is west relative to \(y\)'s position.
- Combining these:
  - The vector from \(z\) to \(y\) is southwest (south and west components).
  - The vector from \(y\) to \(x\) is west (additional west component, no north/south change).
- The total displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) has:
  - A south component (from \(z\) to \(y\)).
  - A west component (sum of west from \(z\) to \(y\) and west from \(y\) to \(x\)).

This results in \(x\) being located southwest or west of \(z\), depending on the magnitudes:
- **Southwest**: If the south component is significant relative to the west component, placing \(x\) in the southwest sector relative to \(z\) (bearing between 202.5° and 247.5°).
- **West**: If the west component dominates (e.g., large westward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) compared to the southward movement from \(z\) to \(y\)), the bearing may fall into the west sector (247.5° to 292.5°), even though there is a south component. Specifically, when the west component is sufficiently large, the direction is classified as **West** in the 8-direction system.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Southwest** and **West**. The relation **South** is not possible because there is always a west component, and **Bounding Box** is not required as the relations are specific.

**Possible relations:**
- Southwest
- West
