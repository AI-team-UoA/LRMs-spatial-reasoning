PROMPT: Let North and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly north of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is West of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly west of \(z\).

To determine the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Position \(z\) as a reference point. Since \(y\) is west of \(z\), \(y\) is located to the left (west) of \(z\).
- Since \(x\) is north of \(y\), \(x\) is located above (north) of \(y\).
- Combining these, from \(z\), \(x\) is both northwest relative to \(z\) because:
  - Moving from \(z\) to \(y\) is directly west.
  - Moving from \(y\) to \(x\) is directly north.
  - The net direction from \(z\) to \(x\) is northwest.

Thus, the relation of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is **Northwest**.  
This is the only possible relation given the strict cardinal directions and the composition, as no other direction (e.g., North, West) fits the combined displacement.

The possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **Northwest**.  

**Answer: Northwest**
