PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **Southwest** of region y: x is south and west of y.
- Region y is **Southeast** of region z: y is south and east of z.

Considering the positions:

- **South component**:  
  - y is south of z, and x is south of y. Thus, x is south of z (further south).

- **East-West component**:  
  - y is east of z.  
  - x is west of y.  
  The relative position of x to z in the east-west direction depends on the distances:  
  - If the westward shift from y to x is **greater** than the eastward shift from z to y, x ends up **west** of z.  
  - If the westward shift from y to x is **less**, x remains **east** of z.  
  - If the shifts are **equal**, x is directly south of z (same longitude).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:

- **Southwest** (if x is west and south of z).  
- **Southeast** (if x is east and south of z).  
- **South** (if x is directly south of z).  

No other cardinal relations are possible, as x must be south of z in all cases.

**Possible relations: South, Southeast, Southwest**
