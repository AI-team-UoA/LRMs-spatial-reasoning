PROMPT: Let  West and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is West of region y and region y is West of region z, the possible relations between x and z are derived from the constraints:

- **x is West of y**: The entire x is to the left of y (x's right boundary < y's left boundary), and their y-projections overlap (positive length).
- **y is West of z**: The entire y is to the left of z (y's right boundary < z's left boundary), and their y-projections overlap.

Thus, x is to the left of z (x's right boundary < z's left boundary). The relation between x and z depends on their y-projections:

1. **West**: If the y-projections of x and z overlap (positive length), then x is directly West of z.
2. **Northwest**: If the entire x is above z (x's bottom y-coordinate > z's top y-coordinate), then x is Northwest of z.
3. **Southwest**: If the entire x is below z (x's top y-coordinate < z's bottom y-coordinate), then x is Southwest of z.

No other cardinal relations are possible because x is always to the left of z, and the y-positions determine the vertical component (overlap for West, above for Northwest, below for Southwest). The "Bounding Box" relation does not apply as it implies non-directional containment, which conflicts with the left alignment.

Thus, the possible relations are: **West, Northwest, Southwest**.
