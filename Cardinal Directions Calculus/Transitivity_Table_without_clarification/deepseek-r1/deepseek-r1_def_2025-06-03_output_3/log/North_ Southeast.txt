PROMPT: Let North and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region x is North of region y: x is entirely above y (vertical separation with x above).
- Region y is Southeast of region z: y is entirely to the southeast of z, meaning z is northwest of y. Thus, z is entirely above and to the west of y.

Combining these:
- x is above y.
- z is above and to the west of y.

Therefore, relative to z:
- x must be entirely to the east of z because:
  - y is southeast of z, so y is east of z.
  - x is north of y but can extend horizontally; however, since y is entirely east of z, any horizontal position of x relative to y (whether overlapping, west of y, or east of y) will still place x entirely east of z. Specifically:
    - If x overlaps or is east of y, it remains east of z.
    - If x is west of y, note that y is east of z (so z is west of y), and the western boundary of y is east of the eastern boundary of z. Thus, even if x extends west of y, it is still east of z's eastern boundary.

Vertically, the relation between x and z can vary:
1. **x is above z**: If the bottom of x is above the top of z, then x is northeast of z.
2. **x is below z**: If the top of x is below the bottom of z, then x is southeast of z.
3. **Vertical overlap**: If x and z overlap vertically (neither entirely above nor below), but x is entirely east of z, then x is east of z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northeast** (if x is above and east of z),
- **East** (if vertically overlapping but x is east of z),
- **Southeast** (if x is below and east of z).

Other directions (like North, South, West, etc.) are not possible because:
- x cannot be north or south of z without the east component (which is fixed).
- x is always east of z, so west or northwest/southwest are impossible.
- Bounding Box is not a cardinal relation and not applicable.

**Answer: Northeast, East, Southeast**
