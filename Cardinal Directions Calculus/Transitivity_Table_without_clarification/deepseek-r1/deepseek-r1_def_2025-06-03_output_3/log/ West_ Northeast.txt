PROMPT: Let  West and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the composition of cardinal direction relations in the Double Cross model:

- Given: Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\).
- The composition of **West** and **Northeast** yields the following possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
  - **North** (if \(x\) is directly above \(z\))
  - **Northeast** (if \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\))
  - **Northwest** (if \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\))
  - **West** (if \(x\) is directly to the left of \(z\))
  - **Southwest** (if \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\), within constraints)
  - **Bounding Box** (if \(x\) and \(z\) share overlapping boundaries or are not separable into a single cardinal direction)

The relations **South**, **Southeast**, and **East** are not possible because:
- \(y\) is **Northeast** of \(z\), placing \(y\) above \(z\).
- \(x\) is **West** of \(y\), which requires \(x\) to be within the vertical range of \(y\) (aligned vertically or above/below but constrained by \(y\)'s position). Since \(y\) is above \(z\), \(x\) cannot be below \(z\) (ruling out **South** and **Southeast**), and **East** is excluded as \(x\) is left of \(y\) and cannot be purely east of \(z\) without vertical alignment issues.

**Possible relations: North, Northeast, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box**
