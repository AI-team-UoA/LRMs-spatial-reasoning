PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations—region x is **Northwest** of region y and region y is **South** of region z—the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived as follows:

- **Northwest** of y implies x is entirely west and north of y:  
  - x is west of y: the right edge of x is left of the left edge of y.  
  - x is north of y: the bottom edge of x is above the top edge of y.  
- **South** of z implies y is entirely south of z:  
  - y is south of z: the top edge of y is below the bottom edge of z.  
  - Horizontal overlap exists between y and z.  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical relations between x and z**:  
  - The bottom edge of x is above the top edge of y, and the top edge of y is below the bottom edge of z.  
  - Thus, x could be:  
    - Entirely above z (if the bottom edge of x is above the top edge of z) → **North**.  
    - Entirely below z (if the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z) → **South**.  
    - Vertically overlapping otherwise.  
- **Horizontal relations between x and z**:  
  - x is west of y, and y horizontally overlaps with z.  
  - Thus, x could be:  
    - Entirely west of z (if the right edge of x is left of the left edge of z) → **West**.  
    - Horizontally overlapping otherwise.  

Considering combinations:  
1. **Northwest**: If x is entirely west of z and entirely above z.  
2. **Southwest**: If x is entirely west of z and entirely below z.  
3. **North**: If x horizontally overlaps with z and is entirely above z.  
4. **South**: If x horizontally overlaps with z and is entirely below z.  
5. **West**: If x is entirely west of z and vertically overlaps with z.  
6. **Bounding Box**: If x horizontally and vertically overlaps with z such that x is inside the minimum bounding rectangle of z.  

The relations **Northeast**, **Southeast**, and **East** are impossible because x is always west of y (and thus cannot be east of z).  

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**North, South, West, Northwest, Southwest, Bounding Box**.
