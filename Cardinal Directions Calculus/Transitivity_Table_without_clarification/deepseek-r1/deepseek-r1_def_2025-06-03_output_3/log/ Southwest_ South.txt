PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is Southwest of region y and region y is South of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the composition of the directions. The vector from z to x results in a direction that can vary based on the relative distances, but it will always fall within the southwest quadrant relative to z. Specifically, x can be:

- **South** of z if the westward component is negligible compared to the southward component.
- **Southwest** of z if the westward and southward components are comparable.
- **West** of z if the southward component is negligible compared to the westward component.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and West.

**Final Answer:**  
South, Southwest, West
