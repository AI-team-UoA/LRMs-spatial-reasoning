PROMPT: Let  South and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly south or within the southern sector (180° ± 22.5°) from \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is in the northwestern sector (315° ± 22.5°) from \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the composition of directions:
- The vector from \(z\) to \(y\) (Northwest) combined with the vector from \(y\) to \(x\) (South) results in a net direction from \(z\) to \(x\).
- The possible bearings from \(z\) to \(x\) fall within the range of approximately 225° to 270° (using navigation bearings where 0° is North, clockwise).

This range covers two cardinal sectors:
- **Southwest** (202.5° to 247.5°)
- **West** (247.5° to 292.5°)

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **Southwest** and **West**.

**Answer: Southwest, West**
