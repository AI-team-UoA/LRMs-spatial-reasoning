PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations—region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\)—the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints:

- **Northwest\((x, y)\)** implies:
  - \(x\) is entirely west of \(y\): the right edge of \(x\) is left of the left edge of \(y\) (\(x_{\text{max}_x} < y_{\text{min}_x}\)).
  - \(x\) is entirely north of \(y\): the bottom edge of \(x\) is above the top edge of \(y\) (\(x_{\text{min}_y} > y_{\text{max}_y}\)).
  
- **East\((y, z)\)** implies:
  - \(y\) is entirely east of \(z\): the left edge of \(y\) is right of the right edge of \(z\) (\(y_{\text{min}_x} > z_{\text{max}_x}\)).
  - Vertical overlap between \(y\) and \(z\): their \(y\)-axis projections overlap (i.e., \(\max(y_{\text{min}_y}, z_{\text{min}_y}) \leq \min(y_{\text{max}_y}, z_{\text{max}_y})\)).

Combining these, the horizontal and vertical relationships between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:

### Horizontal possibilities:
1. **West**: \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) (\(x_{\text{max}_x} < z_{\text{min}_x}\)).
2. **East**: \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) (\(x_{\text{min}_x} > z_{\text{max}_x}\)).
3. **Overlap**: Neither entirely west nor east (horizontal overlap).

### Vertical possibilities:
- Due to \(x_{\text{min}_y} > y_{\text{max}_y}\) and the vertical overlap between \(y\) and \(z\), two cases arise:
  1. **North**: \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) (\(x_{\text{min}_y} > z_{\text{max}_y}\))—occurs if \(z\)'s top is not above \(y\)'s top, or if \(x\)'s bottom is above \(z\)'s top.
  2. **Overlap**: Vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\)—occurs if \(z\)'s top is above \(y\)'s top and \(x\)'s bottom is not above \(z\)'s top.

### Resulting relations:
- **Northwest**: Horizontal **West** + vertical **North**.
- **Northeast**: Horizontal **East** + vertical **North**.
- **North**: Horizontal **Overlap** + vertical **North**.
- **West**: Horizontal **West** + vertical **Overlap**.
- **East**: Horizontal **East** + vertical **Overlap**.
- **Bounding Box**: Horizontal **Overlap** + vertical **Overlap** (not fitting any pure cardinal direction).

South, Southeast, and Southwest are impossible because \(x\) is always north of \(y\) and thus cannot be south of \(z\) (as \(z\) overlaps vertically with \(y\)).

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
North, Northeast, Northwest, East, West, Bounding Box.
