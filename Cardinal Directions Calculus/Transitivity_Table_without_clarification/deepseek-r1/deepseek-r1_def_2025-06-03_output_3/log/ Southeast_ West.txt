PROMPT: Let  Southeast and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is **Southeast** of region y, meaning x is to the southeast of y (i.e., east and south relative to y).
- Region y is **West** of region z, meaning y is directly west of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the combined effect:

1. **Vector analysis**:
   - Place z at the origin (0, 0).
   - y is west of z → y is at (-a, 0) for some a > 0.
   - x is southeast of y → from y (-a, 0), x is at (-a + b, -c) for some b, c > 0 (southeast implies movement east and south).
   - Vector from z to x: (dx, dy) = (-a + b, -c).

2. **Direction from z to x**:
   - **dy = -c < 0**: Always southward.
   - **dx = b - a**:
     - If **b > a**, dx > 0 → x is east and south of z → **Southeast**.
     - If **b < a**, dx < 0 → x is west and south of z → **Southwest**.
     - If **b = a**, dx = 0 → x is directly south of z → **South**.

3. **Excluded directions**:
   - North, Northeast, East, Northwest, West: Not possible because dy is always negative (southward).
   - Bounding Box: Not required as the relations fit specific cardinal directions.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **South**, **Southeast**, and **Southwest**.

**Final Answer**:  
South, Southeast, Southwest
