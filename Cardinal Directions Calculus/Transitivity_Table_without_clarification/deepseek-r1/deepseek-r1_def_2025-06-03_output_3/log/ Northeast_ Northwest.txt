PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\):
  - \(x\) is north of \(y\): \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(y)\)
  - \(x\) is east of \(y\): \(\min_x(x) > \max_x(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\):
  - \(y\) is north of \(z\): \(\min_y(y) > \max_y(z)\)
  - \(y\) is west of \(z\): \(\max_x(y) < \min_x(z)\)

Combining these:
- **North condition for \(x\) relative to \(z\)**:
  - \(\min_y(y) > \max_y(z)\) (from \(y\) north of \(z\))
  - \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(y)\) (from \(x\) north of \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(y) \geq \min_y(y) > \max_y(z)\), so \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(z)\) â†’ \(x\) is north of \(z\).

- **East-West possibilities for \(x\) relative to \(z\)**:
  - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are east of \(y\): \(\min_x(x) > \max_x(y)\) and \(\min_x(z) > \max_x(y)\).
  - This leads to three cases:
    1. **Northwest**: If \(\max_x(x) < \min_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\). Combined with north, the relation is **Northwest**.
    2. **Northeast**: If \(\min_x(x) > \max_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\). Combined with north, the relation is **Northeast**.
    3. **North**: If the MBRs overlap in the x-direction (i.e., \(\min_x(x) \leq \max_x(z)\) and \(\max_x(x) \geq \min_x(z)\)), then the relation is **North** (since the north condition holds and the x-projections overlap).

No other relations are possible:
- **Bounding Box** is excluded because \(x\) is strictly north of \(z\) (no overlap in y-direction).
- **South**, **Southeast**, **Southwest**, **East**, **West** alone are not possible due to the north condition.
- **Southeast** and **Southwest** would require \(x\) south of \(z\), which contradicts the north condition.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northwest**, **North**, and **Northeast**.
