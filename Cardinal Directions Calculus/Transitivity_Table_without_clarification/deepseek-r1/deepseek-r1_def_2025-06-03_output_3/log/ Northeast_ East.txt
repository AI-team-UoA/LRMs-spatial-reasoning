PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\) (\(x\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s right edge).
  - \(x\) is entirely above \(y\) (\(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge).
- Region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(y\) is entirely to the east of \(z\) (\(y\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s right edge).

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relation (east-west)**:
   - From \(x\) **Northeast** of \(y\): \(x\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s right edge.
   - From \(y\) **East** of \(z\): \(y\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s right edge.
   - Since \(y\)'s right edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s left edge (by definition of MBR), it follows:
     \[
     x\text{'s left edge} \geq y\text{'s right edge} \geq y\text{'s left edge} \geq z\text{'s right edge}.
     \]
   - Thus, \(x\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s right edge, meaning \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation (north-south)**:
   - From \(x\) **Northeast** of \(y\): \(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge.
   - However, the relation \(y\) **East** of \(z\) imposes **no vertical constraint** between \(y\) and \(z\). The vertical position of \(y\) relative to \(z\) can vary:
     - \(y\) could be **above** \(z\) (if \(y\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s top edge).
     - \(y\) could be **below** \(z\) (if \(y\)'s top edge \(\leq\) \(z\)'s bottom edge).
     - \(y\) could be in the **same vertical band** as \(z\) (if \(z\)'s bottom edge \(\leq\) \(y\)'s bottom edge and \(y\)'s top edge \(\leq\) \(z\)'s top edge).

   Considering the vertical position of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
   - **If \(y\) is above \(z\)**:
     - Then \(y\)'s top edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s top edge.
     - Since \(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge, it follows:
       \[
       x\text{'s bottom edge} \geq y\text{'s top edge} \geq z\text{'s top edge}.
       \]
     - Thus, \(x\) is entirely above \(z\), and combined with being east, \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
   - **If \(y\) is below \(z\)**:
     - Then \(y\)'s top edge \(\leq\) \(z\)'s bottom edge.
     - \(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge, but \(x\)'s top edge could be \(\leq\) \(z\)'s bottom edge (e.g., if \(x\) is placed low enough).
     - Thus, \(x\) could be entirely below \(z\), and combined with being east, \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).
   - **If \(y\) is in the same vertical band as \(z\)**:
     - Then \(z\)'s bottom edge \(\leq\) \(y\)'s bottom edge and \(y\)'s top edge \(\leq\) \(z\)'s top edge.
     - \(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge, and \(x\)'s top edge could be \(\leq\) \(z\)'s top edge (e.g., if \(x\) is vertically aligned within \(z\)'s band).
     - Thus, \(x\) could be in the same vertical band as \(z\), and combined with being east, \(x\) is **East** of \(z\).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **Northeast** (if \(y\) is above \(z\)).
- **Southeast** (if \(y\) is below \(z\)).
- **East** (if \(y\) is in the same vertical band as \(z\)).

No other cardinal relations are possible because:
- \(x\) must be east of \(z\) (as established horizontally).
- Vertical variations only allow the above three cases.
- **Bounding Box** is impossible since \(x\) is strictly east of \(z\) (no overlap).

**Answer: Northeast, East, Southeast**
