PROMPT: Let  South and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is South of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is South of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **South**.

### Explanation:
- The relation "South" implies that the entire region is positioned below the other region, with overlapping horizontal projections (i.e., they share some horizontal alignment).
- Transitivity applies:  
  - Since \(x\) is South of \(y\), \(x\) is below \(y\) and their horizontal extents overlap.  
  - Since \(y\) is South of \(z\), \(y\) is below \(z\) and their horizontal extents overlap.  
- Consequently, \(x\) must be below \(z\) (vertical transitivity).  
- The horizontal overlap between \(x\) and \(y\), and \(y\) and \(z\), ensures overlap between \(x\) and \(z\).  
- Therefore, \(x\) is directly South of \(z\).  

No other relations (e.g., Southwest or Southeast) are possible because they require non-overlapping horizontal extents (e.g., entirely left or right), which contradicts the overlap condition from the given South relations.  

**Final Answer: South**
