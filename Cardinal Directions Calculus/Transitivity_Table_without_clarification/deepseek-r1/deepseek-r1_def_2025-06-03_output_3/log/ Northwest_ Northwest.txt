PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

This implies:
- x is northwest of y, meaning x is north and west of y.
- y is northwest of z, meaning y is north and west of z.

Composing these relations:
- Since x is north of y and y is north of z, x must be north of z.
- Since x is west of y and y is west of z, x must be west of z.

Therefore, x is both north and west of z, which directly corresponds to the **Northwest** relation.

No other relations (such as North, West, or Bounding Box) are possible under this composition, as the combined displacement strictly places x in the northwest quadrant relative to z. Hence, the only possible relation is:

**Northwest**
