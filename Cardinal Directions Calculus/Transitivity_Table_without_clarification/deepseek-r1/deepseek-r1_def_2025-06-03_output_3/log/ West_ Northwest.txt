PROMPT: Let  West and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region x is West of region y: x is entirely to the west of y, with vertical overlap (i.e., the minimum y-boundary of x ≤ maximum y-boundary of y and maximum y-boundary of x ≥ minimum y-boundary of y).
- Region y is Northwest of region z: y is entirely to the northwest of z, meaning y is entirely to the west (maximum x-boundary of y < minimum x-boundary of z) and entirely to the north (minimum y-boundary of y > maximum y-boundary of z).

Combining these:
- x is entirely to the west of z: maximum x-boundary of x < minimum x-boundary of z (since x is west of y and y is west of z).
- For the vertical relation between x and z:
  - If the minimum y-boundary of x > maximum y-boundary of z, then x is entirely north of z, resulting in the **Northwest** relation.
  - Otherwise, if there is vertical overlap (minimum y-boundary of x ≤ maximum y-boundary of z and maximum y-boundary of x ≥ minimum y-boundary of z), then the relation is **West**.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are **Northwest** and **West**.  
Final answer:  
Northwest, West
