PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both **North** and **East** of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly **South** of \(z\) (same horizontal alignment, i.e., same East-West position).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the composition of these relations:

1. **Horizontally**: Since \(x\) is **East** of \(y\) and \(y\) has the same horizontal position as \(z\) (due to **South**), \(x\) must be **East** of \(z\).
2. **Vertically**: 
   - \(x\) is **North** of \(y\).
   - \(y\) is **South** of \(z\), so \(z\) is **North** of \(y\).
   - The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the distances:
     - If the vertical distance from \(x\) to \(y\) is greater than that from \(z\) to \(y\), then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).
     - If the vertical distance from \(z\) to \(y\) is greater, then \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).
     - If the distances are equal, \(x\) and \(z\) are at the same vertical level.

Combining the horizontal and vertical components:

- **Horizontally**: Always **East**.
- **Vertically**: Can be **North**, **South**, or equal.

Thus, the possible combined relations are:

- **Northeast** (if vertically **North**).
- **East** (if vertically aligned).
- **Southeast** (if vertically **South** with moderate vertical dominance).
- **South** (if vertically **South** with strong vertical dominance, where the angle falls in the South sector despite the East component).

The relations **Northeast**, **East**, **Southeast**, and **South** are all possible based on the distances involved. Other directions like **North**, **Northwest**, **West**, **Southwest**, or **Bounding Box** are not possible due to the fixed horizontal **East** component and the vertical constraints.

**Possible relations**: Northeast, East, Southeast, South.
