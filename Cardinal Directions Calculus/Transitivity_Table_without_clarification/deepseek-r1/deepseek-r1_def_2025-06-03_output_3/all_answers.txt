For r1: North, r2: North, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

The vertical position requires that x is above z (since y is above z and x is above y). However, the horizontal alignment between x and z is not constrained. This leads to three possible relations for x relative to z:

1. **North (N)**: If x and z overlap horizontally (e.g., their east-west projections intersect).
2. **Northwest (NW)**: If x is entirely to the west of z (e.g., the rightmost point of x is left of the leftmost point of z).
3. **Northeast (NE)**: If x is entirely to the east of z (e.g., the leftmost point of x is right of the rightmost point of z).

The "Bounding Box" relation is not possible because x and z cannot contain each other due to the strict vertical separation (x is above z). Other directions like South, East, etc., are invalid because x must be above z.

Thus, the possible relations are **North, Northwest, Northeast**.
For r1: North, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:  
- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\).  
- Region \(y\) is Northeast of region \(z\).  

The relation "Northeast" implies \(y\) is both North and East of \(z\). The North relation between \(x\) and \(y\) ensures \(x\) is North of \(z\) due to transitivity in the north-south direction. However, the east-west position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is not fixed:  
- \(x\) could be directly aligned with \(z\) in longitude (overlap horizontally), resulting in **North**.  
- \(x\) could be entirely East of \(z\), resulting in **Northeast**.  
- \(x\) could be entirely West of \(z\), resulting in **Northwest**.  

No other relations (e.g., South, East, West, etc.) are possible because \(x\) must be North of \(z\). The relations "Bounding Box" is not applicable as it is not a cardinal direction.  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
**North, Northeast, Northwest**.
For r1: North, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is North of region y: x is entirely above y (vertical separation with x above).
- Region y is Southeast of region z: y is entirely to the southeast of z, meaning z is northwest of y. Thus, z is entirely above and to the west of y.

Combining these:
- x is above y.
- z is above and to the west of y.

Therefore, relative to z:
- x must be entirely to the east of z because:
  - y is southeast of z, so y is east of z.
  - x is north of y but can extend horizontally; however, since y is entirely east of z, any horizontal position of x relative to y (whether overlapping, west of y, or east of y) will still place x entirely east of z. Specifically:
    - If x overlaps or is east of y, it remains east of z.
    - If x is west of y, note that y is east of z (so z is west of y), and the western boundary of y is east of the eastern boundary of z. Thus, even if x extends west of y, it is still east of z's eastern boundary.

Vertically, the relation between x and z can vary:
1. **x is above z**: If the bottom of x is above the top of z, then x is northeast of z.
2. **x is below z**: If the top of x is below the bottom of z, then x is southeast of z.
3. **Vertical overlap**: If x and z overlap vertically (neither entirely above nor below), but x is entirely east of z, then x is east of z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northeast** (if x is above and east of z),
- **East** (if vertically overlapping but x is east of z),
- **Southeast** (if x is below and east of z).

Other directions (like North, South, West, etc.) are not possible because:
- x cannot be north or south of z without the east component (which is fixed).
- x is always east of z, so west or northwest/southwest are impossible.
- Bounding Box is not a cardinal relation and not applicable.

**Answer: Northeast, East, Southeast**
For r1: North, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely above \(y\) with horizontal overlap.
- Region \(y\) is South of region \(z\), meaning \(z\) is entirely above \(y\) with horizontal overlap.

This implies both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned above \(y\), but their relative positions to each other are not fixed. The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their horizontal and vertical alignment. All cardinal directions and bounding box are possible:

- **North**: \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) with horizontal overlap.  
  Example: \(x\) and \(z\) aligned vertically, with \(x\) higher than \(z\).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) is entirely above and entirely east of \(z\).  
  Example: \(x\) is higher and to the right of \(z\).
- **East**: \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) with vertical overlap.  
  Example: \(x\) and \(z\) at similar heights, with \(x\) to the right.
- **Southeast**: \(x\) is entirely below and entirely east of \(z\).  
  Example: \(x\) is lower and to the right of \(z\).
- **South**: \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) with horizontal overlap.  
  Example: \(x\) and \(z\) aligned vertically, with \(x\) lower than \(z\).
- **Southwest**: \(x\) is entirely below and entirely west of \(z\).  
  Example: \(x\) is lower and to the left of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) with vertical overlap.  
  Example: \(x\) and \(z\) at similar heights, with \(x\) to the left.
- **Northwest**: \(x\) is entirely above and entirely west of \(z\).  
  Example: \(x\) is higher and to the left of \(z\).
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) and \(z\) overlap in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, so no strict cardinal direction applies.  
  Example: \(x\) and \(z\) partially overlap in space.

Thus, every relation is possible depending on the specific placement of \(x\) and \(z\) relative to each other, while satisfying the initial conditions.

**Answer**: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.
For r1: North, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is North of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is East of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary depending on the spatial extents and positions. Here is a breakdown of the possibilities:

- **Northeast**: \(x\) is entirely to the north and east of \(z\).
- **East**: \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\), with no constraint on the north-south axis (overlap or not), and not entirely north or south.
- **Southeast**: \(x\) is entirely to the south and east of \(z\).
- **North**: \(x\) is entirely to the north of \(z\), with no constraint on the east-west axis (overlap or not), and not entirely east or west.
- **South**: \(x\) is entirely to the south of \(z\), with no constraint on the east-west axis (overlap or not), and not entirely east or west.
- **Northwest**: \(x\) is entirely to the north and west of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\), with no constraint on the north-south axis (overlap or not), and not entirely north or south.
- **Southwest**: \(x\) is entirely to the south and west of \(z\).
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) does not fit entirely in any single cardinal direction relative to \(z\) (e.g., overlaps in both axes or extends into multiple directions).

Each of these relations is possible under different configurations of the regions' minimal bounding boxes, considering that \(x\) being North of \(y\) only constrains the north-south axis and \(y\) being East of \(z\) only constrains the east-west axis, with no direct constraints between \(x\) and \(z\) in the other axes.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**.
For r1: North, r2:  Northwest, answer: Given that region x is North of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

- **West**: This occurs when y is close to the western boundary of the Northwest sector from z, and x is directly North of y, resulting in x being West of z.
- **Northwest**: This occurs when y is solidly within the Northwest sector from z, and x is North of y, resulting in x being Northwest of z.
- **North**: This occurs when y is close to the northern boundary of the Northwest sector from z (i.e., nearly North of z but slightly West), and x is North of y, resulting in x being North of z.

These relations cover all possible cases based on the composition of the cardinal directions. The Bounding Box relation is not applicable here, as the directional relations are specific.

**Possible relations: West, Northwest, North**
For r1: North, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly north of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is West of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly west of \(z\).

To determine the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Position \(z\) as a reference point. Since \(y\) is west of \(z\), \(y\) is located to the left (west) of \(z\).
- Since \(x\) is north of \(y\), \(x\) is located above (north) of \(y\).
- Combining these, from \(z\), \(x\) is both northwest relative to \(z\) because:
  - Moving from \(z\) to \(y\) is directly west.
  - Moving from \(y\) to \(x\) is directly north.
  - The net direction from \(z\) to \(x\) is northwest.

Thus, the relation of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is **Northwest**.  
This is the only possible relation given the strict cardinal directions and the composition, as no other direction (e.g., North, West) fits the combined displacement.

The possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **Northwest**.  

**Answer: Northwest**
For r1: North, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **North** of region \(y\): \(x\) is directly above \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\): \(y\) is below and to the left of \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Relative Positioning**:
   - Since \(y\) is Southwest of \(z\), \(y\) is located in the third quadrant relative to \(z\) (i.e., left and down).
   - \(x\) is North of \(y\), so \(x\) is directly above \(y\) but shares the same longitudinal line (if we assume a coordinate system). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\) (since \(y\) is left of \(z\)) but can be at varying latitudes relative to \(z\).

2. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - **If \(x\) is slightly above \(y\)**:
     - \(x\) remains below \(z\) (since \(y\) is below \(z\)) but to the left. The direction from \(z\) to \(x\) could be:
       - **West**: If \(x\) is almost at the same latitude as \(z\) but left.
       - **Southwest**: If \(x\) is left and somewhat below \(z\).
       - **South**: If \(x\) is significantly below \(z\) and left.
   - **If \(x\) is at the same latitude as \(z\)**:
     - \(x\) is directly left of \(z\), resulting in **West**.
   - **If \(x\) is above \(z\)**:
     - \(x\) is left and above \(z\). The direction could be:
       - **Northwest**: If \(x\) is left and somewhat above \(z\).
       - **North**: If \(x\) is significantly above \(z\) and left.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the exact distances, but without additional constraints, all directions that include a left (west) component relative to \(z\) are possible, combined with varying vertical positions (south, north, or neutral).
   - The possible cardinal directions are:
     - **North**: If \(x\) is sufficiently above \(z\).
     - **Northwest**: If \(x\) is above and left of \(z\).
     - **West**: If \(x\) is directly left of \(z\).
     - **Southwest**: If \(x\) is below and left of \(z\).
     - **South**: If \(x\) is sufficiently below \(z\) and left.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **North, Northwest, West, Southwest, South**.
For r1: North, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **North** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely above \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) completely surrounds \(z\), so \(z\) is entirely within \(y\).

Since \(z\) is entirely within \(y\), every part of \(z\) lies within the boundaries of \(y\). Because \(x\) is entirely above \(y\) (North of \(y\)), every part of \(x\) is above every part of \(y\), and thus above every part of \(z\). Therefore, \(x\) must be **North** of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., Northeast, Northwest) are necessarily implied, as the horizontal alignment between \(x\) and \(z\) is not constrained by the given relations. \(x\) cannot be the **Bounding Box** of \(z\) because \(y\) is the bounding box of \(z\), and \(x\) is outside \(y\) (north of it).

**Possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\):  
North**
For r1:  Northeast, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\):  
  This implies \(x\) is entirely to the east and north of \(y\). Specifically, the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than or equal to the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\), and the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than or equal to the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is **North** of region \(z\):  
  This implies \(y\) is entirely above \(z\) (north) with horizontal overlap. Specifically, the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\) is greater than or equal to the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\), and the \(x\)-projections of \(y\) and \(z\) overlap.

### Analysis for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Vertical component**:  
   Since \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(y\) is above \(z\), \(x\) is entirely above \(z\). Thus, the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\).

2. **Horizontal component**:  
   - \(x\) is east of \(y\): the entire \(x\) lies to the east of \(y\), so the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) \(\geq\) maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\).
   - \(y\) and \(z\) have horizontal overlap: the \(x\)-projections overlap, meaning the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\) \(\geq\) minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\).

   This leads to two possible horizontal scenarios between \(x\) and \(z\):
   - **Case 1: Horizontal overlap between \(x\) and \(z\)**  
     If the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\) is greater than the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\), then \(x\) and \(z\) have horizontal overlap. Combined with \(x\) being entirely above \(z\), the relation is **North**.
   - **Case 2: No horizontal overlap (east)**  
     If the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than or equal to the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\), then \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being entirely above \(z\), the relation is **Northeast**.

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **North** and **Northeast**. These arise from the horizontal positioning variability while maintaining the vertical constraint that \(x\) is always above \(z\).

**Answer: North, Northeast**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:
- Region x is Northeast of region y, meaning x is both North and East of y.
- Region y is Northeast of region z, meaning y is both North and East of z.

This implies:
- **Transitivity of North**: If x is North of y and y is North of z, then x is North of z.
- **Transitivity of East**: If x is East of y and y is East of z, then x is East of z.

Since x is both North and East of z, the relation between x and z must be **Northeast**.

No other relations (e.g., North, East, etc.) are possible under this composition, as the combined conditions strictly satisfy the Northeast definition.

**Answer: Northeast**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is **Northeast** of region y, meaning x is entirely east and north of y.
- Region y is **Southeast** of region z, meaning y is entirely east and south of z.

From these relations, the position of x relative to z must satisfy:
1. **East component**: Since x is east of y and y is east of z, x must be east of z. This is strict and unavoidable.
2. **Vertical (north-south) component**: This can vary:
   - If x is sufficiently north relative to z, then x is **Northeast** of z.
   - If x is sufficiently south relative to z, then x is **Southeast** of z.
   - If x is neither entirely north nor entirely south of z (i.e., there is vertical overlap), then x is **East** of z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **East** (if x is east of z with vertical overlap)
- **Northeast** (if x is east and north of z)
- **Southeast** (if x is east and south of z)

No other cardinal directions are possible because the east component is fixed, and the vertical component only allows these three cases.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  South, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both **North** and **East** of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly **South** of \(z\) (same horizontal alignment, i.e., same East-West position).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the composition of these relations:

1. **Horizontally**: Since \(x\) is **East** of \(y\) and \(y\) has the same horizontal position as \(z\) (due to **South**), \(x\) must be **East** of \(z\).
2. **Vertically**: 
   - \(x\) is **North** of \(y\).
   - \(y\) is **South** of \(z\), so \(z\) is **North** of \(y\).
   - The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the distances:
     - If the vertical distance from \(x\) to \(y\) is greater than that from \(z\) to \(y\), then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).
     - If the vertical distance from \(z\) to \(y\) is greater, then \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).
     - If the distances are equal, \(x\) and \(z\) are at the same vertical level.

Combining the horizontal and vertical components:

- **Horizontally**: Always **East**.
- **Vertically**: Can be **North**, **South**, or equal.

Thus, the possible combined relations are:

- **Northeast** (if vertically **North**).
- **East** (if vertically aligned).
- **Southeast** (if vertically **South** with moderate vertical dominance).
- **South** (if vertically **South** with strong vertical dominance, where the angle falls in the South sector despite the East component).

The relations **Northeast**, **East**, **Southeast**, and **South** are all possible based on the distances involved. Other directions like **North**, **Northwest**, **West**, **Southwest**, or **Bounding Box** are not possible due to the fixed horizontal **East** component and the vertical constraints.

**Possible relations**: Northeast, East, Southeast, South.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\) (\(x\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s right edge).
  - \(x\) is entirely above \(y\) (\(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge).
- Region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(y\) is entirely to the east of \(z\) (\(y\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s right edge).

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relation (east-west)**:
   - From \(x\) **Northeast** of \(y\): \(x\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s right edge.
   - From \(y\) **East** of \(z\): \(y\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s right edge.
   - Since \(y\)'s right edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s left edge (by definition of MBR), it follows:
     \[
     x\text{'s left edge} \geq y\text{'s right edge} \geq y\text{'s left edge} \geq z\text{'s right edge}.
     \]
   - Thus, \(x\)'s left edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s right edge, meaning \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation (north-south)**:
   - From \(x\) **Northeast** of \(y\): \(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge.
   - However, the relation \(y\) **East** of \(z\) imposes **no vertical constraint** between \(y\) and \(z\). The vertical position of \(y\) relative to \(z\) can vary:
     - \(y\) could be **above** \(z\) (if \(y\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s top edge).
     - \(y\) could be **below** \(z\) (if \(y\)'s top edge \(\leq\) \(z\)'s bottom edge).
     - \(y\) could be in the **same vertical band** as \(z\) (if \(z\)'s bottom edge \(\leq\) \(y\)'s bottom edge and \(y\)'s top edge \(\leq\) \(z\)'s top edge).

   Considering the vertical position of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
   - **If \(y\) is above \(z\)**:
     - Then \(y\)'s top edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(z\)'s top edge.
     - Since \(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge, it follows:
       \[
       x\text{'s bottom edge} \geq y\text{'s top edge} \geq z\text{'s top edge}.
       \]
     - Thus, \(x\) is entirely above \(z\), and combined with being east, \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
   - **If \(y\) is below \(z\)**:
     - Then \(y\)'s top edge \(\leq\) \(z\)'s bottom edge.
     - \(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge, but \(x\)'s top edge could be \(\leq\) \(z\)'s bottom edge (e.g., if \(x\) is placed low enough).
     - Thus, \(x\) could be entirely below \(z\), and combined with being east, \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).
   - **If \(y\) is in the same vertical band as \(z\)**:
     - Then \(z\)'s bottom edge \(\leq\) \(y\)'s bottom edge and \(y\)'s top edge \(\leq\) \(z\)'s top edge.
     - \(x\)'s bottom edge \(\geq\) \(y\)'s top edge, and \(x\)'s top edge could be \(\leq\) \(z\)'s top edge (e.g., if \(x\) is vertically aligned within \(z\)'s band).
     - Thus, \(x\) could be in the same vertical band as \(z\), and combined with being east, \(x\) is **East** of \(z\).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **Northeast** (if \(y\) is above \(z\)).
- **Southeast** (if \(y\) is below \(z\)).
- **East** (if \(y\) is in the same vertical band as \(z\)).

No other cardinal relations are possible because:
- \(x\) must be east of \(z\) (as established horizontally).
- Vertical variations only allow the above three cases.
- **Bounding Box** is impossible since \(x\) is strictly east of \(z\) (no overlap).

**Answer: Northeast, East, Southeast**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\):
  - \(x\) is north of \(y\): \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(y)\)
  - \(x\) is east of \(y\): \(\min_x(x) > \max_x(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\):
  - \(y\) is north of \(z\): \(\min_y(y) > \max_y(z)\)
  - \(y\) is west of \(z\): \(\max_x(y) < \min_x(z)\)

Combining these:
- **North condition for \(x\) relative to \(z\)**:
  - \(\min_y(y) > \max_y(z)\) (from \(y\) north of \(z\))
  - \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(y)\) (from \(x\) north of \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(y) \geq \min_y(y) > \max_y(z)\), so \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(z)\) → \(x\) is north of \(z\).

- **East-West possibilities for \(x\) relative to \(z\)**:
  - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are east of \(y\): \(\min_x(x) > \max_x(y)\) and \(\min_x(z) > \max_x(y)\).
  - This leads to three cases:
    1. **Northwest**: If \(\max_x(x) < \min_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\). Combined with north, the relation is **Northwest**.
    2. **Northeast**: If \(\min_x(x) > \max_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\). Combined with north, the relation is **Northeast**.
    3. **North**: If the MBRs overlap in the x-direction (i.e., \(\min_x(x) \leq \max_x(z)\) and \(\max_x(x) \geq \min_x(z)\)), then the relation is **North** (since the north condition holds and the x-projections overlap).

No other relations are possible:
- **Bounding Box** is excluded because \(x\) is strictly north of \(z\) (no overlap in y-direction).
- **South**, **Southeast**, **Southwest**, **East**, **West** alone are not possible due to the north condition.
- **Southeast** and **Southwest** would require \(x\) south of \(z\), which contradicts the north condition.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northwest**, **North**, and **Northeast**.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is Northeast of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is West of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine relations, depending on the specific positions and sizes of the regions. The constraints allow for all combinations of horizontal and vertical alignments:

- **Horizontal possibilities**: \(x\) can be entirely west of \(z\) (West), entirely east of \(z\) (East), or overlap horizontally with \(z\).
- **Vertical possibilities**: \(x\) must be north of \(y\), but \(z\) can be above, below, or overlapping vertically with \(y\) (and thus with \(x\) relatively). This allows \(x\) to be entirely north of \(z\) (North), entirely south of \(z\) (South), or overlap vertically.

Combining these, all cardinal and bounding box relations are possible:
- If \(x\) is west and north of \(z\): **Northwest**
- If \(x\) is west and south of \(z\): **Southwest**
- If \(x\) is west with vertical overlap: **West**
- If \(x\) is east and north of \(z\): **Northeast**
- If \(x\) is east and south of \(z\): **Southeast**
- If \(x\) is east with vertical overlap: **East**
- If \(x\) overlaps horizontally and is north of \(z\): **North**
- If \(x\) overlaps horizontally and is south of \(z\): **South**
- If \(x\) overlaps both horizontally and vertically: **Bounding Box**

Thus, every relation is achievable under the given constraints. The possible relations are:

**North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is Northeast of region y, meaning x is both North and East of y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z, meaning z is both North and East of y (since if y is Southwest of z, then z is Northeast of y).

Thus, both x and z are Northeast of y. However, their relative positions can vary:
- x could be North of z (if x is further North than z).
- x could be South of z (if x is less North than z).
- x could be East of z (if x is further East than z).
- x could be West of z (if x is less East than z).

Considering all combinations of these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are all eight directions:
- **North**: x is directly North of z (same East, x more North).
- **Northeast**: x is North and East of z.
- **East**: x is directly East of z (same North, x more East).
- **Southeast**: x is South and East of z.
- **South**: x is directly South of z (same East, x less North).
- **Southwest**: x is South and West of z.
- **West**: x is directly West of z (same North, x less East).
- **Northwest**: x is North and West of z.

These are all possible because the exact positions relative to y do not constrain the relative positions between x and z beyond both being Northeast of y. Examples can be constructed for each case, as shown in the reasoning.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning:
  - The entire \(x\) is east of the eastern boundary of \(y\).
  - The entire \(x\) is north of the northern boundary of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(y\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle enclosing \(z\), so \(z\) lies entirely within \(y\).
  - The northern boundary of \(y\) is the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\), and the eastern boundary of \(y\) is the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\).

Since \(x\) is entirely northeast of \(y\), and \(z\) is contained within \(y\):
- The eastern boundary of \(y\) (which is the max \(x\) of \(z\)) is less than the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\).
- The northern boundary of \(y\) (which is the max \(y\) of \(z\)) is less than the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\).

Therefore, \(x\) must be **Northeast** of \(z\). This is the only possible relation that satisfies both conditions simultaneously. No other cardinal direction (e.g., East, North, etc.) fits because:
- **East** would require overlap in the north-south direction, but \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\).
- **North** would require overlap in the east-west direction, but \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\).
- Other directions (e.g., Southeast, Northwest) do not align with the strict northeast positioning.

**Possible relation: Northeast**
For r1:  Southeast, r2: North, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations—region \(x\) is Southeast of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is North of region \(z\)—the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- The relation between \(y\) and \(z\) places \(y\) directly North of \(z\), meaning \(y\) is above \(z\) on the North-South axis.
- The relation between \(x\) and \(y\) places \(x\) Southeast of \(y\), meaning \(x\) is to the southeast (a combination of South and East) relative to \(y\).

Considering the composition of these relations:
- The position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on the specific distances involved, but it must lie within the cone defined by the Southeast constraint from \(y\).
- Possible relative positions of \(x\) from \(z\) include:
  - **North**: If \(x\) is sufficiently close to the North direction relative to \(z\), which can occur when the Eastward shift from \(y\) to \(x\) is small compared to the Northward position of \(y\) from \(z\).
  - **Northeast**: If \(x\) is positioned such that it is both North and East of \(z\), typically when the Eastward and Northward components are balanced.
  - **East**: If \(x\) lies directly East of \(z\), which happens when the North-South displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) is zero or negligible.
  - **Southeast**: If \(x\) is Southeast of \(z\), occurring when the Southward component from \(y\) to \(x\) combines with the Eastward shift to place \(x\) in the Southeast quadrant relative to \(z\).

However, the relations **South**, **Southwest**, **West**, **Northwest**, and **Bounding Box** are not possible under the given constraints. Specifically:
- **South** is excluded because the Southeast constraint from \(y\) to \(x\) requires the Southward movement to be bounded relative to the Eastward movement, preventing \(x\) from being directly South of \(z\).
- Other directions like **Southwest**, **West**, and **Northwest** are not feasible as the relations imply only Eastward and variable North/South shifts.
- **Bounding Box** is unnecessary since the relations fit within the defined cardinal directions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **North**, **Northeast**, **East**, and **Southeast**.

**Final Answer:**  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **Southeast** of region y, meaning x is to the east and south of y.
- Region y is **Northeast** of region z, meaning y is to the east and north of z.

To determine possible relations between x and z, consider the relative positions:

- Place z at the origin (0,0). Then y is at (a, a) for some a > 0 (since y is northeast of z).
- From y, x is southeast, so x is at (a + b, a - c) for some b > 0 and c > 0 (east and south displacement).

The vector from z to x is (a + b, a - c). The direction depends on the values of a, b, and c:

1. **If a > c**:
   - The vertical component (a - c) is positive (north), and the horizontal component (a + b) is positive (east).
   - The angle from the east axis is between 0° and 45° (since (a - c) < (a + b) always).
   - Possible relations:
     - **East**: if the angle is small (e.g., a much larger than c, or b large).
     - **Northeast**: if the angle is larger (e.g., a close to c and b small).

2. **If a < c**:
   - The vertical component (a - c) is negative (south), and the horizontal component (a + b) is positive (east).
   - The angle from the east axis is between 0° and -90° (south of east).
   - Possible relations:
     - **East**: if the southward displacement is very small (e.g., c slightly larger than a).
     - **Southeast**: if the angle is moderate (e.g., c larger than a but comparable).
     - **South**: if the southward displacement dominates (e.g., c much larger than a).

3. **If a = c**:
   - The vertical component is zero, so the relation is exactly **East**.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **East** (always possible, as shown in all cases).
- **Northeast** (when a > c).
- **Southeast** (when a < c).
- **South** (when a < c and the south component is dominant).

Other relations (North, Northwest, West, Southwest) are not possible because the eastward displacement (a + b > 0) is always present, and north/south depends on a and c, but never west or the other diagonals.

**Answer:** East, Northeast, Southeast, South.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is Southeast of region y, meaning x is both South and East of y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z, meaning y is both South and East of z.

Transitively:
- Since y is South of z and x is South of y, x is South of z.
- Since y is East of z and x is East of y, x is East of z.

Therefore, x is both South and East of z, which corresponds to the **Southeast** relation. No other cardinal direction or bounding box relation fits, as the transitivity directly leads to Southeast.

**Possible relation: Southeast**
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  South, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region x is **Southeast** of region y, meaning x is both south and east of y.
- Region y is **South** of region z, meaning y is directly south of z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by the composition of these directions. The displacement from z to x involves:
- Moving south from z to y.
- Then moving southeast (south and east) from y to x.

This results in:
- x being **south** of z (since both steps have a south component).
- x having an **east** component relative to z (introduced by the southeast relation from y to x).

The exact relation between x and z depends on the relative magnitudes of the displacements:
- If the east displacement dominates, the relation could be **East** (if the angle is between 90° and 112.5° from north).
- If both south and east components are significant and balanced, the relation is **Southeast** (angle between 112.5° and 157.5°).
- If the south displacement dominates, the relation could be **South** (angle between 157.5° and 180°).

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are **East, Southeast, South**.

**Answer: East, Southeast, South**
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  East, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **Southeast** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\).

The composition of these relations is analyzed as follows:

1. **Southeast** of \(y\) implies \(x\) is positioned to the southeast relative to \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both south and east of \(y\).
2. **East** of \(z\) implies \(y\) is directly east of \(z\), with no specification on north-south alignment.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the relative positions:
- \(x\) must be east of \(z\) because:
  - \(y\) is east of \(z\), so \(x\) being east or southeast of \(y\) places \(x\) further east of \(z\).
- The north-south component varies:
  - If the southward shift from \(y\) to \(x\) is minimal compared to the eastward shift from \(z\) to \(y\), \(x\) may align more with the **East** of \(z\).
  - If the southward shift is significant, \(x\) may fall into the **Southeast** sector relative to \(z\).

Given the constraints:
- \(x\) cannot be directly south of \(z\) because the eastward component from \(z\) to \(y\) and then to \(x\) ensures \(x\) is always east of \(z\).
- Other directions (e.g., Northeast, South) are not possible due to the combined east and southeast displacements.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **East** and **Southeast**.

**Answer: East, Southeast**
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: Given that region x is Southeast of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z can be any of the eight cardinal directions, depending on the relative distances and positions. This is because:

- The Southeast relation from y to x implies that x is east and south of y.
- The Northwest relation from z to y implies that y is north and west of z, meaning z is south and east of y.

Since both x and z are southeast of y (but at potentially different distances), the vector from z to x can result in any direction due to the variability in the distances involved. Specifically:

- If x is farther east and farther north relative to z, it can be Northeast of z.
- If x is farther east and at the same latitude, it can be East of z.
- If x is farther east and farther south, it can be Southeast of z.
- If x is at the same longitude and farther north, it can be North of z.
- If x is at the same longitude and farther south, it can be South of z.
- If x is farther west and farther north, it can be Northwest of z.
- If x is farther west and at the same latitude, it can be West of z.
- If x is farther west and farther south, it can be Southwest of z.

Bounding Box is not possible in this case because the given relations (x Southeast of y and y Northwest of z) imply that all regions are disjoint and have a defined directional relationship, so there is no overlap or containment that would make the direction undefined.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

**Final Answer:**  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is **Southeast** of region y, meaning x is to the southeast of y (i.e., east and south relative to y).
- Region y is **West** of region z, meaning y is directly west of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the combined effect:

1. **Vector analysis**:
   - Place z at the origin (0, 0).
   - y is west of z → y is at (-a, 0) for some a > 0.
   - x is southeast of y → from y (-a, 0), x is at (-a + b, -c) for some b, c > 0 (southeast implies movement east and south).
   - Vector from z to x: (dx, dy) = (-a + b, -c).

2. **Direction from z to x**:
   - **dy = -c < 0**: Always southward.
   - **dx = b - a**:
     - If **b > a**, dx > 0 → x is east and south of z → **Southeast**.
     - If **b < a**, dx < 0 → x is west and south of z → **Southwest**.
     - If **b = a**, dx = 0 → x is directly south of z → **South**.

3. **Excluded directions**:
   - North, Northeast, East, Northwest, West: Not possible because dy is always negative (southward).
   - Bounding Box: Not required as the relations fit specific cardinal directions.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **South**, **Southeast**, and **Southwest**.

**Final Answer**:  
South, Southeast, Southwest
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is Southeast of region y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z.

Considering the relative positions in a coordinate system where z is at the origin (0,0):
- Southwest of z implies y is in the third quadrant (negative x, negative y), e.g., at (-a, -b) where a, b > 0.
- Southeast of y implies x is relative to y: moving east (positive x) and south (negative y). Thus, x is at (-a + c, -b - d) for some c, d > 0.

Relative to z (0,0), the position of x is:
- x-coordinate: -a + c (can be negative, zero, or positive).
- y-coordinate: -b - d (always negative, so south).

Possible relations between x and z:
1. **South (S)**: If the x-coordinate is zero (c = a), x is directly south of z.
   - Example: y at (-1, -1), x at (0, -2). Vector from z to x: (0, -2) → South.
2. **Southeast (SE)**: If the x-coordinate is positive (c > a), x is east and south of z.
   - Example: y at (-1, -1), x at (1, -2). Vector from z to x: (1, -2) → Southeast.
3. **Southwest (SW)**: If the x-coordinate is negative (c < a), x is west and south of z.
   - Example: y at (-1, -1), x at (-2, -2). Vector from z to x: (-2, -2) → Southwest.

No other cardinal directions are possible because:
- North, Northeast, East, Northwest, West, or North-related directions require non-negative y-components, but here y is always negative (south).
- Bounding Box is not necessary as the relations are covered by specific cardinal directions.

Thus, the possible relations are **South, Southeast, Southwest**.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Southeast** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the east and south of \(y\). Specifically:
  - The leftmost point of \(x\) is to the east of the rightmost point of \(y\) (east condition).
  - The topmost point of \(x\) is to the south of the bottommost point of \(y\) (south condition).
- Region \(y\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(z\). This means \(y\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that completely encloses \(z\), so \(z\) lies entirely within \(y\).

Now, consider the position of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- **East condition**: Since \(x\) is east of \(y\), the leftmost point of \(x\) is east of the rightmost point of \(y\). Because \(z\) is inside \(y\), the rightmost point of \(z\) is at most the rightmost point of \(y\). Thus, the leftmost point of \(x\) is east of the rightmost point of \(z\), satisfying the east condition for \(x\) relative to \(z\).
- **South condition**: Since \(x\) is south of \(y\), the topmost point of \(x\) is south of the bottommost point of \(y\). Because \(z\) is inside \(y\), the bottommost point of \(z\) is at least the bottommost point of \(y\). Thus, the topmost point of \(x\) is south of the bottommost point of \(z\), satisfying the south condition for \(x\) relative to \(z\).

Therefore, \(x\) must be **Southeast** of \(z\). There are no other possible relations, as the constraints force \(x\) to be strictly southeast of all parts of \(z\).

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\): Southeast**
For r1:  South, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations—region \(x\) is South of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is North of region \(z\)—both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned south of \(y\). However, there are no constraints on the relative horizontal or vertical alignment between \(x\) and \(z\) themselves. Therefore, any cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is possible, as long as both remain south of \(y\). The possible relations include:

- **North**: \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (with overlapping horizontal projections).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) is above and to the east of \(z\).
- **East**: \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\) (with overlapping vertical projections).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) is below and to the east of \(z\).
- **South**: \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (with overlapping horizontal projections).
- **Southwest**: \(x\) is below and to the west of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\) (with overlapping vertical projections).
- **Northwest**: \(x\) is above and to the west of \(z\).

All eight cardinal directions are feasible, depending on the specific positioning of \(x\) and \(z\) relative to each other while satisfying the given conditions. "Bounding Box" is not a cardinal direction relation and is not applicable here.

**Possible relations**:  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.
For r1:  South, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly south of \(y\) (aligned vertically but southward).
- Region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is northeast of \(z\) (diagonally, so both north and east).

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Relative to \(z\):**  
   - \(y\) is northeast of \(z\), so \(y\) is north and east of \(z\).
   - \(x\) is south of \(y\), so \(x\) is vertically aligned with \(y\) but southward. Thus, \(x\) must be east of \(z\) (since \(y\) is east of \(z\) and \(x\) aligns with \(y\) horizontally).

2. **Vertical position of \(x\) relative to \(z\):**  
   - \(y\) is north of \(z\), but \(x\) is south of \(y\).  
   - The latitude of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on how far south \(x\) is from \(y\):  
     - If \(x\) is not too far south, it may still be north of \(z\) → **Northeast** of \(z\).  
     - If \(x\) is at the same latitude as \(z\) → **East** of \(z\).  
     - If \(x\) is south of \(z\) → **Southeast** of \(z\).

3. **Impossible relations:**  
   - \(x\) cannot be west of \(z\) because it aligns with \(y\) (which is east of \(z\)).  
   - \(x\) cannot be directly north, south, northwest, southwest, or west due to the east alignment.  
   - Bounding Box is not applicable as the relations are specific cardinal directions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
**Northeast, East, Southeast**.  

**Final Answer:** Northeast, East, Southeast
For r1:  South, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given—region x is South of region y, and region y is Southeast of region z—the possible relations between region x and region z are South or Southeast.

### Explanation:
- **South**: If region y is Southeast of region z but very close to being directly South (i.e., the east component is minimal), and region x is directly South of region y, then region x could be directly South of region z if the positions align such that the east-west deviation is negligible.
- **Southeast**: In most cases, since region y is Southeast of region z (implying an east and south component), and region x is South of region y (same east-west position but further south), region x will typically be Southeast of region z due to the inherited east component from y.

Other relations (North, Northeast, East, Northwest, West, Southwest) are not possible because:
- Region x is south of region y, and region y is south of region z, so region x cannot be north of region z.
- The east component from region y's position relative to region z means region x cannot be directly West or East of region z, and combinations like Northeast or Southwest are inconsistent with the given relations.

"Bounding Box" is not applicable here, as region x is outside and south-east of region z, not overlapping or within its bounding box.

Thus, the possible relations are **South** and **Southeast**.
For r1:  South, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is South of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is South of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **South**.

### Explanation:
- The relation "South" implies that the entire region is positioned below the other region, with overlapping horizontal projections (i.e., they share some horizontal alignment).
- Transitivity applies:  
  - Since \(x\) is South of \(y\), \(x\) is below \(y\) and their horizontal extents overlap.  
  - Since \(y\) is South of \(z\), \(y\) is below \(z\) and their horizontal extents overlap.  
- Consequently, \(x\) must be below \(z\) (vertical transitivity).  
- The horizontal overlap between \(x\) and \(y\), and \(y\) and \(z\), ensures overlap between \(x\) and \(z\).  
- Therefore, \(x\) is directly South of \(z\).  

No other relations (e.g., Southwest or Southeast) are possible because they require non-overlapping horizontal extents (e.g., entirely left or right), which contradicts the overlap condition from the given South relations.  

**Final Answer: South**
For r1:  South, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is South of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly below \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is East of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly to the right of \(z\).

The position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on the exact offsets:
- If \(x\) is South of \(y\) and \(y\) is East of \(z\), then \(x\) is located to the southeast, east, or south of \(z\), depending on the distances:
  - **Southeast**: If \(x\) is both significantly south and east of \(z\) (e.g., equal south and east offsets from \(z\) via \(y\)).
  - **East**: If the eastward offset dominates (e.g., \(y\) is far east of \(z\), and \(x\) is only slightly south of \(y\), placing \(x\) primarily east of \(z\)).
  - **South**: If the southward offset dominates (e.g., \(y\) is close to \(z\) eastward, but \(x\) is far south of \(y\), placing \(x\) primarily south of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **East**
- **Southeast**
- **South**

These cover all potential configurations based on the given relations. The "Bounding Box" relation is not applicable here, as the relations are directional and not about containment.
For r1:  South, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly south or within the southern sector (180° ± 22.5°) from \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is in the northwestern sector (315° ± 22.5°) from \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the composition of directions:
- The vector from \(z\) to \(y\) (Northwest) combined with the vector from \(y\) to \(x\) (South) results in a net direction from \(z\) to \(x\).
- The possible bearings from \(z\) to \(x\) fall within the range of approximately 225° to 270° (using navigation bearings where 0° is North, clockwise).

This range covers two cardinal sectors:
- **Southwest** (202.5° to 247.5°)
- **West** (247.5° to 292.5°)

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **Southwest** and **West**.

**Answer: Southwest, West**
For r1:  South, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations—region x is **South** of region y and region y is **West** of region z—the possible relations between region x and region z can vary depending on the spatial arrangement of their minimum bounding boxes (MBRs). The constraints are:
- \( \text{max\_y}(x) < \text{min\_y}(y) \) (x is South of y).
- \( \text{max\_x}(y) < \text{min\_x}(z) \) (y is West of z).

By varying the MBRs while satisfying these constraints, all nine cardinal direction relations (including bounding box overlap) are possible between x and z. Examples include:
- **Southwest (SW)**: If z is above y and x is left of z (e.g., x at [0,9]x[0,4], y at [0,9]x[5,15], z at [10,20]x[10,20]).
- **South (S)**: If z is above y and x overlaps horizontally (e.g., x at [5,15]x[0,4], y at [0,9]x[5,15], z at [10,20]x[10,20]).
- **Southeast (SE)**: If z is above y and x is right of z (e.g., x at [21,30]x[0,4], y at [0,9]x[5,15], z at [10,20]x[10,20]).
- **West (W)**: If z is below y, x is left of z, and vertical overlap (e.g., x at [0,9]x[0,4], y at [0,9]x[10,20], z at [10,20]x[0,4]).
- **Northwest (NW)**: If z is below y, x is left of z, and x is above z (e.g., x at [0,9]x[5,9], y at [0,9]x[10,20], z at [10,20]x[0,4]).
- **North (N)**: If z is below y, x is above z, and horizontal overlap (e.g., x at [5,15]x[5,9], y at [0,10]x[15,25], z at [11,20]x[0,4]).
- **Northeast (NE)**: If z is below y, x is right of z, and x is above z (e.g., x at [21,30]x[5,9], y at [0,9]x[10,20], z at [10,20]x[0,4]).
- **East (E)**: If z is below y, x is right of z, and vertical overlap (e.g., x at [21,30]x[0,4], y at [0,9]x[10,20], z at [10,20]x[0,4]).
- **Bounding Box (B)**: If x and z overlap in both directions (e.g., x at [5,15]x[0,4], y at [0,9]x[10,20], z at [10,20]x[0,4]).

Thus, all relations are possible.

**Possible relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**
For r1:  South, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly south of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is southwest of \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the relative positions. Considering the displacements:

- \(y\) is southwest of \(z\), so \(y\) is both west and south of \(z\).
- \(x\) is south of \(y\), so \(x\) is further south from \(y\) without changing the east-west position relative to \(y\).

The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) combines:
- The westward component from \(z\) to \(y\).
- The southward components from \(z\) to \(y\) and then from \(y\) to \(x\).

This results in \(x\) being:
- West and south of \(z\), but the exact direction depends on the ratio of the southward to westward displacements.

Possible relations:
1. **West**: If the southward displacement is small compared to the westward displacement (angle from west is less than 22.5°).
2. **Southwest**: If the southward and westward displacements are comparable (angle from west is between 22.5° and 67.5°).
3. **South**: If the southward displacement is large compared to the westward displacement (angle from west is greater than 67.5°).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **West**, **Southwest**, and **South**.

**Answer**: West, Southwest, South
For r1:  South, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) lies entirely below \(y\) (i.e., every point in \(x\) is south of every point in \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) completely encloses \(z\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely within \(y\)).

Since \(z\) is inside \(y\) and \(x\) is entirely south of \(y\), \(x\) must be entirely south of \(z\). However, the east-west positioning of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is not constrained by the given relations. Therefore, \(x\) can be:

- **South** of \(z\) if the projections of \(x\) and \(z\) on the east-west axis overlap.
- **Southeast** of \(z\) if \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) lies to the southeast).
- **Southwest** of \(z\) if \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) lies to the southwest).

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **South**, **Southeast**, and **Southwest**.

**Final Answer:**  
South, Southeast, Southwest
For r1:  East, r2: North, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

The possible relations between region x and region z can be derived from the composition of these relations, considering the relative positions and potential overlaps in bounding boxes. The possible relations are:

- **Northeast**: This occurs when x is entirely north and entirely east of z. For example, if y is directly north of z and x is directly east of y, x is northeast of z.
- **North**: This occurs when x is entirely north of z but not entirely east (i.e., there is overlap in the x-direction). For instance, if y is north of z and x is east of y but close to z in the x-direction, x may be north of z with x-overlap.
- **East**: This occurs when x is entirely east of z but not entirely north (i.e., there is overlap in the y-direction). For example, if y is north of z and x is east of y but at a similar y-coordinate to z, x may be east of z with y-overlap.
- **Bounding Box**: This occurs when there is overlap in both the x and y directions between x and z, meaning no single cardinal direction applies. For instance, if the bounding boxes of x and z overlap due to the positions and extents of the regions.

The relations Southeast, South, Northwest, West, and Southwest are not possible because:
- x cannot be south of z, as y is north of z and x is east of y, ensuring that at least part of x is north of z.
- x cannot be west of z, as x is east of y and y has an x-overlap with z, ensuring that x is east of some part of z.

Thus, the possible relations are **Northeast, North, East, and Bounding Box**.
For r1:  East, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is East of region \(y\): This means \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\), and its vertical extent is within the vertical extent of \(y\) (i.e., \(x\) is not entirely above or below \(y\) vertically, but aligned such that it lies within the north-south bounds of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is Northeast of region \(z\): This means \(y\) is entirely to the east and entirely north of \(z\).

From these, we derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal (east-west) relation**:
   - Since \(x\) is east of \(y\), the left edge of \(x\) is to the right of the right edge of \(y\): \(x_{\text{left}} > y_{\text{right}}\).
   - Since \(y\) is northeast of \(z\), the left edge of \(y\) is to the right of the right edge of \(z\): \(y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}\).
   - Combining these: \(x_{\text{left}} > y_{\text{right}} \geq y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}\), so \(x_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical (north-south) relation**:
   - Since \(x\) is east of \(y\), the vertical extent of \(x\) lies within the vertical extent of \(y\): \(y_{\text{bottom}} \leq x_{\text{bottom}} \leq x_{\text{top}} \leq y_{\text{top}}\).
   - Since \(y\) is northeast of \(z\), the bottom edge of \(y\) is above the top edge of \(z\): \(y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}\).
   - Combining these: \(x_{\text{bottom}} \geq y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}\), so \(x_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\).

Therefore, from \(z\) to \(x\), the relation is **Northeast** (entirely east and entirely north). Consequently, from \(x\) to \(z\), the inverse relation is **Southwest** (entirely west and entirely south).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), considering the directional nature, are:
- **Northeast** (if considering \(z\) to \(x\))
- **Southwest** (if considering \(x\) to \(z\))

Thus, the possible relations are **Northeast** and **Southwest**.
For r1:  East, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is East of region y: x is directly to the east of y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z: y is to the southeast of z, meaning y is east and south of z.

Considering the positions relative to z:
- Let z be the origin. Then y is located in the southeast direction (east and south).
- x is east of y, so x is further east than y and at the same latitude (no north/south change relative to y).

The vector from z to x combines:
- The southeast vector from z to y (east and south components).
- The east vector from y to x (additional east component).

Thus, the overall direction from z to x has:
- An east component (sum of the east from z to y and the additional east from y to x).
- A south component (from z to y, unchanged by the east move from y to x).

The possible directions depend on the relative magnitudes of these components:
- If the east component dominates significantly, the direction is **East**.
- If the east and south components are comparable (roughly equal), the direction is **Southeast**.
- If the south component dominates significantly, the direction is **South**.

These are the only possibilities given the constraints (east and southeast relations). Other directions (like North, Northeast, etc.) are not feasible because:
- The south component from y's position ensures no northward movement.
- The east components ensure no westward movement.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **East**, **Southeast**, and **South**.
For r1:  East, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is East of region y, meaning x is to the east of y.
- Region y is South of region z, meaning y is to the south of z, so z is north of y.

The possible relations between x and z depend on the relative positions:
- The vector from z to x involves moving south (from z to y) and then east (from y to x).
- This results in x being located in the southeast quadrant relative to z, but the exact direction can vary based on the magnitudes of the movements:
  - If the eastward movement from y to x is significantly larger than the southward movement from z to y, then x is **East** of z.
  - If the movements are comparable, then x is **Southeast** of z.
  - If the southward movement is significantly larger than the eastward movement, then x is **South** of z.

Thus, the possible relations are:
- **East** (when the eastward displacement dominates)
- **Southeast** (when displacements are balanced)
- **South** (when the southward displacement dominates)

Other cardinal directions (like North, Northeast, West, etc.) are not possible because x must be east and south of z to some degree.

**Answer:** East, Southeast, South
For r1:  East, r2:  East, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided, where region \(x\) is East of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is East of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the composition of East with East. This composition accounts for potential variations in the north-south alignment:

- **East (directly east)**: If \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are aligned such that there is no north-south deviation (e.g., all regions share the same latitude).
- **Northeast**: If \(x\) is north of \(y\) and \(y\) is north of \(z\), or if \(x\) is north of \(y\) and \(y\) is aligned with \(z\) vertically, resulting in \(x\) being northeast of \(z\).
- **Southeast**: If \(x\) is south of \(y\) and \(y\) is south of \(z\), or if \(x\) is south of \(y\) and \(y\) is aligned with \(z\) vertically, resulting in \(x\) being southeast of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are **East, Northeast, Southeast**.
For r1:  East, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **East** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\) (horizontally separated, with \(x\) to the right of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely to the northwest of \(z\) (both horizontally and vertically separated, with \(y\) above and to the left of \(z\)).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the relative positions:

1. **Horizontal relations**:
   - Since \(y\) is west of \(z\) (from \(y\) being **Northwest** of \(z\)), the entire \(y\) is left of \(z\).
   - Since \(x\) is east of \(y\), the entire \(x\) is right of \(y\).
   - This allows two possibilities for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
     - \(x\) could be west of \(z\) (if \(x\) extends leftward but not far enough to reach or pass \(z\)'s left edge).
     - \(x\) could be east of \(z\) (if \(x\) is positioned far enough to the right).

2. **Vertical relations**:
   - Since \(y\) is north of \(z\) (from \(y\) being **Northwest** of \(z\)), the entire \(y\) is above \(z\).
   - \(x\) can be:
     - North of \(z\) (if \(x\) is above \(y\) or vertically aligned with \(y\) but still above \(z\)).
     - South of \(z\) (if \(x\) is below \(y\) and positioned such that it is entirely below \(z\)).

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are the diagonal directions:

- **Northwest**: \(x\) is west and north of \(z\).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) is east and north of \(z\).
- **Southwest**: \(x\) is west and south of \(z\).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) is east and south of \(z\).

Pure cardinal directions (e.g., North, South, East, West) are not possible because the horizontal and vertical separations from \(y\) to \(z\) and \(x\) to \(y\) do not align to produce pure alignment between \(x\) and \(z\). The "Bounding Box" option does not apply here, as the relations fit the diagonal directions.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast**.
For r1:  East, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is East of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\) (i.e., the minimum longitude of \(x\) is greater than the maximum longitude of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is West of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\) (i.e., the maximum longitude of \(y\) is less than the minimum longitude of \(z\)).

This implies both \(x\) and \(z\) are east of \(y\), but there are no constraints on the relative longitudes between \(x\) and \(z\) or their latitudes. Therefore:

1. **Relative Longitude and Latitude Freedom**:
   - The longitude of \(x\) can be less than, greater than, or equal to the longitude of \(z\).
   - The latitude of \(x\) can be north, south, or equal to the latitude of \(z\).

2. **Possible Cardinal Directions**:
   - If \(x\) is west of \(z\) (longitude of \(x\) < longitude of \(z\)):
     - **Northwest** if \(x\) is north of \(z\).
     - **West** if at the same latitude.
     - **Southwest** if \(x\) is south of \(z\).
   - If \(x\) is east of \(z\) (longitude of \(x\) > longitude of \(z\)):
     - **Northeast** if \(x\) is north of \(z\).
     - **East** if at the same latitude.
     - **Southeast** if \(x\) is south of \(z\).
   - If \(x\) and \(z\) have the same longitude:
     - **North** if \(x\) is north of \(z\).
     - **South** if \(x\) is south of \(z\).

3. **Bounding Box Consideration**:
   - If the regions \(x\) and \(z\) overlap in longitude (e.g., part of \(x\) is west of \(z\) and part is east), a simple cardinal direction may not apply, and the relation might be described as a **Bounding Box** (indicating complex spatial overlap).

Thus, all eight cardinal directions and the Bounding Box are possible depending on the specific positions and extents of \(x\) and \(z\).

**Final Answer**:  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  East, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations that region x is East of region y and region y is Southwest of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the composition of cardinal directions. The analysis considers the relative positions:

- y is Southwest of z: y is south and west of z.
- x is East of y: x is east of y.

The vector from z to x combines:
- A southwest movement from z to y (negative in both x and y directions).
- An east movement from y to x (positive in the x direction, no change in y).

The resultant direction depends on the magnitudes:
1. If the eastward movement from y to x is sufficiently large compared to the westward component from z to y, x ends up southeast of z (positive x, negative y relative to z).
2. If the eastward movement balances the westward component, x is directly south of z (zero x, negative y).
3. If the eastward movement is smaller, x remains southwest of z (negative x, negative y).

Thus, the possible relations are:
- **Southeast** (x southeast of z)
- **South** (x directly south of z)
- **Southwest** (x southwest of z)

These are the only possible outcomes given the constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

**Southeast, South, Southwest**
For r1:  East, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Given that region x is East of region y and region y is Bounding Box of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are East, Northeast, and Southeast. This is because:

- Region z is entirely contained within region y (since y is the Bounding Box of z).
- Region x is East of region y, meaning x is positioned to the east of y with no significant north or south deviation relative to y.
- Depending on the vertical position of z within y, the direction from z to x can vary:
  - If z is vertically centered in y, x is East of z.
  - If z is in the northern part of y, x is Southeast of z (as x is east and south relative to z).
  - If z is in the southern part of y, x is Northeast of z (as x is east and north relative to z).

Other relations (North, South, West, Southwest, Northwest, or Bounding Box) are not possible because:
- x is always east of z due to being east of y and z being within y.
- There is no scenario where x is directly north, south, west, etc., of z without an east component.
- Bounding Box is not possible because x is disjoint from and outside y, while z is contained within y, so x cannot contain or be contained by z.

Thus, the possible relations are East, Northeast, and Southeast.
For r1:  Northwest, r2: North, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is Northwest of region y, meaning x is both north and west of y.
- Region y is North of region z, meaning y is directly north of z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by the combined displacements:

1. **North component**: Since y is north of z, and x is north of y, x is north of z.
2. **West component**: x is west of y, and y is directly north of z, so x is also west of z relative to z's position.

The exact direction from z to x depends on the ratio of the west displacement to the north displacement:
- If the west displacement is relatively small compared to the total north displacement (from z to x), the relation is **North**.
- If the west displacement is significant but not dominant, the relation is **Northwest**.

Given the constraints from the initial relations (x Northwest of y and y North of z), the possible relations between x and z are:

- **North**: When the westward shift from y to x is minimal relative to the combined northward shift from z to x.
- **Northwest**: When the westward shift is more pronounced but still within the bounds defining Northwest.

Other directions (like West) are not possible because the northward displacement from z to x is always present and significant due to the relations provided. Therefore, the possible relations are North and Northwest.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is Northwest of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is Northeast of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) is always north of \(z\) because \(y\) is north of \(z\) (from \(y\) being Northeast of \(z\)) and \(x\) is north of \(y\) (from \(x\) being Northwest of \(y\)).
- The east-west position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on the relative movements:
  - If the westward move from \(y\) to \(x\) is less than the eastward move from \(z\) to \(y\), \(x\) may be east of \(z\), leading to **East** or **Northeast**.
  - If the westward move from \(y\) to \(x\) equals the eastward move from \(z\) to \(y\), \(x\) is directly **North**.
  - If the westward move from \(y\) to \(x\) is greater than the eastward move from \(z\) to \(y\), \(x\) is west of \(z\), leading to **Northwest**.

Specific examples confirm:
- **North**: \(z = (0,0)\), \(y = (2,1)\), \(x = (0,2)\) (vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((0,2)\), North).
- **Northeast**: \(z = (0,0)\), \(y = (3,1)\), \(x = (2.5,2)\) (vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((2.5,2)\), Northeast).
- **East**: \(z = (0,0)\), \(y = (3,1)\), \(x = (2.9,1.05)\) (vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((2.9,1.05)\), slope \(\approx 0.362 < \tan(22.5^\circ) \approx 0.414\), East).
- **Northwest**: \(z = (0,0)\), \(y = (1,1)\), \(x = (-1,2)\) (vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((-1,2)\), angle \(\approx 116.57^\circ\), Northwest).

The relation **West** is not possible because the northwest constraint from \(y\) to \(x\) requires a significant north component, preventing the vector from \(z\) to \(x\) from being in the West sector (angle \(> 157.5^\circ\)).

Thus, the possible relations are **North**, **Northeast**, **East**, and **Northwest**.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is Northwest of region y: x is entirely to the west and north of y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z: y is entirely to the east and south of z, meaning z is entirely to the west and north of y (since the inverse of Southeast is Northwest).

Thus, both x and z are located in the northwest quadrant relative to y. However, their positions relative to each other can vary arbitrarily within this quadrant, as there are no direct constraints between x and z. Therefore, any cardinal direction relation or bounding box relation between x and z is possible.

The possible relations are:
- **North**: x could be directly north of z (overlapping horizontally, x above z).
- **Northeast**: x could be northeast of z (x east and north of z).
- **Southeast**: x could be southeast of z (x east and south of z).
- **South**: x could be directly south of z (overlapping horizontally, x below z).
- **East**: x could be east of z (overlapping vertically, x to the east).
- **Northwest**: x could be northwest of z (x west and north of z).
- **West**: x could be west of z (overlapping vertically, x to the west).
- **Southwest**: x could be southwest of z (x west and south of z).
- **Bounding Box**: x and z could overlap in both horizontal and vertical directions, not fitting a pure cardinal direction.

All nine relations are possible.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given relations—region x is **Northwest** of region y and region y is **South** of region z—the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived as follows:

- **Northwest** of y implies x is entirely west and north of y:  
  - x is west of y: the right edge of x is left of the left edge of y.  
  - x is north of y: the bottom edge of x is above the top edge of y.  
- **South** of z implies y is entirely south of z:  
  - y is south of z: the top edge of y is below the bottom edge of z.  
  - Horizontal overlap exists between y and z.  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical relations between x and z**:  
  - The bottom edge of x is above the top edge of y, and the top edge of y is below the bottom edge of z.  
  - Thus, x could be:  
    - Entirely above z (if the bottom edge of x is above the top edge of z) → **North**.  
    - Entirely below z (if the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z) → **South**.  
    - Vertically overlapping otherwise.  
- **Horizontal relations between x and z**:  
  - x is west of y, and y horizontally overlaps with z.  
  - Thus, x could be:  
    - Entirely west of z (if the right edge of x is left of the left edge of z) → **West**.  
    - Horizontally overlapping otherwise.  

Considering combinations:  
1. **Northwest**: If x is entirely west of z and entirely above z.  
2. **Southwest**: If x is entirely west of z and entirely below z.  
3. **North**: If x horizontally overlaps with z and is entirely above z.  
4. **South**: If x horizontally overlaps with z and is entirely below z.  
5. **West**: If x is entirely west of z and vertically overlaps with z.  
6. **Bounding Box**: If x horizontally and vertically overlaps with z such that x is inside the minimum bounding rectangle of z.  

The relations **Northeast**, **Southeast**, and **East** are impossible because x is always west of y (and thus cannot be east of z).  

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**North, South, West, Northwest, Southwest, Bounding Box**.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations—region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\)—the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints:

- **Northwest\((x, y)\)** implies:
  - \(x\) is entirely west of \(y\): the right edge of \(x\) is left of the left edge of \(y\) (\(x_{\text{max}_x} < y_{\text{min}_x}\)).
  - \(x\) is entirely north of \(y\): the bottom edge of \(x\) is above the top edge of \(y\) (\(x_{\text{min}_y} > y_{\text{max}_y}\)).
  
- **East\((y, z)\)** implies:
  - \(y\) is entirely east of \(z\): the left edge of \(y\) is right of the right edge of \(z\) (\(y_{\text{min}_x} > z_{\text{max}_x}\)).
  - Vertical overlap between \(y\) and \(z\): their \(y\)-axis projections overlap (i.e., \(\max(y_{\text{min}_y}, z_{\text{min}_y}) \leq \min(y_{\text{max}_y}, z_{\text{max}_y})\)).

Combining these, the horizontal and vertical relationships between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:

### Horizontal possibilities:
1. **West**: \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) (\(x_{\text{max}_x} < z_{\text{min}_x}\)).
2. **East**: \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) (\(x_{\text{min}_x} > z_{\text{max}_x}\)).
3. **Overlap**: Neither entirely west nor east (horizontal overlap).

### Vertical possibilities:
- Due to \(x_{\text{min}_y} > y_{\text{max}_y}\) and the vertical overlap between \(y\) and \(z\), two cases arise:
  1. **North**: \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) (\(x_{\text{min}_y} > z_{\text{max}_y}\))—occurs if \(z\)'s top is not above \(y\)'s top, or if \(x\)'s bottom is above \(z\)'s top.
  2. **Overlap**: Vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\)—occurs if \(z\)'s top is above \(y\)'s top and \(x\)'s bottom is not above \(z\)'s top.

### Resulting relations:
- **Northwest**: Horizontal **West** + vertical **North**.
- **Northeast**: Horizontal **East** + vertical **North**.
- **North**: Horizontal **Overlap** + vertical **North**.
- **West**: Horizontal **West** + vertical **Overlap**.
- **East**: Horizontal **East** + vertical **Overlap**.
- **Bounding Box**: Horizontal **Overlap** + vertical **Overlap** (not fitting any pure cardinal direction).

South, Southeast, and Southwest are impossible because \(x\) is always north of \(y\) and thus cannot be south of \(z\) (as \(z\) overlaps vertically with \(y\)).

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
North, Northeast, Northwest, East, West, Bounding Box.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

This implies:
- x is northwest of y, meaning x is north and west of y.
- y is northwest of z, meaning y is north and west of z.

Composing these relations:
- Since x is north of y and y is north of z, x must be north of z.
- Since x is west of y and y is west of z, x must be west of z.

Therefore, x is both north and west of z, which directly corresponds to the **Northwest** relation.

No other relations (such as North, West, or Bounding Box) are possible under this composition, as the combined displacement strictly places x in the northwest quadrant relative to z. Hence, the only possible relation is:

**Northwest**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\): This implies \(x\) is both north and west of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **West** of region \(z\): This implies \(y\) is directly west of \(z\), with no significant north/south displacement relative to \(z\).

The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is the sum of the vector from \(z\) to \(y\) (westward) and the vector from \(y\) to \(x\) (northwestward). Thus, \(x\) is:
- North of \(z\) (due to the north component from \(y\) to \(x\)).
- West of \(z\) (due to the west components from both \(z\) to \(y\) and \(y\) to \(x\)).

The exact direction depends on the magnitudes of these displacements:
- If the northward displacement dominates significantly, \(x\) could be **North** of \(z\).
- If the westward and northward displacements are comparable, \(x\) could be **Northwest** of \(z\).
- If the westward displacement dominates significantly, \(x\) could be **West** of \(z\).

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **North**
- **Northwest**
- **West**

These cover the scenarios where \(x\) is generally northwest of \(z\), but the specific relation varies based on the relative distances. Other directions (e.g., Northeast, East, Southwest) are not possible as they would require \(x\) to be east or south of \(z\), which contradicts the given relations. Bounding Box is not a cardinal direction relation and does not apply.

**Final Answer:**  
North, Northwest, West
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is **Northwest** of region y, meaning x is north and west of y.
- Region y is **Southwest** of region z, meaning y is south and west of z.

Considering the relative positions:
- Since y is southwest of z, y is south and west of z.
- Since x is northwest of y, x is north and west of y.

The possible positions of x relative to z are:
- **North**: If x is sufficiently far north relative to z, while remaining west.
- **Northwest**: If x is both north and west of z, with the north component dominant or balanced.
- **West**: If x is directly west of z, with no significant north/south deviation.
- **Southwest**: If x is west and south of z, as the south component from y's position may influence.
- **South**: If x is sufficiently far south relative to z, while remaining west.

These relations arise because:
- The west component is inherited (x is west of y, y is west of z → x is west of z).
- The north/south component depends on the relative magnitudes:  
  - If x's northward shift from y dominates, x may be north or northwest of z.  
  - If y's southward shift from z dominates and x is not far north of y, x may be south or southwest of z.  
  - Intermediate positions yield west.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:  
**North, Northwest, West, Southwest, South**.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is entirely north and entirely west of \(y\). Specifically:
  - The entire \(x\) is north of the northernmost point of \(y\).
  - The entire \(x\) is west of the westernmost point of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(z\). This means \(y\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing \(z\), so \(z\) is entirely within \(y\). Specifically:
  - The northernmost point of \(z\) is at most as north as the northernmost point of \(y\).
  - The southernmost point of \(z\) is at least as south as the southernmost point of \(y\).
  - The easternmost point of \(z\) is at most as east as the easternmost point of \(y\).
  - The westernmost point of \(z\) is at least as west as the westernmost point of \(y\).

Now, consider the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

- **North-south direction**: Since \(x\) is entirely north of \(y\) (i.e., the southernmost point of \(x\) is north of the northernmost point of \(y\)), and \(z\) is entirely within \(y\) (i.e., the northernmost point of \(z\) is at most as north as the northernmost point of \(y\)), it follows that the entire \(x\) is north of the entire \(z\). Specifically, the southernmost point of \(x\) is north of the northernmost point of \(z\).
- **East-west direction**: Since \(x\) is entirely west of \(y\) (i.e., the easternmost point of \(x\) is west of the westernmost point of \(y\)), and \(z\) is entirely within \(y\) (i.e., the westernmost point of \(z\) is at least as west as the westernmost point of \(y\)), it follows that the entire \(x\) is west of the entire \(z\). Specifically, the easternmost point of \(x\) is west of the westernmost point of \(z\).

Thus, \(x\) is entirely north and entirely west of \(z\), satisfying the definition of **Northwest**. This holds regardless of the specific position of \(z\) within \(y\) (e.g., even if \(z\) is in the southeast corner of \(y\), the constraints ensure \(x\) remains northwest of \(z\)).

No other cardinal direction relation is possible because:
- \(x\) cannot be south or east of \(z\) due to the north and west constraints.
- Mixed relations (e.g., Northeast, Southwest) are excluded because \(x\) is strictly north and west of \(z\).
- Direct cardinal directions (e.g., North, West) alone are insufficient as both conditions must hold simultaneously.

Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **Northwest**.

**Answer: Northwest**
For r1:  West, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is West of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is North of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary due to the relative positions of the regions' bounding boxes. Here's a concise breakdown:

- **Horizontally**: \(x\) is west of \(y\), but \(y\) can be west, east, or overlapping with \(z\) horizontally. Thus, \(x\) can be:
  - West of \(z\) (if \(y\) is west of \(z\) or overlaps but \(x\) is left of \(z\)),
  - East of \(z\) (if \(y\) is east of \(z\) and \(x\) is right of \(z\) but still left of \(y\)),
  - Overlapping horizontally with \(z\).

- **Vertically**: \(y\) is north of \(z\), but \(x\) can be above, below, or overlapping with \(y\) vertically. Thus, \(x\) can be:
  - North of \(z\) (if \(x\) is above \(y\) or high enough),
  - South of \(z\) (if \(x\) is below \(y\) and low enough),
  - Overlapping vertically with \(z\).

Combining these, all nine cardinal and bounding box relations are possible:
- **Northwest**: \(x\) west and north of \(z\).
- **North**: \(x\) overlaps horizontally and north of \(z\).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) east and north of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) west and vertically overlaps with \(z\).
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) overlaps both horizontally and vertically with \(z\).
- **East**: \(x\) east and vertically overlaps with \(z\).
- **Southwest**: \(x\) west and south of \(z\).
- **South**: \(x\) overlaps horizontally and south of \(z\).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) east and south of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box**.
For r1:  West, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the composition of cardinal direction relations in the Double Cross model:

- Given: Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\).
- The composition of **West** and **Northeast** yields the following possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
  - **North** (if \(x\) is directly above \(z\))
  - **Northeast** (if \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\))
  - **Northwest** (if \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\))
  - **West** (if \(x\) is directly to the left of \(z\))
  - **Southwest** (if \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\), within constraints)
  - **Bounding Box** (if \(x\) and \(z\) share overlapping boundaries or are not separable into a single cardinal direction)

The relations **South**, **Southeast**, and **East** are not possible because:
- \(y\) is **Northeast** of \(z\), placing \(y\) above \(z\).
- \(x\) is **West** of \(y\), which requires \(x\) to be within the vertical range of \(y\) (aligned vertically or above/below but constrained by \(y\)'s position). Since \(y\) is above \(z\), \(x\) cannot be below \(z\) (ruling out **South** and **Southeast**), and **East** is excluded as \(x\) is left of \(y\) and cannot be purely east of \(z\) without vertical alignment issues.

**Possible relations: North, Northeast, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box**
For r1:  West, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast** of region \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the vector composition:

1. **Southeast possibility**:  
   If the westward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) is small compared to the eastward component from \(z\) to \(y\), \(x\) remains east of \(z\) and south of \(z\), resulting in **Southeast**.

2. **South possibility**:  
   If the westward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) exactly cancels the eastward component from \(z\) to \(y\), \(x\) is directly south of \(z\), resulting in **South**.

3. **Southwest possibility**:  
   If the westward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) is large enough to make \(x\) west of \(z\), and the southward component dominates, \(x\) is southwest of \(z\), resulting in **Southwest**.

4. **West possibility**:  
   If the westward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) is very large, making the eastward component negligible, and the resulting vector aligns within the west sector, \(x\) is west of \(z\), resulting in **West**.

The composition of **West** and **Southeast** yields these possibilities. Other relations like North, Northeast, East, or Northwest are not feasible given the constraints, as the movements do not allow \(x\) to be north or east of \(z\) overall. Bounding Box is not applicable here as directional relations exist.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:  
**Southeast, South, West, Southwest**.
For r1:  West, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is West of region y: x is to the left of y.
- Region y is South of region z: y is below z.

The relative position of x with respect to z can be determined as follows:
- From z, moving to y is directly South.
- From y, moving to x is directly West.

Thus, the vector from z to x combines South and West components. The possible directions depend on the exact positions:
- If x is directly South of z (minimal West component), the relation is **South**.
- If x is directly West of z (minimal South component), the relation is **West**.
- In all other cases (non-zero South and West components), the relation is **Southwest**.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **South**
- **Southwest**
- **West**

These cover all scenarios based on the composition of the given cardinal directions.
For r1:  West, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is West of region y, meaning x is entirely to the west of y.
- Region y is East of region z, meaning z is entirely to the west of y (since y being east of z implies z is west of y).

Thus, both x and z are west of y. However, the relative positions of x and z are not specified and can vary:

1. **East-west relation between x and z**:
   - If x is west of z, then x is to the west of z.
   - If z is west of x, then x is to the east of z (since z being west of x means x is east of z).

2. **North-south relation**: The given relations do not constrain the north-south alignment. Therefore:
   - If x is west of z, the possible relations are:
     - **Northwest**: if x is north of z.
     - **West**: if x is at the same north-south level as z.
     - **Southwest**: if x is south of z.
   - If x is east of z, the possible relations are:
     - **Northeast**: if x is north of z.
     - **East**: if x is at the same north-south level as z.
     - **Southeast**: if x is south of z.

Given that both scenarios (x west of z or x east of z) are possible and the north-south positions are unconstrained, the possible relations between x and z include all combinations except:
- **North** or **South**: These require the same east-west position (which is not possible here, as x and z must differ in east-west due to the strict west/east relations given).
- **Bounding Box**: This implies containment or exact overlap, which is not indicated by the relations.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**Northwest, West, Southwest, Northeast, East, Southeast**.
For r1:  West, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region x is West of region y: x is entirely to the west of y, with vertical overlap (i.e., the minimum y-boundary of x ≤ maximum y-boundary of y and maximum y-boundary of x ≥ minimum y-boundary of y).
- Region y is Northwest of region z: y is entirely to the northwest of z, meaning y is entirely to the west (maximum x-boundary of y < minimum x-boundary of z) and entirely to the north (minimum y-boundary of y > maximum y-boundary of z).

Combining these:
- x is entirely to the west of z: maximum x-boundary of x < minimum x-boundary of z (since x is west of y and y is west of z).
- For the vertical relation between x and z:
  - If the minimum y-boundary of x > maximum y-boundary of z, then x is entirely north of z, resulting in the **Northwest** relation.
  - Otherwise, if there is vertical overlap (minimum y-boundary of x ≤ maximum y-boundary of z and maximum y-boundary of x ≥ minimum y-boundary of z), then the relation is **West**.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are **Northwest** and **West**.  
Final answer:  
Northwest, West
For r1:  West, r2:  West, answer: Given that region x is West of region y and region y is West of region z, the possible relations between x and z are derived from the constraints:

- **x is West of y**: The entire x is to the left of y (x's right boundary < y's left boundary), and their y-projections overlap (positive length).
- **y is West of z**: The entire y is to the left of z (y's right boundary < z's left boundary), and their y-projections overlap.

Thus, x is to the left of z (x's right boundary < z's left boundary). The relation between x and z depends on their y-projections:

1. **West**: If the y-projections of x and z overlap (positive length), then x is directly West of z.
2. **Northwest**: If the entire x is above z (x's bottom y-coordinate > z's top y-coordinate), then x is Northwest of z.
3. **Southwest**: If the entire x is below z (x's top y-coordinate < z's bottom y-coordinate), then x is Southwest of z.

No other cardinal relations are possible because x is always to the left of z, and the y-positions determine the vertical component (overlap for West, above for Northwest, below for Southwest). The "Bounding Box" relation does not apply as it implies non-directional containment, which conflicts with the left alignment.

Thus, the possible relations are: **West, Northwest, Southwest**.
For r1:  West, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is to the west of \(y\) (primarily horizontal, with no significant north/south deviation).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is to the southwest of \(z\) (south and west of \(z\)).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Since \(y\) is southwest of \(z\), \(z\) is northeast of \(y\).
- \(x\) is west of \(y\), so \(x\) is west relative to \(y\)'s position.
- Combining these:
  - The vector from \(z\) to \(y\) is southwest (south and west components).
  - The vector from \(y\) to \(x\) is west (additional west component, no north/south change).
- The total displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) has:
  - A south component (from \(z\) to \(y\)).
  - A west component (sum of west from \(z\) to \(y\) and west from \(y\) to \(x\)).

This results in \(x\) being located southwest or west of \(z\), depending on the magnitudes:
- **Southwest**: If the south component is significant relative to the west component, placing \(x\) in the southwest sector relative to \(z\) (bearing between 202.5° and 247.5°).
- **West**: If the west component dominates (e.g., large westward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) compared to the southward movement from \(z\) to \(y\)), the bearing may fall into the west sector (247.5° to 292.5°), even though there is a south component. Specifically, when the west component is sufficiently large, the direction is classified as **West** in the 8-direction system.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Southwest** and **West**. The relation **South** is not possible because there is always a west component, and **Bounding Box** is not required as the relations are specific.

**Possible relations:**
- Southwest
- West
For r1:  West, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **West** of region y, meaning the entire x lies to the west of y (i.e., the rightmost point of x is left of the leftmost point of y).
- Region y is the **Bounding Box** of region z, meaning z is entirely contained within the minimum bounding rectangle of y.

The possible relations between x and z are derived as follows:

1. **Horizontal Constraint**: Since x is west of y and z is within y's bounding box, the left boundary of z is at least as far east as the left boundary of y. Thus, the entire x remains west of z (rightmost x < leftmost z). Therefore, x cannot be east, northeast, or southeast of z.

2. **Vertical Possibilities**: The vertical position of x relative to y's bounding box (and thus z) can vary:
   - If x is entirely **above** the top of y's bounding box, then x is north of z → **Northwest**.
   - If x is entirely **below** the bottom of y's bounding box, then x is south of z → **Southwest**.
   - If x **overlaps vertically** with y's bounding box, and specifically overlaps vertically with z (i.e., their y-projections intersect), then x is directly **West** of z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northwest** (if x is north and west of z)
- **West** (if x is west of z with vertical overlap)
- **Southwest** (if x is south and west of z)

Other relations (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Bounding Box) are not possible given the constraints.

**Possible relations**: Northwest, West, Southwest.
For r1:  Southwest, r2: North, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is Southwest of region \(y\): \(x\) is both south and west of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\): \(z\) is south of \(y\).

The composition of these relations yields possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

- **Northwest (NW)**: \(x\) could be northwest of \(z\) if \(x\) is north and west of \(z\). This occurs when \(z\) is directly south or southeast of \(y\), and \(x\) is positioned such that it is north of \(z\) while maintaining its west position relative to \(y\).
- **West (W)**: \(x\) could be directly west of \(z\) if they share the same latitude but \(x\) is west of \(z\). This happens when \(z\) is directly south of \(y\) (same longitude as \(y\)) and \(x\) is at the same latitude as \(z\) but west of \(y\).
- **Southwest (SW)**: \(x\) could be southwest of \(z\) if \(x\) is south and west of \(z\). This is possible when \(z\) is directly south or southeast of \(y\), and \(x\) is positioned south of \(z\).
- **South (S)**: \(x\) could be directly south of \(z\) if they share the same longitude but \(x\) is south of \(z\). This occurs when \(z\) is southwest of \(y\) and \(x\) is positioned such that it is south of \(z\) with aligned longitudes.

These possibilities arise because:
- \(x\) is west and south of \(y\).
- \(z\) is south of \(y\), but its longitude relative to \(y\) is unconstrained (could be directly south, southeast, or southwest of \(y\)).
- Combining these, \(x\) can be west, southwest, south, or northwest of \(z\), depending on the relative positions.

The relations **Northeast, East, Southeast, and Bounding Box** are not possible outcomes given the constraints:
- \(x\) is west of \(y\), so it cannot be east of \(z\) in a way that yields **East, Northeast, or Southeast**.
- **Bounding Box** implies a non-cardinal relation (e.g., overlap), which is not supported here since the given relations are strict cardinal directions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **Northwest, West, Southwest, South**.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Southwest** of region \(y\): This means \(x\) is strictly south and west of \(y\). Thus, the center of \(x\) has a lower \(x\)-coordinate (west) and lower \(y\)-coordinate (south) than the center of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\): This means \(y\) is strictly north and east of \(z\). Thus, the center of \(y\) has a higher \(x\)-coordinate (east) and higher \(y\)-coordinate (north) than the center of \(z\).

Combining these:
- \(x\) is west and south of \(y\): \(x_x < y_x\) and \(x_y < y_y\).
- \(z\) is west and south of \(y\): \(z_x < y_x\) and \(z_y < y_y\) (since \(y\) is northeast of \(z\)).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the relative positions of their centers within the open quadrant defined by \(y\) (west and south of \(y\)). The possible cases are:

1. **Northwest**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) (\(x_x < z_x\)) and north of \(z\) (\(x_y > z_y\)).
2. **North**: \(x\) has the same \(x\)-coordinate as \(z\) (\(x_x = z_x\)) and is north of \(z\) (\(x_y > z_y\)).
3. **Northeast**: \(x\) is east of \(z\) (\(x_x > z_x\)) and north of \(z\) (\(x_y > z_y\)).
4. **East**: \(x\) is east of \(z\) (\(x_x > z_x\)) and has the same \(y\)-coordinate (\(x_y = z_y\)).
5. **Southeast**: \(x\) is east of \(z\) (\(x_x > z_x\)) and south of \(z\) (\(x_y < z_y\)).
6. **South**: \(x\) has the same \(x\)-coordinate as \(z\) (\(x_x = z_x\)) and is south of \(z\) (\(x_y < z_y\)).
7. **Southwest**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) (\(x_x < z_x\)) and south of \(z\) (\(x_y < z_y\)).
8. **West**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) (\(x_x < z_x\)) and has the same \(y\)-coordinate (\(x_y = z_y\)).

All eight cardinal directions are possible because the centers of \(x\) and \(z\) can be arranged in any relative position (with strict inequalities or equality in one coordinate) while still satisfying the constraints \(x_x < y_x\), \(x_y < y_y\), \(z_x < y_x\), and \(z_y < y_y\). Examples exist for each case without violating the given relations.

**Bounding Box** is not included because it typically refers to cases where regions overlap or one contains the other, which is not required here, as the relations are defined by directional constraints on centers.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

**North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest**
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **Southwest** of region y: x is south and west of y.
- Region y is **Southeast** of region z: y is south and east of z.

Considering the positions:

- **South component**:  
  - y is south of z, and x is south of y. Thus, x is south of z (further south).

- **East-West component**:  
  - y is east of z.  
  - x is west of y.  
  The relative position of x to z in the east-west direction depends on the distances:  
  - If the westward shift from y to x is **greater** than the eastward shift from z to y, x ends up **west** of z.  
  - If the westward shift from y to x is **less**, x remains **east** of z.  
  - If the shifts are **equal**, x is directly south of z (same longitude).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:

- **Southwest** (if x is west and south of z).  
- **Southeast** (if x is east and south of z).  
- **South** (if x is directly south of z).  

No other cardinal relations are possible, as x must be south of z in all cases.

**Possible relations: South, Southeast, Southwest**
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  South, answer: Given that region x is Southwest of region y and region y is South of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the composition of the directions. The vector from z to x results in a direction that can vary based on the relative distances, but it will always fall within the southwest quadrant relative to z. Specifically, x can be:

- **South** of z if the westward component is negligible compared to the southward component.
- **Southwest** of z if the westward and southward components are comparable.
- **West** of z if the southward component is negligible compared to the westward component.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and West.

**Final Answer:**  
South, Southwest, West
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  East, answer: Given that region \(x\) is **Southwest** of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the composition of directions. The vector from \(z\) to \(y\) is eastward (positive \(x\)-direction), and the vector from \(y\) to \(x\) is southwestward (negative \(x\)- and negative \(y\)-direction). Combining these:

- The resulting vector from \(z\) to \(x\) can fall into different quadrants or directions based on the relative magnitudes:
  - If the eastward component from \(z\) to \(y\) is sufficiently large compared to the southwestward component from \(y\) to \(x\), \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\) (fourth quadrant: positive \(x\), negative \(y\)).
  - If the southwestward component dominates in the negative \(y\)-direction but the \(x\)-component is negative and the angle is within the southwest sector (202.5° to 247.5°), \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\) (third quadrant, southwest sector).
  - If the resulting vector is directly southward (negative \(y\)-direction with \(x \approx 0\)) or the angle falls in the south sector (247.5° to 292.5°), \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are **Southeast**, **South**, and **Southwest**. These cover all feasible outcomes given the initial relations. No other cardinal directions or bounding box relations are applicable here. 

**Possible relations:** Southeast, South, Southwest
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is Southwest of region y, meaning x is to the south and west of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z, meaning y is to the north and west of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. **West Component**: Both relations indicate a west component. Since y is west of z, and x is west of y, x must be west of z. Thus, the west direction is inherent.

2. **North-South Component**:
   - y is north of z (from y being Northwest of z).
   - x is south of y (from x being Southwest of y).
   - The net north-south position of x relative to z depends on the relative distances:
     - If the southward shift from y to x is less than the northward shift from z to y, then x is north of z → **Northwest**.
     - If the southward shift equals the northward shift, then x is directly west of z → **West**.
     - If the southward shift is greater, then x is south of z → **Southwest**.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- **Northwest** (when x is northwest of z)
- **West** (when x is directly west of z)
- **Southwest** (when x is southwest of z)

These cover all scenarios based on the relative distances in the north-south direction. No other cardinal directions (e.g., North, East, Southeast) or the bounding box are possible, as the west component is fixed and the north-south variations are confined to the three cases above.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  West, answer: Given the relations:
- Region x is Southwest of region y: This means x is to the southwest of y, implying x is both south and west of y.
- Region y is West of region z: This means y is directly west of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z:
1. **Vector Analysis**: 
   - From z to y: Movement purely west (negative x-direction, no change in y).
   - From y to x: Movement southwest (negative x-direction and negative y-direction).
   - Total displacement from z to x: Combined movement in the west and south directions. The exact direction depends on the relative distances:
     - If the southward movement from y to x is dominant, x could be south of z.
     - If the westward components (from both steps) are comparable to the southward, x could be southwest of z.
     - If the westward movement dominates (e.g., large west step from z to y and a small south component from y to x), x could be west of z.

2. **Direction Cones (based on 8 cardinal directions)**:
   - The angle from z to x, measured clockwise from north, can range between 180° (south) and 270° (west), depending on the vector sums:
     - **South (S)**: 157.5° to 202.5° (occurs if the south component is strong).
     - **Southwest (SW)**: 202.5° to 247.5° (occurs with balanced south and west components).
     - **West (W)**: 247.5° to 292.5° (occurs if the west component dominates).

3. **Composition of Relations**:
   - The composition of Southwest (x to y) and West (y to z) can result in x being directly south, southwest, or west of z. This aligns with the continuous range of possible angles.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **South, Southwest, and West**.

**Answer: South, Southwest, West**
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction composition rules, if region x is Southwest of region y and region y is Southwest of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are:

- **Southwest (SW)**: If the combined directional vectors align such that x is distinctly southwest of z.
- **South (S)**: If the westward component is relatively weak compared to the southward components, making x primarily south of z.
- **West (W)**: If the southward component is relatively weak compared to the westward components, making x primarily west of z.

These possibilities arise due to variations in the relative positions and magnitudes of the directional vectors. The composition of two Southwest relations can yield these outcomes, as per standard spatial reasoning models.

**Possible relations**: Southwest, South, West.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is **Southwest** of region y, meaning x is entirely to the south and west of y.
- Region y is the **Bounding Box** of region z, meaning z is entirely contained within the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of y, so z is spatially inside y.

Since z is inside y and x is **Southwest** of y:
- Every part of x is south of every part of y, and thus south of every part of z (since z ⊆ y).
- Every part of x is west of every part of y, and thus west of every part of z (since z ⊆ y).

Therefore, x must be **Southwest** of z. No other cardinal direction relation is possible because:
- x cannot be north, east, or in any direction that contradicts being strictly south and west of z.
- The **Bounding Box** relation for y and z ensures z is entirely within y, leaving no room for x to be in a different direction relative to z.

**Possible relation between x and z: Southwest**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is the minimal rectangle containing \(y\). Thus, \(x\) shares the same northern, southern, eastern, and western boundaries as \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **North** of region \(z\), meaning the entire \(y\) lies north of \(z\) (i.e., the southern boundary of \(y\) is north of the northern boundary of \(z\)).

Since \(x\) is the bounding box of \(y\), the southern boundary of \(x\) (which matches \(y\)'s southern boundary) is also north of \(z\)'s northern boundary. Therefore, the entire \(x\) lies north of \(z\). However, the east-west relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the horizontal alignment of \(y\) relative to \(z\), which is not constrained by the given relations. This leads to three possible scenarios:

1. **North**: If the horizontal projections of \(x\) (and thus \(y\)) overlap with \(z\) in the east-west direction (e.g., \(x\) extends over part of \(z\)'s width), then \(x\) is directly **North** of \(z\).
2. **Northeast**: If \(x\) (and \(y\)) lies entirely to the east of \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
3. **Northwest**: If \(x\) (and \(y\)) lies entirely to the west of \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).

No other cardinal relations are possible because \(x\) must be entirely north of \(z\) due to the **North** relation between \(y\) and \(z\) and the bounding box property. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **North**, **Northeast**, and **Northwest**.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Northeast, answer: Given that region x is the Bounding Box of region y, x is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that entirely contains y. This means the boundaries of x are defined by the extreme points of y: the northernmost, southernmost, easternmost, and westernmost points of y form the edges of x.

Region y is Northeast of region z, meaning:
- Every point in y is north of (above) the northernmost point of z.
- Every point in y is east of (to the right of) the easternmost point of z.

Considering the relationship between x and z:
- The southern boundary of x is the southernmost point of y. Since every point in y is north of the northernmost point of z, the southern boundary of x (which is part of y) is also north of the entire z. Thus, the entire x is north of z.
- The western boundary of x is the westernmost point of y. Since every point in y is east of the easternmost point of z, the western boundary of x (which is part of y) is also east of the entire z. Thus, the entire x is east of z.

Therefore, x is both north and east of z, satisfying the definition of Northeast. No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., North, East, etc.) or Bounding Box is possible because:
- x is entirely above and to the right of z, ruling out any overlap or other directional relations.
- x is not necessarily the minimal bounding box of z, so Bounding Box does not apply.

The only possible relation is **Northeast**. 

**Answer: Northeast**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Southeast, answer: Given that region \(x\) is the bounding box of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is southeast of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is analyzed as follows:

- Since \(y\) is southeast of \(z\), \(z\) must be northwest of \(y\).
- \(x\) is the bounding box of \(y\), meaning \(x\) has the same minimum and maximum coordinates as \(y\) in both the east-west and north-south directions.
- Therefore, relative to \(z\), \(x\) is also southeast of \(z\) because:
  - \(x\) is at least as far east as \(y\) (since they share the same eastern boundary), satisfying the "east" component.
  - \(x\) is at least as far south as \(y\) (since they share the same southern boundary), satisfying the "south" component.
- Thus, \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., north, northeast, south, east, northwest, west, southwest) or the bounding box relation are possible, as \(z\) cannot be inside \(x\) (since \(z\) is northwest of \(y\) and \(x\) only encloses \(y\)) and the directional constraints are fixed.

The possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **Southeast**.

\boxed{\text{Southeast}}
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  South, answer: Given that region x is the bounding box of region y and region y is directly south of region z, the spatial relationship between x and z must be consistent with the following constraints:

- Since x is the bounding box of y, the bounding box of x is identical to that of y. This means that the minimum and maximum coordinates (in both x and y directions) of x are the same as those of y.
- Since y is directly south of z, the entire region y is positioned south of z with no east-west offset. Specifically:
  - The maximum y-coordinate (northern edge) of y is less than the minimum y-coordinate (southern edge) of z (i.e., y is completely below z in the north-south direction).
  - The x-projections of y and z overlap, meaning there is alignment in the east-west direction (i.e., y is directly south, not southeast or southwest).

Given that x shares the same bounding box as y:
- The maximum y-coordinate of x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z, so x is also completely below z in the north-south direction.
- The x-projections of x and z are identical to those of y and z, so they overlap, indicating direct south alignment.

Therefore, the only possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is **South**. No other relations (such as Southeast, Southwest, or Bounding Box) are possible under these constraints, as they would require different spatial alignments (e.g., an east-west offset or containment, which is not the case here).

**Possible relation: South**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing \(y\). Thus, \(y\) is entirely within \(x\).
- Region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) lies entirely to the east of \(z\) (i.e., the entire \(y\) is to the east of the entire \(z\)).

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **East component**: Since \(y\) is entirely within \(x\) and \(y\) is east of \(z\), \(x\) must also be entirely east of \(z\). This is because the western boundary of \(x\) (which coincides with the westernmost point of \(y\)) is east of the eastern boundary of \(z\) (as \(y\) is east of \(z\)). Thus, \(x\) is **East** of \(z\) in all cases.

2. **North-South component**: The vertical (north-south) relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) is unconstrained:
   - If \(x\) is entirely **north** of \(z\) (i.e., the southern boundary of \(x\) is above the northern boundary of \(z\)), then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
   - If \(x\) is entirely **south** of \(z\) (i.e., the northern boundary of \(x\) is below the southern boundary of \(z\)), then \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).
   - If there is vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\) (i.e., their north-south projections overlap), then only the east-west separation applies, so \(x\) is **East** of \(z\).

### Possible Relations:
- **East**: Always true due to the east constraint.
- **Northeast**: Possible if \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\).
- **Southeast**: Possible if \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\).

### Excluded Relations:
- **North**, **South**, **Northwest**, **Southwest**, **West**: Cannot occur because \(x\) is east of \(z\) (west is impossible), and north/south alone would ignore the east constraint.
- **Bounding Box**: Not a directional relation between \(x\) and \(z\); it only applies to \(x\) and \(y\).

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **East**, **Northeast**, and **Southeast**.

**Answer: East, Northeast, Southeast**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that entirely contains \(y\). Thus, \(y\) lies completely within \(x\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely to the north and west of \(z\). Specifically:
  - The entire region \(y\) is above (north of) the northernmost point of \(z\).
  - The entire region \(y\) is to the left (west of) the westernmost point of \(z\).

Given these:
- Since \(y\) is northwest of \(z\), all parts of \(y\) are north and west of \(z\).
- The bounding box \(x\) of \(y\) extends to the edges of \(y\) but no further (by definition of minimal bounding box). Therefore:
  - The southern boundary of \(x\) is determined by the southernmost point of \(y\). Since \(y\) is entirely north of \(z\), this southern boundary of \(x\) must also be north of the northernmost point of \(z\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\).
  - The eastern boundary of \(x\) is determined by the easternmost point of \(y\). Since \(y\) is entirely west of \(z\), this eastern boundary of \(x\) must also be west of the westernmost point of \(z\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\).

Combining these, \(x\) is entirely **north and west** of \(z\), which corresponds to the cardinal direction **Northwest**.

No other relations are possible because:
- **Bounding Box** would require \(z\) to be inside \(x\), but \(z\) is southeast of \(y\) (hence outside \(x\)).
- Other directions (e.g., North, West alone) are incomplete, as both north and west conditions hold simultaneously, and **Northwest** is the appropriate combined relation.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **Northwest**.

**Answer: Northwest**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle enclosing \(y\). Thus, the horizontal and vertical extents of \(x\) match the extremes of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **West** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\). Specifically, the rightmost point of \(y\) (which is also the right boundary of \(x\)) is to the left of the leftmost point of \(z\).

Given this:
- The entire region \(x\) must be to the left of \(z\) because its right boundary (same as \(y\)'s right boundary) is left of \(z\)'s left boundary. Thus, \(x\) is horizontally west of \(z\).
- The vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) is not constrained by the given relations. Therefore, three scenarios are possible:

  1. **If \(x\) is entirely above \(z\)**:  
     - The bottom of \(x\) is above the top of \(z\).  
     - This results in \(x\) being **Northwest** of \(z\).

  2. **If \(x\) is entirely within the vertical range of \(z\)**:  
     - The top of \(x\) is at or below the top of \(z\), and the bottom of \(x\) is at or above the bottom of \(z\).  
     - Since \(x\) is horizontally west and vertically aligned, \(x\) is **West** of \(z\).

  3. **If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)**:  
     - The top of \(x\) is below the bottom of \(z\).  
     - This results in \(x\) being **Southwest** of \(z\).

No other cardinal relations are possible because \(x\) must always be west of \(z\) horizontally, and the vertical position can only lead to Northwest, West, or Southwest.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
- **Northwest**  
- **West**  
- **Southwest**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is the bounding box of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) minimally encloses \(y\), so \(y\) is entirely within \(x\).
- Region \(y\) is southwest of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely to the southwest of \(z\). This implies:
  - The maximum x-coordinate of \(y\) is less than the minimum x-coordinate of \(z\) (west condition).
  - The maximum y-coordinate of \(y\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\) (south condition).

Since \(x\) is the bounding box of \(y\), it extends at least to the boundaries of \(y\). However, \(x\) can extend beyond \(y\) in any direction. Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on how \(x\) extends relative to \(z\):

- **Southwest (SW) is always possible**: If \(x\) does not extend beyond the southwest position of \(y\), then \(x\) remains entirely southwest of \(z\).
- **South (S) is possible**: If \(x\) extends horizontally to overlap with \(z\)'s west-east bounds but remains entirely south of \(z\) (i.e., the entire \(x\) is below \(z\)).
- **Southeast (SE) is possible**: If \(x\) extends eastward beyond \(z\)'s east boundary while remaining south of \(z\).
- **West (W) is possible**: If \(x\) extends vertically into \(z\)'s north-south bounds but remains entirely west of \(z\).
- **Northwest (NW) is possible**: If \(x\) extends westward and northward, covering areas west and north of \(z\) (but still contains \(y\) southwest).
- **North (N) is possible**: If \(x\) extends far north, potentially covering areas north of \(z\).
- **Northeast (NE) is possible**: If \(x\) extends eastward and northward, covering areas east and north of \(z\).
- **East (E) is possible**: If \(x\) extends eastward into or beyond \(z\)'s east boundary while overlapping vertically.

The bounding box relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is not necessarily true, as \(x\) may not minimally enclose \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) could extend beyond \(x\) or not be fully contained). Thus, "Bounding Box" is not a possible relation.

Given that the extension of \(x\) can be in any direction while still containing \(y\) (which is southwest of \(z\)), all cardinal directions except "Bounding Box" are possible for the relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Possible relations**: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Given that region x is the bounding box of region y, and region y is the bounding box of region z, the following holds:

- The bounding box of a region is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that completely contains it.
- Since y is the bounding box of z, the bounding box of y (which is the same as the bounding box of its own bounding box) is y itself.
- Therefore, x, being the bounding box of y, must be exactly equal to y (as the bounding box of a rectangle is the rectangle itself).
- Thus, x = y, and since y is the bounding box of z, x must also be the bounding box of z.

Consequently, the only possible relation between region x and region z is **Bounding Box**, as x contains z entirely within its minimal bounding rectangle, and x is that rectangle. No other cardinal direction relation applies, as z is not positioned exclusively in any specific direction relative to x (like North, Northeast, etc.), but is contained within x.

**Answer: Bounding Box**
