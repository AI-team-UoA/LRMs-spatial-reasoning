PROMPT: Let  South and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:
- Region x is South of region y, meaning x is directly south of y (same longitude, lower latitude).
- Region y is Northwest of region z, meaning y is northwest of z (north and west relative to z).

To determine the possible relations between x and z:
- Since y is northwest of z, moving south from y (to reach x) keeps x west of z (same longitude as y, which is west of z).
- The north-south position of x relative to z depends on the distances:
  - If x remains north of z (e.g., y is far enough north and the south movement is small), then x is **Northwest** of z (west and north).
  - If x is at the same latitude as z (e.g., south movement from y exactly reaches z's latitude), then x is **West** of z (same latitude, west).
  - If x moves south beyond z (e.g., significant south movement), then x is **Southwest** of z (west and south).

Other relations are not possible because:
- **North**, **South**, **East**, **Northeast**, **Southeast** require specific alignments (e.g., East would require x to be east of z, but x is west due to y's position).
- **Bounding Box** is not a direct cardinal relation and does not apply here.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **Southwest**
