PROMPT: Let  East and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **East** of region y: This means the entire x is to the east of y, so the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y: \( \text{min}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(y) \).
- Region y is the **Bounding Box** of region z: This means y is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing z, so the x and y extents of z are within y:  
  \( \text{min}_x(y) \leq \text{min}_x(z) \leq \text{max}_x(z) \leq \text{max}_x(y) \) and  
  \( \text{min}_y(y) \leq \text{min}_y(z) \leq \text{max}_y(z) \leq \text{max}_y(y) \).

From these, we derive the relation between x and z:

1. **Horizontal relation (x to z)**:  
   \( \text{min}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(y) \geq \text{max}_x(z) \) (since z is inside y).  
   Thus, \( \text{min}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(z) \), meaning x is entirely to the east of z horizontally.

2. **Vertical relation (y-axis)**:  
   The vertical position of x relative to z can vary because:
   - The vertical extent of z is within y: \( [\text{min}_y(z), \text{max}_y(z)] \subseteq [\text{min}_y(y), \text{max}_y(y)] \).
   - The East relation between x and y requires vertical overlap between x and y, but this does not guarantee vertical overlap with z. Specifically:
     - If the vertical intervals of x and z **overlap**, then x is **East** of z.
     - If x is entirely **above** z (i.e., \( \text{min}_y(x) > \text{max}_y(z) \)), then x is **Northeast** of z.
     - If x is entirely **below** z (i.e., \( \text{max}_y(x) < \text{min}_y(z) \)), then x is **Southeast** of z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **East**, **Northeast**, or **Southeast**. Other relations (like North, South, West, etc.) are not possible due to the horizontal east constraint.

**Final Answer: East, Northeast, Southeast**
