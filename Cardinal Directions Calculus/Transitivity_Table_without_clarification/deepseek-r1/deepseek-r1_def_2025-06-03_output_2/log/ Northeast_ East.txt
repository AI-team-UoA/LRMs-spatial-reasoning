PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\). Specifically, the entire region \(x\) lies in the northeast tile relative to \(y\)'s minimum bounding rectangle (MBR), so \(x\) is strictly east and north of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is strictly east of \(z\) and vertically within the same band as \(z\)'s MBR (i.e., \(y\) does not extend above or below \(z\)).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the vertical displacement of \(x\) relative to \(z\):

1. **Northeast**: If the bottom edge of \(x\) (\(x_{\text{south}}\)) is strictly above the top edge of \(z\) (\(z_{\text{north}}\)), then \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) and east of \(z\) (since \(x\) is east of \(y\) and \(y\) is east of \(z\), implying \(x\) is east of \(z\)). Thus, \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
   
2. **East**: If the entire region \(x\) is vertically within the band defined by \(z_{\text{south}}\) and \(z_{\text{north}}\) (i.e., \(x_{\text{south}} \geq z_{\text{south}}\) and \(x_{\text{north}} \leq z_{\text{north}}\)), and since \(x\) is east of \(z\), then \(x\) is **East** of \(z\). This occurs when the northward displacement from \(y\) to \(x\) is insufficient to push \(x\) above \(z\).

3. **Bounding Box**: If \(x\) extends above \(z_{\text{north}}\) but starts within \(z\)'s vertical band (i.e., \(x_{\text{south}} \leq z_{\text{north}}\) and \(x_{\text{north}} > z_{\text{north}}\)), then \(x\) spans both the **East** and **Northeast** tiles of \(z\). This multi-tile relation is not captured by a single cardinal direction and is classified as **Bounding Box**.

No other cardinal relations (e.g., North, Southeast, etc.) are possible because:
- \(x\) is always east of \(z\) (due to \(x\) being east of \(y\) and \(y\) east of \(z\)).
- \(x\) cannot be south of \(z\) because \(x\) is north of \(y\) and \(y\) is within \(z\)'s vertical band, so \(x\) starts at or above \(z\)'s bottom edge.

Thus, the possible relations are **Northeast**, **East**, and **Bounding Box**.
