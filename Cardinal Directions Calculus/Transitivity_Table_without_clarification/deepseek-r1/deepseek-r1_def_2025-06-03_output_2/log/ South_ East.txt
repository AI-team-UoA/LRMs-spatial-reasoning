PROMPT: Let  South and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is South of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is East of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:

- **Southeast**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely below the minimum vertical extent of \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\)). For example, if \(z\) spans vertically from 0 to 10, and \(x\) spans vertically from -5 to -1, then \(x\) is to the southeast of \(z\).
- **East**: This occurs when there is vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\), and the horizontal position of \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\)). For example, if \(z\) spans vertically from 0 to 10, and \(x\) spans vertically from 2 to 4 (overlapping vertically with \(z\)), and \(x\) is east of \(z\), then the relation is East.

These are the only possible relations, as \(x\) must be east of \(z\) due to \(y\) being east of \(z\) and \(x\) being horizontally constrained by \(y\)'s extent. Vertical positioning relative to \(z\) determines whether it is Southeast or East.

**Answer: East, Southeast**
