PROMPT: Let  South and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region x is South of region y, meaning x is entirely south of y with overlapping horizontal projections (longitude).
- Region y is South of region z, meaning y is entirely south of z with overlapping horizontal projections.

The relation between x and z must satisfy that x is entirely south of z, as the north-south relation is transitive. However, the horizontal projection (east-west) between x and z may vary:

1. **South**: If the horizontal projections of x and z overlap, then x is directly South of z.
2. **Southeast**: If the horizontal projection of x is entirely east of z (no overlap, and x is east of z), then x is Southeast of z.
3. **Southwest**: If the horizontal projection of x is entirely west of z (no overlap, and x is west of z), then x is Southwest of z.

These are the only possible relations, as the vertical (south) constraint is fixed, but the horizontal alignment can lead to the three scenarios. Other cardinal directions (e.g., North, East, West) or Bounding Box are not possible given the transitive south relation.

**Possible relations between x and z: South, Southeast, Southwest.**
