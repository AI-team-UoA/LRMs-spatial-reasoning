PROMPT: Let  West and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided, where region x is West of region y and region y is West of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are derived as follows:

- The longitude of x is less than that of y, and the longitude of y is less than that of z. Thus, the longitude of x is less than that of z, meaning x is west of z in terms of east-west positioning.
- The latitude (north-south positioning) between x and z is not constrained by the given relations. Therefore:
  - If x is at the same latitude as z, the relation is **West**.
  - If x is north of z, the relation is **Northwest**.
  - If x is south of z, the relation is **Southwest**.

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are **West, Northwest, Southwest**.
