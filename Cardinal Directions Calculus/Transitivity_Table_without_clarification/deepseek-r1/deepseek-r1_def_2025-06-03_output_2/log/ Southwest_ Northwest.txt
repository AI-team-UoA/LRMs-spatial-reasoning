PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region x is Southwest of region y: x is entirely to the west (maxx_x < minx_y) and south (maxy_x < miny_y) of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z: y is entirely to the west (maxx_y < minx_z) and north (miny_y > maxy_z) of z.

From the west relations:
- maxx_x < minx_y (from x Southwest of y)
- maxx_y < minx_z (from y Northwest of z)
Since minx_y ≤ maxx_y (by bounding box properties), it follows that maxx_x < minx_y ≤ maxx_y < minx_z, so maxx_x < minx_z. Thus, x is entirely to the west of z.

For the north-south relation between x and z:
- From x Southwest of y: maxy_x < miny_y.
- From y Northwest of z: miny_y > maxy_z, so maxy_z < miny_y.
However, there is no direct constraint between the vertical positions of x and z. Possible scenarios:
1. **x is entirely north of z (miny_x > maxy_z)**: This satisfies the condition for Northwest between x and z.
2. **x is entirely south of z (maxy_x < miny_z)**: This satisfies the condition for Southwest between x and z.
3. **Vertical overlap (neither miny_x > maxy_z nor maxy_x < miny_z)**: Then x is only to the west of z, resulting in a West relation.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northwest** (if x is north of z)
- **Southwest** (if x is south of z)
- **West** (if there is vertical overlap)

No other cardinal directions are possible because x is always west of z, and the vertical relation varies. The answer does not include "Bounding Box" as the relations are covered by the cardinal directions.

**Possible relations: Northwest, Southwest, West**
