PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is Southwest of region y: this means x is located in the southwest direction relative to y.
- Region y is West of region z: this means y is located in the west direction relative to z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the composition of these directions. The vector from z to x is the sum of the vector from z to y (west direction) and the vector from y to x (southwest direction). Analyzing the possible combined directions:

- The west direction (from z to y) can be represented by angles in the compass sector [247.5°, 292.5°].
- The southwest direction (from y to x) can be represented by angles in the compass sector [202.5°, 247.5°].

The resulting vector from z to x can fall into one of the following compass sectors, depending on the specific angles and magnitudes:
- **South (S)**: compass angles [157.5°, 202.5°]. This can occur when the combined vector has a strong south component (e.g., if the west vector has a southward tilt and the southwest vector is oriented more southward).
- **Southwest (SW)**: compass angles [202.5°, 247.5°]. This is a direct combination, such as when both vectors contribute to a southwest resultant.
- **West (W)**: compass angles [247.5°, 292.5°]. This can happen when the west vector dominates or when the southwest vector has a westward tilt.

Thus, the possible relations for x relative to z are that x could be **South**, **Southwest**, or **West** of z.

**Answer: South, Southwest, West**
