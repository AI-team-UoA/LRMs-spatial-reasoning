PROMPT: Let  Bounding Box and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Bounding Box of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that completely encloses \(y\). Thus, the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of \(x\) is identical to the MBR of \(y\):  
  - \(\text{min}_x(x) = \text{min}_x(y)\), \(\text{max}_x(x) = \text{max}_x(y)\),  
  - \(\text{min}_y(x) = \text{min}_y(y)\), \(\text{max}_y(x) = \text{max}_y(y)\).  

- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), which requires:  
  - The entire MBR of \(y\) is to the **west** of \(z\): \(\text{max}_x(y) < \text{min}_x(z)\),  
  - The entire MBR of \(y\) is to the **north** of \(z\): \(\text{min}_y(y) > \text{max}_y(z)\).  

Since \(x\) shares the same MBR as \(y\):  
- \(\text{max}_x(x) = \text{max}_x(y) < \text{min}_x(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\).  
- \(\text{min}_y(x) = \text{min}_y(y) > \text{max}_y(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\).  

Thus, \(x\) is entirely within the **Northwest** sector relative to \(z\). Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **Northwest**.
