PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- **Region x is Northwest of region y**: This means x is entirely to the northwest of y's bounding box. Specifically:
  - The entire x lies west of the western boundary of y (i.e., the maximum x-coordinate of x ≤ the minimum x-coordinate of y).
  - The entire x lies north of the northern boundary of y (i.e., the minimum y-coordinate of x ≥ the maximum y-coordinate of y).

- **Region y is the Bounding Box of region z**: This means y is the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of z. Thus, z is entirely contained within y:
  - The minimum x-coordinate of z ≥ the minimum x-coordinate of y.
  - The maximum x-coordinate of z ≤ the maximum x-coordinate of y.
  - The minimum y-coordinate of z ≥ the minimum y-coordinate of y.
  - The maximum y-coordinate of z ≤ the maximum y-coordinate of y.

**Deriving the relation between x and z**:
1. **West component**:
   - From x being west of y: max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y).
   - From z contained in y: min_x(z) ≥ min_x(y).
   - Combining: max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z).
   - Thus, the entire x lies west of the western boundary of z (i.e., x is west of z).

2. **North component**:
   - From x being north of y: min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y).
   - From z contained in y: max_y(z) ≤ max_y(y).
   - Combining: min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y) ≥ max_y(z).
   - Thus, the entire x lies north of the northern boundary of z (i.e., x is north of z).

Combining the west and north components, x must be **Northwest** of z. No other cardinal direction (e.g., North alone or West alone) fully satisfies both conditions simultaneously, and x cannot be the bounding box of z since x lies entirely outside z.

**Possible relation**:  
Northwest
