PROMPT: Let  Southeast and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region x is Southeast (SE) of region y, meaning x is entirely to the southeast of y (east and south of y).
- Region y is South (S) of region z, meaning y is entirely south of z and their horizontal projections overlap.

The possible relations between x and z are determined as follows:

1. **Vertical Component**: Since y is south of z and x is southeast of y, x must be south of z. Specifically, the top boundary of x is below the bottom boundary of z.
2. **Horizontal Component**:
   - **Case 1**: If the horizontal projections of x and z overlap, then x is directly south of z (S relation). This occurs when the western boundary of x is less than or equal to the eastern boundary of z.
   - **Case 2**: If x is entirely to the east of z (no horizontal overlap), then x is southeast of z (SE relation). This occurs when the western boundary of x is greater than the eastern boundary of z.

The horizontal position of x relative to z depends on the specific boundaries:
- x is east of y (from SE relation), and y horizontally overlaps with z (from S relation). Thus, x cannot be west of z, ruling out relations like West, Southwest, or Northwest.
- Given the vertical constraint (x south of z), relations like North, Northeast, or East are impossible.

Therefore, the only possible relations are:
- **South (S)**: When x and z have horizontal overlap.
- **Southeast (SE)**: When x is entirely east of z with no horizontal overlap.

The relations Bounding Box, North, Northeast, East, Southwest, West, and Northwest are not possible.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **South** and **Southeast**.

**Answer: South, Southeast**
