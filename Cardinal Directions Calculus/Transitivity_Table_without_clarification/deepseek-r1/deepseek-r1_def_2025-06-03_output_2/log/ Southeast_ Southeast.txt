PROMPT: Let  Southeast and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the composition of cardinal direction relations, if region x is Southeast of region y and region y is Southeast of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the combined directional vectors. The Southeast direction involves both east and south components. When composing two Southeast relations:

- The resulting direction depends on the relative magnitudes of the east and south components of the displacements.
- If the east components dominate, the relation may be **East**.
- If the south components dominate, the relation may be **South**.
- If the components are balanced, the relation remains **Southeast**.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are **East**, **South**, and **Southeast**. 

**Answer: East, South, Southeast**
