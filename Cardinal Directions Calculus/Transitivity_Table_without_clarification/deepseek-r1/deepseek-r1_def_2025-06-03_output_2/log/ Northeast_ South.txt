PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\), meaning \(z\) is directly north of \(y\) (aligned vertically, same east-west position).

Considering the positions:
- Let \(y\) be at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- Since \(y\) is South of \(z\), \(z\) is at \((0, d_1)\) where \(d_1 > 0\) (north of \(y\)).
- Since \(x\) is Northeast of \(y\), \(x\) is at \((d_2, d_3)\) where \(d_2 > 0\) (east) and \(d_3 > 0\) (north).

The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((d_2 - 0, d_3 - d_1) = (d_2, d_3 - d_1)\). Since \(d_2 > 0\):
- If \(d_3 > d_1\), then \(d_3 - d_1 > 0\), so \(x\) is **north and east** of \(z\) → **Northeast**.
- If \(d_3 = d_1\), then \(d_3 - d_1 = 0\), so \(x\) is directly **east** of \(z\) → **East**.
- If \(d_3 < d_1\), then \(d_3 - d_1 < 0\), so \(x\) is **south and east** of \(z\) → **Southeast**.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northeast, East, and Southeast**. Other directions (e.g., North, South, West, Southwest, Northwest) are not possible because \(x\) is always east of \(z\) (due to \(d_2 > 0\) and the vertical alignment of \(y\) and \(z\)).

**Answer: Northeast, East, Southeast**
