PROMPT: Let  East and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **East** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\).

Using standard composition rules for cardinal directions in the 8-direction model (considering cones of influence and typical composition tables):

- The composition of **East** and **Northwest** yields possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) as **North**, **Northwest**, or **West**.

### Explanation:
- **Northwest** of \(z\) means \(y\) is northwest relative to \(z\) (i.e., \(y\) is north and west of \(z\)).
- **East** of \(y\) means \(x\) is directly east of \(y\) (within the eastern cone).
- When composing these:
  - If \(x\) is slightly east of \(y\), it may align north of \(z\) (if \(x\) is near \(y\)'s longitude but north).
  - If \(x\) is moderately east of \(y\), it may remain northwest of \(z\) (if \(x\) is still west of \(z\) but north).
  - If \(x\) is minimally east of \(y\) (not moving far east), it may end up west of \(z\) (if \(y\) was far west of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **North**
- **Northwest**
- **West**

No other relations (e.g., East, Northeast, South, etc.) are possible under the standard composition, as the constraints from the given relations limit the outcomes to these three.

**Answer: North, Northwest, West**
