PROMPT: Let North and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is South of region z, which implies region z is North of region y.

Both regions x and z are positioned North relative to region y. The relative direction between x and z can vary depending on their exact positions. Possible relations from x to z include:

- **North**: If z is further North than x (x is between y and z in the North-South line, same longitude).
- **South**: If x is further North than z (z is between x and y in the North-South line, same longitude).
- **East**: If z is East of x (same latitude).
- **West**: If z is West of x (same latitude).
- **Northeast**: If z is Northeast of x (z is North and East of x).
- **Southeast**: If z is Southeast of x (z is South and East of x).
- **Northwest**: If z is Northwest of x (z is North and West of x).
- **Southwest**: If z is Southwest of x (z is South and West of x).

All eight cardinal directions are possible because the positions of x and z relative to each other are not constrained beyond both being North of y. For example:
- **Northeast**: x at (0,1), z at (1,2) relative to y at (0,0).
- **Southeast**: x at (0,2), z at (1,1) relative to y.
- **Northwest**: x at (1,1), z at (0,2) relative to y.
- **Southwest**: x at (1,2), z at (0,1) relative to y.
- **North/South/East/West**: Aligned examples as described.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:  
**North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest**.  

Note: "Bounding Box" is not required as the relations fit the cardinal directions.
