PROMPT: Let North and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:  
- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\).  
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\).  

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be derived as follows:  
- **North**: If \(x\) is directly aligned above \(z\) (no horizontal shift).  
- **Northeast**: If \(x\) is shifted to the east relative to \(z\) (entirely above and to the east).  
- **Northwest**: If \(x\) is shifted to the west relative to \(z\) (entirely above and to the west).  

These arise because the horizontal alignment of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is not constrained by the given relations. Thus, the possible relations are **North**, **Northeast**, and **Northwest**.  

**Answer**: North, Northeast, Northwest
