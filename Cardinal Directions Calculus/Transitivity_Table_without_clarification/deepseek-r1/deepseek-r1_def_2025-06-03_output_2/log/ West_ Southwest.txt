PROMPT: Let  West and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\): This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(y\) (i.e., \(x\)'s eastern boundary is west of \(y\)'s western boundary), and there is overlap in their north-south projection.
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\): This means \(y\) is entirely to the southwest of \(z\) (i.e., \(y\)'s eastern boundary is west of \(z\)'s western boundary, and \(y\)'s northern boundary is south of \(z\)'s southern boundary).

The composition of these relations results in two possible scenarios for the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Southwest**: If \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\)'s northern boundary is south of \(z\)'s southern boundary) in addition to being west, then \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).
2. **West**: If \(x\) overlaps with \(z\) in the north-south projection (i.e., their vertical extents intersect) while remaining west, then \(x\) is west of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as \(x\) must be west of \(z\) due to the transitive west displacement, but the north-south positioning relative to \(z\) depends on the vertical extent of \(x\) relative to \(z\)'s southern boundary.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **Southwest** and **West**.
