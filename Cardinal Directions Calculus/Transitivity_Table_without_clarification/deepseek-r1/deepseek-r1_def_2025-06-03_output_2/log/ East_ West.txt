PROMPT: Let  East and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- Region x is East of region y, meaning x is entirely to the east of y (specifically, the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y).
- Region y is West of region z, meaning y is entirely to the west of z (specifically, the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z).

This implies both x and z are east of y, but there are no constraints on their relative positions in the north-south direction or their exact longitudinal alignment. Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z can be any of the eight cardinal directions or the bounding box case (indicating overlap or indeterminate direction). Here are the possibilities:

- **East**: If z is entirely to the east of x (z's minimum x-coordinate > x's maximum x-coordinate), then z is East of x.
- **West**: If z is entirely to the west of x (z's maximum x-coordinate < x's minimum x-coordinate), then z is West of x.
- **North**: If z is entirely to the north of x (z's minimum y-coordinate > x's maximum y-coordinate) and their x-coordinates overlap.
- **South**: If z is entirely to the south of x (z's maximum y-coordinate < x's minimum y-coordinate) and their x-coordinates overlap.
- **Northeast**: If z is entirely to the east and north of x (z's minimum x-coordinate > x's maximum x-coordinate and z's minimum y-coordinate > x's maximum y-coordinate).
- **Southeast**: If z is entirely to the east and south of x (z's minimum x-coordinate > x's maximum x-coordinate and z's maximum y-coordinate < x's minimum y-coordinate).
- **Northwest**: If z is entirely to the west and north of x (z's maximum x-coordinate < x's minimum x-coordinate and z's minimum y-coordinate > x's maximum y-coordinate).
- **Southwest**: If z is entirely to the west and south of x (z's maximum x-coordinate < x's minimum x-coordinate and z's maximum y-coordinate < x's minimum y-coordinate).
- **Bounding Box**: If the minimum bounding rectangles of x and z overlap in both x and y directions, making no single cardinal direction relation applicable.

All nine relations are possible due to the lack of constraints between x and z beyond being east of y.

**Possible relations:**  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box
