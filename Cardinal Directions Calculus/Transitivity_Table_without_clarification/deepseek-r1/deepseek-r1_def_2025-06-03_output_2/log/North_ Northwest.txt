PROMPT: Let North and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are **North** or **Northwest**.

### Explanation:
- Since y is Northwest of z, y is both north and west of z.
- x is directly North of y, so x is north of y with no east-west change relative to y.
- Therefore, from z, x inherits the west component from y but has an increased north component due to being north of y.
- Depending on the relative distances:
  - If the north component from z to x is dominant (e.g., x is far north of y), the relation is **North**.
  - If the west and north components are comparable (e.g., x is close to y in the north direction), the relation is **Northwest**.
- It is not possible for x to be in any other cardinal direction (e.g., East, South, etc.) because x must be both north and west of z due to the relations given.

Thus, the possible relations are **North** and **Northwest**.
