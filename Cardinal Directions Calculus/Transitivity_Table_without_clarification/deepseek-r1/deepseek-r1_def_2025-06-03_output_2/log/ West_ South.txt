PROMPT: Let  West and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given—region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\)—the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the composition of these relations. Considering the constraints:

- **West** means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(y\) (horizontally), with no vertical constraint between \(x\) and \(y\).
- **South** means \(y\) is entirely below \(z\) (vertically), with no horizontal constraint between \(y\) and \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) arise from combining the horizontal and vertical positioning:
- **Horizontally**: \(x\) is left of \(y\), and \(y\) is within or spans the horizontal extent of \(z\). Thus, \(x\) can be:
  - Left of \(z\)'s left boundary (West sector).
  - Within \(z\)'s horizontal bounds (Bounding Box horizontally).
- **Vertically**: \(y\) is below \(z\), and the vertical position of \(x\) relative to \(y\) is unconstrained, so \(x\) can be:
  - Above \(z\)'s top boundary (North sector).
  - Below \(z\)'s bottom boundary (South sector).
  - Within \(z\)'s vertical bounds (Bounding Box vertically).

The composition yields the following possible relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- **Northwest** (NW): \(x\) is left and above \(z\).
- **Southwest** (SW): \(x\) is left and below \(z\).
- **West** (W): \(x\) is left of \(z\) and within its vertical bounds.
- **North** (N): \(x\) is above \(z\) and within its horizontal bounds.
- **South** (S): \(x\) is below \(z\) and within its horizontal bounds.
- **Bounding Box** (BB): \(x\) is within both horizontal and vertical bounds of \(z\).

The relations **Northeast** (NE), **East** (E), and **Southeast** (SE) are impossible because \(x\) is constrained to be left of \(y\), and \(y\) is horizontally within or aligned with \(z\)'s bounds, preventing \(x\) from being right of \(z\)'s right boundary.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**North, South, West, Northwest, Southwest, Bounding Box**.
