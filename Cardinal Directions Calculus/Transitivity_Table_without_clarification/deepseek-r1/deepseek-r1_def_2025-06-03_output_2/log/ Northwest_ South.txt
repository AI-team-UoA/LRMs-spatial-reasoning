PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(x\) is entirely west of \(y\): the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\).
  - \(x\) is entirely north of \(y\): the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(y\) is entirely south of \(z\): the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\) is less than the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\).
  - The \(x\)-projections of \(y\) and \(z\) overlap: there is some horizontal alignment between them.

From these relations, we derive possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical relations** (based on \(y\)-coordinates):
   - Since \(x\) is north of \(y\) and \(y\) is south of \(z\), the \(y\)-range of \(x\) can be:
     - **Above \(z\)**: if the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\).
     - **Below \(z\)**: if the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\).
     - **Overlapping vertically**: otherwise (partial \(y\)-overlap).

2. **Horizontal relations** (based on \(x\)-coordinates):
   - Since \(x\) is west of \(y\) and \(y\) overlaps \(z\) horizontally, the \(x\)-range of \(x\) can be:
     - **West of \(z\)**: if the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\).
     - **Overlapping horizontally**: if the \(x\)-projections of \(x\) and \(z\) overlap (due to \(z\) potentially extending west of \(y\)).

Combining these possibilities:

- If \(x\) is **above \(z\) and west of \(z\)**, then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **above \(z\) and horizontally overlapping**, then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **below \(z\) and west of \(z\)**, then \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **below \(z\) and horizontally overlapping**, then \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **vertically overlapping and west of \(z\)**, then \(x\) is **West** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **vertically and horizontally overlapping**, the MBRs overlap in both axes, so the relation is **Bounding Box** (not a strict cardinal direction).

**East, Northeast, and Southeast are not possible** because \(x\) is west of \(y\), and \(z\) overlaps \(y\) horizontally, so \(x\) cannot be east of \(z\) (the entire \(x\) lies west of \(y\)'s starting \(x\)-coordinate, preventing an eastward relation).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
**Northwest, North, Southwest, South, West, Bounding Box**.
