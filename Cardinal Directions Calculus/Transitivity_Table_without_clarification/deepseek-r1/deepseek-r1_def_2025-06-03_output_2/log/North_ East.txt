PROMPT: Let North and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly above \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is East of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly to the right of \(z\).

In a standard point-based model (commonly used for cardinal direction compositions), the position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is determined as follows:
- Moving from \(z\) to \(y\) is East (rightward).
- Moving from \(y\) to \(x\) is North (upward).

Thus, relative to \(z\), \(x\) is both North and East, resulting in the **Northeast** direction.

The possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **Northeast**.

**Answer: Northeast**
