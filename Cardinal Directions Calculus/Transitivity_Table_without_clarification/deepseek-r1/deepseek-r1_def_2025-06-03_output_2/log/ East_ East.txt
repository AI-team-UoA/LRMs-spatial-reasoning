PROMPT: Let  East and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is East of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is East of region \(z\).

The composition of two East relations results in region \(x\) being East of region \(z\). This is because:
- The East relation implies that \(x\) is positioned such that its direction from \(y\) is directly east.
- Similarly, \(y\) is directly east of \(z\).
- Transitivity in the eastward direction ensures that \(x\) is directly east of \(z\), without deviation to northeast or southeast, as the relations specify strict east alignment.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **East**.
