PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is Northwest (NW) of region \(y\). This means that from \(y\), \(x\) is in the northwest direction.
- Region \(y\) is West (W) of region \(z\). This means that from \(z\), \(y\) is directly west.

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the composition of directions:
- From \(z\), moving west to \(y\), then from \(y\), moving northwest to \(x\).
- The combined direction from \(z\) to \(x\) is the vector sum of the west and northwest vectors.

Using the mathematical representation (east as positive \(x\), north as positive \(y\)):
- West vector: \((-a, 0)\) for \(a > 0\).
- Northwest vector: \((-b, c)\) for \(b > 0\), \(c > 0\) (as northwest has components west and north).

The total displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) is:
\[
(-a - b, c)
\]
The direction is given by the angle \(\theta = \atan2(c, -a - b)\), which lies between \(90^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\) (second quadrant).

The cardinal direction sectors (based on \(45^\circ\) intervals) are:
- Northwest (NW): \(112.5^\circ\) to \(157.5^\circ\).
- West (W): \(157.5^\circ\) to \(202.5^\circ\).

Analyzing \(\theta\):
- If \(\theta < 157.5^\circ\), it falls in the NW sector.
- If \(\theta \geq 157.5^\circ\), it falls in the W sector.

This occurs because:
- When the north component \(c\) is relatively large compared to \(a + b\), \(\theta\) is smaller (closer to \(90^\circ\)), resulting in NW.
- When \(c\) is small or \(a + b\) is large, \(\theta\) is closer to \(180^\circ\), resulting in W.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **Northwest** (if the displacement angle is between \(112.5^\circ\) and \(157.5^\circ\)).
- **West** (if the displacement angle is between \(157.5^\circ\) and \(202.5^\circ\)).

No other relations (e.g., North, Southwest, etc.) are possible because \(\theta\) is confined to the range \(90^\circ\) to \(180^\circ\), which only overlaps with the NW and W sectors.

**Answer: Northwest, West**
