PROMPT: Let  West and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region x is **West** of region y: This means x is entirely to the left of y with vertical overlap (i.e., the horizontal extent of x is strictly left of y, and their vertical projections overlap).
- Region y is **Northwest** of region z: This means y is entirely to the left and entirely above z (i.e., the horizontal extent of y is strictly left of z, and the vertical extent of y is strictly above z).

Composing these relations:
- **Horizontally**: Since x is left of y and y is left of z, x must be entirely to the left of z (i.e., the horizontal condition for **West** holds between x and z).
- **Vertically**: 
  - y is entirely above z, so the bottom of y is above the top of z.
  - x has vertical overlap with y, meaning x spans above and/or below the vertical range of y.
  - Thus, the vertical relation between x and z has two cases:
    1. If the bottom of x is above the top of z (which can occur if x is entirely above z), then x is **Northwest** of z.
    2. If there is vertical overlap between x and z (which can occur if part of x is below the top of z), then x is **West** of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- **Northwest** (if x is entirely above z)
- **West** (if there is vertical overlap between x and z)

No other cardinal directions are possible given the constraints. The relation **Bounding Box** (indicating exact alignment or containment) does not apply here. 

**Answer: Northwest, West**
