PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is both south and west of \(z\), which implies \(z\) is northeast of \(y\).

Thus, both \(x\) and \(z\) are northeast of \(y\) (i.e., both have greater easting and northing coordinates than \(y\) relative to a common reference). However, the relative positions between \(x\) and \(z\) are not constrained by these relations alone. The exact directional relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their specific coordinates, and all cardinal directions are possible. Examples:

- If \(x\) has greater northing and less easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has less northing and greater easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has greater northing and greater easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has less northing and less easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has the same easting but greater northing than \(z\), then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has the same easting but less northing than \(z\), then \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has the same northing but greater easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **East** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has the same northing but less easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **West** of \(z\).

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all eight cardinal directions.

**Answer:**  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest
