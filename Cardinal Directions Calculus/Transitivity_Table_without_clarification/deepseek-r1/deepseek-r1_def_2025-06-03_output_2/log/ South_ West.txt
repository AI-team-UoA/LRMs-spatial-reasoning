PROMPT: Let  South and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations—region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is **West** of region \(z\)—the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary due to the lack of constraints on the vertical position of \(y\) relative to \(z\) and the horizontal position of \(x\) relative to \(z\). Here's the reasoning:

- **South** of \(y\) means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) (i.e., the top edge of \(x\) is below the bottom edge of \(y\): \(\text{north}_x < \text{south}_y\)).
- **West** of \(z\) means \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (i.e., the right edge of \(y\) is left of the left edge of \(z\): \(\text{east}_y < \text{west}_z\)).

The vertical position of \(y\) relative to \(z\) is unconstrained, and the horizontal position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is also unconstrained. This allows for various configurations:

1. **Vertically**, \(x\) can be:
   - **Below** \(z\) (if \(\text{north}_x < \text{south}_z\)).
   - **Overlapping** \(z\) vertically (if \(\text{south}_z \leq \text{north}_x \leq \text{north}_z\) or partial overlap).
   - **Above** \(z\) (if \(\text{south}_x > \text{north}_z\)).

2. **Horizontally**, \(x\) can be:
   - **West** of \(z\) (if \(\text{east}_x < \text{west}_z\)).
   - **Overlapping** \(z\) horizontally (if \(\text{west}_x < \text{west}_z < \text{east}_x\) or similar).
   - **East** of \(z\) (if \(\text{west}_x > \text{east}_z\)).

Combining these, all 8 cardinal directions and the **Bounding Box** (indicating overlap in both directions) are possible:

- **Southwest**: \(x\) below and west of \(z\).
- **South**: \(x\) below and horizontally overlapping with \(z\).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) below and east of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) vertically overlapping and west of \(z\).
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) vertically and horizontally overlapping with \(z\).
- **East**: \(x\) vertically overlapping and east of \(z\).
- **Northwest**: \(x\) above and west of \(z\).
- **North**: \(x\) above and horizontally overlapping with \(z\).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) above and east of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all given options.

**Answer**:  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box
