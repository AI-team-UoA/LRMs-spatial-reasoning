For r1: North, r2: North, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:  
- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\).  
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\).  

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be derived as follows:  
- **North**: If \(x\) is directly aligned above \(z\) (no horizontal shift).  
- **Northeast**: If \(x\) is shifted to the east relative to \(z\) (entirely above and to the east).  
- **Northwest**: If \(x\) is shifted to the west relative to \(z\) (entirely above and to the west).  

These arise because the horizontal alignment of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is not constrained by the given relations. Thus, the possible relations are **North**, **Northeast**, and **Northwest**.  

**Answer**: North, Northeast, Northwest
For r1: North, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\): This implies \(x\) is entirely above \(y\) with possible horizontal overlap.
- Region \(y\) is Northeast of region \(z\): This implies \(y\) is entirely above and to the east of \(z\), meaning \(y\) has no horizontal overlap with \(z\) and is positioned to the northeast.

Considering the composition:
- \(x\) is above \(y\), and \(y\) is above \(z\), so \(x\) must be above \(z\) vertically.
- Horizontally:
  - If the horizontal projection of \(x\) overlaps with that of \(z\), then \(x\) is directly **North** of \(z\).
  - If there is no horizontal overlap and \(x\) lies entirely to the east of \(z\) (since \(y\) is east of \(z\) and \(x\) must horizontally overlap with \(y\)), then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).

No other relations are possible because:
- \(x\) cannot be west of \(z\) due to the requirement that \(x\) horizontally overlaps with \(y\) (which is entirely east of \(z\)), ensuring \(x\) extends at least partially eastward.
- Other diagonal directions (e.g., Northwest, Southeast) or pure East/West are excluded by the vertical alignment and the specific positioning of \(y\) relative to \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **North** and **Northeast**.
For r1: North, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the composition of cardinal directions:
- **Northeast**: If the northward distance from y to x is large enough to place x north of z while maintaining an eastward component (since y is east of z).
- **East**: If the northward movement from y places x at the same latitude as z (y is south of z; moving north by the exact distance to reach z's latitude) but still east of z.
- **Southeast**: If the northward distance from y to x is insufficient to reach or exceed z's latitude, so x remains south of z while being east of z.

These are the only possible relations, as the eastward component from y (relative to z) is preserved, and the north-south position of x relative to z depends on the specific distances.

**Possible relations**: Northeast, East, Southeast.
For r1: North, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is South of region z, which implies region z is North of region y.

Both regions x and z are positioned North relative to region y. The relative direction between x and z can vary depending on their exact positions. Possible relations from x to z include:

- **North**: If z is further North than x (x is between y and z in the North-South line, same longitude).
- **South**: If x is further North than z (z is between x and y in the North-South line, same longitude).
- **East**: If z is East of x (same latitude).
- **West**: If z is West of x (same latitude).
- **Northeast**: If z is Northeast of x (z is North and East of x).
- **Southeast**: If z is Southeast of x (z is South and East of x).
- **Northwest**: If z is Northwest of x (z is North and West of x).
- **Southwest**: If z is Southwest of x (z is South and West of x).

All eight cardinal directions are possible because the positions of x and z relative to each other are not constrained beyond both being North of y. For example:
- **Northeast**: x at (0,1), z at (1,2) relative to y at (0,0).
- **Southeast**: x at (0,2), z at (1,1) relative to y.
- **Northwest**: x at (1,1), z at (0,2) relative to y.
- **Southwest**: x at (1,2), z at (0,1) relative to y.
- **North/South/East/West**: Aligned examples as described.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:  
**North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest**.  

Note: "Bounding Box" is not required as the relations fit the cardinal directions.
For r1: North, r2:  East, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly above \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is East of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is directly to the right of \(z\).

In a standard point-based model (commonly used for cardinal direction compositions), the position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is determined as follows:
- Moving from \(z\) to \(y\) is East (rightward).
- Moving from \(y\) to \(x\) is North (upward).

Thus, relative to \(z\), \(x\) is both North and East, resulting in the **Northeast** direction.

The possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **Northeast**.

**Answer: Northeast**
For r1: North, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are **North** or **Northwest**.

### Explanation:
- Since y is Northwest of z, y is both north and west of z.
- x is directly North of y, so x is north of y with no east-west change relative to y.
- Therefore, from z, x inherits the west component from y but has an increased north component due to being north of y.
- Depending on the relative distances:
  - If the north component from z to x is dominant (e.g., x is far north of y), the relation is **North**.
  - If the west and north components are comparable (e.g., x is close to y in the north direction), the relation is **Northwest**.
- It is not possible for x to be in any other cardinal direction (e.g., East, South, etc.) because x must be both north and west of z due to the relations given.

Thus, the possible relations are **North** and **Northwest**.
For r1: North, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely above \(y\) (i.e., the southern boundary of \(x\) is at or above the northern boundary of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is West of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\) (i.e., the eastern boundary of \(y\) is at or west of the western boundary of \(z\)).

The possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can vary due to the lack of constraints on the horizontal position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) and the vertical position of \(z\) relative to \(y\) and \(x\). Examples demonstrate that any of the nine cardinal direction relations (including Bounding Box) are possible:

- **Northwest**: \(x\) is west and north of \(z\).
- **North**: \(x\) is directly north of \(z\), with horizontal overlap.
- **Northeast**: \(x\) is east and north of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) is directly west of \(z\), with vertical overlap.
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) and \(z\) overlap in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- **East**: \(x\) is directly east of \(z\), with vertical overlap.
- **Southwest**: \(x\) is west and south of \(z\).
- **South**: \(x\) is directly south of \(z\), with horizontal overlap.
- **Southeast**: \(x\) is east and south of \(z\).

Thus, all nine relations are possible. The relations are:

**North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**
For r1: North, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is directly above \(y\) with no east-west deviation.
- Region \(y\) is Southwest of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is below and to the west of \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the positions:

1. **North component**: Since \(x\) is north of \(y\), and \(y\) is southwest of \(z\), \(z\) is northeast of \(y\). Thus, \(x\) and \(z\) are both north of \(y\), but their relative north-south positions depend on distances:
   - If \(x\) is sufficiently far north compared to \(z\), \(x\) could be north of \(z\).
   - However, \(z\) is northeast of \(y\), so \(z\) has a northern component relative to \(y\), and \(x\) is directly north of \(y\). Without knowing exact distances, \(x\) could be north, south, or at the same latitude as \(z\), but the east-west relation must also be considered.

2. **West component**: Since \(y\) is southwest of \(z\), \(y\) is west of \(z\). As \(x\) is north of \(y\), \(x\) shares the same east-west position as \(y\) (due to "North" implying no east-west shift). Thus, \(x\) is also west of \(z\).

Combining these:
- \(x\) must be west of \(z\) (since \(y\) is west of \(z\) and \(x\) is directly north of \(y\)).
- The north-south relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is variable:
  - If \(x\) is far enough north, it could be **northwest** of \(z\).
  - If \(x\) is not as far north, it could be **southwest** of \(z\).
  - If \(x\) and \(z\) are at the same latitude (vertically aligned after accounting for positions), it could be **west** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **Northwest** (if \(x\) is north and west of \(z\))
- **West** (if \(x\) is directly west of \(z\) with no north-south deviation)
- **Southwest** (if \(x\) is south and west of \(z\))

These cover all scenarios given the constraints. The relations **North**, **Northeast**, **East**, **Southeast**, **South**, and **Bounding Box** are not possible due to the west constraint and the relative positions.

**Final Answer: Northwest, West, Southwest**
For r1: North, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is North of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely above \(y\) in the north-south direction, and their horizontal projections (east-west extents) overlap.
- Region \(y\) is the Bounding Box of region \(z\), meaning \(z\) is entirely contained within \(y\), so \(z\)'s horizontal projection is a subset of \(y\)'s.

For the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

- Since \(x\) is North of \(y\) and \(z \subseteq y\), \(x\) must be entirely above \(z\) in the north-south direction (as \(z\) lies within \(y\), and \(x\) is above \(y\)).
- The horizontal projection of \(z\) is within \(y\)'s horizontal projection. Given that \(x\) and \(y\) have overlapping horizontal projections, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) in the east-west direction depends on the alignment of their horizontal extents:
  - If the horizontal projections of \(x\) and \(z\) overlap (i.e., they share some east-west extent), then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).
  - If \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\) (i.e., the entire horizontal extent of \(z\) is west of \(x\)'s horizontal extent), then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
  - If \(z\) is entirely to the east of \(x\) (i.e., the entire horizontal extent of \(z\) is east of \(x\)'s horizontal extent), then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **North**, **Northeast**, and **Northwest**. Other cardinal directions (like South, East, etc.) are not possible because \(x\) is always north of \(z\), and "Bounding Box" does not apply as \(x\) is not necessarily the bounding box of \(z\).

**Answer: North, Northeast, Northwest**
For r1:  Northeast, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely above and to the east of \(y\). Specifically, \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(y)\) and \(\min_x(x) > \max_x(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is **North** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely above \(z\) with horizontal overlap. Specifically, \(\min_y(y) > \max_y(z)\) and the horizontal projections overlap: \([\min_x(y), \max_x(y)] \cap [\min_x(z), \max_x(z)] \neq \emptyset\).

For the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Vertically, \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(y) > \max_y(z)\) (since \(\max_y(y) \geq \min_y(y) > \max_y(z)\)), so \(\min_y(x) > \max_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is above \(z\).
- Horizontally, two scenarios are possible due to the overlap between \(y\) and \(z\):
  1. If \(\max_x(z) \leq \max_x(y)\), then \(\min_x(x) > \max_x(y) \geq \max_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\), and there is no horizontal overlap. This results in **Northeast** between \(x\) and \(z\).
  2. If \(\max_x(z) > \max_x(y)\), then \(\min_x(x) > \max_x(y)\) but \(\max_x(z) > \max_x(y)\). It is possible that \(\max_x(z) \geq \min_x(x)\), leading to horizontal overlap between \(x\) and \(z\) (since \([\min_x(z), \max_x(z)]\) may intersect \([\min_x(x), \max_x(x)]\) due to the existing overlap with \(y\)). With \(x\) above \(z\) and horizontal overlap, the relation is **North**.

No other cardinal directions (e.g., East, South, etc.) are possible because \(x\) is always above \(z\), and horizontal positions are constrained by the given relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **North** and **Northeast**.

**Answer:** North, Northeast
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given, where region \(x\) is Northeast of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is Northeast of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is analyzed as follows:

- The Northeast relation implies that \(x\) is both North and East of \(y\), and similarly, \(y\) is both North and East of \(z\).
- The composition of two Northeast relations results in a combined displacement where \(x\) must lie in the Northeast quadrant relative to \(z\).
- The angle of the displacement vector from \(z\) to \(x\) falls within the range of 22.5° to 67.5° (relative to the East), which corresponds to the Northeast sector.
- For both point regions and extended regions (assuming no special cases like exact boundary alignments or overlaps that cause multiple tile occupations), the relation is consistently Northeast.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **Northeast**.

**Answer:** Northeast
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is north and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is south and east of \(z\).

The horizontal (east-west) relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is fixed: since \(y\) is east of \(z\) and \(x\) is east of \(y\), \(x\) must be east of \(z\). Therefore, the horizontal component is **East**.

The vertical (north-south) relation between \(x\) and \(z\) has three possible scenarios:
1. **Northeast (NE)**: If \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) (i.e., the minimum y-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of \(z\)).
2. **East (E)**: If there is vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\) (i.e., the vertical intervals of their MBRs overlap).
3. **Southeast (SE)**: If \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northeast**, **East**, and **Southeast**.

**Answer: Northeast, East, Southeast**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\), meaning \(z\) is directly north of \(y\) (aligned vertically, same east-west position).

Considering the positions:
- Let \(y\) be at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- Since \(y\) is South of \(z\), \(z\) is at \((0, d_1)\) where \(d_1 > 0\) (north of \(y\)).
- Since \(x\) is Northeast of \(y\), \(x\) is at \((d_2, d_3)\) where \(d_2 > 0\) (east) and \(d_3 > 0\) (north).

The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((d_2 - 0, d_3 - d_1) = (d_2, d_3 - d_1)\). Since \(d_2 > 0\):
- If \(d_3 > d_1\), then \(d_3 - d_1 > 0\), so \(x\) is **north and east** of \(z\) → **Northeast**.
- If \(d_3 = d_1\), then \(d_3 - d_1 = 0\), so \(x\) is directly **east** of \(z\) → **East**.
- If \(d_3 < d_1\), then \(d_3 - d_1 < 0\), so \(x\) is **south and east** of \(z\) → **Southeast**.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Northeast, East, and Southeast**. Other directions (e.g., North, South, West, Southwest, Northwest) are not possible because \(x\) is always east of \(z\) (due to \(d_2 > 0\) and the vertical alignment of \(y\) and \(z\)).

**Answer: Northeast, East, Southeast**
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\). Specifically, the entire region \(x\) lies in the northeast tile relative to \(y\)'s minimum bounding rectangle (MBR), so \(x\) is strictly east and north of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is strictly east of \(z\) and vertically within the same band as \(z\)'s MBR (i.e., \(y\) does not extend above or below \(z\)).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the vertical displacement of \(x\) relative to \(z\):

1. **Northeast**: If the bottom edge of \(x\) (\(x_{\text{south}}\)) is strictly above the top edge of \(z\) (\(z_{\text{north}}\)), then \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) and east of \(z\) (since \(x\) is east of \(y\) and \(y\) is east of \(z\), implying \(x\) is east of \(z\)). Thus, \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
   
2. **East**: If the entire region \(x\) is vertically within the band defined by \(z_{\text{south}}\) and \(z_{\text{north}}\) (i.e., \(x_{\text{south}} \geq z_{\text{south}}\) and \(x_{\text{north}} \leq z_{\text{north}}\)), and since \(x\) is east of \(z\), then \(x\) is **East** of \(z\). This occurs when the northward displacement from \(y\) to \(x\) is insufficient to push \(x\) above \(z\).

3. **Bounding Box**: If \(x\) extends above \(z_{\text{north}}\) but starts within \(z\)'s vertical band (i.e., \(x_{\text{south}} \leq z_{\text{north}}\) and \(x_{\text{north}} > z_{\text{north}}\)), then \(x\) spans both the **East** and **Northeast** tiles of \(z\). This multi-tile relation is not captured by a single cardinal direction and is classified as **Bounding Box**.

No other cardinal relations (e.g., North, Southeast, etc.) are possible because:
- \(x\) is always east of \(z\) (due to \(x\) being east of \(y\) and \(y\) east of \(z\)).
- \(x\) cannot be south of \(z\) because \(x\) is north of \(y\) and \(y\) is within \(z\)'s vertical band, so \(x\) starts at or above \(z\)'s bottom edge.

Thus, the possible relations are **Northeast**, **East**, and **Bounding Box**.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is both north and west of \(z\).

Considering the positions:
- \(x\) is north of \(y\), and \(y\) is north of \(z\), so \(x\) must be **north** of \(z\).
- For the east-west relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
  - \(x\) is east of \(y\), and \(y\) is west of \(z\).
  - This allows three possibilities:
    1. If \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).
    2. If \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
    3. If \(x\) and \(z\) overlap in the east-west direction (but \(x\) is still north), then \(x\) is directly **North** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **North**, **Northeast**, and **Northwest**.

**Answer:** North, Northeast, Northwest
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is Northeast of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is West of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is west of \(z\) (i.e., \(z\) is east of \(y\)).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their relative positions:
- **East-West component**: \(x\) is east of \(y\), and \(z\) is east of \(y\), but \(x\) could be west of \(z\), east of \(z\), or at the same longitude as \(z\).
- **North-South component**: \(x\) is north of \(y\), but \(z\) could be north of \(y\), south of \(y\), or at the same latitude as \(y\). Thus, \(x\) could be north of \(z\), south of \(z\), or at the same latitude as \(z\).

Considering all combinations:
- If \(x\) is west of \(z\) and north of \(z\): **Northwest**.
- If \(x\) is west of \(z\) and at the same latitude: **West**.
- If \(x\) is west of \(z\) and south of \(z\): **Southwest**.
- If \(x\) is east of \(z\) and north of \(z\): **Northeast**.
- If \(x\) is east of \(z\) and at the same latitude: **East**.
- If \(x\) is east of \(z\) and south of \(z\): **Southeast**.
- If \(x\) is at the same longitude as \(z\) and north of \(z\): **North**.
- If \(x\) is at the same longitude as \(z\) and south of \(z\): **South**.

Thus, all eight cardinal directions are possible. The answer includes:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both north and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is both south and west of \(z\), which implies \(z\) is northeast of \(y\).

Thus, both \(x\) and \(z\) are northeast of \(y\) (i.e., both have greater easting and northing coordinates than \(y\) relative to a common reference). However, the relative positions between \(x\) and \(z\) are not constrained by these relations alone. The exact directional relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their specific coordinates, and all cardinal directions are possible. Examples:

- If \(x\) has greater northing and less easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has less northing and greater easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **Southeast** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has greater northing and greater easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has less northing and less easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has the same easting but greater northing than \(z\), then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has the same easting but less northing than \(z\), then \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has the same northing but greater easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **East** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) has the same northing but less easting than \(z\), then \(x\) is **West** of \(z\).

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all eight cardinal directions.

**Answer:**  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Given that region \(x\) is **Northeast** of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is analyzed as follows:

- **Northeast** means \(x\) is entirely to the north and east of \(y\). Specifically, the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\), and the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\).
- **Bounding Box** means \(y\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle enclosing \(z\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely within \(y\), so the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\) is less than or equal to the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\), and the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\) is less than or equal to the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\).

Combining these:
- Since \(x\) is northeast of \(y\), and \(z\) is inside \(y\), \(x\) must be entirely to the east of \(z\) (because the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) exceeds the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\), which is greater than or equal to the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\)).
- Similarly, \(x\) must be entirely to the north of \(z\) (because the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) exceeds the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\), which is greater than or equal to the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\)).

Therefore, \(x\) is both north and east of \(z\), satisfying the definition of **Northeast**. No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., North, East, etc.) is possible because \(x\) must be strictly northeast relative to \(z\)'s position within \(y\).

**Possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\): Northeast**
For r1:  Southeast, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is Southeast of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is North of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by considering the net displacement:

- **East component**: Since \(x\) is Southeast of \(y\), \(x\) is east of \(y\). As \(y\) is directly North of \(z\), \(y\) has the same east-west position as \(z\). Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\).
- **North-south component**: 
  - The movement from \(z\) to \(y\) is North, increasing the north coordinate.
  - The movement from \(y\) to \(x\) is Southeast, which includes a south component, decreasing the north coordinate.
  - The net north-south displacement depends on the relative magnitudes:
    - If the north movement (\(z\) to \(y\)) is greater than the south movement (\(y\) to \(x\)), \(x\) is north of \(z\).
    - If they are equal, \(x\) is at the same latitude as \(z\).
    - If the south movement is greater, \(x\) is south of \(z\).

Combining the east component with the possible north-south components:

- **North**: When the net north component is positive and the east component is very small, the bearing from \(z\) to \(x\) falls in the North sector (0° to 22.5° from north).
- **Northeast**: When the net north component is positive and the east component is significant, placing the bearing between 22.5° and 67.5°.
- **East**: When the net north component is zero, so \(x\) is directly east of \(z\) (bearing 90°).
- **Southeast**: When the net south component is positive and the east component is significant, bearing between 112.5° and 157.5°.
- **South**: When the net south component is positive and the east component is very small, bearing between 157.5° and 202.5°.

Thus, the possible relations are North, Northeast, East, Southeast, and South.

**Final Answer**:  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Southeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is to the southeast relative to \(y\) (i.e., east and south of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is to the northeast relative to \(z\) (i.e., east and north of \(z\)).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Coordinate Analysis**:  
   - Place \(z\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).  
   - Since \(y\) is northeast of \(z\), \(y\) is at \((a, b)\) with \(a > 0\) (east) and \(b > 0\) (north).  
   - Since \(x\) is southeast of \(y\), \(x\) is at \((a + c, b - d)\) with \(c > 0\) (east) and \(d > 0\) (south).  
   - The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((a + c, b - d)\), where \(a + c > 0\) (always eastward).

2. **Possible Relations**:  
   - **East**: If \(b - d = 0\) (no net north/south displacement), \(x\) is directly east of \(z\).  
   - **Northeast**: If \(b - d > 0\) (net north displacement), \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) (east and north).  
   - **Southeast**: If \(b - d < 0\) (net south displacement), \(x\) is southeast of \(z\) (east and south).  

3. **Constraints from Given Relations**:  
   - \(y\) being northeast of \(z\) implies \(b > 0\) and \(a > 0\).  
   - \(x\) being southeast of \(y\) implies \(d > 0\) and \(c > 0\).  
   - The net displacement in the north-south direction (\(b - d\)) can be positive, zero, or negative, leading to the three cases above.  

4. **Impossible Directions**:  
   - **North**, **South**, **Northwest**, **West**, **Southwest**: Impossible because \(x\) is always east of \(z\) (since \(a + c > 0\)).  
   - **Bounding Box**: Not applicable, as the relations are directional.  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **East**, **Northeast**, and **Southeast**.

**Final Answer**:  
East, Northeast, Southeast
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the composition of cardinal direction relations, if region x is Southeast of region y and region y is Southeast of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the combined directional vectors. The Southeast direction involves both east and south components. When composing two Southeast relations:

- The resulting direction depends on the relative magnitudes of the east and south components of the displacements.
- If the east components dominate, the relation may be **East**.
- If the south components dominate, the relation may be **South**.
- If the components are balanced, the relation remains **Southeast**.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are **East**, **South**, and **Southeast**. 

**Answer: East, South, Southeast**
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is Southeast (SE) of region y, meaning x is entirely to the southeast of y (east and south of y).
- Region y is South (S) of region z, meaning y is entirely south of z and their horizontal projections overlap.

The possible relations between x and z are determined as follows:

1. **Vertical Component**: Since y is south of z and x is southeast of y, x must be south of z. Specifically, the top boundary of x is below the bottom boundary of z.
2. **Horizontal Component**:
   - **Case 1**: If the horizontal projections of x and z overlap, then x is directly south of z (S relation). This occurs when the western boundary of x is less than or equal to the eastern boundary of z.
   - **Case 2**: If x is entirely to the east of z (no horizontal overlap), then x is southeast of z (SE relation). This occurs when the western boundary of x is greater than the eastern boundary of z.

The horizontal position of x relative to z depends on the specific boundaries:
- x is east of y (from SE relation), and y horizontally overlaps with z (from S relation). Thus, x cannot be west of z, ruling out relations like West, Southwest, or Northwest.
- Given the vertical constraint (x south of z), relations like North, Northeast, or East are impossible.

Therefore, the only possible relations are:
- **South (S)**: When x and z have horizontal overlap.
- **Southeast (SE)**: When x is entirely east of z with no horizontal overlap.

The relations Bounding Box, North, Northeast, East, Southwest, West, and Northwest are not possible.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **South** and **Southeast**.

**Answer: South, Southeast**
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  East, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **Southeast** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **East** of region \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the composition of these directions. The displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) involves:
- An eastward movement from \(z\) to \(y\).
- A southeast movement from \(y\) to \(x\) (which combines east and south components).

The resultant direction from \(z\) to \(x\) depends on the relative magnitudes of these movements:
- If the eastward component from \(z\) to \(y\) dominates, the direction may fall within the **East** sector (bearing approximately 67.5° to 112.5°).
- If the southeast movement from \(y\) to \(x\) has a significant south component, the direction may fall within the **Southeast** sector (bearing approximately 112.5° to 157.5°).

Given the variability, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **East** and **Southeast**. Other directions (like South or Northeast) are not possible, as the combined displacement always has a non-zero east component and cannot align purely south or deviate northeast.

**Answer: East, Southeast**
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given relations—region x is Southeast of region y, and region y is Northwest of region z—the possible relations between region x and region z can vary depending on the relative positions. Using the composition of cardinal directions:

- **Southeast (SE)** of y means x is south and east of y.
- **Northwest (NW)** of z means y is north and west of z.

The net displacement from z to x depends on the magnitudes of these movements:
- The east-west component: x could be east, west, or directly aligned with z.
- The north-south component: x could be north, south, or directly aligned with z.

All nine cardinal direction relations (including Bounding Box for exact alignment) are possible:
- **Northeast**: If x is east and north of z.
- **East**: If x is directly east of z (same latitude, east longitude).
- **Southeast**: If x is east and south of z.
- **South**: If x is directly south of z (same longitude, south latitude).
- **Southwest**: If x is west and south of z.
- **West**: If x is directly west of z (same latitude, west longitude).
- **Northwest**: If x is west and north of z.
- **North**: If x is directly north of z (same longitude, north latitude).
- **Bounding Box**: If x and z coincide or share boundaries (exact position alignment).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:  
**North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box**.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is Southeast of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is West of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the relative positions. The vector analysis of the displacements shows that:

- If the eastward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) is very small compared to the westward distance between \(z\) and \(y\), \(x\) can be **West** of \(z\).
- If the eastward movement is moderate but less than the westward distance, \(x\) can be **Southwest** of \(z\).
- If the eastward movement equals the westward distance, \(x\) can be directly **South** of \(z\).
- If the eastward movement exceeds the westward distance, \(x\) can be **Southeast** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are **South**, **Southeast**, **Southwest**, and **West**. These cover all scenarios based on the magnitudes of the directional shifts.

**Possible relations:**  
- South  
- Southeast  
- Southwest  
- West
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Southeast** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is south and east of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is south and west of \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

- **South component**: Since \(y\) is south of \(z\), and \(x\) is south of \(y\), \(x\) must be south of \(z\). This implies the relation will always have a south component (i.e., cannot be north).
- **East/West component**:
  - \(y\) is west of \(z\) (from \(y\) **Southwest** of \(z\)).
  - \(x\) is east of \(y\) (from \(x\) **Southeast** of \(y\)).
  - The net horizontal displacement of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on the magnitudes:
    - If the eastward displacement of \(x\) from \(y\) is greater than the westward displacement of \(y\) from \(z\), then \(x\) is east of \(z\).
    - If the westward displacement of \(y\) from \(z\) is greater, then \(x\) is west of \(z\).
    - If they are equal, \(x\) is directly south of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **Southwest** (if \(x\) is west and south of \(z\)).
- **South** (if \(x\) is directly south of \(z\)).
- **Southeast** (if \(x\) is east and south of \(z\)).

These cover all cases based on relative displacements. No other cardinal directions (e.g., North, Northeast, etc.) or "Bounding Box" are possible because the south component is fixed.

**Final Answer**:  
Southwest, South, Southeast
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is **Southeast** of region y, meaning x is entirely to the southeast of y.
- Region y is **Bounding Box** of region z, meaning y completely surrounds z, so z is entirely contained within y.

Since z is inside y, and x is southeast of y, x must be southeast of every point in y, including all points in z. Therefore, the only possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is **Southeast**.

No other relations (e.g., East, South, etc.) are guaranteed, as the **Southeast** relation inherently implies both east and south components and consistently holds given the constraints.

**Answer: Southeast**
For r1:  South, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is South of region \(y\): This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) and horizontally within the bounding box of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\): This means \(y\) is entirely above \(z\) and horizontally within the bounding box of \(z\).

The horizontal alignment implies that \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(z\) because:
- \(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box.
- \(y\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box.
- Thus, \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box.

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the vertical positions:
1. **North**: If \(x\) is entirely above \(z\)'s bounding box. This is possible because \(x\) is below \(y\), and \(y\) is above \(z\), so \(x\) could be positioned such that its entire vertical extent is above \(z\)'s top boundary (e.g., if \(y\) is high above \(z\) and \(x\) is close to \(y\) but still above \(z\)).
2. **South**: If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)'s bounding box. This is possible if \(x\) is far below \(y\), extending below \(z\)'s bottom boundary.
3. **Bounding Box**: If \(x\) overlaps vertically with \(z\)'s bounding box (entirely within \(z\)'s vertical range). Since \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box, vertical overlap places \(x\) inside the bounding box region.

The other cardinal directions (Northeast, Southeast, East, Northwest, West, Southwest) are not possible because they require horizontal misalignment (e.g., \(x\) being to the east or west of \(z\)), but the horizontal constraints force \(x\) to be within \(z\)'s horizontal bounds.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **North**, **South**, and **Bounding Box**.
For r1:  South, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is located southward relative to \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northeast** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is northeast relative to \(z\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the composition of these directions. Moving from \(z\) to \(y\) in the **Northeast** direction and then from \(y\) to \(x\) in the **South** direction results in a net displacement that can fall into one of several directional cones relative to \(z\):

1. **East**: If the southward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) has minimal or no east-west deviation, and the net displacement places \(x\) directly east of \(z\).  
   Example: \(z\) at \((0,0)\), \(y\) at \((10,10)\), \(x\) at \((10,0)\) → vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((10,0)\), which is due east.

2. **Southeast**: If the southward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) includes an eastward component or the net displacement angles southeast.  
   Example: \(z\) at \((0,0)\), \(y\) at \((10,10)\), \(x\) at \((10,-5)\) → vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((10,-5)\), which is southeast.

3. **South**: If the southward movement from \(y\) to \(x\) is significant and the net displacement aligns southward relative to \(z\).  
   Example: \(z\) at \((0,0)\), \(y\) at \((10,10)\), \(x\) at \((5,-20)\) → vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((5,-20)\), which is south (angle ≈ \(-76^\circ\), within the south cone of \(247.5^\circ\) to \(292.5^\circ\)).

These possibilities arise because:
- The **Northeast** movement from \(z\) to \(y\) adds positive east and north components.
- The **South** movement from \(y\) to \(x\) adds a south component (negative north) with possible east-west variation within the south cone.
- The net effect can place \(x\) in the **East**, **Southeast**, or **South** direction relative to \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **East**, **Southeast**, and **South**.
For r1:  South, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **South** of region y, meaning the direction from y to x is directly south (bearing 180°).
- Region y is **Southeast** of region z, meaning the direction from z to y is southeast (bearing 135°).

Considering the positions:
- Place z at the origin (0,0).
- y is southeast of z, so y is at (a, -b) with a > 0, b > 0 (e.g., (1, -1)).
- x is south of y, so x is at (a, -b - c) with c > 0 (e.g., (1, -1 - c)).

The direction from z to x is determined by the vector (a, -b - c). The bearing θ from z to x is calculated as:
- θ = 90° - atan2(-b - c, a) degrees (mod 360), where atan2 is the two-argument arctangent.

Since a > 0 and -b - c < 0, θ ranges between 90° and 180°:
- When c is small (e.g., c = 0), θ ≈ 135° (Southeast).
- When c is large (e.g., c → ∞), θ → 180° (South).

The 8-direction compass sectors are:
- **Southeast**: 112.5° to 157.5°
- **South**: 157.5° to 202.5°

Given θ ∈ [135°, 180°]:
- If θ ≤ 157.5°, it falls in the Southeast sector.
- If θ ≥ 157.5°, it falls in the South sector.

Thus, depending on the displacement c:
- For smaller c, θ is between 135° and 157.5° → **Southeast**.
- For larger c, θ is between 157.5° and 180° → **South**.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are **Southeast** and **South**.

**Answer:** Southeast, South
For r1:  South, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region x is South of region y, meaning x is entirely south of y with overlapping horizontal projections (longitude).
- Region y is South of region z, meaning y is entirely south of z with overlapping horizontal projections.

The relation between x and z must satisfy that x is entirely south of z, as the north-south relation is transitive. However, the horizontal projection (east-west) between x and z may vary:

1. **South**: If the horizontal projections of x and z overlap, then x is directly South of z.
2. **Southeast**: If the horizontal projection of x is entirely east of z (no overlap, and x is east of z), then x is Southeast of z.
3. **Southwest**: If the horizontal projection of x is entirely west of z (no overlap, and x is west of z), then x is Southwest of z.

These are the only possible relations, as the vertical (south) constraint is fixed, but the horizontal alignment can lead to the three scenarios. Other cardinal directions (e.g., North, East, West) or Bounding Box are not possible given the transitive south relation.

**Possible relations between x and z: South, Southeast, Southwest.**
For r1:  South, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is South of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is East of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:

- **Southeast**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely below the minimum vertical extent of \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\)). For example, if \(z\) spans vertically from 0 to 10, and \(x\) spans vertically from -5 to -1, then \(x\) is to the southeast of \(z\).
- **East**: This occurs when there is vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\) (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\), and the horizontal position of \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\)). For example, if \(z\) spans vertically from 0 to 10, and \(x\) spans vertically from 2 to 4 (overlapping vertically with \(z\)), and \(x\) is east of \(z\), then the relation is East.

These are the only possible relations, as \(x\) must be east of \(z\) due to \(y\) being east of \(z\) and \(x\) being horizontally constrained by \(y\)'s extent. Vertical positioning relative to \(z\) determines whether it is Southeast or East.

**Answer: East, Southeast**
For r1:  South, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:
- Region x is South of region y, meaning x is directly south of y (same longitude, lower latitude).
- Region y is Northwest of region z, meaning y is northwest of z (north and west relative to z).

To determine the possible relations between x and z:
- Since y is northwest of z, moving south from y (to reach x) keeps x west of z (same longitude as y, which is west of z).
- The north-south position of x relative to z depends on the distances:
  - If x remains north of z (e.g., y is far enough north and the south movement is small), then x is **Northwest** of z (west and north).
  - If x is at the same latitude as z (e.g., south movement from y exactly reaches z's latitude), then x is **West** of z (same latitude, west).
  - If x moves south beyond z (e.g., significant south movement), then x is **Southwest** of z (west and south).

Other relations are not possible because:
- **North**, **South**, **East**, **Northeast**, **Southeast** require specific alignments (e.g., East would require x to be east of z, but x is west due to y's position).
- **Bounding Box** is not a direct cardinal relation and does not apply here.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **Southwest**
For r1:  South, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations—region \(x\) is **South** of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is **West** of region \(z\)—the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary due to the lack of constraints on the vertical position of \(y\) relative to \(z\) and the horizontal position of \(x\) relative to \(z\). Here's the reasoning:

- **South** of \(y\) means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) (i.e., the top edge of \(x\) is below the bottom edge of \(y\): \(\text{north}_x < \text{south}_y\)).
- **West** of \(z\) means \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (i.e., the right edge of \(y\) is left of the left edge of \(z\): \(\text{east}_y < \text{west}_z\)).

The vertical position of \(y\) relative to \(z\) is unconstrained, and the horizontal position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) is also unconstrained. This allows for various configurations:

1. **Vertically**, \(x\) can be:
   - **Below** \(z\) (if \(\text{north}_x < \text{south}_z\)).
   - **Overlapping** \(z\) vertically (if \(\text{south}_z \leq \text{north}_x \leq \text{north}_z\) or partial overlap).
   - **Above** \(z\) (if \(\text{south}_x > \text{north}_z\)).

2. **Horizontally**, \(x\) can be:
   - **West** of \(z\) (if \(\text{east}_x < \text{west}_z\)).
   - **Overlapping** \(z\) horizontally (if \(\text{west}_x < \text{west}_z < \text{east}_x\) or similar).
   - **East** of \(z\) (if \(\text{west}_x > \text{east}_z\)).

Combining these, all 8 cardinal directions and the **Bounding Box** (indicating overlap in both directions) are possible:

- **Southwest**: \(x\) below and west of \(z\).
- **South**: \(x\) below and horizontally overlapping with \(z\).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) below and east of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) vertically overlapping and west of \(z\).
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) vertically and horizontally overlapping with \(z\).
- **East**: \(x\) vertically overlapping and east of \(z\).
- **Northwest**: \(x\) above and west of \(z\).
- **North**: \(x\) above and horizontally overlapping with \(z\).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) above and east of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all given options.

**Answer**:  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  South, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region x is **South** of region y, meaning x is entirely below y in the y-coordinate.
- Region y is **Southwest** of region z, meaning y is both below and to the west of z.

Considering the y-coordinate chain:
- Since y is below z and x is below y, x must be below z. Thus, x is **South** of z.

Considering the x-coordinate possibilities:
- **Southwest**: If x is entirely to the west of z (e.g., x's maximum x-coordinate is less than z's minimum x-coordinate), then x is both west and south of z, resulting in **Southwest**.
- **Southeast**: If x is entirely to the east of z (e.g., x's minimum x-coordinate is greater than z's maximum x-coordinate), then x is both east and south of z, resulting in **Southeast**.
- **South**: If x is horizontally aligned with z (e.g., x's x-coordinates are within or overlap with z's x-range), then x is directly south of z, resulting in **South**.

The constraints do not force a single specific relation; instead, the possible relations depend on the relative horizontal positioning of x and z. Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:

- **Southwest**
- **South**
- **Southeast**

These cover all scenarios based on the given relations and the potential horizontal placements of the regions.
For r1:  South, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is **South** of region y. This means x is entirely below y, and the horizontal extent of x (east-west projection) is contained within the horizontal extent of y.
- Region y is the **Bounding Box** of region z. This means y is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that contains z, so the horizontal extent of y matches that of z (i.e., the westernmost and easternmost points of z define the west and east boundaries of y).

Since x is **South** of y:
- The entire region x lies below the southern boundary of y.
- The horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of y.

Because y is the **Bounding Box** of z:
- The southern boundary of y is determined by the southernmost point of z. Thus, the entire region z lies above or at this southern boundary (i.e., z is not below y).
- The horizontal extent of y is identical to the horizontal extent of z.

Combining these:
- x lies below the southern boundary of y, which is the same as the southern boundary of z. Therefore, x lies entirely below z.
- The horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of y, which is identical to the horizontal extent of z. Thus, the horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of z.

This configuration satisfies the definition of **South** for the relation between x and z:
- x is entirely below z.
- The horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of z.

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., Southwest, Southeast) are possible because:
- **Southwest** would require x to be both below and to the west of z, but the horizontal extent of x is contained within z's extent, so x cannot be entirely to the west.
- **Southeast** would require x to be below and to the east, but similarly, x's horizontal extent is contained, so it cannot be entirely to the east.
- Other directions like North, Northeast, etc., are not possible because x is below z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is **South**.

**Answer: South**
For r1:  East, r2: North, answer: Given that region \(x\) is East of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is North of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be any of the cardinal directions or require consideration of bounding boxes due to potential overlaps. Here's why:

- **East constraint**: \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\), so \(\text{min}_x(x) \geq \text{max}_x(y)\).
- **North constraint**: \(y\) is entirely north of \(z\), so \(\text{min}_y(y) \geq \text{max}_y(z)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their relative positions in both the east-west and north-south directions, which are not fully constrained by the given relations. Specifically:
- **Vertical (north-south) relation**: \(x\) can be north, south, or overlapping with \(z\) in the y-direction.
- **Horizontal (east-west) relation**: \(x\) can be east, west, or overlapping with \(z\) in the x-direction.

Combining these possibilities leads to the following potential relations:
- **North**: If \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) (\(\text{min}_y(x) \geq \text{max}_y(z)\) and horizontally overlapping or aligned.
- **Northeast**: If \(x\) is north and east of \(z\).
- **East**: If \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) (\(\text{min}_x(x) \geq \text{max}_x(z)\) and vertically overlapping or aligned.
- **Southeast**: If \(x\) is south and east of \(z\).
- **South**: If \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (\(\text{max}_y(x) \leq \text{min}_y(z)\) and horizontally overlapping or aligned.
- **Southwest**: If \(x\) is south and west of \(z\).
- **West**: If \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) (\(\text{max}_x(x) \leq \text{min}_x(z)\) and vertically overlapping or aligned.
- **Northwest**: If \(x\) is north and west of \(z\).
- **Bounding Box**: If \(x\) and \(z\) overlap in both directions (vertical and horizontal), meaning no single cardinal direction applies, requiring bounding box consideration.

Thus, all cardinal directions and the bounding box case are possible.

**Possible relations**: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  East, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region x is **East** of region y, meaning x is directly to the east of y (along the positive x-axis relative to y).
- Region y is **Northeast** of region z, meaning y is both north and east of z (in the first quadrant relative to z, with an angle between 22.5° and 67.5° from the east axis).

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. **Vector Analysis**:
   - Place z at the origin (0,0). Then y is at (a, b) where a > 0, b > 0, and the angle θ_yz = arctan(b/a) is between 22.5° and 67.5° (ensuring y is Northeast of z).
   - x is East of y, so x is at (a + c, b) for some c > 0 (moving east from y increases the x-coordinate).

2. **Vector from z to x**: (a + c, b).
   - The angle θ_xz = arctan(b / (a + c)).
   - Since c > 0, (a + c) > a, so b / (a + c) < b / a.
   - Given b/a ≤ tan(67.5°) ≈ 2.414 (upper bound for Northeast), b / (a + c) is strictly less than b/a and thus ≤ 2.414.

3. **Angle Ranges**:
   - **East**: θ_xz < 22.5° when b / (a + c) < tan(22.5°) ≈ 0.414.
   - **Northeast**: 22.5° ≤ θ_xz ≤ 67.5° when 0.414 ≤ b / (a + c) ≤ 2.414.
   - **North**: θ_xz > 67.5° would require b / (a + c) > 2.414, but b / (a + c) ≤ b/a ≤ 2.414, so this is impossible.

4. **Feasibility**:
   - **East**: Achievable if c is large enough (e.g., a=1, b=0.5, c=1 → b/(a+c)=0.25 < 0.414, θ≈14°).
   - **Northeast**: Achievable if c is small (e.g., a=1, b=1, c=0.5 → b/(a+c)≈0.67, θ≈34°; or c=0 → same as y, θ=45°).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **East** and **Northeast**.  
**North** is not possible due to the constraint b/(a+c) ≤ b/a ≤ 2.414.

**Answer**:  
East  
Northeast
For r1:  East, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is East of region y, meaning x is entirely to the east of y (min_x(x) > max_x(y)).
- Region y is Southeast of region z, meaning y is entirely to the southeast of z (min_x(y) > max_x(z) and max_y(y) < min_y(z)).

The composition of these relations leads to possible relations between x and z:
1. **East (E)**: If the vertical (north-south) positions of x and z overlap, meaning x is not entirely north or south of z, but x is entirely east of z (since min_x(x) > max_x(y) > max_x(z)).
2. **Northeast (NE)**: If x is entirely north of z (min_y(x) > max_y(z)) in addition to being east of z. This is possible because x being east of y does not constrain its vertical position relative to z; if x is sufficiently north, it can be northeast of z.
3. **Southeast (SE)**: If x is entirely south of z (max_y(x) < min_y(z)) in addition to being east of z. Since y is south of z, and if x is south of y or aligned such that it extends further south, it can be southeast of z.

The relations are derived from the bounding boxes and directional constraints:
- x must be east of z due to the transitive eastward displacement (x east of y and y east of z).
- The vertical relation depends on the north-south alignment of x relative to z, which is not fixed by the given relations, allowing for all three possibilities: overlap (East), entirely north (Northeast), or entirely south (Southeast).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: **Northeast, East, Southeast**.
For r1:  East, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is East of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is positioned to the east relative to \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is South of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is positioned to the south relative to \(z\).

To determine the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Since \(y\) is South of \(z\), \(y\) lies below \(z\).
- \(x\) is East of \(y\), so \(x\) lies to the right of \(y\).
- Combining these, \(x\) is both south and east relative to \(z\). Specifically:
  - The eastward position of \(x\) relative to \(y\) extends eastward from \(z\) (since \(y\) is directly south of \(z\)).
  - The southward position of \(y\) relative to \(z\) means \(x\) shares this southward displacement from \(z\) (as \(x\) is at the same latitude as \(y\)).

This results in \(x\) being **Southeast** of \(z\). The directional relation is consistently Southeast, as the east and south components are definite and non-overlapping.

**Possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\): Southeast.**
For r1:  East, r2:  East, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is East of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is East of region \(z\).

The composition of two East relations results in region \(x\) being East of region \(z\). This is because:
- The East relation implies that \(x\) is positioned such that its direction from \(y\) is directly east.
- Similarly, \(y\) is directly east of \(z\).
- Transitivity in the eastward direction ensures that \(x\) is directly east of \(z\), without deviation to northeast or southeast, as the relations specify strict east alignment.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **East**.

**Answer: East**
For r1:  East, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **East** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\).

Using standard composition rules for cardinal directions in the 8-direction model (considering cones of influence and typical composition tables):

- The composition of **East** and **Northwest** yields possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) as **North**, **Northwest**, or **West**.

### Explanation:
- **Northwest** of \(z\) means \(y\) is northwest relative to \(z\) (i.e., \(y\) is north and west of \(z\)).
- **East** of \(y\) means \(x\) is directly east of \(y\) (within the eastern cone).
- When composing these:
  - If \(x\) is slightly east of \(y\), it may align north of \(z\) (if \(x\) is near \(y\)'s longitude but north).
  - If \(x\) is moderately east of \(y\), it may remain northwest of \(z\) (if \(x\) is still west of \(z\) but north).
  - If \(x\) is minimally east of \(y\) (not moving far east), it may end up west of \(z\) (if \(y\) was far west of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **North**
- **Northwest**
- **West**

No other relations (e.g., East, Northeast, South, etc.) are possible under the standard composition, as the constraints from the given relations limit the outcomes to these three.

**Answer: North, Northwest, West**
For r1:  East, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is East of region y, meaning x is entirely to the east of y (specifically, the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y).
- Region y is West of region z, meaning y is entirely to the west of z (specifically, the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z).

This implies both x and z are east of y, but there are no constraints on their relative positions in the north-south direction or their exact longitudinal alignment. Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z can be any of the eight cardinal directions or the bounding box case (indicating overlap or indeterminate direction). Here are the possibilities:

- **East**: If z is entirely to the east of x (z's minimum x-coordinate > x's maximum x-coordinate), then z is East of x.
- **West**: If z is entirely to the west of x (z's maximum x-coordinate < x's minimum x-coordinate), then z is West of x.
- **North**: If z is entirely to the north of x (z's minimum y-coordinate > x's maximum y-coordinate) and their x-coordinates overlap.
- **South**: If z is entirely to the south of x (z's maximum y-coordinate < x's minimum y-coordinate) and their x-coordinates overlap.
- **Northeast**: If z is entirely to the east and north of x (z's minimum x-coordinate > x's maximum x-coordinate and z's minimum y-coordinate > x's maximum y-coordinate).
- **Southeast**: If z is entirely to the east and south of x (z's minimum x-coordinate > x's maximum x-coordinate and z's maximum y-coordinate < x's minimum y-coordinate).
- **Northwest**: If z is entirely to the west and north of x (z's maximum x-coordinate < x's minimum x-coordinate and z's minimum y-coordinate > x's maximum y-coordinate).
- **Southwest**: If z is entirely to the west and south of x (z's maximum x-coordinate < x's minimum x-coordinate and z's maximum y-coordinate < x's minimum y-coordinate).
- **Bounding Box**: If the minimum bounding rectangles of x and z overlap in both x and y directions, making no single cardinal direction relation applicable.

All nine relations are possible due to the lack of constraints between x and z beyond being east of y.

**Possible relations:**  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  East, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **East** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\).

The possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) depend on the relative distances involved. By analyzing the vector composition (considering \(z\) as the origin):

- The vector from \(z\) to \(y\) is in the **Southwest** direction (approximately 225° in mathematical coordinates, equivalent to \((-a, -a)\) for some \(a > 0\)).
- The vector from \(y\) to \(x\) is in the **East** direction (approximately 0° in mathematical coordinates, equivalent to \((b, 0)\) for some \(b > 0\)).
- The net vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is \((-a + b, -a)\).

The direction of this net vector varies with \(b\) relative to \(a\):

- If \(b < a\): The net vector is in the third quadrant (negative x, negative y), resulting in **Southwest**.
- If \(b = a\): The net vector is \((0, -a)\), pointing directly **South**.
- If \(a < b < 2.414a\) (approximately): The net vector is in the fourth quadrant (positive x, negative y), with an angle between 112.5° and 157.5° geographic, resulting in **Southeast**.
- If \(b \geq 2.414a\): The net vector is almost horizontal to the east (positive x dominates), with an angle between 67.5° and 112.5° geographic, resulting in **East**.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **East**
- **Southeast**
- **South**
- **Southwest**

These cover all potential outcomes based on the distances. The answer does not include **Bounding Box** as the relations are specific directional ones.
For r1:  East, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **East** of region y: This means the entire x is to the east of y, so the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y: \( \text{min}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(y) \).
- Region y is the **Bounding Box** of region z: This means y is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing z, so the x and y extents of z are within y:  
  \( \text{min}_x(y) \leq \text{min}_x(z) \leq \text{max}_x(z) \leq \text{max}_x(y) \) and  
  \( \text{min}_y(y) \leq \text{min}_y(z) \leq \text{max}_y(z) \leq \text{max}_y(y) \).

From these, we derive the relation between x and z:

1. **Horizontal relation (x to z)**:  
   \( \text{min}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(y) \geq \text{max}_x(z) \) (since z is inside y).  
   Thus, \( \text{min}_x(x) > \text{max}_x(z) \), meaning x is entirely to the east of z horizontally.

2. **Vertical relation (y-axis)**:  
   The vertical position of x relative to z can vary because:
   - The vertical extent of z is within y: \( [\text{min}_y(z), \text{max}_y(z)] \subseteq [\text{min}_y(y), \text{max}_y(y)] \).
   - The East relation between x and y requires vertical overlap between x and y, but this does not guarantee vertical overlap with z. Specifically:
     - If the vertical intervals of x and z **overlap**, then x is **East** of z.
     - If x is entirely **above** z (i.e., \( \text{min}_y(x) > \text{max}_y(z) \)), then x is **Northeast** of z.
     - If x is entirely **below** z (i.e., \( \text{max}_y(x) < \text{min}_y(z) \)), then x is **Southeast** of z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **East**, **Northeast**, or **Southeast**. Other relations (like North, South, West, etc.) are not possible due to the horizontal east constraint.

**Final Answer: East, Northeast, Southeast**
For r1:  Northwest, r2: North, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\): This means \(x\) is positioned to the northwest relative to \(y\), implying \(x\) is both north and west of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **North** of region \(z\): This means \(y\) is directly north of \(z\), so \(z\) is south of \(y\).

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the combined effect:
- From \(z\), moving north reaches \(y\).
- From \(y\), moving northwest reaches \(x\).

The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) combines:
- The northward movement from \(z\) to \(y\) (increasing the north-south coordinate).
- The northwest movement from \(y\) to \(x\) (further increasing the north-south coordinate and decreasing the east-west coordinate, i.e., moving west).

The net displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) is:
- **North component**: Sum of the northward movements (positive).
- **West component**: Solely from the northwest movement (negative east-west, i.e., west).

The direction from \(z\) to \(x\) depends on the ratio of the west component to the north component:
- If the west component is **small** relative to the north component (e.g., slight west but mostly north), the direction is **North**.
- If the west component is **significant** relative to the north component (e.g., balanced west and north), the direction is **Northwest**.

Using the composition of cardinal directions (based on standard qualitative spatial reasoning, such as Frank's calculus):
- **North** ∘ **Northwest** = {**North**, **Northwest**}.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **North** and **Northwest**.

**Answer**: North, Northwest
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **Northwest** of region y, meaning x is north and west of y relative to their centers.
- Region y is **Northeast** of region z, meaning y is north and east of z relative to their centers.

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. **Vertical (north-south) component**:
   - y is north of z (from y Northeast of z).
   - x is north of y (from x Northwest of y).
   - Therefore, x is **north of z** in all cases.

2. **Horizontal (east-west) component**:
   - y is east of z (from y Northeast of z).
   - x is west of y (from x Northwest of y).
   - The relative position of x to z in the east-west direction depends on the distances:
     - If the west movement from y to x is **greater** than the east movement from z to y, x ends up **west** of z.
     - If the west movement from y to x is **less** than the east movement from z to y, x ends up **east** of z.
     - If the movements are **equal**, x is at the **same longitude** as z.

Combining the components:
- **North and west**: x is **Northwest** of z.
- **North and east**: x is **Northeast** of z.
- **North and no horizontal offset**: x is **North** of z.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **North, Northeast, Northwest**. Other cardinal directions (e.g., South, East, West, Southwest, Southeast) are not possible because x must be north of z. "Bounding Box" is not applicable as the relations are determined by center points.

**Possible relations**: North, Northeast, Northwest.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is west and north of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is east and south of \(z\), which implies \(z\) is northwest of \(y\).

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned northwest of \(y\) (i.e., west and north of \(y\)). However, the relative positions between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary within this quadrant. Possible arrangements include:

- \(x\) can be **north** of \(z\) (vertically aligned, \(x\) above \(z\)).
- \(x\) can be **south** of \(z\) (vertically aligned, \(x\) below \(z\)).
- \(x\) can be **east** of \(z\) (horizontally aligned, \(x\) to the right of \(z\)).
- \(x\) can be **west** of \(z\) (horizontally aligned, \(x\) to the left of \(z\)).
- Combinations of these yield diagonal relations: **Northeast**, **Southeast**, **Southwest**, **Northwest**.

Examples confirming each possibility:
- **Northwest**: \(x\) west and north of \(z\).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) east and north of \(z\).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) east and south of \(z\).
- **Southwest**: \(x\) west and south of \(z\).
- **North**: \(x\) directly north of \(z\) (overlapping horizontally).
- **South**: \(x\) directly south of \(z\) (overlapping horizontally).
- **East**: \(x\) directly east of \(z\) (overlapping vertically).
- **West**: \(x\) directly west of \(z\) (overlapping vertically).

Thus, all eight cardinal directions are possible between \(x\) and \(z\). The "Bounding Box" option is not applicable here, as the relations are well-defined cardinal directions.

\boxed{\text{North}}  
\boxed{\text{Northeast}}  
\boxed{\text{East}}  
\boxed{\text{Southeast}}  
\boxed{\text{South}}  
\boxed{\text{Southwest}}  
\boxed{\text{West}}  
\boxed{\text{Northwest}}
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  South, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(x\) is entirely west of \(y\): the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(y\).
  - \(x\) is entirely north of \(y\): the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(y\) is entirely south of \(z\): the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(y\) is less than the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\).
  - The \(x\)-projections of \(y\) and \(z\) overlap: there is some horizontal alignment between them.

From these relations, we derive possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical relations** (based on \(y\)-coordinates):
   - Since \(x\) is north of \(y\) and \(y\) is south of \(z\), the \(y\)-range of \(x\) can be:
     - **Above \(z\)**: if the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is greater than the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\).
     - **Below \(z\)**: if the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum \(y\)-coordinate of \(z\).
     - **Overlapping vertically**: otherwise (partial \(y\)-overlap).

2. **Horizontal relations** (based on \(x\)-coordinates):
   - Since \(x\) is west of \(y\) and \(y\) overlaps \(z\) horizontally, the \(x\)-range of \(x\) can be:
     - **West of \(z\)**: if the maximum \(x\)-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum \(x\)-coordinate of \(z\).
     - **Overlapping horizontally**: if the \(x\)-projections of \(x\) and \(z\) overlap (due to \(z\) potentially extending west of \(y\)).

Combining these possibilities:

- If \(x\) is **above \(z\) and west of \(z\)**, then \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **above \(z\) and horizontally overlapping**, then \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **below \(z\) and west of \(z\)**, then \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **below \(z\) and horizontally overlapping**, then \(x\) is **South** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **vertically overlapping and west of \(z\)**, then \(x\) is **West** of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is **vertically and horizontally overlapping**, the MBRs overlap in both axes, so the relation is **Bounding Box** (not a strict cardinal direction).

**East, Northeast, and Southeast are not possible** because \(x\) is west of \(y\), and \(z\) overlaps \(y\) horizontally, so \(x\) cannot be east of \(z\) (the entire \(x\) lies west of \(y\)'s starting \(x\)-coordinate, preventing an eastward relation).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
**Northwest, North, Southwest, South, West, Bounding Box**.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  East, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y, meaning x is to the northwest of y.
- Region y is East of region z, meaning y is to the east of z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the composition of these directions. Considering the spatial reasoning for regions (assuming minimal bounding boxes or point-based approximation for simplicity), the following relations are possible:

- **North**: If x is directly north of z.
- **Northeast**: If x is to the northeast of z.
- **Northwest**: If x is to the northwest of z.

These relations account for the northwest component from x to y and the east component from y to z, resulting in x being generally north of z with varying east-west offsets.

Other relations like South, Southeast, Southwest, East, and West are not possible because the north component from x being northwest of y ensures that x cannot be south of z. The Bounding Box relation is not typically considered a cardinal direction and is not applicable here, as the given relations imply no overlap between the regions.

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are North, Northeast, and Northwest.

**Final Answer: North, Northeast, Northwest**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, if region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, the relation between region x and region z must be Northwest. This is because:

- "Northwest" means x is entirely north and west of y, and y is entirely north and west of z.
- By transitivity:
  - **Vertical (north-south)**: The bottom boundary of x is at or above the top boundary of y, and the bottom boundary of y is at or above the top boundary of z. Thus, the bottom boundary of x is at or above the top boundary of z, ensuring x is north of z.
  - **Horizontal (east-west)**: The right boundary of x is at or to the left of the left boundary of y, and the right boundary of y is at or to the left of the left boundary of z. Thus, the right boundary of x is at or to the left of the left boundary of z, ensuring x is west of z.

Combining these, x is both north and west of z, which defines the **Northwest** relation. No other relations (such as North, West, or Bounding Box) are possible under the strict conditions of the cardinal direction relations provided.

**Possible relation: Northwest**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is Northwest (NW) of region \(y\). This means that from \(y\), \(x\) is in the northwest direction.
- Region \(y\) is West (W) of region \(z\). This means that from \(z\), \(y\) is directly west.

To determine the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the composition of directions:
- From \(z\), moving west to \(y\), then from \(y\), moving northwest to \(x\).
- The combined direction from \(z\) to \(x\) is the vector sum of the west and northwest vectors.

Using the mathematical representation (east as positive \(x\), north as positive \(y\)):
- West vector: \((-a, 0)\) for \(a > 0\).
- Northwest vector: \((-b, c)\) for \(b > 0\), \(c > 0\) (as northwest has components west and north).

The total displacement from \(z\) to \(x\) is:
\[
(-a - b, c)
\]
The direction is given by the angle \(\theta = \atan2(c, -a - b)\), which lies between \(90^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\) (second quadrant).

The cardinal direction sectors (based on \(45^\circ\) intervals) are:
- Northwest (NW): \(112.5^\circ\) to \(157.5^\circ\).
- West (W): \(157.5^\circ\) to \(202.5^\circ\).

Analyzing \(\theta\):
- If \(\theta < 157.5^\circ\), it falls in the NW sector.
- If \(\theta \geq 157.5^\circ\), it falls in the W sector.

This occurs because:
- When the north component \(c\) is relatively large compared to \(a + b\), \(\theta\) is smaller (closer to \(90^\circ\)), resulting in NW.
- When \(c\) is small or \(a + b\) is large, \(\theta\) is closer to \(180^\circ\), resulting in W.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **Northwest** (if the displacement angle is between \(112.5^\circ\) and \(157.5^\circ\)).
- **West** (if the displacement angle is between \(157.5^\circ\) and \(202.5^\circ\)).

No other relations (e.g., North, Southwest, etc.) are possible because \(\theta\) is confined to the range \(90^\circ\) to \(180^\circ\), which only overlaps with the NW and W sectors.

**Answer: Northwest, West**
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **Northwest** of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\).

The composition of these relations can result in multiple possible directions between \(x\) and \(z\), depending on the relative distances. The vector from \(z\) to \(x\) is derived as follows:

- From \(z\) to \(y\): Southwest (SW) direction, which has components west and south.
- From \(y\) to \(x\): Northwest (NW) direction, which has components west and north.

The combined direction from \(z\) to \(x\) is influenced by the magnitudes:
- If the northward component (from \(y\) to \(x\)) dominates, \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).
- If the southward component (from \(z\) to \(y\)) dominates, \(x\) is **Southwest** of \(z\).
- If the westward components balance such that the north/south components cancel, \(x\) is **West** of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **West**
- **Northwest**
- **Southwest**

These cover all scenarios based on distance variations. The answer does not include "Bounding Box" as it is not required.

**Answer:** West, Northwest, Southwest
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- **Region x is Northwest of region y**: This means x is entirely to the northwest of y's bounding box. Specifically:
  - The entire x lies west of the western boundary of y (i.e., the maximum x-coordinate of x ≤ the minimum x-coordinate of y).
  - The entire x lies north of the northern boundary of y (i.e., the minimum y-coordinate of x ≥ the maximum y-coordinate of y).

- **Region y is the Bounding Box of region z**: This means y is the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of z. Thus, z is entirely contained within y:
  - The minimum x-coordinate of z ≥ the minimum x-coordinate of y.
  - The maximum x-coordinate of z ≤ the maximum x-coordinate of y.
  - The minimum y-coordinate of z ≥ the minimum y-coordinate of y.
  - The maximum y-coordinate of z ≤ the maximum y-coordinate of y.

**Deriving the relation between x and z**:
1. **West component**:
   - From x being west of y: max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y).
   - From z contained in y: min_x(z) ≥ min_x(y).
   - Combining: max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z).
   - Thus, the entire x lies west of the western boundary of z (i.e., x is west of z).

2. **North component**:
   - From x being north of y: min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y).
   - From z contained in y: max_y(z) ≤ max_y(y).
   - Combining: min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y) ≥ max_y(z).
   - Thus, the entire x lies north of the northern boundary of z (i.e., x is north of z).

Combining the west and north components, x must be **Northwest** of z. No other cardinal direction (e.g., North alone or West alone) fully satisfies both conditions simultaneously, and x cannot be the bounding box of z since x lies entirely outside z.

**Possible relation**:  
Northwest
For r1:  West, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations that region x is West of region y and region y is North of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the spatial constraints:

- **Vertical Constraint**: Since y is North of z, the entire y is above z. Because x is vertically within the bounds of y (as part of the West relation), x must also be entirely above z. Thus, x cannot be South, Southeast, or Southwest relative to z.
- **Horizontal Constraint**: x is entirely to the west of y, meaning x lies left of y's left boundary. Since y is horizontally within the bounds of z, y's left boundary is at least as far right as z's left boundary. This leads to three scenarios for x relative to z:
  1. **Northwest**: If x is entirely to the left of z's left boundary, then x is both above and to the left of z.
  2. **North**: If x is horizontally within z's bounds (x's right boundary is left of y's left boundary, which is within z, and x's left boundary is within z), then x is above and horizontally inside z.
  3. **Bounding Box**: If x spans across z's left boundary (partially left of z and partially inside z horizontally), then x cannot be confined to a single cardinal tile relative to z, requiring a bounding box relation.

Thus, the possible relations are Northwest, North, and Bounding Box.

**Answer**: Northwest, North, Bounding Box
For r1:  West, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is West of region \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is Northeast of region \(z\).

The composition of West and Northeast yields the following possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **North**: This occurs when moving west from \(y\) (which is northeast of \(z\)) positions \(x\) due north of \(z\), or when the movement aligns with the north direction relative to \(z\).
2. **Northeast**: If \(y\) is northeast of \(z\) and \(x\) is slightly west of \(y\), \(x\) may still be within the northeast sector relative to \(z\).
3. **Northwest**: When moving further west from \(y\) (northeast of \(z\)) positions \(x\) in the northwest sector relative to \(z\).
4. **West**: If the westward movement from \(y\) is significant, \(x\) may be directly west of \(z\).

These possibilities arise from the relative positioning:
- \(y\) being northeast of \(z\) places \(y\) in a quadrant where both east and north components are positive relative to \(z\).
- Moving west from \(y\) reduces the east coordinate, potentially placing \(x\) in the north, northeast, northwest, or west sectors relative to \(z\), depending on the magnitude of the movement.

The relations Southeast, South, East, Southwest, and Bounding Box are not possible given the constraints.

**Possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\): North, Northeast, Northwest, West**
For r1:  West, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(y\) (left horizontally), with no vertical constraint relative to \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is **Southeast** of region \(z\). This means \(y\) is entirely to the southeast of \(z\) (east horizontally and south vertically).

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the combined effect:

- **Vertically**: \(y\) is south of \(z\), but \(x\) can be anywhere vertically relative to \(y\) (north, south, or overlapping). Thus, relative to \(z\), \(x\) could be:
  - **South** (if \(x\) is south of \(y\), inheriting the south position).
  - **North** (if \(x\) is sufficiently north of \(y\) to be above \(z\)).
  - **Overlapping vertically** (if \(x\) spans parts of \(z\)'s vertical range).

- **Horizontally**: \(y\) is east of \(z\), and \(x\) is west of \(y\). The net horizontal position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on the distances:
  - If the eastward extent of \(z\) to \(y\) is greater than the westward extent from \(y\) to \(x\), \(x\) could be **east** of \(z\).
  - If the westward extent dominates, \(x\) could be **west** of \(z\).
  - **Overlapping horizontally** is also possible if \(x\) spans \(z\)'s horizontal range.

**Possible relations**:
- **Single cardinal directions**: Depending on vertical and horizontal alignment, \(x\) could be in any of the 8 tiles around \(z\):
  - **North** (if \(x\) is north and horizontally aligned with \(z\)).
  - **Northeast** (if \(x\) is north and east of \(z\)).
  - **East** (if \(x\) is east and vertically aligned).
  - **Southeast** (if \(x\) is south and east).
  - **South** (if \(x\) is south and horizontally aligned).
  - **Southwest** (if \(x\) is south and west).
  - **West** (if \(x\) is west and vertically aligned).
  - **Northwest** (if \(x\) is north and west).
- **Bounding Box**: If \(x\) spans multiple tiles (e.g., overlaps horizontally and/or vertically with \(z\)), the relation cannot be described by a single cardinal direction and requires a compound bounding box relation.

Thus, all listed relations are possible depending on the specific positions and extents of the regions.

**Answer**:  
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  West, r2:  South, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given—region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\)—the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the composition of these relations. Considering the constraints:

- **West** means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(y\) (horizontally), with no vertical constraint between \(x\) and \(y\).
- **South** means \(y\) is entirely below \(z\) (vertically), with no horizontal constraint between \(y\) and \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) arise from combining the horizontal and vertical positioning:
- **Horizontally**: \(x\) is left of \(y\), and \(y\) is within or spans the horizontal extent of \(z\). Thus, \(x\) can be:
  - Left of \(z\)'s left boundary (West sector).
  - Within \(z\)'s horizontal bounds (Bounding Box horizontally).
- **Vertically**: \(y\) is below \(z\), and the vertical position of \(x\) relative to \(y\) is unconstrained, so \(x\) can be:
  - Above \(z\)'s top boundary (North sector).
  - Below \(z\)'s bottom boundary (South sector).
  - Within \(z\)'s vertical bounds (Bounding Box vertically).

The composition yields the following possible relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- **Northwest** (NW): \(x\) is left and above \(z\).
- **Southwest** (SW): \(x\) is left and below \(z\).
- **West** (W): \(x\) is left of \(z\) and within its vertical bounds.
- **North** (N): \(x\) is above \(z\) and within its horizontal bounds.
- **South** (S): \(x\) is below \(z\) and within its horizontal bounds.
- **Bounding Box** (BB): \(x\) is within both horizontal and vertical bounds of \(z\).

The relations **Northeast** (NE), **East** (E), and **Southeast** (SE) are impossible because \(x\) is constrained to be left of \(y\), and \(y\) is horizontally within or aligned with \(z\)'s bounds, preventing \(x\) from being right of \(z\)'s right boundary.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**North, South, West, Northwest, Southwest, Bounding Box**.
For r1:  West, r2:  East, answer: Based on the given relations—region \(x\) is West of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is East of region \(z\)—the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are not constrained beyond both being West of \(y\). This allows for any relative positioning between \(x\) and \(z\) in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, as long as they remain West of \(y\). Therefore, all cardinal direction relations and the Bounding Box relation are possible:

- **North**: \(x\) could be entirely above \(z\) with horizontal overlap.
- **Northeast**: \(x\) could be entirely above and entirely east of \(z\).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) could be entirely below and entirely east of \(z\).
- **South**: \(x\) could be entirely below \(z\) with horizontal overlap.
- **East**: \(x\) could be entirely east of \(z\).
- **Northwest**: \(x\) could be entirely above and entirely west of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) could be entirely west of \(z\).
- **Southwest**: \(x\) could be entirely below and entirely west of \(z\).
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) and \(z\) could be the same region, sharing the same minimal bounding box.

Thus, the possible relations include all listed options.
For r1:  West, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region x is **West** of region y: This means x is entirely to the left of y with vertical overlap (i.e., the horizontal extent of x is strictly left of y, and their vertical projections overlap).
- Region y is **Northwest** of region z: This means y is entirely to the left and entirely above z (i.e., the horizontal extent of y is strictly left of z, and the vertical extent of y is strictly above z).

Composing these relations:
- **Horizontally**: Since x is left of y and y is left of z, x must be entirely to the left of z (i.e., the horizontal condition for **West** holds between x and z).
- **Vertically**: 
  - y is entirely above z, so the bottom of y is above the top of z.
  - x has vertical overlap with y, meaning x spans above and/or below the vertical range of y.
  - Thus, the vertical relation between x and z has two cases:
    1. If the bottom of x is above the top of z (which can occur if x is entirely above z), then x is **Northwest** of z.
    2. If there is vertical overlap between x and z (which can occur if part of x is below the top of z), then x is **West** of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- **Northwest** (if x is entirely above z)
- **West** (if there is vertical overlap between x and z)

No other cardinal directions are possible given the constraints. The relation **Bounding Box** (indicating exact alignment or containment) does not apply here. 

**Answer: Northwest, West**
For r1:  West, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided, where region x is West of region y and region y is West of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are derived as follows:

- The longitude of x is less than that of y, and the longitude of y is less than that of z. Thus, the longitude of x is less than that of z, meaning x is west of z in terms of east-west positioning.
- The latitude (north-south positioning) between x and z is not constrained by the given relations. Therefore:
  - If x is at the same latitude as z, the relation is **West**.
  - If x is north of z, the relation is **Northwest**.
  - If x is south of z, the relation is **Southwest**.

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are **West, Northwest, Southwest**.
For r1:  West, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\): This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(y\) (i.e., \(x\)'s eastern boundary is west of \(y\)'s western boundary), and there is overlap in their north-south projection.
- Region \(y\) is **Southwest** of region \(z\): This means \(y\) is entirely to the southwest of \(z\) (i.e., \(y\)'s eastern boundary is west of \(z\)'s western boundary, and \(y\)'s northern boundary is south of \(z\)'s southern boundary).

The composition of these relations results in two possible scenarios for the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Southwest**: If \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\)'s northern boundary is south of \(z\)'s southern boundary) in addition to being west, then \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).
2. **West**: If \(x\) overlaps with \(z\) in the north-south projection (i.e., their vertical extents intersect) while remaining west, then \(x\) is west of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as \(x\) must be west of \(z\) due to the transitive west displacement, but the north-south positioning relative to \(z\) depends on the vertical extent of \(x\) relative to \(z\)'s southern boundary.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **Southwest** and **West**.
For r1:  West, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is **West** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(y\) (no overlap in the east-west direction).
- Region \(y\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) completely encloses \(z\), so \(z\) is entirely within \(y\)'s boundaries.

Considering the position of \(x\) relative to \(z\):

1. **West Component**: Since \(x\) is west of \(y\) and \(z\) is inside \(y\), \(x\) must be west of \(z\). This rules out any relations without a west component (e.g., East, Northeast, Southeast).
2. **North-South Possibilities**: The west relation does not constrain north-south alignment. Thus, \(x\) could be:
   - Entirely north of \(z\) → **Northwest**.
   - Entirely south of \(z\) → **Southwest**.
   - Overlapping or aligned north-south with \(z\) → **West**.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
- **West**: If \(x\) is directly west of \(z\) with no significant north-south deviation.
- **Northwest**: If \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
- **Southwest**: If \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).

**Not possible**:
- **East**, **Northeast**, **Southeast**, **South**, **North**: These lack the west component required by \(x\)'s position relative to \(y\) and \(z\).
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) is outside \(y\) (since \(x\) is west of \(y\)), so \(x\) cannot enclose \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are **West**, **Northwest**, and **Southwest**.
For r1:  Southwest, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is Southwest of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both south and west of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\), meaning \(z\) is south of \(y\).

The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their exact locations relative to \(y\):
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are south of \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other (i.e., whether \(x\) is north, south, or at the same latitude as \(z\)) are unknown.
- Horizontally, \(x\) is west of \(y\), but \(z\) could be east, west, or at the same longitude as \(y\). Thus, the horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) (east, west, or same) is also unknown.

By varying the distances and alignments, all eight cardinal directions between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:
- **North**: \(x\) is north of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) is farther south than \(x\)).
- **Northeast**: \(x\) is north and east of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) is southwest of \(x\)).
- **East**: \(x\) is east of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) is far west of \(y\)).
- **Southeast**: \(x\) is south and east of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) is northwest of \(x\)).
- **South**: \(x\) is south of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) is closer to \(y\) vertically than \(x\)).
- **Southwest**: \(x\) is south and west of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) is east of \(y\)).
- **West**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) is east of \(y\) but not far enough to be east of \(x\)).
- **Northwest**: \(x\) is north and west of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) is southeast of \(x\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all cardinal directions.

**Answer**: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations that region \(x\) is Southwest of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is Northeast of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can vary due to the relative positions of their minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs). The constraints are:

- \(x\) is Southwest of \(y\): \(x\) is entirely south and west of \(y\), so \(\text{max\_lat}_x < \text{min\_lat}_y\) and \(\text{max\_lon}_x < \text{min\_lon}_y\).
- \(y\) is Northeast of \(z\): \(y\) is entirely north and east of \(z\), so \(\text{min\_lat}_y > \text{max\_lat}_z\) and \(\text{min\_lon}_y > \text{max\_lon}_z\).

These constraints imply that both \(x\) and \(z\) are south of \(y\) and west of \(y\), but there are no direct constraints between \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, the relative position of \(x\) to \(z\) can be any cardinal direction or even involve overlapping MBRs (Bounding Box). Examples can be constructed for each case:

- **North**: \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) (higher minimum latitude) with overlapping longitudes.
- **Northeast**: \(x\) is entirely north and east of \(z\).
- **East**: \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) (higher minimum longitude) with overlapping latitudes.
- **Southeast**: \(x\) is entirely south and east of \(z\).
- **South**: \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (lower maximum latitude) with overlapping longitudes.
- **Southwest**: \(x\) is entirely south and west of \(z\).
- **West**: \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) (lower maximum longitude) with overlapping latitudes.
- **Northwest**: \(x\) is entirely north and west of \(z\).
- **Bounding Box**: The MBRs of \(x\) and \(z\) overlap in both latitude and longitude (e.g., one region partially or fully overlaps the other).

Thus, all nine relations are possible.

**Possible relations:** North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is **Southwest** of region y. This implies that x is positioned to the southwest relative to y, meaning x is both south and west of y.
- Region y is **Southeast** of region z. This implies that y is positioned to the southeast relative to z, meaning y is both south and east of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. **Spatial Reasoning**:
   - Since y is southeast of z, y is south and east of z.
   - Since x is southwest of y, x is south and west of y.
   - Combining these, x is south of y, and y is south of z, so x is south of z.
   - For the east-west direction:
     - x is west of y, and y is east of z. This means x could be east, west, or directly south of z relative to the east-west axis, depending on the exact positions.

2. **Possible Relations**:
   - **South**: If x is directly south of z (aligned vertically, no east-west offset).
   - **Southeast**: If x is both south and east of z (if the eastward component from y to z is less than the westward component from y to x).
   - **Southwest**: If x is both south and west of z (if the eastward component from y to z is greater than the westward component from y to x).

3. **Exclusion of Other Directions**:
   - North, Northeast, Northwest, West, East, and other directions are not possible because x is unambiguously south of z due to the southward relations from y to z and x to y.
   - Bounding Box is not applicable as the relations are directional and do not imply containment or overlap in a way that changes the cardinal direction.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are **South**, **Southeast**, and **Southwest**.

**Answer**:  
South  
Southeast  
Southwest
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  South, answer: Given that region x is Southwest of region y and region y is South of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

- **South**: This occurs when region y is significantly far south of region z relative to the distance between y and x. In this case, from z, x appears primarily south due to the dominance of the southward component.
- **Southwest**: This occurs when region x is significantly far southwest of region y relative to the distance between z and y. In this case, from z, x appears southwest due to the strong southwestward component.

The relation cannot be other cardinal directions (e.g., North, Northeast, East, Southeast, Northwest, West) because the combined positions always place x to the south or southwest of z, based on the vector composition of the directions. The "Bounding Box" option is not applicable here, as the relations are directional and specific.

Thus, the possible relations are South and Southwest.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  East, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region \(x\) is Southwest of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both West and South of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is East of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is East of \(z\).

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical Component**: Since \(x\) is South of \(y\) and there is no vertical constraint between \(y\) and \(z\), \(x\) must be South of \(z\) in all cases. This is because:
   - \(y\) can be at any latitude relative to \(z\) (North, same, or South).
   - However, \(x\) being South of \(y\) implies that \(x\) is South of \(z\) if \(y\) is North of \(z\), at the same latitude as \(z\), or even South of \(z\) (as long as \(x\) is further South).

2. **Horizontal Component**: 
   - \(y\) is East of \(z\), so \(y\) is to the East of \(z\).
   - \(x\) is West of \(y\), so \(x\) can be:
     - **West of \(z\)**: If \(x\) is far enough West that it is left of \(z\).
     - **At the same longitude as \(z\)**: If \(x\) is directly West of \(y\) but aligned with \(z\).
     - **East of \(z\)**: If \(x\) is between \(z\) and \(y\) horizontally (i.e., not as far East as \(y\) but still East of \(z\)).

Combining the vertical (South) and horizontal possibilities:
- **Southwest**: If \(x\) is West of \(z\) and South of \(z\).
- **South**: If \(x\) is at the same longitude as \(z\) and South of \(z\).
- **Southeast**: If \(x\) is East of \(z\) and South of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **Southwest**, **South**, and **Southeast**. These cover all horizontal positions of \(x\) relative to \(z\) while maintaining the South vertical component.

**Answer**: Southwest, South, Southeast
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is Southwest of region y: x is entirely to the west (maxx_x < minx_y) and south (maxy_x < miny_y) of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z: y is entirely to the west (maxx_y < minx_z) and north (miny_y > maxy_z) of z.

From the west relations:
- maxx_x < minx_y (from x Southwest of y)
- maxx_y < minx_z (from y Northwest of z)
Since minx_y ≤ maxx_y (by bounding box properties), it follows that maxx_x < minx_y ≤ maxx_y < minx_z, so maxx_x < minx_z. Thus, x is entirely to the west of z.

For the north-south relation between x and z:
- From x Southwest of y: maxy_x < miny_y.
- From y Northwest of z: miny_y > maxy_z, so maxy_z < miny_y.
However, there is no direct constraint between the vertical positions of x and z. Possible scenarios:
1. **x is entirely north of z (miny_x > maxy_z)**: This satisfies the condition for Northwest between x and z.
2. **x is entirely south of z (maxy_x < miny_z)**: This satisfies the condition for Southwest between x and z.
3. **Vertical overlap (neither miny_x > maxy_z nor maxy_x < miny_z)**: Then x is only to the west of z, resulting in a West relation.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northwest** (if x is north of z)
- **Southwest** (if x is south of z)
- **West** (if there is vertical overlap)

No other cardinal directions are possible because x is always west of z, and the vertical relation varies. The answer does not include "Bounding Box" as the relations are covered by the cardinal directions.

**Possible relations: Northwest, Southwest, West**
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  West, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations given:

- Region x is Southwest of region y: this means x is located in the southwest direction relative to y.
- Region y is West of region z: this means y is located in the west direction relative to z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, consider the composition of these directions. The vector from z to x is the sum of the vector from z to y (west direction) and the vector from y to x (southwest direction). Analyzing the possible combined directions:

- The west direction (from z to y) can be represented by angles in the compass sector [247.5°, 292.5°].
- The southwest direction (from y to x) can be represented by angles in the compass sector [202.5°, 247.5°].

The resulting vector from z to x can fall into one of the following compass sectors, depending on the specific angles and magnitudes:
- **South (S)**: compass angles [157.5°, 202.5°]. This can occur when the combined vector has a strong south component (e.g., if the west vector has a southward tilt and the southwest vector is oriented more southward).
- **Southwest (SW)**: compass angles [202.5°, 247.5°]. This is a direct combination, such as when both vectors contribute to a southwest resultant.
- **West (W)**: compass angles [247.5°, 292.5°]. This can happen when the west vector dominates or when the southwest vector has a westward tilt.

Thus, the possible relations for x relative to z are that x could be **South**, **Southwest**, or **West** of z.

**Answer: South, Southwest, West**
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Southwest, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is Southwest of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is both South and West of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is Southwest of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is both South and West of \(z\).

To determine the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Since \(x\) is South of \(y\) and \(y\) is South of \(z\), \(x\) is South of \(z\) (transitivity of South).
- Since \(x\) is West of \(y\) and \(y\) is West of \(z\), \(x\) is West of \(z\) (transitivity of West).

Therefore, \(x\) is both South and West of \(z\), which corresponds to the **Southwest** relation. No other cardinal direction relations (such as South, West, or others) are possible under the given constraints, as the transitivity strictly leads to Southwest.

**Answer: Southwest**
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is **Southwest** of region y. This means that x is entirely to the south and west of y. Specifically, the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of x lies completely southwest of the MBR of y.
- Region y is the **Bounding Box** of region z. This means that y is the minimal bounding rectangle of z, so the MBR of z is identical to the MBR of y.

Since the MBR of z is the same as the MBR of y, and x is southwest of y's MBR, it follows that x must also be southwest of z's MBR. Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is **Southwest**.

No other cardinal direction relations are possible because:
- The **Southwest** relation is strict and absolute (x is entirely south and west of z's MBR).
- The bounding box relation ensures that z's spatial extent is exactly aligned with y, leaving no room for alternative directional relationships (e.g., x cannot be north, east, etc., of z).

Thus, the only possible relation is **Southwest**.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2: North, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is the bounding box of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing \(y\). Thus, \(y\) is entirely within \(x\), and the southern boundary of \(x\) coincides with the southern boundary of \(y\).
- Region \(y\) is North of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is entirely north of \(z\). Consequently, \(z\) is entirely south of the southern boundary of \(y\), which is the same as the southern boundary of \(x\). Therefore, \(z\) is entirely south of \(x\).

The possible horizontal positions of \(z\) relative to \(x\) determine the cardinal direction relations for the pair \((x, z)\):

1. **If \(z\) is horizontally aligned with \(x\)** (i.e., the horizontal projection of \(z\) overlaps with or is contained within the horizontal extent of \(x\)):
   - From the perspective of \(z\), \(x\) is to the north. Thus, \(x\) is **North** of \(z\).

2. **If \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\)**:
   - From the perspective of \(z\), \(x\) is to the northeast (since \(x\) is north and east of \(z\)). Thus, \(x\) is **Northeast** of \(z\).

3. **If \(z\) is entirely to the east of \(x\)**:
   - From the perspective of \(z\), \(x\) is to the northwest (since \(x\) is north and west of \(z\)). Thus, \(x\) is **Northwest** of \(z\).

In all cases, \(z\) cannot be inside \(x\) (as it is entirely south of \(x\)'s boundary), so "Bounding Box" is not possible. The relations South, Southeast, Southwest, East, or West do not apply because \(x\) is never south, east, or west of \(z\) based on the given conditions.

Thus, the possible relations for the pair \((x, z)\) are:
- **North** (when \(z\) is horizontally aligned with \(x\))
- **Northeast** (when \(z\) is entirely west of \(x\))
- **Northwest** (when \(z\) is entirely east of \(x\))

**Answer:** North, Northeast, Northwest
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is the **Bounding Box** of region y, meaning x is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that entirely contains y. Thus, y is completely inside x.
- Region y is **Northeast** of region z, meaning:
  - The entire region y is strictly to the east of z (minimum x-coordinate of y > maximum x-coordinate of z).
  - The entire region y is strictly to the north of z (minimum y-coordinate of y > maximum y-coordinate of z).

Since y is inside x, the bounding box of y (x) inherits these directional properties relative to z:
- The minimum x-coordinate of x (which equals the minimum x-coordinate of y) is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z. Thus, every point in x is east of every point in z.
- The minimum y-coordinate of x (which equals the minimum y-coordinate of y) is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z. Thus, every point in x is north of every point in z.

Therefore, region x is entirely to the northeast of region z. The only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is **Northeast**.

**Answer: Northeast**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Southeast, answer: Based on the given relations:

- **Region x is the Bounding Box of region y**: This means x is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that completely encloses y. Thus, the boundaries of x are defined by the extreme points of y (western boundary = min_x(y), eastern = max_x(y), southern = min_y(y), northern = max_y(y)).
- **Region y is Southeast of region z**: This implies:
  - The entire y is east of the eastern boundary of z: **min_x(y) ≥ max_x(z)**.
  - The entire y is south of the southern boundary of z: **max_y(y) ≤ min_y(z)**.

### Analysis of x relative to z:
- **East component**:  
  The western boundary of x is min_x(y) (since x encloses y). From the Southeast relation, min_x(y) ≥ max_x(z). Thus, the entire x starts at or east of the eastern boundary of z. The eastern boundary of x (max_x(y)) is even farther east. Therefore, **x is entirely east of z**.
  
- **South component**:  
  The northern boundary of x is max_y(y) (since x encloses y). From the Southeast relation, max_y(y) ≤ min_y(z). Thus, the highest point of x is at or below the lowest point of z. The southern boundary of x (min_y(y)) is even farther south. Therefore, **x is entirely south of z**.

### Conclusion:
- The combination of **entirely east** and **entirely south** means region x must be **Southeast** of region z.
- No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., South, East, etc.) or the Bounding Box relation are possible, as the constraints force x strictly into the southeast quadrant relative to z without overlap or ambiguity.

**Possible relation: Southeast**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  South, answer: Given that region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is **South** of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **South**.

### Explanation:
- **Bounding Box**: \(x\) is the minimal rectangle that contains \(y\), so \(x\) shares the same extreme points (northernmost, southernmost, easternmost, westernmost) as \(y\).
- **South**: \(y\) is entirely below \(z\), meaning the northernmost point of \(y\) is south of the southernmost point of \(z\), and \(y\) is horizontally within the east-west extent of \(z\).
- Since \(x\) is the bounding box of \(y\):
  - The northernmost point of \(x\) is the same as that of \(y\), so it is also south of \(z\).
  - The horizontal extent of \(x\) (east-west) matches that of \(y\), so it remains within the horizontal bounds of \(z\).
- Thus, \(x\) must also be entirely below \(z\) and horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s extent, satisfying the **South** relation.

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., Southwest, Southeast, etc.) or **Bounding Box** are possible, as \(x\) cannot extend north of \(y\) (so it cannot be north of \(z\)) and must align horizontally with \(y\) relative to \(z\).

**Answer: South**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  East, answer: Given that region x is the bounding box of region y and region y is East of region z, we analyze the possible relations between x and z.

- **Bounding Box (x of y)**: x is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle enclosing y. Thus, the northern, southern, eastern, and western boundaries of x are determined by the extents of y.
- **East (y of z)**: y lies entirely to the east of z, meaning the minimum x-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z.

### Implications for x and z:
1. **East-West Relation**:
   - Since y is entirely east of z, the western boundary of y (which is the western boundary of x) is east of the eastern boundary of z.
   - Therefore, the entire x lies east of z. This satisfies the east component for cardinal relations.

2. **North-South Relation**:
   - The north-south extent of x matches that of y because x is the bounding box of y.
   - The north-south position of z relative to y (and thus x) can vary:
     - **Overlap**: If the north-south projections of z and y overlap (i.e., the y-coordinate ranges intersect), then x is **East** of z (since x is east of z and there is north-south overlap).
     - **z entirely south of y/x**: If the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than the minimum y-coordinate of y (and x), then x is entirely north of z. Combined with the east relation, x is **Northeast** of z.
     - **z entirely north of y/x**: If the minimum y-coordinate of z is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y (and x), then x is entirely south of z. Combined with the east relation, x is **Southeast** of z.

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between x and z are:
- **East** (if north-south overlap),
- **Northeast** (if z is entirely south of x),
- **Southeast** (if z is entirely north of x).

Thus, the possible relations are **East**, **Northeast**, and **Southeast**.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is the **Bounding Box** of region \(y\), meaning \(x\) is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that completely encloses \(y\). Thus, the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of \(x\) is identical to the MBR of \(y\):  
  - \(\text{min}_x(x) = \text{min}_x(y)\), \(\text{max}_x(x) = \text{max}_x(y)\),  
  - \(\text{min}_y(x) = \text{min}_y(y)\), \(\text{max}_y(x) = \text{max}_y(y)\).  

- Region \(y\) is **Northwest** of region \(z\), which requires:  
  - The entire MBR of \(y\) is to the **west** of \(z\): \(\text{max}_x(y) < \text{min}_x(z)\),  
  - The entire MBR of \(y\) is to the **north** of \(z\): \(\text{min}_y(y) > \text{max}_y(z)\).  

Since \(x\) shares the same MBR as \(y\):  
- \(\text{max}_x(x) = \text{max}_x(y) < \text{min}_x(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\).  
- \(\text{min}_y(x) = \text{min}_y(y) > \text{max}_y(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\).  

Thus, \(x\) is entirely within the **Northwest** sector relative to \(z\). Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **Northwest**.  

**Answer: Northwest**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  West, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region x is the **Bounding Box** of region y, meaning x is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle enclosing y. Thus, y is entirely within x.
- Region y is **West** of region z, meaning every point in y is west of every point in z (i.e., the eastern boundary of y is west of the western boundary of z).

The possible relations between region x and region z must account for the following:
1. **West component**: Since y is inside x and y is west of z, the entire x must be west of z. The eastern boundary of x aligns with the eastern boundary of y (as x is y's bounding box), and z lies east of y, hence east of x. Therefore, from z's perspective, x is to the west.
2. **North-south component**: The north-south positioning of x relative to z can vary, as the bounding box x may extend beyond y north or south, and z's position is unconstrained vertically.

Considering the cardinal directions from z to x (as the relation is between x and z, and the input "y is West of z" describes y relative to z), the possibilities are:
- **West**: If the north-south projections of x and z overlap (i.e., neither x is entirely north nor south of z).
- **Northwest**: If x is entirely north of z (i.e., the southern boundary of x is north of the northern boundary of z).
- **Southwest**: If x is entirely south of z (i.e., the northern boundary of x is south of the southern boundary of z).

**Example Illustrations**:
- **West**:  
  x: [0, 10] × [0, 10] (bounding box),  
  y: [2, 8] × [2, 8] (inside x),  
  z: [12, 20] × [5, 15] (east of y; overlaps vertically with x).  
  Here, x is **West** of z.
- **Northwest**:  
  x: [0, 10] × [0, 10],  
  y: [2, 8] × [2, 8],  
  z: [12, 20] × [−10, −5] (east of y; entirely south of x).  
  Here, x is **Northwest** of z.
- **Southwest**:  
  x: [0, 10] × [0, 10],  
  y: [2, 8] × [2, 8],  
  z: [12, 20] × [15, 20] (east of y; entirely north of x).  
  Here, x is **Southwest** of z.

The relations **East**, **Northeast**, and **Southeast** are not possible because x cannot be east of z (as x is west of z). **Bounding Box** is also not possible, as z is east of x and cannot contain it or be contained by it. Other directions like **North**, **South**, **Northeast**, **Southeast** do not apply due to the west constraint.

Thus, the possible relations are **West, Northwest, Southwest**.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Southwest, answer: Given that region \(x\) is the bounding box of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is southwest of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **Southwest**.

### Explanation:
- The bounding box of a region (here, \(x\) for \(y\)) shares the same minimum and maximum coordinates as the region it encloses. Thus, \(x\) has the same spatial extent as \(y\) in terms of its minimum and maximum x (east-west) and y (north-south) coordinates.
- Since \(y\) is southwest of \(z\), the following conditions hold based on cardinal direction relations:
  - The entire region \(y\) is west of \(z\), meaning the maximum x-coordinate of \(y\) (east edge) is less than the minimum x-coordinate of \(z\) (west edge).
  - The entire region \(y\) is south of \(z\), meaning the maximum y-coordinate of \(y\) (north edge) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\) (south edge).
- Because \(x\) has the same bounding coordinates as \(y\), these conditions directly apply to \(x\):
  - The maximum x-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum x-coordinate of \(z\), so \(x\) is west of \(z\).
  - The maximum y-coordinate of \(x\) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\), so \(x\) is south of \(z\).
- Therefore, \(x\) must be southwest of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West) or the Bounding Box relation are possible, as \(x\) cannot be the bounding box of \(z\) (since \(z\) is not contained within \(x\)) and the directional conditions are strict and exclusive.

**Final Answer: Southwest**
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is the minimal bounding box of region y, meaning y is entirely contained within x.
- Region y is the minimal bounding box of region z, meaning z is entirely contained within y.

Since z is contained within y and y is contained within x, z must be entirely within x. However, the exact position of z within x is not fixed. It can lie in any directional part of x relative to its minimal bounding rectangle. The possible cardinal direction relations between x (as the reference region) and z (as the target) include all eight directional tiles (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) because:
- z could be positioned in the northern part of x, making the relation **North**.
- z could be in the northeastern part, making it **Northeast**.
- Similarly, it could be in any other directional part: **East**, **Southeast**, **South**, **Southwest**, **West**, or **Northwest**.

The "Bounding Box" relation does not apply between x and z because x is not necessarily the minimal bounding box of z (y is the minimal bounding box of z, and x contains y, so x is a bounding box but not minimal). The center tile is not listed as an option, so it is not considered.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest**.
