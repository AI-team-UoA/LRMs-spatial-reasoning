PROMPT: Let  South and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, we need to analyze the given directions:

1. Region x is South of region y.
2. Region y is Northwest of region z.

The implication of region y being Northwest of region z means region z is Southeast of region y. Therefore, if region x is South of region y, it is also possibly South or Southwest of region z.

Hence, the possible relations between region x and region z are:

- South
- Southwest
