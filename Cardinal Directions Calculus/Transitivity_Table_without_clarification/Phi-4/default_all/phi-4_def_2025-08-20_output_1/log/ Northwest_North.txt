PROMPT: Let  Northwest and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

West. 

If region x is northwest of region y, and y is north of z, then x must be west of z. This is because for x to be northwest of y, it must be both north and west of y, and since y itself is directly north of z, x must be west of z overall.
