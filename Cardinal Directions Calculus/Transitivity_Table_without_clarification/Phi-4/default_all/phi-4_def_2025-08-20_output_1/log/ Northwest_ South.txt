PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is "West." 

Since region x is Northwest of region y, it is both north and west of y. Since region y is South of region z, it is directly south of z. Therefore, region x, being northwest of y, is west of both y and z. 

Thus, region x is west of region z.
