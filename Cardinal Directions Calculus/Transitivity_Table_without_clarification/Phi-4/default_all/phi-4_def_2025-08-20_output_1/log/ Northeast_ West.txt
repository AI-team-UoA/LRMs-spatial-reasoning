PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are Southeast and West. 

- If region x is Northeast of region y and region y is West of region z, then x could be Southeast of z because moving Northeast from y brings you closer to the Southeast side of z.
- Additionally, there could also be a scenario in which x is still West of z if the Northeast movement from y is not strong enough to reach beyond z's meridian.
