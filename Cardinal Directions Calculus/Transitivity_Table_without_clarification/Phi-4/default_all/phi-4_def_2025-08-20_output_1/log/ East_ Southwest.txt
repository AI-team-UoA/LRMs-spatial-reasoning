PROMPT: Let  East and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z could be East or Southeast. 

Here's the reasoning:
- If region x is East of region y, and region y is Southwest of region z, then region x is either East or Southeast of region z.
- Specifically:
  - If y is directly Southwest of z, then x would be to the East of z.
  - If y is further southwest (i.e., more toward south or more toward west than the cardinal Southwest), then x could be Southeast of z.
