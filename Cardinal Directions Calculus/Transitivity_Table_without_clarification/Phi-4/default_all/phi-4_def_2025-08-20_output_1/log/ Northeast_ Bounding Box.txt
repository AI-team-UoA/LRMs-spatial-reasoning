PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Northeast of region y, it is located in the direction that is both north and east of region y. Since region y is the Bounding Box of region z, region z is entirely contained within region y. Therefore, region x could be placed in any of the northeast, east, or north of region z since it starts northeast of region y but the bounding box does not restrict it to strictly northeast away from region z. 

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: Northeast, East, or North.
