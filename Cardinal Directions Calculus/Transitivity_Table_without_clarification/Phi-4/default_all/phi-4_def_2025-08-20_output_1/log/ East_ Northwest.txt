PROMPT: Let  East and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is East of region y, and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x must be East or Southeast of region z. This is because being directly East of y, going directly South or Southeast would still keep x in the East general direction relative to z. Hence, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southeast and East.
