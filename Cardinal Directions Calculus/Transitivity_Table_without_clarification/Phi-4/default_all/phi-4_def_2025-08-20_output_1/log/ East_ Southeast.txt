PROMPT: Let  East and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is East of region y, and region y is Southeast of region z, then region x can be East, Southeast, or possibly directly South of region z. 

To elaborate:
- When region y is Southeast of region z, it means y is both South and East of z.
- Given that x is East of y, x must be further East than y.
- Therefore, x will be either directly East of z, or Southeast of z, depending on the relative positions of y and x with respect to z.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are: **East** and **Southeast**.
