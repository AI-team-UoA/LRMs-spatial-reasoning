PROMPT: Let  Bounding Box and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Bounding Box of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z could be:

- Northwest
- Bounding Box

Region x encompasses region y, which is Northwest of region z. Therefore, region x could be at least Northwest of region z or could be a bounding box that includes region z.
