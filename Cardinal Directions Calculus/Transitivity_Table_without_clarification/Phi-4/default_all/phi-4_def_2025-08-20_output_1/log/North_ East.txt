PROMPT: Let North and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the conditions:
- Region x is North of region y: This implies that x is somewhere directly above or above and slightly to the north-east or north-west of y.
- Region y is East of region z: This implies that y is directly to the east or east and slightly to the north-east or south-east of z.

In combining these conditions, region x would generally be in relation to region z in one of these directions:
- Northeast
- North
