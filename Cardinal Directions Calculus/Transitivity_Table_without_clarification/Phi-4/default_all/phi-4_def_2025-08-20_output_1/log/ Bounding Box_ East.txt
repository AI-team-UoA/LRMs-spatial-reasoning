PROMPT: Let  Bounding Box and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Bounding Box of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are: East, Northeast, and Southeast. This is because region x, as a bounding box of region y, encompasses y's location, and with y being east of z, x can extend further east than y, potentially to the north or south of y.
