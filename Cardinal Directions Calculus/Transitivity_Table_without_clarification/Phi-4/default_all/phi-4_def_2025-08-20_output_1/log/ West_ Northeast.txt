PROMPT: Let  West and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z could be: Northwest and West. 

Here's a brief explanation: 

- If region x is West of region y, it is positioned somewhere directly to the left of region y.
- If region y is Northeast of region z, it is positioned directly to the upper-left of region z.

Therefore, region x, being to the West of region y, could be both directly to the West of region z or further up, making it Northwest of region z. Thus, the answer is Northwest and West.
