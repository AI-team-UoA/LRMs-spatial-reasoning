PROMPT: Let  Bounding Box and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Bounding Box of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is a bounding box of region y, and region y is a bounding box of region z, then region x is also a bounding box of region z. Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is "Bounding Box."
