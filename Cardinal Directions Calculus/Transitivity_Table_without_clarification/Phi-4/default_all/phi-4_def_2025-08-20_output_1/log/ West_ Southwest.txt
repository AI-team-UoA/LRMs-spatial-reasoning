PROMPT: Let  West and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is West of region y, and region y is Southwest of region z, then region x could be West, Southwest, or Northwest of region z. This is because:

- Since y is Southwest of z, moving West from y could keep region x either West or Southwest of z.
- Additionally, considering y already shares a Southern component with respect to z, moving directly West could potentially place x into the Northwest of z due to the initial Southern influence. 

Thus, the possible relations are West, Southwest, or Northwest.
