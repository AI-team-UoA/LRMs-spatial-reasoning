PROMPT: Let North and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is North of region y, and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x must be either North or Northeast of region z. This is because x being north of y positions x above y, while y being northwest of z puts y above and to the left of z. What follows is that x could be directly north (if x and y have the same east-west line, so x is directly above z) or northeast (if x is both above and to the east of z) of z. Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are North and Northeast.
