PROMPT: Let  West and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is West of region y and region y is Southeast of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are West or Southwest. This is because:

- If region y is directly Southeast of region z, then region x being directly West of region y would place it to the West or Southwest of region z.
- If region y is somewhat Northeast from being directly Southeast to region z, region x could be closer to the Southwest of region z. 

Thus, the relations between region x and region z could be West or Southwest.
