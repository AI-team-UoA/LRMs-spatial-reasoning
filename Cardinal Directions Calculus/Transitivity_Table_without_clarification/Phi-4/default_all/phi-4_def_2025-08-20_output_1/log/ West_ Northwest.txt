PROMPT: Let  West and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z could be West, Southwest, and Northwest. Here's the breakdown:

- If region x is West of region y, and region y is Northwest of region z, region x could be West of region z directly.
- Alternatively, region x could be Southwest of region z if it's further south relative to region z than region y.
- Region x could also be Northwest of region z if it's further north relative to region z than region y. 

Therefore, region x could be Northwest, Southwest, or West of region z.
