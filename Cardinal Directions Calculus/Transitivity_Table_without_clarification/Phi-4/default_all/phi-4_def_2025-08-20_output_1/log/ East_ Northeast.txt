PROMPT: Let  East and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z can be East or Southeast. 

Explanation:
1. If region x is East of region y, then x is directly to the east of y.
2. If region y is Northeast of region z, then y is to the northeast of z, which means y is both east and north of z.

Combining these, region x can either be:
- East of z (since x is east of y and y is directly northeast, likely mostly east from z).
- Southeast of z (if the eastward component of y from z is quite strong while x remains directly east of y).

Thus, the possible relations are East or Southeast.
