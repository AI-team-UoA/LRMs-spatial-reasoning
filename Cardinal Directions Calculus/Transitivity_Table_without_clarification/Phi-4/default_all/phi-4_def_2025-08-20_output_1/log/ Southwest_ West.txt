PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is Southwest. 

Since region x is Southwest of region y, it implies x is both South and somewhat West of y. Additionally, because region y is West of region z, x will also be South of z in addition to being West of z, placing x in the Southwest direction relative to z.
