PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is "West." 

Here's the reasoning:

- Region x is Northwest of region y, meaning x is to the northwest relative to y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z, meaning y is to the southwest relative to z.

When you connect these directions:
- From z to y, you would go northeast to get from z to y (the opposite of southwest).
- From y to x, you would go northeast to get from y to x (the opposite of northwest).

Combining these two steps:
- You go northeast from z to y.
- Then, you continue northeast from y to x.

In terms of cardinal direction traversal:
- Starting from z, and taking both northeastern steps leads you directly to the west relative to z. 

Therefore, region x is west of region z.
