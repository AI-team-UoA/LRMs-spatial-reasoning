PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Northeast of region y, and region y is Southwest of region z, then region x is likely to be roughly Northeast of region z. This is because moving Northeast from a point will place it further in the Northeast direction relative to the original position, especially when the intermediate point (region y) is Southwest of another reference point (region z). Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z could be Northeast.
