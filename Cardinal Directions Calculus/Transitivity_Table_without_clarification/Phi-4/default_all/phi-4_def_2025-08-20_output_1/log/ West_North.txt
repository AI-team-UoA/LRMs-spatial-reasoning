PROMPT: Let  West and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is West of region y and region y is North of region z, then region x could be Northwest of region z. This is because moving west from y and continuing north of z places x in a position that is both to the west and north relative to z. Therefore, the possible relation is Northwest.
