{"prompt": "Let  Bounding Box and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Bounding Box of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "The possible relation between region x and region z could be:\n\n- Northwest\n- Bounding Box\n\nRegion x encompasses region y, which is Northwest of region z. Therefore, region x could be at least Northwest of region z or could be a bounding box that includes region z.", "elapsed-time": 1.5381193161010742, "reasoning-tokens": "111", "completion-tokens": "56"}
