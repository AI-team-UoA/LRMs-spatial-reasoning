{"prompt": "Let  West and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "If region x is West of region y, and region y is the Bounding Box of region z, then region z is entirely within the boundaries of region y. Thus, region x, being West of the entire region y, would also be West of any part of region z. Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is West.", "elapsed-time": 3.2743983268737793, "reasoning-tokens": "111", "completion-tokens": "71"}
