{"prompt": "Let North and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "If region x is North of region y, and region y is a Bounding Box of region z, then region z is completely within or along the boundary of region y. Since region x is entirely to the North of region y, region x must be in relation North of region z. Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is North.", "elapsed-time": 2.2249948978424072, "reasoning-tokens": "109", "completion-tokens": "72"}
