PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region \( x \) is Northeast of region \( y \) and region \( y \) is Southwest of region \( z \), region \( x \) is East of region \( z \). This is because moving from \( y \) to \( x \) involves moving Northeast, while moving from \( z \) to \( y \) involves moving Southwest. Combining these movements, \( x \) ends up directly East of \( z \). Therefore, the possible relation is:

- East
