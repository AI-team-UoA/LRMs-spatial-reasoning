PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z could be: Northeast, East, and Southeast. This is because region x is to the Northeast of y, and y is to the Northeast of z, which places x generally to the northeast of z. Depending on the specific alignments, x could also be directly east or southeast of z.
