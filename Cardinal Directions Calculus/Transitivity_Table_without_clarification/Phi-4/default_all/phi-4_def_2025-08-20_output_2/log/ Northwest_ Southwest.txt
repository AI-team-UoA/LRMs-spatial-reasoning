PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is North. 

Explanation:
- If x is Northwest of y, then x is both north and west of y.
- If y is Southwest of z, then y is both south and west of z. 

Hence, x, being north of y, and with y being south of z, would position x to be north of z. The westward aspect (since both x is west of y and y is west of z) does not affect the north-south relation between x and z.
