PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Northwest of region y and region y is West of region z, region x could be Northwest or West of region z. This is because:

- Region x is Northwest of region y, so relative to z, it could be either closer to the north or remain in the northwest.
- Since region y is to the west of region z, and region x is even further to the northwest, the combined effect is that region x ends up either directly northwest or due west of region z.
