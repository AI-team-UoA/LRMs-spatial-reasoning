PROMPT: Let  East and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relationships:  
- Region x is East of region y, which implies x is directly to the right of y.
- Region y is Northeast of region z, which implies y is to the north and east of z.

From this configuration, possible directions from region z to region x could include:
- East
- Southeast
- South

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z can be: Southeast, East, South.
