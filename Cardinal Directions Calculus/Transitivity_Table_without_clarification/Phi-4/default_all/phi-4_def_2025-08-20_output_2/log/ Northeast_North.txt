PROMPT: Let  Northeast and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z could be Northeast or East. 

- If region x is directly Northeast of region y, and region y is directly North of region z, then region x would be directly Northeast of region z.
- Alternatively, if the orientation implies a slightly different alignment, region x could also simply be to the East of region z.
