PROMPT: Let  East and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is East of region y and region y is West of region z, then region x could directly be East, Northeast, or Southeast of region z. This is because region x is to the east side of y, and y is to the west side of z, which implies x can only be eastward of z or in a diagonal direction assuming some latitude change. Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:

- East
- Northeast
- Southeast
