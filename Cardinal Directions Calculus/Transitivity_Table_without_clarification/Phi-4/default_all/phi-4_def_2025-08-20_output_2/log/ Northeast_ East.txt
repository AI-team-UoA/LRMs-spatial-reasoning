PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is Northeast. 

Here's the reasoning:
- If region x is Northeast of region y, it means region x is both north and east of region y.
- If region y is East of region z, it means region y is directly east of region z.

Therefore, combining these relations:
- Since x is northeast of y, and y is east of z, x would be both north of the line from z to y and also east of z. This places x in the Northeast quadrant relative to z.
