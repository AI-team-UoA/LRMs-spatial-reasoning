PROMPT: Let  West and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region \( x \) is west of region \( y \), and region \( y \) is northwest of region \( z \), then region \( x \) can be either west or southwest of region \( z \). This is because being west of \( y \) and \( y \) being northwest of \( z \) place \( x \) to the left of both the direct line from \( y \) to \( z \) and the north-south alignment, leading to \( x \) being either directly west or southwest relative to \( z \). 

Possible relations: West, Southwest.
