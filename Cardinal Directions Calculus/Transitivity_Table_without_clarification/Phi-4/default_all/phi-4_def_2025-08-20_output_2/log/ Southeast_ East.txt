PROMPT: Let  Southeast and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is Southeast of region y and region y is East of region z, the possible direction relation between region x and region z is Southeast. This is because moving from z to y requires moving east, and then moving from y to x involves a southeast direction. Combining these two movements, region x ends up in the southeast relative to region z.
