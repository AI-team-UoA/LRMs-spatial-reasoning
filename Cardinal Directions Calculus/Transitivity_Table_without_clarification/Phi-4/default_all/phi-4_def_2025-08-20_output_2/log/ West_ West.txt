PROMPT: Let  West and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Region x would be West of region z. Given that region x is directly west of region y, and region y is directly west of region z, region x is further west of the line connecting y and z, which places it to the west of z in terms of cardinal directions.
