PROMPT: Let  East and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z could be: East, Southeast, Northeast. 

Since region x is East of region y, and region y is a Bounding Box of region z (which means region z is completely within region y), region x could be to the east, southeast, or northeast of region z.
