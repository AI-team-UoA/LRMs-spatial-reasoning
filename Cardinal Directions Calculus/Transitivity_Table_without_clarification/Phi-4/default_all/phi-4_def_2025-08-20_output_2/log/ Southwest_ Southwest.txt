PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region \( x \) is Southwest of region \( y \) and region \( y \) is Southwest of region \( z \), then region \( x \) would be South, Southwest, or Southeast of region \( z \). This is because moving southwest from \( y \) to \( x \), and then southwest again from \( y \) to \( z \), places \( x \) relative to \( z \) in one of these directions.
