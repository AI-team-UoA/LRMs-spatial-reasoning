PROMPT: Let  South and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is South of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z would be South or Southeast. This is because moving south from y after moving northwest from z would end up south or southeast of z. Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are South and Southeast.
