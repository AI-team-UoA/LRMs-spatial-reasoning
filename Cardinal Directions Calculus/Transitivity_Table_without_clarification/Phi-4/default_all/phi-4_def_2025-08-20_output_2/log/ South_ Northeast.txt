PROMPT: Let  South and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the information:

- Region x is South of region y.
- Region y is Northeast of region z.

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

**Possible relations:**

1. **Southeast of region z:** Since y is Northeast of z and x is directly South of y, x should also be Southeast relative to z.

Thus, the possible relation between region x and region z is Southeast.
