PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z could be Northeast. 

Here's why: 
- Since x is Northeast of y, x is both north and east of y. 
- Since y is South of z, z is north of y.
- Combining these, z is north of y, and x is north of y, thus x is not directly north of z but still north relative to y. 
- Similarly, since y is south of z and x is east of y, x is east of z.

Thus, x is both north and east of z, putting it in the Northeast relation to z.
