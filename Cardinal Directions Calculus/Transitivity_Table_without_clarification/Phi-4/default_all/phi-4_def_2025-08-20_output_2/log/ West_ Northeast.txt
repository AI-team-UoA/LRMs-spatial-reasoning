PROMPT: Let  West and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given:

1. Region x is West of region y.
2. Region y is Northeast of region z.

From (2), the Northeast relation implies that y is both North and East of z.

If y is East of z and x is West of y, x could still be anywhere horizontally relative to z or it could even be to the East if x is significantly further west relative to y than y is to the east of z. Vertically, since y is North of z, x could be North, South, or any diagonal direction relative to z.

Possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, West, Southwest, North, South, and a Bounding Box (since x can range over multiple possible directions).
