PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Northeast of region y and region y is West of region z, then region x would be North or Northeast of region z. This is because being Northeast of y and also having y to the West of z brings x to either a North or Northeast direction concerning z.
