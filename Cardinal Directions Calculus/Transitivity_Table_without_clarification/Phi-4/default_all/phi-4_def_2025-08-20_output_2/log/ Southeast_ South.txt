PROMPT: Let  Southeast and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Southeast of region y, and region y is South of region z, then region x would be Southeast of region z. This follows because moving southeast from y (which is already south of z) results in a direction that is a diagonal combination of south and east relative to z. Thus, the possible relation between region x and region z is Southeast.
