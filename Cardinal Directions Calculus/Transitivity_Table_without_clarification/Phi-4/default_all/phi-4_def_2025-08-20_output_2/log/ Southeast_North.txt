PROMPT: Let  Southeast and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are Southeast and South. 

- If region x is Southeast of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x would typically be more directly Southeast of region z, but it could also be more generally South, depending on their specific positions.
