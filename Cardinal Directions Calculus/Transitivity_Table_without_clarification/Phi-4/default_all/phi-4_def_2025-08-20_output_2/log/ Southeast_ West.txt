PROMPT: Let  Southeast and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is southeast of region y and region y is west of region z, then region x could be either southeast or south of region z. This is because region x is already southeast of region y, and moving further southeast from it, relative to region z which is east of region y, doesn't shift region x too far from the southeast or south direction relative to region z.
