PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

To find the relation between region x and region z, consider the following:

1. If region x is Northwest of region y, it means x is both north and west of y.
2. If region y is South of region z, it means z is North of region y.

Combining these:
- Region x is North of region y (from Northwest of y), and y is South of z, so x is North of (South of) z â†’ x is further North than z.
- Region x is West of region y (from Northwest of y).

Thus, region x is North and West of region z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest.
