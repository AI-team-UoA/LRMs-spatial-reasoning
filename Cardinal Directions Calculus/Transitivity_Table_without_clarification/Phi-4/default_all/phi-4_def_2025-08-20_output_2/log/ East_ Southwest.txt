PROMPT: Let  East and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z.

Analyzing Position:
- Since y is Southwest of z, z is Northeast of y.
- Region x being East of y means x is to the right of y.

Considering Relative Position:
- From z, if y is Southwest, z would be further Northeast compared to y.
- Therefore, x being further east of y will be even closer to or to the right of the Northeast line extending from z.

Possible relations between region x and region z:
- Northeast
- East

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northeast and East.
