PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is South. 

Here's why: 
- If x is Southwest of y, then x is both South and West of y.
- If y is East of z, then moving from z to y involves going East.
- Combining these, for x relative to z: moving Eastward from z to y and then Southwest from y to x means moving South relative to z. Region x is further South than region z.
