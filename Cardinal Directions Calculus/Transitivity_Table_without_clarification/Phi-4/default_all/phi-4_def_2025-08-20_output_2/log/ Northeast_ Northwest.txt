PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- Region \( x \) is Northeast of region \( y \).
- Region \( y \) is Northwest of region \( z \).

To find the relationship between \( x \) and \( z \), consider the spatial implications:
- Since \( x \) is Northeast of \( y \), \( x \) is both north and east of \( y \).
- Since \( y \) is Northwest of \( z \), \( y \) is both north and west of \( z \).

When combining these, \( x \) must be north of \( z \) (as \( x \) is north of \( y \) and \( y \) is north of \( z \)), and simultaneously, \( x \) must be east of \( z \) (as \( x \) is east of \( y \) and \( y \) is west of \( z \)). 

Thus, the possible relation between region \( x \) and region \( z \) is:
- Northeast.
