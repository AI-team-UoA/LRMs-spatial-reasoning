{"prompt": "Let  East and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "East, Bounding Box. If region x is east of region y and region y is west of region z, then region x could be east of region z or it could be in a configuration where region z is east of region x with region y between them (i.e., a bounding box situation where x and z are on opposite sides with y in between).", "elapsed-time": 2.375359535217285, "reasoning-tokens": "107", "completion-tokens": "73"}
