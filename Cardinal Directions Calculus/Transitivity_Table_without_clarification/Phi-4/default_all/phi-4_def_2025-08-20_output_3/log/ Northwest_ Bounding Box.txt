PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Northwest of region y, it is located to the north and west of region y. Since region y is a Bounding Box of region z, region z is entirely within the boundaries of region y. Therefore, region x, being located northwest of region y, is also any direction from northwest to southeast of region z. The possible relations between region x and region z could be Northwest, North, or West.
