PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are Northeast. 

Given:
- Region x is Northeast of region y.
- Region y is East of region z.

From these, region x will be Northeast of region z because moving from z to y moves you East, and then moving from y to x moves you further North and East, placing x in the Northeast direction from z.
