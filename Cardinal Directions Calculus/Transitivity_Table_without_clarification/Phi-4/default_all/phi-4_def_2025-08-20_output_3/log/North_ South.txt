PROMPT: Let North and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the conditions:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

From these conditions, it follows that:
- Region x is North of region y, implying z (being further South from y) must also be South of x. 

Thus, the possible direction relation between region x and region z is South.
