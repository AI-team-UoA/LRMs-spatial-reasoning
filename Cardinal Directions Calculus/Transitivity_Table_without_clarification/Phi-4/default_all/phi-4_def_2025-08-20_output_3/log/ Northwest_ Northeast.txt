PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northeast of region z, then the possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest. This is because:

- Region x is to the Northwest of region y, meaning it is both north and west of y.
- Region y is to the Northeast of region z, meaning it is both north and east of z.

Combining these, region x will be north and west of region z, placing it in the Northwest direction relative to region z.
