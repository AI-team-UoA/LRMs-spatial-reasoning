PROMPT: Let North and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is North of region y, and region y is Northeast of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z could be North or Northwest. This is because region x must be above region z and may also be to the west of region z, depending on the specific positions.
