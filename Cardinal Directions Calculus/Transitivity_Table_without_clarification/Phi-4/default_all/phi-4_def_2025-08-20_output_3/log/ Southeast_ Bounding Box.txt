PROMPT: Let  Southeast and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Southeast of region y, and region y is the Bounding Box of region z, then region x is also Southeast of region z. This is because the Bounding Box (region y) contains region z entirely, meaning that the relative position of region x to region y will also be its relative position to region z. Thus, the possible relation is:

- Southeast of region z.
