PROMPT: Let  Southeast and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Southeast of region y, and region y is West of region z, then region x could be directly Southeast of region z. However, depending on the relative distances, region x could also be somewhere in the Eastern or Southeastern quadrant relative to region z. The specific directional relation between region x and region z will be Southeast.
