PROMPT: Let  South and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southeast, and Southwest. 

Explanation:
1. If x is South of y, then x is directly below y.
2. If y is Southwest of z, then y is diagonally down-left from z.

Combining these, x could be:
- Directly South of z (if it aligns with the south direction of z beyond y),
- Southeast of z (diagonally below-right from z),
- Southwest of z (diagonally below-left from z).
