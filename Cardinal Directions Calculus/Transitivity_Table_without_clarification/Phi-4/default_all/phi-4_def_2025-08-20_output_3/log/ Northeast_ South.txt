PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Region x could be East or Northeast of region z. 

Here's the reasoning:
- If region x is Northeast of region y, it means region x is to the North and East of region y.
- If region y is South of region z, it means region y is below region z.
- Combining these, region x would be either directly East of region z (if the North shift is less impactful) or Northeast if both the North and East shifts are significant.
