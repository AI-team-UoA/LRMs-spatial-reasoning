PROMPT: Let  West and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is West of region y, and region y is Northwest of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z could be West or Southwest. This is because moving West of an area that is itself Northwest suggests a movement further to the West or slightly South. Thus, x could be directly West of z or to the Southwest of z.
