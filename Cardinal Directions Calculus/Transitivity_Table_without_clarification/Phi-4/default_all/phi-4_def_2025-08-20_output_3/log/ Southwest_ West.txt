PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Southwest of region y, and region y is West of region z, then region x is Southeast of region z. The Southeast direction is derived by combining the displacements: Southwest from y to x involves moving South and West relative to y, and since y is West of z, x would be further Southeast relative to z. So, the possible relation between region x and region z is Southeast.
