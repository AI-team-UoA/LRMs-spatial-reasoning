PROMPT: Let  West and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Region x could be West or Southwest of region z. 

Explanation:
- If region x is West of region y and region y is Southwest of region z, then region x could be aligned more to the West when compared to z, making it West of z.
- Region x could also fall Southwest of z if the relative positions allow for y being Southwest of z and x being directly on a path that lies in the Southwest when extended towards z.
