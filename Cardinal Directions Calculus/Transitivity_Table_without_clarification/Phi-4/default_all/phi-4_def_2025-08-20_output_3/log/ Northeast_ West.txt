PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the information:

- Region x is Northeast of region y.
- Region y is West of region z.

When we analyze the relationship between x and z:

- If x is Northeast of y, it means x is to the North and East of y.
- If y is West of z, it means y is to the West of z.

To visualize this:
- Place y to the West of z.
- Then place x to the Northeast of y.

From this arrangement, x is both North and East of y and, because y is West of z, x ends up being North or Northeast of z. Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:

- Northeast
- North
