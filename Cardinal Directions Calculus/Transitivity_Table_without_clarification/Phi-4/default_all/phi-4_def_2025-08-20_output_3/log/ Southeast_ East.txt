PROMPT: Let  Southeast and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z could be Southeast or South. 

Here's the reasoning:
- If region x is Southeast of region y and region y is East of region z, then region x is further to the right (East) from region z, and either directly South or Southeast relative to region z. Thus, x could be either Southeast or directly South of z, depending on the relative distances between these regions in the cardinal directions.
