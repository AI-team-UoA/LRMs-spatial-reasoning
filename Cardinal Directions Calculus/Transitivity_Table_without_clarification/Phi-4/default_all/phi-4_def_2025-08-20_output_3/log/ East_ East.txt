PROMPT: Let  East and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

If region \( x \) is East of region \( y \), and region \( y \) is East of region \( z \), then region \( x \) must also be East of region \( z \). The possible relation between region \( x \) and region \( z \) is East.
