PROMPT: Let  West and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are Southeast and South. Since x is West of y and y is South of z, x would be to the Southwest of z in a direct line, but in terms of broader cardinal directions, this positions x to the Southeast or directly South of z, depending on the relative line of sight from z.
