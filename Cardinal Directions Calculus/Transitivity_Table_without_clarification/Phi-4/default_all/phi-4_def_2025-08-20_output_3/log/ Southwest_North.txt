PROMPT: Let  Southwest and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is Southwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then the possible relation between region x and region z could be Southwest. This is because moving from region z to region y requires moving South, and then moving from y to x requires moving West and South, leading overall to a Southwest direction from region z to region x.
