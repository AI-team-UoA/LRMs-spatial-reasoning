PROMPT: Let  South and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is South of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x could be South, Southwest, or directly West of region z. The bounding box formed by these regions would depend on their specific positions, but the direct cardinal relation between x and z would be South or Southwest.
