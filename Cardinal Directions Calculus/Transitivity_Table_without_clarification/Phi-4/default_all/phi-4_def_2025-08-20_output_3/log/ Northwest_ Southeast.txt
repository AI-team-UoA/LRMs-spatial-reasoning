PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is West. 

Explanation:
- If region x is Northwest of region y, this means x is to the north and to the west of y.
- If region y is Southeast of region z, this means y is to the south and to the east of z.
- Combining these directions, x would be both to the north and to the west of y, and y being to the south and east of z places x to the northwest of z but directly aligns x to the west of z. Therefore, the direct cardinal direction relation between x and z is West.
