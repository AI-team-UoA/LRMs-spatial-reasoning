PROMPT: Let  East and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is East of region y, it means x is directly to the east of y. If region y is Southeast of region z, y is diagonally to the southeast relative to z. Therefore, x, being east of y and given y's position southeast of z, could be either East or Southeast of z. Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are East and Southeast.
