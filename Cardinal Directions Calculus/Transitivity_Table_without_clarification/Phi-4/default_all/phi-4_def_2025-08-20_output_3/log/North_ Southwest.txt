PROMPT: Let North and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If region x is North of region y, then region x is somewhere directly above region y. If region y is Southwest of region z, then region z is Northeast of region y. 

To determine the relation between region x and region z, consider how these directions combine:

- Since y is Southwest of z, z is to the Northeast of y.
- x being North of y means x is directly above y on the map.

By combining these, x must be somewhere North or Northeast of z, because to move from z to y you go Northeast, then from y to x you go North. 

Therefore, the possible direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast.
