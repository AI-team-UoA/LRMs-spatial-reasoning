PROMPT: Let  Northwest and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, region x could be Northwest or North of region z. In relation to cardinal directions, for region x to be Northwest of region y while region y is North of region z, region x must also be either Northwest (direct line action from y) or North (moving horizontally from north position) of region z. Thus, the possible relations are Northwest and North.
