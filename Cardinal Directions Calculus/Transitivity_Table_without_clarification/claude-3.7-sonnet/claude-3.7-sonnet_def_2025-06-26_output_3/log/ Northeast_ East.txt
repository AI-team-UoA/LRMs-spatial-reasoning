PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I need to figure out the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that:
- Region x is Northeast of region y
- Region y is East of region z

Let me think about what these relations mean spatially:

When region x is Northeast of region y, it means that x is both North and East of y.
When region y is East of region z, it means that y is directly East of z.

Now, let's reason about where x could be relative to z:

We know:
- x is Northeast of y (meaning x is both North and East of y)
- y is East of z (meaning y is directly East of z)

If y is directly East of z, and x is Northeast of y, then x must be:
1. East of z (because x is East of y, and y is East of z, so x is also East of z by transitivity)
2. North of z (because x is North of y, and y is at the same latitude as z, so x is also North of z)

So, x is both North and East of z, which means x is Northeast of z.

But wait, I need to be more careful. The cardinal direction relations can be interpreted in different ways. Let me think about this more precisely.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations can be defined using different models. One common model is the cone-based model, where each cardinal direction corresponds to a cone-shaped region.

Let's reconsider using this understanding:

If region x is Northeast of region y, it means x is in the Northeast cone or sector as viewed from y.
If region y is East of region z, it means y is in the East cone or sector as viewed from z.

Now, if we combine these:
- y is in the East sector as viewed from z
- x is in the Northeast sector as viewed from y

Where can x be, as viewed from z?

Since y is East of z, and x is Northeast of y, x could be:
- Northeast of z
- East of z (if x is just slightly north of y)
- North of z (if x is quite north of y and not too much further east than y)

Let me double-check this with a different approach.

Imagine a coordinate system where z is at the origin (0, 0).
Since y is East of z, y could be at position (a, 0) where a > 0.
Since x is Northeast of y, x could be at position (a+b, c) where b, c > 0.

So, x is at position (a+b, c) relative to z. This means x is:
- East of z (because a+b > 0)
- North of z (because c > 0)

Thus, x is Northeast of z.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. The interpretation of cardinal directions can be more nuanced.

Let's use the 9-intersection model (also known as the projection-based model) for cardinal directions. In this model, the space is divided into 9 regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Central.

Given:
- x is Northeast of y
- y is East of z

In the 9-intersection model:
- If y is East of z, then y's longitude is greater than z's, but they have similar latitudes.
- If x is Northeast of y, then x's longitude is greater than y's and x's latitude is greater than y's.

Combining these:
- x's longitude is greater than y's, which is greater than z's.
- x's latitude is greater than y's, which is similar to z's.

So, x's longitude is definitely greater than z's. And x's latitude is greater than z's. Thus, x is Northeast of z.

Actually, let me be even more careful. The exact definition of cardinal direction relations can vary. 

Let's use a more general interpretation and consider regions (not just points).

If region y is East of region z, it means that the minimum longitude of y is greater than the maximum longitude of z.
If region x is Northeast of region y, it means:
- The minimum longitude of x is greater than the maximum longitude of y.
- The minimum latitude of x is greater than the maximum latitude of y.

Combining these:
- The minimum longitude of x is greater than the maximum longitude of y, which is greater than the maximum longitude of z. So, x is East of z.
- The minimum latitude of x is greater than the maximum latitude of y, which is not necessarily related to the latitude of z. However, since y is East of z, their latitudes are related.

Hmm, this gets tricky with regions. Let me step back and consider the most standard interpretation using the 9-intersection model.

In the 9-intersection model, the space around a reference region is divided into 9 tiles. If a region falls completely within one of these tiles, then it has the corresponding cardinal direction relation.

Given this:
- If y is East of z, then y is completely within the East tile of z.
- If x is Northeast of y, then x is completely within the Northeast tile of y.

Where can x be relative to z? It depends on the exact position of y within the East tile of z, and the exact position of x within the Northeast tile of y.

I'll imagine a scenario:
- z is at the origin (0, 0).
- y is at (2, 0), which is East of z.
- x is at (3, 1), which is Northeast of y.

In this scenario, x is at (3, 1) relative to z, which is Northeast of z.

But what if:
- z is at the origin (0, 0).
- y is at (2, 0), which is East of z.
- x is at (2.5, 1.5), which is Northeast of y.

In this scenario, x is at (2.5, 1.5) relative to z, which is still Northeast of z.

It seems like regardless of the exact positions (within the constraints), x will always be Northeast of z. This is because the East relation and the Northeast relation, when combined, restrict x to be both East and North of z, which is the definition of Northeast.

So, the relation between x and z should be Northeast.

Actually, I'm being overly convoluted. Let's simplify:

- If y is East of z, then y is to the right of z on a map.
- If x is Northeast of y, then x is to the upper right of y on a map.

Combining these:
- Since y is to the right of z, and x is to the upper right of y, x is to the upper right of z, which is Northeast.

But I think I'm slightly conflating some concepts. Let me think more carefully.

Northeast relation: If region x is Northeast of region y, it means x is both North and East of y. 
East relation: If region y is East of region z, it means y is directly East of z.

Let me draw it out to be clearer:
If we consider the centroid of each region, z could be at the origin (0, 0), and y could be at (a, 0) where a > 0. Then, x could be at (a+b, c) where b, c > 0. So, x is at position (a+b, c) relative to z, which is Northeast.

Actually, I might be confused here. Let me try to understand the cardinal direction relations in a different way.

I'll consider point-based relations. If z is at the origin (0, 0), and y is East of z, then y is at (a, 0) where a > 0. If x is Northeast of y, then x is at (a+b, c) where b, c > 0. So, x is at position (a+b, c) relative to z. Since a+b > 0 and c > 0, x is Northeast of z.

But regions are more complex. Let's consider the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of each region. The MBR is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

If the MBR of y is East of the MBR of z, it means the minimum x-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z.
If the MBR of x is Northeast of the MBR of y, it means:
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.

Combining these:
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y, which is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z. So, the MBR of x is East of the MBR of z.
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y. Now, if the maximum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, then the MBR of x is North of the MBR of z. But if not, we can't say for sure.

Hmm, maybe I don't need to be this detailed. Let's go back to the point-based reasoning, which is more intuitive.

If z is at the origin (0, 0), and y is East of z, then y is at (a, 0) where a > 0. If x is Northeast of y, then x is at (a+b, c) where b, c > 0. So, x is at position (a+b, c) relative to z. Since a+b > 0 and c > 0, x is Northeast of z.

So, the answer would be Northeast. But now I see a complication, especially with the way the cardinal direction relations are defined in the problem.

If "East" refers to the strict East (directly to the right), and "Northeast" refers to the strict Northeast (diagonally up and to the right), then my analysis above holds.

But if "East" is more general (anything to the right), and "Northeast" is more general (anything in the upper right quadrant), then the relation between x and z could be Northeast or East.

Let's see... if y is generally to the right of z (not necessarily directly), and x is generally in the upper right quadrant relative to y (not necessarily at a 45-degree angle), then x could be:
- Northeast of z (if x is significantly north of both y and z)
- East of z (if x is just slightly north of y, and y is not significantly north of z)

But I think the most conservative answer, based on the given information, is that x is Northeast of z.

But now I've realized an additional possibility. Let's consider:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (3, 0), which is East of z
- x is at (4, 3), which is Northeast of y

In this case, x is at (4, 3) relative to z, which is Northeast of z.

But what if:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (3, 0), which is East of z
- x is at (3.5, 3), which is Northeast of y

In this case, x is at (3.5, 3) relative to z. If Northeast strictly means at a 45-degree angle, then x might not be exactly Northeast of z. But if Northeast means in the upper right quadrant, then x is Northeast of z.

But now, consider this:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (3, 1), which is East of z if we consider a broader definition of East
- x is at (4, 4), which is Northeast of y

In this case, x is at (4, 4) relative to z, which is Northeast of z.

But what if:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (3, -1), which is East of z if we consider a broader definition of East
- x is at (4, 0), which is Northeast of y

In this case, x is at (4, 0) relative to z, which is East of z.

Hmm, it seems like the relation between x and z could be either Northeast or East, depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z within the constraints of the given relations.

Actually, I've been over-complicating this. In the context of the problem, the cardinal direction relations likely refer to the 9-intersection or tile-based model. In this model, the space is partitioned into 9 tiles based on relative directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Center.

Given this model:
- If y is East of z, then y is entirely within the East tile of z.
- If x is Northeast of y, then x is entirely within the Northeast tile of y.

Let's visualize this:
- Z is at the center, surrounded by 8 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).
- Y is in the East tile of Z.
- Y is also a center, surrounded by 8 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).
- X is in the Northeast tile of Y.

Now, where is X relative to Z? It's in the East tile of Z, and then in the Northeast tile of that region. Given the geometry, X can only be in the Northeast tile of Z.

So, based on the 9-intersection model, the relation between X and Z should be Northeast.

But wait, I need to be careful. The 9-intersection model divides the space into 9 tiles, but the size of each tile can vary based on the size of the reference region. Let's re-analyze.

If y is East of z, it means the centroid of y is in the East tile of z. Now, from y's perspective, y is the center, and x is in the Northeast tile of y. So, the centroid of x is in the Northeast tile of y.

From z's perspective, where is the centroid of x? It's to the East and then to the Northeast. This would place it in the Northeast tile of z.

So, based on the centroid-based approach with the 9-intersection model, the relation between x and z should be Northeast.

Actually, I think my original analysis was correct. If y is East of z, and x is Northeast of y, then x is most likely Northeast of z. But there are edge cases (depending on the exact model and interpretation) where x could be East of z.

But in the most standard interpretation, x would be Northeast of z.

Actually, wait, I think I'm still complicating this. Let's say:
- z is at the origin (0, 0).
- y is directly to the east of z, so y is at (a, 0) where a > 0.
- x is to the northeast of y, so x is at (a+b, c) where b, c > 0.

Relative to z, x is at (a+b, c), which is in the northeast direction from z since a+b > 0 and c > 0.

So, x is Northeast of z.

But, let's consider another scenario, using a more general interpretation of cardinal directions.

In the 9-tile model (or the projection-based model):
- If y is East of z, it means y is entirely within the East tile of z.
- If x is Northeast of y, it means x is entirely within the Northeast tile of y.

Where can x be relative to z? The Northeast tile of the East tile of z can map to more than one tile relative to z. Depending on the exact location, x could be:
- Northeast of z (most likely)
- East of z (if x is close to the East-Northeast border of y, and y is close to the East-Center border of z)

I'm getting more convinced that there's a range of possibilities, and it depends on the exact model used and the exact positions of the regions.

Let me try to be definitive. Based on the most standard interpretation of cardinal direction relations, if y is East of z, and x is Northeast of y, then x is most likely to be Northeast of z. But there's a possibility that x could be East of z, depending on the exact positions.

Actually, I think the most accurate answer would be that x could be either Northeast or East of z, with Northeast being the more likely relation.

Actually, I think it might help to draw this out. Let me imagine a 2D plane with a grid:

```
  ^
  |
  N
  |
W-+-E
  |
  S
  v
```

Let's say z is at the origin (0, 0). If y is East of z, then y is at a point (a, 0) where a > 0. If x is Northeast of y, then x is at a point (a+b, c) where b, c > 0.

So, relative to z, x is at (a+b, c). Since a+b > 0 and c > 0, x is Northeast of z.

But this is assuming a point-based model. In a region-based model, it gets more complex. But I think, in most scenarios, x would still be Northeast of z. However, in some edge cases, x could be East of z.

Let me have one more attempt using a different approach.

I'll consider a scenario where I place regions z, y, and x on a grid, ensuring they respect the given cardinal direction relations.

Let's say:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is East of z, so y is at (3, 0).
- x is Northeast of y, so x is at (5, 2).

Relative to z, x is at (5, 2), which is Northeast of z.

But what if:
- z is at (0, 0) with a size of 1x1.
- y is East of z, so y's centroid is at (3, 0) with a size of 1x1.
- x is Northeast of y, so x's centroid is at (5, 2) with a size of 1x1.

Relative to z, x's centroid is at (5, 2), which is Northeast of z.

I'm really starting to believe that the relation between x and z is Northeast, without other possibilities. 

Let me try one more edge case:
- z is at (0, 0) with a size of 1x1.
- y is East of z, so y's left edge is just to the right of z's right edge. Say, y's centroid is at (1.5, 0) with a size of 1x1.
- x is Northeast of y, so x's bottom-left corner is just above and to the right of y's top-right corner. Say, x's centroid is at (2.5, 1) with a size of 1x1.

Relative to z, x's centroid is at (2.5, 1), which is Northeast of z.

It seems like regardless of the exact setup (within the constraints), x will always be Northeast of z. This is because, geometrically, if you move East from a point and then Northeast, you'll always end up in the Northeast direction from the original point.

So, the relation between x and z should be Northeast.

Actually, no, I'm being way too rigid here. I was ignoring the fact that when we talk about cardinal direction relations between regions, there's a lot more flexibility. The direction from one region to another depends on how we measure it: we could use centroids, we could use borders, or we could use the entire regions.

Let's consider a more general approach using the 9-intersection model for cardinal directions.

In the 9-intersection model:
- If region y is East of region z, it means y falls entirely within the East tile of z.
- If region x is Northeast of region y, it means x falls entirely within the Northeast tile of y.

Now, the crucial question is: Where does the Northeast tile of the East tile of z overlap with the tiles of z? This overlap defines the possible relations between x and z.

The Northeast tile of the East tile will overlap with the Northeast and the East tiles of z. Let me try to understand this by visualizing:

```
 NW | N | NE
----|---|----
  W | C | E
----|---|----
 SW | S | SE
```

This represents the 9 tiles around a reference region. If z is the reference region and y is in the E tile, then y can be represented as:
```
    |   |   
----|---|----
    | y |   
----|---|----
    |   |   
```

Now, from y's perspective, the 9 tiles look like:
```
 NW | N | NE
----|---|----
  W | y | E
----|---|----
 SW | S | SE
```

If x is in the NE tile of y, then x's position is:
```
    |   | x 
----|---|----
    | y |   
----|---|----
    |   |   
```

Now, from z's perspective, where is x? It's in the East tile and then in the Northeast of that region. This would place it in the Northeast tile of z:
```
    |   | x 
----|---|----
    | z |   
----|---|----
    |   |   
```

But I'm being too strict. The Northeast tile of the East tile can overlap with both the Northeast and the East tiles of the original reference, depending on the exact layout.

Imagine z's 9 tiles as:
```
 NW | N | NE
----|---|----
  W | z | E
----|---|----
 SW | S | SE
```

If y is in the E tile, and x is in the NE tile of y, then x can be either in the NE tile of z or the E tile of z, depending on the exact layout.

But actually, I can show geometrically that the Northeast tile of the East tile always intersects with the Northeast tile of the original reference.

Let's imagine z at the origin (0, 0). The 9 tiles around z can be viewed as:
```
(-1,1) | (0,1) | (1,1)
-------|-------|-------
(-1,0) | (0,0) | (1,0)
-------|-------|-------
(-1,-1)| (0,-1)| (1,-1)
```

If y is in the East tile, then y is at position (1, 0). The 9 tiles around y can be viewed as:
```
(0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1)
------|-------|-------
(0,0) | (1,0) | (2,0)
------|-------|-------
(0,-1)| (1,-1)| (2,-1)
```

If x is in the Northeast tile of y, then x is at position (2, 1). Relative to z, x is at position (2, 1), which is in the Northeast tile of z.

This suggests that if y is East of z, and x is Northeast of y, then x is Northeast of z. I think this is the most accurate answer.

But I was thinking if there are any edge cases I'm missing.

Let's consider a more general scenario, where we're considering whole regions with varying sizes, not just single points. 

But actually, I think the answer still holds. In the 9-intersection model, if region y is entirely within the East tile of z, and region x is entirely within the Northeast tile of y, then region x is entirely within the Northeast tile of z. This is because the Northeast tile of the East tile is contained entirely within the Northeast tile of the original reference.

Actually, that's not entirely accurate. For regions, the cardinal direction relations are more complex.

Ok, let me consider a model where each region is represented by its Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR).

The 9-intersection model divides the space around a reference region's MBR into 9 tiles. If the MBR of a target region falls entirely within one of these tiles, then the target has the corresponding cardinal direction relation to the reference.

But this is where I'm getting confused. I'm not sure if this is the model the problem uses, and I'm not sure if I'm applying it correctly.

Actually, I'll go with the most standard interpretation. In the 9-intersection model, if region y is East of region z, and region x is Northeast of region y, then region x is most likely to be Northeast of region z.

But, considering the fact that regions have size and shape, there might be edge cases where x could have other relations to z.

In the cone-based model (where directions are defined by cones emanating from the centroid of the reference region), if the centroid of y is East of the centroid of z, and the centroid of x is Northeast of the centroid of y, then the centroid of x is Northeast of the centroid of z. This is geometrically guaranteed.

So, in the most standard interpretation, the relation between x and z should be Northeast.

Let's reflect, we know:
- Region x is Northeast of region y
- Region y is East of region z

So the possible relations between region x and region z are most certainly:
- Northeast

And if we just want to be super sure we're covering all bases (which the question is asking for), we should also consider:
- East (in some edge cases, depending on the model)

But I'm confident the correct answer is just "Northeast". Let me check if there are any other edge cases I'm missing.

Actually, let me reconsider by making a change to my assumptions so far. I think a more accurate way of thinking about these relations when regions are involved is to use the concept of a "Bounding Box". The bounding box is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

In this model, I might define cardinal direction relations as follows:
- Region y is East of region z if the minimum x-coordinate of y's bounding box is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z's bounding box.
- Region x is Northeast of region y if the minimum x-coordinate of x's bounding box is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y's bounding box and the minimum y-coordinate of x's bounding box is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y's bounding box.

Given these definitions, if y is East of z, and x is Northeast of y, then we can derive:
- The minimum x-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z.
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.

From the first two, we can conclude: The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z. This means x is East of z.

Additionally, the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y. But we don't know the relation between the y-coordinates of y and z. So, we're not sure if x is North of z.

So in this interpretation, the relation between x and z could be:
- Northeast (if the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z)
- East (if the minimum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of z)

I think this interpretation is more accurate, and it suggests that the relation between x and z could be either Northeast or East. But are there any other edge cases?

Actually, I think there's another possible relation. If z's bounding box extends higher than y's bounding box, and x's bounding box is Northeast of y's bounding box (without any overlap), then x's bounding box could be at a position where it's only East of z's bounding box, without being North of it. In such a case, the relation between x and z would be East.

Now I think the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East

Let me double-check this by visualizing it with specific coordinates.

Let's say:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 0) to (2, 3).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 1) to (5, 2). (This ensures y is East of z.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 3) to (7, 4). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is at a position where it's both East and North of z's bounding box. So, the relation between x and z is Northeast.

Now, let's modify the setup:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 0) to (2, 5).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 1) to (5, 3). (This ensures y is East of z, but not North.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 4) to (7, 5). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this modified setup, x's bounding box is East of z's bounding box, but it's not entirely North of z's bounding box (since the maximum y-coordinate of z is 5, which is equal to the maximum y-coordinate of x). So, the relation between x and z is not Northeast. The relation between x and z is ambiguous in this model, but it's not purely Northeast or purely East.

Actually, in the projection-based model (also known as the 9-intersection model), a region is said to be in the Northeast of another if it is both in the North and in the East. In the setup I just described, x is East of z, but it's not North of z (since their bounding boxes have an overlap in the North-South direction). So, the relation between x and z is East, not Northeast.

Let me re-evaluate the original problem. If we're using the projection-based model, and given that y is East of z, and x is Northeast of y, then x can be either Northeast of z or East of z, depending on the exact layout of the regions.

To summarize, based on the projection-based model with bounding boxes, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East

Are there any other possibilities I'm overlooking?

Actually, I realized I should make sure of the model being used here. The problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll stick with the most standard interpretation.

For cardinal direction relations, the most standard model is the projection-based (or 9-intersection) model. In this model, if a region is Northeast of another, it means it's both North and East of the other region.

Given:
- Region x is Northeast of region y (x is both North and East of y).
- Region y is East of region z (y is East of z, but not necessarily North).

The relation between x and z depends on the exact layout of the regions. But in most scenarios, x would be Northeast of z. However, in some edge cases, x could be East of z (for instance, if z extends further North than y, and x is just slightly North of y).

Ok, hold on. I realize I've been confusing what the question is asking me to do. It's asking me what the possible relations between x and z could be. So the answer is definitely not just "Northeast", but rather includes both "Northeast" and "East". 

Is there any other relation that x could have with z?

Well, could x be North of z? Let's check that:
- Region x is Northeast of region y (x is both North and East of y).
- Region y is East of region z (y is East of z, but not necessarily North).

For x to be North of z, x would need to be directly above z. But given that x is both North and East of y, and y is East of z, x is definitely East of z. So, x cannot be purely North of z.

OK, now let's think of one more possibility, could x be even more to the East, such that it's Southeast of z?

No, that's not possible. If x is Northeast of y, then x is North of y. And if y is East of z, then y is not South of z. So, x cannot be South of z, which means x cannot be Southeast of z.

Lastly, are there any other, possibly rarer models of cardinal direction where there could be other relations? I'm not aware of any.

But actually, let me check the bounding box model one more time, since this could be what the problem is getting at.

In the bounding box model, cardinal direction relations are defined based on the relative positions of the bounding boxes of the regions. Let's reconsider the problem:

- Region x is Northeast of region y (The bounding box of x is both North and East of the bounding box of y).
- Region y is East of region z (The bounding box of y is East of the bounding box of z, but not necessarily North).

I realized something: the relationship between y and z in the y-dimension is not specified. Let's consider a case where y's bounding box is actually South of z's bounding box.

Let's say:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 3) to (2, 5).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 0) to (5, 2). (This ensures y is East of z, but also South.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 3) to (7, 4). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is East of z's bounding box, but it's not North of z's bounding box (since the minimum y-coordinate of x is 3, which is the same as the minimum y-coordinate of z). In fact, in the y-dimension, x and z's bounding boxes are at the same level. So, the relation between x and z is East, not Northeast.

Let's try another:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 3) to (2, 4).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 0) to (5, 2). (This ensures y is East of z, but also South.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 3) to (7, 5). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is East of z's bounding box, and it's also North of z's bounding box (since the maximum y-coordinate of z is 4, which is less than the maximum y-coordinate of x). So, the relation between x and z is Northeast.

What about another scenario?
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 4) to (2, 6).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 1) to (5, 3). (This ensures y is East of z, but also South.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 4) to (7, 5). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is East of z's bounding box, but it's not North of z's bounding box (since the maximum y-coordinate of x is 5, which is less than the maximum y-coordinate of z). In fact, in the y-dimension, x's bounding box is South of z's bounding box. So, the relation between x and z is East, not Northeast.

Hmm, if y is South and East of z, and x is Northeast of y, then can x be Southeast of z? Let's check it:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 7) to (2, 9).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 1) to (5, 3). (This ensures y is East and South of z.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 4) to (7, 5). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is East of z's bounding box, and it's also South of z's bounding box. So, the relation between x and z is Southeast.

So, based on the bounding box model, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, I'm starting to see that there are even more possibilities I've overlooked. The problem is under-constrained in the y-dimension, which leads to multiple possible relations between x and z.

It's confusing because it depends on the exact layout and the choice of the model used for cardinal directions.

Actually, I forgot to consider a case where x could be North of z. Let me check that:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 0) to (10, 2).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (11, 0) to (12, 2). (This ensures y is East of z.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (13, 3) to (14, 4). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is North of z's bounding box, but it's also East of z's bounding box. So, the relation between x and z is Northeast, not just North.

Actually, let me reason about this carefully. In the projection-based model, the cardinal direction of x relative to z is determined by the position of x's bounding box relative to z's bounding box.

If y is East of z, then the minimum x-coordinate of y's bounding box is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z's bounding box. And if x is Northeast of y, then the minimum x-coordinate of x's bounding box is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y's bounding box, and the minimum y-coordinate of x's bounding box is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y's bounding box.

From these two facts, we can deduce that the minimum x-coordinate of x's bounding box is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z's bounding box. This means x is East of z.

But we don't know the relation between y's bounding box and z's bounding box in the y-dimension. If y's bounding box is North of z's bounding box, and x's bounding box is North of y's bounding box, then x's bounding box is North of z's bounding box, making x Northeast of z.

If y's bounding box is at the same level as z's bounding box in the y-dimension, and x's bounding box is North of y's bounding box, then x's bounding box could be either North of z's bounding box or at the same level as z's bounding box, depending on the exact heights. This makes x either Northeast of z or East of z.

If y's bounding box is South of z's bounding box, and x's bounding box is North of y's bounding box, then x's bounding box could be North of z's bounding box, at the same level as z's bounding box, or South of z's bounding box, depending on the exact positions. This makes x either Northeast of z, East of z, or Southeast of z.

So, based on the projection-based model with bounding boxes, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

So far, the possible relations between regions x and z are:

1. Northeast (x is both North and East of z)
2. East (x is East of z, but not North)
3. Southeast (x is East and South of z)

Is that a definitive list? 

I can't think of any more logical possibilities. I'm confident these are the three possible relations, given the constraints.

Let me check:
- Could x be North of z? No, because x is Northeast of y, and y is East of z, so x must be East of z. It can't be directly North.
- Could x be Northwest of z? No, because x is Northeast of y, and y is East of z, so x must be East of z. It can't be West.
- Could x be West of z? No, for the same reason.
- Could x be Southwest of z? No, because x is Northeast of y, which means x is North of y. So, x can't be Southwest of z.
- Could x be South of z? No, for the same reason. If x is Northeast of y, then x is North of y. It can't be directly South of z.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, there's one more possibility: the bounding box. In certain models, a region can be said to be in the "Bounding Box" relation with another if one region's bounding box contains the other. But, given the constraints of the problem, I don't think this is a possibility here.

So my answer is: Northeast, East, Southeast.

Actually I think this is wrong. In the projection based model, if region y is East of region z, then y's bounding box is entirely in the East tile of z. And if region x is Northeast of region y, then x's bounding box is entirely in the Northeast tile of y.

But when we propagate these constraints, there's a problem. If y is in the East tile of z, and x is in the Northeast tile of y, then x is definitely in the East half of the plane relative to z. But its y-position is not fixed. x could be in the North half of the plane relative to z, it could be in the middle (same y-level as z), or it could be in the South half of the plane. That makes x either Northeast, East, or Southeast of z, respectively.

Let's do one more check to make sure I haven't missed anything. In the projection-based model, cardinal directions are defined by the partition of the plane into 9 tiles. If y is East of z, then the bounding box of y is entirely within the East tile of z. And if x is Northeast of y, then the bounding box of x is entirely within the Northeast tile of y.

We know that the East tile of z and the Northeast tile of y are both unbounded, extending indefinitely in the East direction. 

Given that y is entirely within the East tile of z, and x is entirely within the Northeast tile of y, where can x be relative to z?

Ah, the problem is that I forgot that the East and Northeast tiles are defined based on the dimension of the reference region.

If the bounding box of z is from (0, 0) to (2, 2), then the East tile of z starts from x = 2. And if the bounding box of y is from (3, 0) to (4, 2), then the Northeast tile of y starts from x = 4 and y = 2.

So, the bounding box of x, being in the Northeast tile of y, must start from at least (4, 2).

Now, relative to z, the bounding box of x starts from at least (4, 2), which is both East and North of z. So, the relation between x and z is Northeast.

Actually I'm making this way more complicated than it is, and I realize the problem is too under-constrained to get a definitive answer.

If I had to guess, the intended answer is probably "Northeast", since that's the most intuitive relation given the constraints. But I can demonstrate that "East" and "Southeast" are also valid relations, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, I'm not sure if "Southeast" is a valid answer. Let me check once more:

If y is East of z, and x is Northeast of y, then x is East of z. But the relation between x and z in the y-dimension is not fixed. It depends on the exact positions of the regions. 

For x to be Southeast of z, x needs to be both East and South of z. We know x is East of z. For it to be South of z, the maximum y-coordinate of x should be less than the minimum y-coordinate of z.

Let's set up an example to see if this is possible:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 5) to (2, 7).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 0) to (5, 2). (This ensures y is East of z, but also South.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 3) to (7, 4). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is East of z's bounding box, and it's also South of z's bounding box (since the maximum y-coordinate of x is 4, which is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z, which is 5). So, the relation between x and z is Southeast.

Let's try a more extreme example:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 10) to (1, 11).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (2, 0) to (3, 1). (This ensures y is East of z, but also South.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (4, 2) to (5, 3). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is East of z's bounding box, and it's also South of z's bounding box (since the maximum y-coordinate of x is 3, which is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z, which is 10). So, the relation between x and z is Southeast.

Actually, wait, I see my confusion. The constraints allow for y to be placed far South of z, and for x to be North of y but still South of z. In this case, x would be Southeast of z. So, "Southeast" is a valid answer.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

One more thing: I think "Northwest" is not a valid answer, because if y is East of z, and x is Northeast of y, then x is definitely East of z. Similarly, "North" is not a valid answer because x is also East of z. So are "Southwest", "South", and "West".

So, I'm sticking with: Northeast, East, and Southeast as the possible relations between regions x and z.

Actually, let me just quickly check one more variant of this. Using the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of each region:

Let's call R_z, R_y, and R_x the MBRs of z, y, and x, respectively.

Given:
- R_y is East of R_z: The minimum x-coordinate of R_y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of R_z.
- R_x is Northeast of R_y: The minimum x-coordinate of R_x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of R_y, and the minimum y-coordinate of R_x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of R_y.

From these, we can deduce:
- The minimum x-coordinate of R_x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of R_z (by transitivity). This means R_x is East of R_z.
- The relation between R_x and R_z in the y-dimension is not fixed. It depends on the relative positions of the MBRs in the y-dimension.

For R_x to be Northeast of R_z, the minimum y-coordinate of R_x should be greater than the maximum y-coordinate of R_z. For this to be true, and given that the minimum y-coordinate of R_x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of R_y, the maximum y-coordinate of R_y should be less than the maximum y-coordinate of R_z. But this is not guaranteed by the given constraints. Y can be North, at the same level, or South of Z.

For R_x to be East of R_z, the y-coordinates of R_x should overlap with the y-coordinates of R_z. This can happen in a variety of scenarios, depending on the exact positions of the MBRs.

For R_x to be Southeast of R_z, the maximum y-coordinate of R_x should be less than the minimum y-coordinate of R_z. For this to be true, and given that the minimum y-coordinate of R_x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of R_y, the maximum y-coordinate of R_y should be much less than the minimum y-coordinate of R_z. This is possible in the given constraints, as shown in the examples I provided earlier.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z, based on the projection-based model with MBRs, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, let me think of this again from the beginning. I think I was overcomplicating things.

If y is East of z, then y is in a region to the right of z. And if x is Northeast of y, then x is in a region above and to the right of y.

Given these two facts, where is x relative to z? It's definitely to the right of z. But is it above, at the same level, or below z? It depends on the exact positions of the regions. But in the most standard interpretation, x would be above and to the right of z, making it Northeast of z.

But if y is much below z, and x is above and to the right of y, then x could be at the same level as z or even below z. In these cases, x would be East or Southeast of z, respectively.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

I think these are all the possible relations, and I don't see any more. So my final answer is: Northeast, East, and Southeast.

Actually, let me re-check because this answer sounds fishy. I'm going to do this once more, and slightly differently.

Assume cardinal directions based on the projection-based model. Let's imagine a coordinate system:

```
  ^ N
  |
W-+-E
  |
  v S
```

I think the crux of my trouble is determining the relations between z and y in the North-South axis. So, let me draw out a different scenario.

We know that y is East of z (i.e., y's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate).

But in the North-South direction, y could be:
- North of z
- At the same level as z
- South of z

And we know that x is Northeast of y (i.e., x's x-coordinate is greater than y's x-coordinate, and x's y-coordinate is greater than y's y-coordinate).

So let's check these cases and see how x is related to z in each one.

1. If y is North of z, and x is Northeast of y, then x is Northeast of z.
2. If y is at the same level as z, and x is Northeast of y, then x is Northeast of z.
3. If y is South of z, and x is Northeast of y, then x could be:
   a. Northeast of z (if x's y-coordinate is greater than z's y-coordinate)
   b. East of z (if x's y-coordinate is the same as z's y-coordinate)
   c. Southeast of z (if x's y-coordinate is less than z's y-coordinate)

That actually confirms my earlier response: the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

But I'm somehow still confused. Let me just ignore all the confusion, and think about this from the beginning once more, to triple check.

Given:
- Region y is East of region z (y has a greater x-coordinate than z)
- Region x is Northeast of region y (x has a greater x-coordinate than y, and a greater y-coordinate than y)

Therefore, x has a greater x-coordinate than z (by transitivity). But the y-coordinate relation between x and z is not fixed. It depends on the exact y-coordinates of z, y, and x.

If z's y-coordinate is much greater than y's y-coordinate, and x's y-coordinate is just slightly greater than y's y-coordinate, then x's y-coordinate could be less than z's y-coordinate. In this case, x would be Southeast of z.

If z's y-coordinate is just slightly greater than y's y-coordinate, and x's y-coordinate is significantly greater than y's y-coordinate, then x's y-coordinate would be greater than z's y-coordinate. In this case, x would be Northeast of z.

If z's y-coordinate is the same as y's y-coordinate, and x's y-coordinate is greater than y's y-coordinate, then x's y-coordinate would be greater than z's y-coordinate. In this case, x would be Northeast of z.

But the question is, based on the given constraints, what are the possible relations between x and z? Without additional constraints, all three of the above are indeed possible (Northeast, East, and Southeast).

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually just to be careful, let me also check if x can be "North" of z. If x is greater in x-coordinate than z, and greater in y-coordinate than z, then x is "Northeast" of z, not just "North". 

Actually, a tricky part is that when I am trying to decide if x can be "East" of z, I need to be precise about what "East" means. Based on the projection model, a region is "East" of another if it has a greater x-coordinate and approximately the same y-coordinate. 

Similarly, a region is "Southeast" of another if it has a greater x-coordinate and a lesser y-coordinate.

Finally, a region is "Northeast" of another if it has a greater x-coordinate and a greater y-coordinate.

I've worked through examples for each of these, and I'm convinced that x can be any of the three in relation to z, depending on the specific positioning of the regions (which is compatible with the given constraints).

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

And that's my final answer.

Actually, now I'm being paranoid. Let me quadruple check. 

Given:
- Region x is Northeast of region y
- Region y is East of region z

I think part of my problem might be not precisely defining what "East" and "Northeast" mean.

So, let's define "East":
- Region A is East of region B if the minimum x-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of B, and the y-coordinates of A and B overlap.

And let's define "Northeast":
- Region A is Northeast of region B if the minimum x-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of B, and the minimum y-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of B.

Now, given:
- Region y is East of region z: The minimum x-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinates of y and z overlap.
- Region x is Northeast of region y: The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y, and the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.

From these, we can derive:
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z (by transitivity).

But the relation between the y-coordinates of x and z is not fixed. Depending on the exact positions, x can be:
- Northeast of z (if the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z)
- East of z (if the y-coordinates of x and z overlap)
- Southeast of z (if the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z)

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

OK, that's my final answer.

Wait a second. Let me look at what the definition of "East" again:
- Region A is East of region B if the minimum x-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of B, and the y-coordinates of A and B overlap.

This means, if region y is East of region z, then the y-coordinates of y and z overlap. And if region x is Northeast of region y, then the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.

Putting these together:
- The y-coordinates of y and z overlap.
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.

Is it possible for x to be Southeast of z? For x to be Southeast of z, the maximum y-coordinate of x should be less than the minimum y-coordinate of z. But this is incompatible with the constraints, because:
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.
- The y-coordinates of y and z overlap.

From these two, we can deduce that the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of z. This means x can't be Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East

But wait, that's not right. Let me use actual coordinates to check.

Let's say:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 4) to (2, 6).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 3) to (5, 5). (This ensures y is East of z, and the y-coordinates overlap.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 6) to (7, 7). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is Northeast of z's bounding box.

Now, let's try a different setup:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 4) to (2, 6).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 5) to (5, 6). (This ensures y is East of z, and the y-coordinates overlap.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 7) to (7, 8). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is Northeast of z's bounding box.

Let's try another setup to see if x can be East of z:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 4) to (2, 6).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 4) to (5, 5). (This ensures y is East of z, and the y-coordinates overlap.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 6) to (7, 7). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box is also Northeast of z's bounding box.

I'm not sure if I can find a setup where x is East of z. Let me try once more:
- z's bounding box is the rectangle from (0, 5) to (2, 8).
- y's bounding box is the rectangle from (3, 5) to (5, 6). (This ensures y is East of z, and the y-coordinates overlap.)
- x's bounding box is the rectangle from (6, 7) to (7, 8). (This ensures x is Northeast of y.)

In this setup, x's bounding box's y-coordinates overlap with z's bounding box's y-coordinates. So, x is East of z.

Actually I'm confused with my own thinking now.

Actually let me just try once more, from the beginning. One key thing is to be precise with the definitions of "East" and "Northeast", and to be careful with the constraints.

Let me define "East":
- Region A is East of region B if the minimum x-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of B, and the y-coordinates of A and B overlap.

And define "Northeast":
- Region A is Northeast of region B if the minimum x-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of B, and the minimum y-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of B.

Given:
- Region y is East of region z: The minimum x-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinates of y and z overlap.
- Region x is Northeast of region y: The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y, and the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.

Let's consider different scenarios to see what relations x can have with z.

Scenario 1:
- z has y-coordinates [2, 6].
- y has y-coordinates [3, 5]. (This ensures y and z's y-coordinates overlap.)
- x has y-coordinates [6, 8]. (This ensures x's minimum y-coordinate is greater than y's maximum y-coordinate.)

In this scenario, x's y-coordinates don't overlap with z's y-coordinates, and x's minimum y-coordinate is greater than z's maximum y-coordinate. So, x is Northeast of z.

Scenario 2:
- z has y-coordinates [5, 10].
- y has y-coordinates [6, 8]. (This ensures y and z's y-coordinates overlap.)
- x has y-coordinates [9, 11]. (This ensures x's minimum y-coordinate is greater than y's maximum y-coordinate.)

In this scenario, x's y-coordinates overlap with z's y-coordinates. So, x is East of z.

Scenario 3:
- z has y-coordinates [8, 10].
- y has y-coordinates [8, 9]. (This ensures y and z's y-coordinates overlap.)
- x has y-coordinates [10, 11]. (This ensures x's minimum y-coordinate is greater than y's maximum y-coordinate.)

In this scenario, x's minimum y-coordinate is equal to z's maximum y-coordinate. I think we could consider this as "East", since a strict interpretation of "Northeast" requires x's minimum y-coordinate to be strictly greater than z's maximum y-coordinate.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East

I don't think x can be Southeast of z, given the constraints.

Actually, maybe I'm being a bit too rigorous in our definitions.

Northeast relation: If region x is Northeast of region y, it means x is both North and East of y.
East relation: If region y is East of region z, it means y is directly East of z.

So now I realize that there's a bit of an issue with my definitions being different than the colloquial ones. 

OK, so the definition of "East" in this case might just be that y has a strictly greater x-coordinate than z (i.e., y is to the right of z). There's no constraint on the y-coordinates. Actually, this is also supported by the "projection-based" model, where a region is "East" of another if it's to the right of it, regardless of their y-coordinates.

So, given:
- Region y is East of region z: y is to the right of z (y's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate).
- Region x is Northeast of region y: x is to the right and above y (x's x-coordinate is greater than y's x-coordinate, and x's y-coordinate is greater than y's y-coordinate).

With these interpretations, where can x be relative to z?

We know x is to the right of y, and y is to the right of z. So, x is to the right of z (x's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate).

But for the y-coordinate, it's less constrained. X's y-coordinate is greater than y's y-coordinate. But y's y-coordinate could be greater than, equal to, or less than z's y-coordinate. So, x's y-coordinate could be:
- Greater than z's y-coordinate: In this case, x is Northeast of z.
- Equal to z's y-coordinate: In this case, x is East of z.
- Less than z's y-coordinate: In this case, x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

I think the confusion arose from the definition of "East". If "East" requires that the y-coordinates overlap (as in the more strict 9-intersection model), then the possible relations would be Northeast and East. But if "East" just means "to the right", without constraints on the y-coordinates, then the possible relations are Northeast, East, and Southeast.

Actually, in the 9-intersection model, "East" doesn't require y-coordinates to overlap; it just requires the region to be to the right of the reference region.

OK, I'm just going to go from the beginning again and be very clear. I think I'm doing a bunch of useless second-guessing.

Northeast relation: If region x is Northeast of region y, it means x is both North and East of y. In other words, if you think of a map, x is in the upper right quadrant relative to y.
East relation: If region y is East of region z, it means y is directly East of z. In other words, if you think of a map, y is to the right of z.

Given these interpretations, where can x be relative to z?

We know x is to the right of y, and y is to the right of z. So, x is to the right of z (i.e., x is in the Eastern half of the plane relative to z).

But for the North-South direction, it's less constrained. X is to the North of y. But y could be to the North of, at the same level as, or to the South of z. So, x could be:
- To the North and East of z: In this case, x is Northeast of z.
- Only to the East of z: In this case, x is East of z.
- To the South and East of z: In this case, x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

So my final answer is: Northeast, East, Southeast.

Actually, one more check. I need to be very precise about the definitions of "East" and "Northeast".

In the context of the question, "East" relation means that one region is situated directly to the east of the other. This doesn't mean they're at the same latitude; it just means that the first region is entirely to the east of the second. So, if y is East of z, then the westernmost point of y is further east than the easternmost point of z.

And "Northeast" relation means that one region is situated directly to the northeast of the other. If x is Northeast of y, then the southwestern-most point of x is further north and east than the northeastern-most point of y.

Given these interpretations, where can x be relative to z?

We know x is to the northeast of y, and y is to the east of z. So, x is to the east of z (because it's east of y, which is east of z). But x's position in the north-south direction relative to z is not fixed. It depends on the exact positions of the regions.

If y is far to the north of z, and x is just slightly to the north of y, then x might be to the southeast of z. If y is at the same level as z, and x is to the north of y, then x is to the northeast of z. If y is to the south of z, and x is to the north of y but still south of z, then x is to the southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between regions x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

I think this is correct. So my answer is: Northeast, East, Southeast.

Actually I'm doing too much second-guessing. Let me just clearly layout a diagram with 3 concrete examples:

For Northeast:
z: (0, 0) to (2, 2)
y: (3, 0) to (5, 2)
x: (6, 3) to (8, 5)

For East:
z: (0, 0) to (2, 5)
y: (3, 2) to (5, 4)
x: (6, 5) to (8, 7)

For Southeast:
z: (0, 5) to (2, 10)
y: (3, 0) to (5, 2)
x: (6, 3) to (8, 4)

These check out. x is northeast of y, and y is east of z, and in the 3 different cases, x is either northeast, east, or southeast of z. So the answer is northeast, east, or southeast.

Northeast, East, Southeast.
