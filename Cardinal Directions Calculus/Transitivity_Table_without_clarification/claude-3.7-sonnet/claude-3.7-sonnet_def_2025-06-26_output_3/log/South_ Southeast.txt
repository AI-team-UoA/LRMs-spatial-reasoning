PROMPT: Let  South and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I need to determine the cardinal relation between regions x and z, given that:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southeast of region z

Let me visualize this:

```
      z
       \
        \  Southeast
         \
          y
          |
          | South
          |
          x
```

So we have:
- x is South of y
- y is Southeast of z

Now I need to determine what cardinal relation x has with respect to z.

Let's think about this in terms of coordinates. Let's set up a coordinate system where:
- North corresponds to the positive y-axis
- East corresponds to the positive x-axis
- South corresponds to the negative y-axis
- West corresponds to the negative x-axis

If y is Southeast of z, then:
- y is East and South of z
- This means y has a greater x-coordinate than z and a smaller y-coordinate than z

If x is South of y, then:
- x has the same x-coordinate as y
- x has a smaller y-coordinate than y

Combining these:
- x has a greater x-coordinate than z (because y does)
- x has a smaller y-coordinate than y, which already has a smaller y-coordinate than z
- So x has a much smaller y-coordinate than z

Given these coordinate relationships, x would be to the South and East of z. So x is Southeast of z.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. If x is South of y, x doesn't necessarily have the same x-coordinate as y. Being "South" means that x is directly below y, meaning they have the same x-coordinate.

Let me reconsider:

If y is Southeast of z, then:
- y is to the East and South of z
- y has a greater x-coordinate than z
- y has a smaller y-coordinate than z

If x is South of y, then:
- x is directly below y
- x has the same x-coordinate as y
- x has a smaller y-coordinate than y

So, combining these:
- x has the same x-coordinate as y, which is greater than the x-coordinate of z. So x is to the East of z.
- x has a smaller y-coordinate than y, which already has a smaller y-coordinate than z. So x is to the South of z.

Given these relationships, x is to the South and East of z, which means x is Southeast of z.

Actually, I think my reasoning still has some issues. Let me carefully think about the cardinal directions again:

Cardinal directions on a map:
- North: Directly upward (positive y-axis)
- South: Directly downward (negative y-axis)
- East: Directly to the right (positive x-axis)
- West: Directly to the left (negative x-axis)
- Northeast: Upward and to the right (positive y-axis and positive x-axis)
- Southeast: Downward and to the right (negative y-axis and positive x-axis)
- Northwest: Upward and to the left (positive y-axis and negative x-axis)
- Southwest: Downward and to the left (negative y-axis and negative x-axis)

Now, let's place our regions:

If y is Southeast of z:
- y is below and to the right of z
- In coordinates, if z is at (x_z, y_z), then y is at (x_y, y_y) where x_y > x_z and y_y < y_z

If x is South of y:
- x is directly below y
- In coordinates, if y is at (x_y, y_y), then x is at (x_x, y_x) where x_x = x_y and y_x < y_y

Combining these:
- x is at (x_x, y_x) where x_x = x_y > x_z and y_x < y_y < y_z
- So, x is below and to the right of z
- This means x is Southeast of z

Hmm, it's still not clear to me if this reasoning is correct. Let me draw this out more carefully:

```
       z
       .
       .
       .
       .
       .
       .    y
       .    .
       .    .
       .    .
       .    .
       .    .
            x
```

Here, y is Southeast of z (below and to the right), and x is South of y (directly below). From this drawing, it seems like x is Southeast of z.

But wait, I realize there's an important issue I've been overlooking. The "South" and "Southeast" relations I've been using are typically defined in qualitative spatial reasoning, which means they don't have to be exact. 

For example, "South" doesn't mean directly below, but rather in a region that's generally in the southern direction. Similarly, "Southeast" means in a region that's generally in the southeastern direction.

Let me re-approach this problem:

When we say y is Southeast of z, it means y is in a region that's generally to the southeast of z. This doesn't pin down y to a specific point.

Similarly, when we say x is South of y, it means x is in a region that's generally to the south of y.

Given these relations, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

Let's consider the possible locations of x relative to z:

1. If y is directly Southeast of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is Southeast of z.
2. But if y is more East than South of z, and x is directly South of y, then x could be more South than East of z, which might make it South or Southeast of z.
3. If y is more South than East of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is definitely South of z.

So the relation between x and z could be South or Southeast, depending on the exact locations of the three regions.

I think I've been overcomplicating things. Let's make this simpler by thinking about it on a grid, where the cardinal directions are more strictly defined:

```
NW  N  NE
 \  |  /
W -- O -- E
 /  |  \
SW  S  SE
```

If y is Southeast of z, then y is in the SE sector from z.
If x is South of y, then x is in the S sector from y.

Now, if we draw rays from z through these sectors, what sectors of z does x fall into?

If y is in the SE sector from z, and x is in the S sector from y, then x can be in the SE or S sectors from z, depending on where exactly in the SE sector y is.

So, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

But I realize that I'm still not being precise enough. In qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal directions are typically defined more rigorously.

One common model is the cone-based model, where each direction is defined by a cone emanating from the reference point. Another is the projection-based model, where the space is divided into 9 regions using lines parallel to the coordinate axes.

Let's use the projection-based model, which is more common:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | O | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

In this model:
- North (N) means the y-coordinate is greater, and the x-coordinate is the same.
- South (S) means the y-coordinate is smaller, and the x-coordinate is the same.
- East (E) means the x-coordinate is greater, and the y-coordinate is the same.
- West (W) means the x-coordinate is smaller, and the y-coordinate is the same.
- Northeast (NE) means both the x and y coordinates are greater.
- Southeast (SE) means the x-coordinate is greater, and the y-coordinate is smaller.
- Northwest (NW) means the x-coordinate is smaller, and the y-coordinate is greater.
- Southwest (SW) means both the x and y coordinates are smaller.

Given this model:
- If y is Southeast of z, then y has a greater x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z.
- If x is South of y, then x has the same x-coordinate as y and a smaller y-coordinate than y.

Combining these:
- x has the same x-coordinate as y, which is greater than the x-coordinate of z. So, in terms of the x-coordinate, x is to the East of z.
- x has a smaller y-coordinate than y, which already has a smaller y-coordinate than z. So, in terms of the y-coordinate, x is to the South of z.

Given these relationships, in the projection-based model, x is Southeast of z.

However, I want to double-check this. Let's visualize it again with coordinates:

Let's say z is at (0, 0).
If y is Southeast of z, it could be at (1, -1) for instance.
If x is South of y, it could be at (1, -2).

From these coordinates, we can see that x is at (1, -2), which is to the east and south of z at (0, 0). In the projection-based model, this means x is Southeast of z.

But wait, I need to be more precise. I said x is South of y, which means x has the same x-coordinate as y. But I then said x is to the East of z, which is only true if x has a larger x-coordinate than z.

Let me reconsider the projection-based model and ensure I'm being consistent. In this model, as mentioned earlier:

- North (N): Same x-coordinate, larger y-coordinate.
- South (S): Same x-coordinate, smaller y-coordinate.
- East (E): Larger x-coordinate, same y-coordinate.
- West (W): Smaller x-coordinate, same y-coordinate.
- Northeast (NE): Larger x-coordinate, larger y-coordinate.
- Southeast (SE): Larger x-coordinate, smaller y-coordinate.
- Northwest (NW): Smaller x-coordinate, larger y-coordinate.
- Southwest (SW): Smaller x-coordinate, smaller y-coordinate.

Now, given:
- y is Southeast of z: y has a larger x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z.
- x is South of y: x has the same x-coordinate as y and a smaller y-coordinate than y.

Comparing x and z:
- x has the same x-coordinate as y, which is larger than the x-coordinate of z. So, x has a larger x-coordinate than z.
- x has a smaller y-coordinate than y, which already has a smaller y-coordinate than z. So, x has a smaller y-coordinate than z.

According to the projection-based model, if x has a larger x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z, then x is Southeast of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Southeast.

However, as I'm thinking more about it, I realized that the given problem asks for "possible" relations, not the definitive relation. This suggests that there might be some ambiguity or multiple possible relations depending on how we interpret or model the cardinal directions.

For instance, in the cone-based model of cardinal directions, the cardinal directions are defined by cones emanating from the reference point. The exact relation between x and z in this model would depend on the angle of the cone and the exact locations of x, y, and z.

Given the information, in the cone-based model, x could indeed be Southeast of z if y is in a particular position. But x could also be South of z if y is positioned differently.

For example, if z is at (0, 0), y could be at (1, -10), which is Southeast of z. If x is South of y, it could be at (1, -15). The angle from z to x might be very close to directly South, which could categorize x as South of z in the cone-based model.

So, in the cone-based model, the possible relations between x and z could be South or Southeast, depending on the exact locations.

Ah, there's another complication. The problem doesn't specify which model of cardinal directions we're using. Given the ambiguity, I should consider both the projection-based and cone-based models.

In the projection-based model, as I've reasoned above, x is Southeast of z.

In the cone-based model, x could be South or Southeast of z, depending on the exact locations.

Since the problem asks for "possible" relations, I should include both South and Southeast as possible answers.

But wait, I'm second-guessing myself. Let me draw a simple diagram to confirm:

```
      z
       \
        \  Southeast
         \
          y
          |
          | South
          |
          x
```

From this diagram, it seems that x is to the Southeast of z. But can x be directly South of z? Let's check:

If z is at (0, 0), y is Southeast of z, so it has a positive x-coordinate and a negative y-coordinate, like (1, -1).

If x is South of y, it has the same x-coordinate as y and a more negative y-coordinate, like (1, -2).

Comparing x and z:
- x-coordinate: x has 1, z has 0. So x is to the East of z.
- y-coordinate: x has -2, z has 0. So x is to the South of z.

This means x is to the Southeast of z.

But could there be a scenario where x is directly South of z? For this to be true, x and z would need to have the same x-coordinate.

If z is at (0, 0) and y is Southeast of z, then y's x-coordinate is positive, like (1, -1).

If x is South of y, it has the same x-coordinate as y, like (1, -2).

x and z have different x-coordinates (1 vs 0), so x cannot be directly South of z.

Wait, I didn't consider all possibilities. If y is only slightly to the East but primarily to the South of z, could x be directly South of z?

For example, if z is at (0, 0) and y is at (0.1, -10), y is Southeast of z. If x is South of y, it could be at (0.1, -20).

The angle from z to x is very close to directly South, but it's still technically Southeast.

In the projection-based model, x is Southeast of z as long as x has a larger x-coordinate than z, regardless of how small the difference is.

In the cone-based model, if the cone for "South" is wide enough, x could be considered South of z if the angle is close to directly South.

But realistically, if y is Southeast of z, and x is South of y, then x should also be Southeast of z, especially since we're working with cardinal directions, which are discrete.

So, I'm leaning towards Southeast as the answer. But I'm still not sure.

Actually, I think I've been making a mistake in assuming that "South" means directly below in the projection-based model. Let me redefine the cardinal directions in the projection-based model:

In the projection-based model, space is divided into 9 regions using orthogonal lines through the reference point. The cardinal directions are defined as follows:

- Northwest (NW): x < x_ref and y > y_ref
- North (N): x = x_ref and y > y_ref
- Northeast (NE): x > x_ref and y > y_ref
- West (W): x < x_ref and y = y_ref
- Origin (O): x = x_ref and y = y_ref
- East (E): x > x_ref and y = y_ref
- Southwest (SW): x < x_ref and y < y_ref
- South (S): x = x_ref and y < y_ref
- Southeast (SE): x > x_ref and y < y_ref

Given this definition:
- y is Southeast of z means y is in the SE region of z, so y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y.
- x is South of y means x is in the S region of y, so x_x = y_x and x_y < y_y.

Combining these:
- x_x = y_x > z_x
- x_y < y_y < z_y

So, x is in the SE region of z, which means x is Southeast of z.

Wait, I'm double-checking a key assumption: I've been assuming that the "South" and "Southeast" relations in the problem refer to cardinal directions as defined in the projection-based model. However, the problem doesn't specify which model of cardinal directions it uses. Other models, like the cone-based model, could have different implications.

Let me reconsider using the cone-based model, which defines cardinal directions using cones emanating from the reference point:

- North (N): The cone extending from the reference point upwards.
- South (S): The cone extending from the reference point downwards.
- East (E): The cone extending from the reference point to the right.
- West (W): The cone extending from the reference point to the left.
- Northeast (NE): The cone extending from the reference point to the upper right.
- Southeast (SE): The cone extending from the reference point to the lower right.
- Northwest (NW): The cone extending from the reference point to the upper left.
- Southwest (SW): The cone extending from the reference point to the lower left.

In this model, the exact relation between x and z depends on the angle of the cone and the exact locations of x, y, and z.

For instance, if the cones for South and Southeast are each 45 degrees wide, then the angle from the reference point to the target point determines the cardinal direction.

If z is at (0, 0), y is Southeast of z, and x is South of y, the exact relation between x and z in the cone-based model depends on the angle from z to x.

If the angle is between 112.5 and 157.5 degrees (considering a standard Cartesian plane where 0 degrees is to the right, and angles increase counterclockwise), then x is South of z.

If the angle is between 157.5 and 202.5 degrees, then x is Southeast of z.

In the cone-based model, if y is barely to the East of z but primarily to the South, and x is directly South of y, then x could be South of z. But if y is significantly to the East of z, and x is directly South of y, then x would be Southeast of z.

Given the ambiguity in which model the problem is using, and the fact that it asks for "possible" relations, I think it's safer to say that the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider what the question is asking. It says "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

The question is asking about possible relations, which means it's not asking for the definitive relation but for the range of possible relations that could exist.

Given the setup:
- x is South of y
- y is Southeast of z

We want to know what relation(s) x could have with z.

In the projection-based model, as I've reasoned, x is Southeast of z.

In the cone-based model, x could be South or Southeast of z, depending on the exact locations.

Wait, there's another model I haven't fully explored. The 4-4m model (cardinal-cardinat model) is another variation of the projection-based model. 

In the 4-4m model, there are 4 primary directions (North, South, East, West) and 4 mixed directions (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest). The model works as follows:

- North (N): 45 degrees < Angle < 135 degrees
- South (S): 225 degrees < Angle < 315 degrees
- East (E): -45 degrees < Angle < 45 degrees
- West (W): 135 degrees < Angle < 225 degrees
- Northeast (NE): 45 degrees
- Southeast (SE): -45 degrees
- Northwest (NW): 135 degrees
- Southwest (SW): 225 degrees

Given this model, the relation between x and z depends on the angle from z to x.

I am getting confused again, which one is this 4-4m model, I don't remember a model where NE is just 45 degrees. Let me go back to the basic reasoning.

In the projection-based model, cardinal directions are determined by the quadrant in which the target point lies with respect to the reference point. In this model, if y is Southeast of z, it means y is in the fourth quadrant from z. If x is South of y, it means x is in the second quadrant from y.

What quadrant is x from z? Well, if y is in the fourth quadrant from z, and x is in the second quadrant from y, we need to determine where x falls with respect to z.

Let me set up a specific example to check:

Suppose z is at (0, 0).
If y is Southeast of z, it could be at (1, -1).
If x is South of y, it would be at (1, -2).

With respect to z, x is at (1, -2), which is in the fourth quadrant. In the projection-based model, this means x is Southeast of z.

For a few more examples, let me try other possible locations of y:

1. If y is at (2, -1), which is Southeast of z, and x is South of y, then x is at (2, -2), which is Southeast of z.
2. If y is at (0.1, -10), which is Southeast of z, and x is South of y, then x is at (0.1, -11), which is still Southeast of z.

In all cases, x ends up being Southeast of z.

Oh wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. If x is South of y, it doesn't necessarily mean x is in the second quadrant from y. It means x is directly below y, which is in the third quadrant from y.

Let me correct this:

In the projection-based model, if y is Southeast of z, it means y is in the fourth quadrant from z. If x is South of y, it means x is in the third quadrant from y.

Now, what quadrant is x from z?

Again, let's set up a specific example:

Suppose z is at (0, 0).
If y is Southeast of z, it could be at (1, -1).
If x is South of y, it would be at (1, -2).

With respect to z, x is at (1, -2), which is in the fourth quadrant. In the projection-based model, this means x is Southeast of z.

For a few more examples, let me try other possible locations of y:

1. If y is at (2, -1), which is Southeast of z, and x is South of y, then x is at (2, -2), which is Southeast of z.
2. If y is at (0.1, -10), which is Southeast of z, and x is South of y, then x is at (0.1, -11), which is still Southeast of z.

In all cases, x ends up being Southeast of z.

Wait, I'm being inconsistent with the quadrant numbering. Let me be clear:

- First quadrant: x > 0, y > 0 (Northeast)
- Second quadrant: x < 0, y > 0 (Northwest)
- Third quadrant: x < 0, y < 0 (Southwest)
- Fourth quadrant: x > 0, y < 0 (Southeast)

In the projection-based model, if y is Southeast of z, it means y is in the fourth quadrant from z. If x is South of y, it means x has the same x-coordinate as y and a smaller y-coordinate than y.

Now, what quadrant is x from z?

Again, let's set up a specific example:

Suppose z is at (0, 0).
If y is Southeast of z, it could be at (1, -1).
If x is South of y, it would be at (1, -2).

With respect to z, x is at (1, -2), which is in the fourth quadrant. In the projection-based model, this means x is Southeast of z.

But I want to check if there's a way for x to be directly South of z. For this to be true, x and z would need to have the same x-coordinate.

If z is at (0, 0) and y is Southeast of z, then y's x-coordinate is positive, like (1, -1).

If x is South of y, it has the same x-coordinate as y, like (1, -2).

x and z have different x-coordinates (1 vs 0), so x cannot be directly South of z.

Wait, I think I'm not considering all possibilities. I need to reconsider the precise definition of the cardinal direction relations.

In the projection-based model, the relations are typically defined as follows:

- North (N): y_2 > y_1 and x_2 = x_1
- South (S): y_2 < y_1 and x_2 = x_1
- East (E): x_2 > x_1 and y_2 = y_1
- West (W): x_2 < x_1 and y_2 = y_1
- Northeast (NE): x_2 > x_1 and y_2 > y_1
- Southeast (SE): x_2 > x_1 and y_2 < y_1
- Northwest (NW): x_2 < x_1 and y_2 > y_1
- Southwest (SW): x_2 < x_1 and y_2 < y_1

Given this definition:
- y is Southeast of z means y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y.
- x is South of y means x_x = y_x and x_y < y_y.

Combining these:
- x_x = y_x > z_x
- x_y < y_y < z_y

So, x is in the SE region of z, which means x is Southeast of z.

I think I'm getting confused because I'm considering too many possibilities at once. Let me simplify and focus on the basics:

In the projection-based model:
- y is Southeast of z: y is to the east and south of z.
- x is South of y: x is directly below y.

Using coordinates, if z is at (0, 0), y could be at (1, -1), and x at (1, -2).

Comparing x to z:
- x is to the east of z (x_x > z_x).
- x is to the south of z (x_y < z_y).

So, x is Southeast of z.

Can x be directly South of z? If x is South of y, it has the same x-coordinate as y. If y is Southeast of z, y has a larger x-coordinate than z. Thus, x also has a larger x-coordinate than z, which means x cannot be directly South of z.

Can x be Southwest of z? If x is South of y, it has the same x-coordinate as y. If y is Southeast of z, y has a larger x-coordinate than z. Thus, x also has a larger x-coordinate than z, which means x cannot be Southwest of z.

Can x be East of z? If x is South of y, it has the same x-coordinate as y. If y is Southeast of z, y has a larger x-coordinate than z. Thus, x also has a larger x-coordinate than z. But for x to be East of z, x and z should have the same y-coordinate, which is not the case. So, x cannot be East of z.

So, in the projection-based model, the only possible relation between x and z is Southeast.

But just to double check, suppose y is at the farthest east, such that it's barely to the south. If y is just a tiny bit south, but very far east, and x is directly south of y, isn't it possible for x to be so far east that it's directly east of z? 

Let's check: if z is at (0, 0), y is at (10, -0.1), and x is at (10, -10). Comparing x to z, x is far to the east, but also far to the south. Is it possible for x to be considered East of z instead of Southeast? 

No, in the projection-based model, direction is determined by quadrants, not by how extreme the difference is in one direction versus the other. So, no matter how far east and how little south y is from z, if x is South of y, x will always be Southeast of z in the projection-based model.

Now, let's briefly consider the cone-based model. In this model, directions are determined by the angle from the reference point to the target point.

If the cone for South is centered at 270 degrees (directly below) and is 45 degrees wide (from 247.5 to 292.5 degrees), and the cone for Southeast is centered at 315 degrees (down and to the right) and is 45 degrees wide (from 292.5 to 337.5 degrees), then the direction from z to x depends on the angle.

If z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, -1), and x is at (1, -2), the angle from z to x is approximately 297 degrees, which would place x in the Southeast cone from z.

But if z is at (0, 0), y is at (0.1, -10), and x is at (0.1, -11), the angle from z to x is approximately 270.5 degrees, which would place x in the South cone from z.

So, in the cone-based model, x could be South or Southeast of z, depending on the exact locations.

Given this, I think it's safe to say that the possible relations between x and z, considering both projection-based and cone-based models, are South and Southeast.

Wait, I want to double check the angle computation.

If z is at (0, 0), y is at (0.1, -10), and x is at (0.1, -11), the angle from z to x is:

atan2(-11, 0.1) * 180 / pi = atan2(-11, 0.1) * 180 / 3.14159... ≈ -89.5 degrees

But we're using the convention where 0 degrees is to the right and angles increase counterclockwise. So, the angle is:

(360 - 89.5) degrees = 270.5 degrees

This places x in the South cone from z, given the convention I mentioned earlier.

But, to ensure I'm getting the angle calculation right, let me recalculate:

If z is at (0, 0), y is at (0.1, -10), and x is at (0.1, -11), the vector from z to x is (0.1, -11).

The angle of this vector from the positive x-axis is:

atan2(-11, 0.1) = -89.5 degrees

Converting to the standard Cartesian angle (0 degrees is to the right, angles increase counterclockwise), we get:

(360 - 89.5) degrees = 270.5 degrees

This places x in the South cone from z, given the cone-based model I described earlier.

Actually, I think I made a typo. The correct computation should be:

atan2(-11, 0.1) ≈ -89.5 degrees

But in the standard Cartesian convention (0 degrees is to the right and angles increase counterclockwise), if the computed angle is negative, we add 360 degrees to get the positive equivalent:

-89.5 + 360 = 270.5 degrees

So, the correct angle is 270.5 degrees, which places x in the South cone from z, given the cone-based model.

Ok I think I've been spending too much time on this. Let's succinctly answer the question:

The question asks for the possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Southeast of z.

In the projection-based model, where directions are determined by quadrants, x is definitely Southeast of z.

In the cone-based model, where directions are determined by angles, x could be South or Southeast of z, depending on the exact locations of the three regions.

Given the ambiguity of which model the problem is using, and the fact that it asks for "possible" relations, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

Actually, let me just check one more thing. What if y is directly at the boundary between South and Southeast of z? Could that put x exactly South of z?

Let's position:
z at (0, 0)
y at (0, -1) (which is South of z)
and x at (0, -2) (which is South of y)

So, x is at (0, -2) with respect to z, which is South of z.

Wait, but that doesn't satisfy the condition that y is Southeast of z.

Actually, let me check: is it possible for y to be both Southeast of z (which means y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y) and for x to be South of y (which means x_x = y_x and x_y < y_y), but for x to be South of z (which means x_x = z_x and x_y < z_y)?

For y to be Southeast of z, y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y.
For x to be South of y, x_x = y_x and x_y < y_y.
For x to be South of z, x_x = z_x and x_y < z_y.

From the first two conditions, we know that x_x = y_x > z_x. But for x to be South of z, we need x_x = z_x. These are contradictory.

So, it's not possible for x to be South of z.

What about other cardinal directions, such as Southwest of z?

For x to be Southwest of z, we need x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y.
But we know from the given conditions that x_x = y_x > z_x, which contradicts the requirement for x to be Southwest of z.

Ah, wait! If we're using the projection-based model, y can't be directly at the boundary. It's either Southeast of z or South of z, not both.

After all these checks, I'm convinced that in the projection-based model, x can only be Southeast of z.

But in the cone-based model, especially if the cones are wide, x could be South or Southeast of z, depending on the exact locations of the three regions.

So, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

Actually, to be exhaustive, let me check if the "Bounding Box" relation is a possibility.

The "Bounding Box" relation typically means one region is contained within the bounding box of another. Given the information provided, we don't have enough to determine if x is contained within the bounding box of z or vice versa.

But wait, if x is South of y and y is Southeast of z, then x is not only to the South and Southeast of z but also to the South of z. It's not contained within z, and it doesn't contain z.

So, the "Bounding Box" relation is not a possible relation between x and z.

Now, let me consolidate:

In the projection-based model, x is Southeast of z.
In the cone-based model, x could be South or Southeast of z, depending on the exact locations.
The "Bounding Box" relation is not a possibility.

Given the ambiguity and the fact that the problem asks for possible relations, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

Actually, I want to clarify something about the projection-based model, since I might have been inconsistent with the model.

In the projection-based model, cardinal directions are often defined using orthogonal lines through the reference point, dividing the space into 9 regions (including the reference point itself). The 8 surrounding regions correspond to the 8 cardinal directions.

Given this model:
- y is Southeast of z means y is in the Southeast region of z, which means y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y.
- x is South of y means x is in the South region of y, which means x_x = y_x and x_y < y_y.

Combining these:
- x_x = y_x > z_x
- x_y < y_y < z_y

Checking if x is in one of the 8 regions of z:
- Northeast: x_x > z_x and x_y > z_y. Since x_y < z_y, x is not Northeast of z.
- North: x_x = z_x and x_y > z_y. Since x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y, x is not North of z.
- Northwest: x_x < z_x and x_y > z_y. Since x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y, x is not Northwest of z.
- West: x_x < z_x and x_y = z_y. Since x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y, x is not West of z.
- Southwest: x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y. Since x_x > z_x, x is not Southwest of z.
- South: x_x = z_x and x_y < z_y. Since x_x > z_x, x is not South of z.
- East: x_x > z_x and x_y = z_y. Since x_y < z_y, x is not East of z.
- Southeast: x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y. This is satisfied.

So, in the projection-based model, x is Southeast of z.

Finally, for the cone-based model, as I demonstrated earlier, x could be South or Southeast of z, depending on the exact locations.

Given both models, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

Actually, let me check one more detail in the cone-based model, specifically about the possibility of x being South of z.

In the cone-based model, if the cone for South is centered at 270 degrees and is 45 degrees wide (from 247.5 to 292.5 degrees), and the cone for Southeast is centered at 315 degrees and is 45 degrees wide (from 292.5 to 337.5 degrees), then the direction from z to x depends on the angle.

If z is at (0, 0), y is at (0.1, -10), and x is at (0.1, -11), the angle from z to x is approximately 270.5 degrees, which would place x in the South cone from z.

Hmm, actually, I realized there's a mistake in my angle calculation. Let me recalculate.

If z is at (0, 0), y is at (0.1, -10), and x is at (0.1, -11), the vector from z to x is (0.1, -11).

The angle of this vector from the positive x-axis is:

atan2(-11, 0.1) = -89.48 degrees

Converting to the standard Cartesian angle (0 degrees is to the right, angles increase counterclockwise), we get:

(-89.48 + 360) degrees = 270.52 degrees

Now, if the South cone is from 247.5 to 292.5 degrees, then 270.52 degrees falls within this cone, which means x is South of z in the cone-based model.

So, in the cone-based model, x could be South or Southeast of z, depending on the exact locations.

Given both models, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

One thing I do want to check, before I finish, is whether x can be anything other than South or Southeast of z. What about East or Southwest?

For East, we would need x_y = z_y, but we know x_y < z_y, so East is not possible.

For Southwest, we would need x_x < z_x, but we know x_x > z_x, so Southwest is not possible.

What about West or Northwest?

For West, we would need x_x < z_x and x_y = z_y, but we know x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y, so West is not possible.

For Northwest, we would need x_x < z_x and x_y > z_y, but we know x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y, so Northwest is not possible.

What about North or Northeast?

For North, we would need x_x = z_x and x_y > z_y, but we know x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y, so North is not possible.

For Northeast, we would need x_x > z_x and x_y > z_y, but we know x_y < z_y, so Northeast is not possible.

So, the only possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are South and Southeast.

Alright, to finalize, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

After extensive reasoning and considering both the projection-based and cone-based models of cardinal directions, I conclude that the possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Southeast of z, are South and Southeast.

Actually, let me double-check and trace through a concrete example:

Let z be at (0, 0).
Let y be at (1, -1), which is Southeast of z.
Let x be at (1, -2), which is South of y.

Where is x with respect to z?

In the projection-based model, comparing x to z:
- x_x = 1 > z_x = 0, so x is to the East of z.
- x_y = -2 < z_y = 0, so x is to the South of z.
This means x is Southeast of z.

In the cone-based model, if the cones for each direction are 45 degrees wide, the angle from z to x is:

atan2(-2, 1) = -63.43 degrees

Converting to the standard Cartesian angle (0 degrees is to the right, angles increase counterclockwise), we get:

(-63.43 + 360) degrees = 296.57 degrees

If the Southeast cone is from 292.5 to 337.5 degrees, then 296.57 degrees falls within this cone, which means x is Southeast of z in the cone-based model.

Now, let's try another example:

Let z be at (0, 0).
Let y be at (0.01, -10), which is Southeast of z.
Let x be at (0.01, -11), which is South of y.

In the projection-based model, comparing x to z:
- x_x = 0.01 > z_x = 0, so x is to the East of z.
- x_y = -11 < z_y = 0, so x is to the South of z.
This means x is Southeast of z.

In the cone-based model, the angle from z to x is:

atan2(-11, 0.01) = -89.95 degrees

Converting to the standard Cartesian angle (0 degrees is to the right, angles increase counterclockwise), we get:

(-89.95 + 360) degrees = 270.05 degrees

If the South cone is from 247.5 to 292.5 degrees, then 270.05 degrees falls within this cone, which means x is South of z in the cone-based model.

So, in the cone-based model, x could be South or Southeast of z, depending on the exact locations.

Given both models, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

Actually, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning in the first example. Let me recalculate:

If z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, -1), and x is at (1, -2), the angle from z to x is:

atan2(-2, 1) = -63.43 degrees

Converting to the standard Cartesian angle (0 degrees is to the right, angles increase counterclockwise), we get:

(-63.43 + 360) degrees = 296.57 degrees

If the South cone is from 247.5 to 292.5 degrees and the Southeast cone is from 292.5 to 337.5 degrees, then 296.57 degrees falls within the Southeast cone, which means x is Southeast of z in the cone-based model.

Sorry for the confusion, but I was getting the cone definitions mixed up.

To get a clear understanding of whether x can be South of z in the cone-based model, I need to determine if there are locations of y and x that satisfy the given conditions (y is Southeast of z and x is South of y) and also result in x being South of z.

If z is at (0, 0), we need y to be Southeast of z, which means y is in the Southeast cone from z. Let's say the Southeast cone is from 292.5 to 337.5 degrees.

For y to be Southeast of z, the angle from z to y should be between 292.5 and 337.5 degrees. This means y could be at (0.1, -10), where the angle is approximately 270.57 degrees.

Wait, 270.57 degrees is not in the Southeast cone; it's in the South cone. Let me fix this.

Hmm, I think I'm computing the angle incorrectly. Let's fix this.

If z is at (0, 0) and y is at (0.1, -10), the vector from z to y is (0.1, -10).

The angle of this vector from the positive x-axis is:

atan2(-10, 0.1) ≈ -89.4 degrees

Converting to the standard Cartesian angle (0 degrees is to the right, angles increase counterclockwise), we get:

(-89.4 + 360) degrees = 270.6 degrees

So, the angle from z to y is 270.6 degrees.

In the cone-based model, if the Southeast cone is from 292.5 to 337.5 degrees, then 270.6 degrees doesn't fall within this cone. It falls within the South cone (247.5 to 292.5 degrees).

So, y would not be Southeast of z in this cone-based model.

Actually, I think I need to adjust the location of y to ensure it's Southeast of z.

If z is at (0, 0), and we want y to be Southeast of z in the cone-based model, the angle from z to y should be between 292.5 and 337.5 degrees. This means y could be at (1, -1), where the angle is approximately 315 degrees.

Checking: atan2(-1, 1) = -45 degrees. Converting to the standard Cartesian angle, we get: (-45 + 360) degrees = 315 degrees. This falls within the Southeast cone, so y is Southeast of z.

Now, if x is South of y, the angle from y to x should be between 247.5 and 292.5 degrees. This means x could be at (1, -3), where the angle from y to x is approximately 270 degrees.

Checking: atan2(-2, 0) = -90 degrees. Converting to the standard Cartesian angle, we get: (-90 + 360) degrees = 270 degrees. This falls within the South cone, so x is South of y.

Now, what's the relation between x and z?

The angle from z to x is: atan2(-3, 1) = -71.57 degrees. Converting to the standard Cartesian angle, we get: (-71.57 + 360) degrees = 288.43 degrees. This falls within the South cone (247.5 to 292.5 degrees), so x is South of z in this cone-based model.

Wait, but 288.43 degrees is less than 292.5 degrees, which means it falls within the South cone (247.5 to 292.5 degrees).

Actually let me retry from scratch:

In the cone-based model, if the cones are 45 degrees wide, the cardinal directions are defined as follows:
- North (N): 337.5 to 22.5 degrees
- Northeast (NE): 22.5 to 67.5 degrees
- East (E): 67.5 to 112.5 degrees
- Southeast (SE): 112.5 to 157.5 degrees
- South (S): 157.5 to 202.5 degrees
- Southwest (SW): 202.5 to 247.5 degrees
- West (W): 247.5 to 292.5 degrees
- Northwest (NW): 292.5 to 337.5 degrees

But I think I'm using the wrong convention for the angle. Let me double check:

In standard Cartesian coordinates, 0 degrees is to the right (positive x-axis) and angles increase counterclockwise. So:

- East (E): 0 degrees
- Northeast (NE): 45 degrees
- North (N): 90 degrees
- Northwest (NW): 135 degrees
- West (W): 180 degrees
- Southwest (SW): 225 degrees
- South (S): 270 degrees
- Southeast (SE): 315 degrees

If the cones are 45 degrees wide, the cardinal directions are defined as follows:
- East (E): 337.5 to 22.5 degrees
- Northeast (NE): 22.5 to 67.5 degrees
- North (N): 67.5 to 112.5 degrees
- Northwest (NW): 112.5 to 157.5 degrees
- West (W): 157.5 to 202.5 degrees
- Southwest (SW): 202.5 to 247.5 degrees
- South (S): 247.5 to 292.5 degrees
- Southeast (SE): 292.5 to 337.5 degrees

Given this convention:

If z is at (0, 0) and y is at (1, -1), the angle from z to y is atan2(-1, 1) = -45 degrees = 315 degrees, which falls within the Southeast cone (292.5 to 337.5 degrees). So, y is Southeast of z.

If y is at (1, -1) and x is at (1, -2), the angle from y to x is atan2(-1, 0) = -90 degrees = 270 degrees, which falls within the South cone (247.5 to 292.5 degrees). So, x is South of y.

Now, the angle from z to x is atan2(-2, 1) = -63.43 degrees = 296.57 degrees, which falls within the Southeast cone (292.5 to 337.5 degrees). So, x is Southeast of z.

Hmm, I'm wrong about the angle calculation.

If y is at (1, -1) and x is at (1, -2), the vector from y to x is (0, -1). The angle of this vector from the positive x-axis is atan2(-1, 0) = -90 degrees. Converting to the standard Cartesian angle, we get: (-90 + 360) degrees = 270 degrees. This falls within the South cone (247.5 to 292.5 degrees), so x is South of y.

But wait, I just realized I might have an inconsistency here. When I say "x is South of y", it doesn't necessarily mean the angle from y to x is in the South cone. It means x has the same x-coordinate as y and a smaller y-coordinate than y.

So I'm better of using the projection-based model instead of the cone-based model.

Let me revisit the problem:

In the projection-based model:
- y is Southeast of z means y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y.
- x is South of y means x_x = y_x and x_y < y_y.

Combining these:
- x_x = y_x > z_x
- x_y < y_y < z_y

Checking if x is in one of the 8 regions of z:
- Northeast: x_x > z_x and x_y > z_y. Since x_y < z_y, x is not Northeast of z.
- North: x_x = z_x and x_y > z_y. Since x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y, x is not North of z.
- Northwest: x_x < z_x and x_y > z_y. Since x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y, x is not Northwest of z.
- West: x_x < z_x and x_y = z_y. Since x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y, x is not West of z.
- Southwest: x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y. Since x_x > z_x, x is not Southwest of z.
- South: x_x = z_x and x_y < z_y. Since x_x > z_x, x is not South of z.
- East: x_x > z_x and x_y = z_y. Since x_y < z_y, x is not East of z.
- Southeast: x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y. This is satisfied.

In the projection-based model, the only possible relation between x and z is Southeast.

But wait, I think I misunderstood the problem initially. The problem might be asking for the possible relations between x and z across all possible positions of x, y, and z, not just the definitive relation given one set of positions.

Let's reconsider the problem:

We're given that x is South of y and y is Southeast of z. We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

In the projection-based model, regardless of the exact positions of x, y, and z, if we honor the given relations, x will always be Southeast of z. This is because being South of y ensures x has the same x-coordinate as y, which is greater than the x-coordinate of z (since y is Southeast of z). It also ensures x has a smaller y-coordinate than y, which already has a smaller y-coordinate than z. Thus, x is to the east and south of z, making it Southeast of z.

So, in the projection-based model, the only possible relation between x and z is Southeast.

I realize that I've been going in circles on this problem, so let me make a final decision:

In the projection-based model:
- y is Southeast of z means y is to the east and south of z.
- x is South of y means x is directly below y.

Combining these, x is to the east and south of z, which means x is Southeast of z. This is true regardless of the exact positions of x, y, and z, as long as the given relations hold.

So, the possible relation between x and z in the projection-based model is Southeast.

But wait, I feel that projection-based and cone-based models are all interpretations.

So, given the information:
- x is South of y
- y is Southeast of z

The possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

Hmm, actually, I don't think I can choose between those models arbitrarily just because I feel like it.

Actually let me just reason without referring to the model:

When I say "y is Southeast of z", it means y is both to the East and to the South of z. In other words, y has a larger x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z.

When I say "x is South of y", it means x is directly below y. This implies that x has the same x-coordinate as y and a smaller y-coordinate than y.

Combining these:
- x has the same x-coordinate as y, which is larger than the x-coordinate of z. So, x is to the East of z.
- x has a smaller y-coordinate than y, which already has a smaller y-coordinate than z. So, x is to the South of z.

Given these relationships, x is both to the East and to the South of z, which means x is Southeast of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Southeast.

Actually, I think the problem asks what are the possible relations that z and x could have, I think that means I should think of all pairs of points (z, x) such that there exists a y such that y is Southeast of z and x is South of y, and then, for each of those pairs, figure out which cardinal direction relation they have.

Let's determine where x can be located relative to z, given the constraints:

1. y is Southeast of z: This means y has a larger x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z.
2. x is South of y: This means x has the same x-coordinate as y and a smaller y-coordinate than y.

Combining these:
- x has the same x-coordinate as y, which is larger than the x-coordinate of z. So, x is to the East of z.
- x has a smaller y-coordinate than y, which already has a smaller y-coordinate than z. So, x is to the South of z.

Thus, x is both to the East and to the South of z, which means x is Southeast of z.

Could x be South of z? For x to be South of z, it would need to have the same x-coordinate as z and a smaller y-coordinate than z. But we know that x has a larger x-coordinate than z, so x cannot be South of z.

Could x be East of z? For x to be East of z, it would need to have a larger x-coordinate than z and the same y-coordinate as z. But we know that x has a smaller y-coordinate than z, so x cannot be East of z.

And similarly, x cannot be any of the other cardinal directions (like North, Northeast, Northwest, West, or Southwest) due to the constraints on its x and y coordinates relative to z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is Southeast.

Actually, let me double check. 

Take z at (0, 0).
If y is Southeast of z, y could be at (1, -1), for example.
If x is South of y, x would be at (1, -2).

From z's perspective, x is at (1, -2), which is Southeast of z.

Let's try another example:
z at (0, 0).
y at (0.1, -10). This is Southeast of z.
x at (0.1, -11). This is South of y.

From z's perspective, x is at (0.1, -11), which is Southeast of z.

Let's try some more extreme examples:
z at (0, 0).
y at (100, -0.1). This is Southeast of z.
x at (100, -100). This is South of y.

From z's perspective, x is at (100, -100), which is Southeast of z.

In all cases, x is Southeast of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Southeast.

Hmm, but the problem is asking which could the possible relations between region x and region z be. I wonder if I'm supposed to interpret this question as "what are the possible cardinal direction relations that could exist between any pair of regions (x, z) such that there exists a region y, with x being South of y and y being Southeast of z?"

That seems like a very different question. But let me think about it.

Let me try a more direct approach: If y is Southeast of z, y could be at (1, -1) relative to z. If x is South of y, x could be at (1, -2) relative to z. So, x is Southeast of z.

But could there be other scenarios where x has a different cardinal direction relation with z? Let's check:

For x to be East of z, it would need to have a larger x-coordinate than z and the same y-coordinate as z. But this contradicts the condition that x is South of y, which means x has a smaller y-coordinate than y. And since y already has a smaller y-coordinate than z, x would also have a smaller y-coordinate than z, which means x cannot be East of z.

For x to be South of z, it would need to have the same x-coordinate as z and a smaller y-coordinate than z. But since y is Southeast of z, y has a larger x-coordinate than z. And since x is South of y, x has the same x-coordinate as y, which means x also has a larger x-coordinate than z. Thus, x cannot be South of z.

For x to be Northeast, North, Northwest, West, or Southwest of z, it would need to have specific coordinates relative to z. But all of these would contradict the conditions that y is Southeast of z and x is South of y.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is Southeast.

I think I've been overthinking this problem. Given that:
- y is Southeast of z: y has a larger x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z.
- x is South of y: x has the same x-coordinate as y and a smaller y-coordinate than y.

Combining these, x has a larger x-coordinate than z and a smaller y-coordinate than z, which means x is Southeast of z.

So, the answer is Southeast.

Actually, I want to check one thing. 

So far I've been assuming a Cartesian coordinate system where North is positive y, East is positive x, South is negative y and West is negative x.

But direction doesn't have to be related to these coordinates. Direction is determined by the angle from the reference point to the target point.

So let me compute the angle of x as seen from z.

If z is at (0, 0) and y is at (1, -1), the angle from z to y is:

theta_zy = atan2(-1, 1) = -45 degrees

Converting to the standard Cartesian angle (0 degrees is to the right, angles increase counterclockwise), we get:

theta_zy_cartesian = (-45 + 360) degrees = 315 degrees

This is the Southeast direction.

Now, if x is South of y, and y is at (1, -1), x could be at (1, -2). The angle from z to x is:

theta_zx = atan2(-2, 1) = -63.43 degrees

Converting to the standard Cartesian angle, we get:

theta_zx_cartesian = (-63.43 + 360) degrees = 296.57 degrees

This is also the Southeast direction, but it's closer to the South direction compared to the angle from z to y.

Let's try another scenario: z at (0, 0), y at (0.1, -10), and x at (0.1, -11).

The angle from z to x is:

theta_zx = atan2(-11, 0.1) = -89.48 degrees

Converting to the standard Cartesian angle, we get:

theta_zx_cartesian = (-89.48 + 360) degrees = 270.52 degrees

This is very close to the South direction. If we had a cone-based model where the South direction is defined as angles between 260 and 280 degrees, x would be South of z in this scenario.

So, in terms of the angle, x can be considered Southeast or South of z, depending on the specific locations of y and x.

Given the ambiguity and the fact that the problem asks for possible relations, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

But since in Cartesian coordinates, x is always Southeast of z, that should probably be the answer.

Alright, let me summarize again:

In Cartesian coordinates, if y is Southeast of z and x is South of y, then x is Southeast of z.
In terms of the angle (considering a cone-based approach), x can be Southeast or South of z, depending on the specific locations of y and x.

Given the ambiguity and the nature of the question, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast.

Actually, let me just focus on what the problem is directly asking:

"If region x is South of region y and region y is Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

The question asks for the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, given the constraints.

After careful consideration, I'm inclined to believe the possible relations are both South and Southeast, depending on the specific locations of x, y, and z. This is the most comprehensive answer given the information provided.

But actually I need to be a bit more precise here. Given how cardinal directions are defined, let me compute exactly which cardinal directions are possible for x relative to z.

Let's say z is at (0, 0). If y is Southeast of z, y could be at (e, -f) for positive real numbers e and f.

If x is South of y, x would be at (e, -f-g) for a positive real number g. Then x is at (e, -f-g) relative to z.

If e is large compared to f+g, x is primarily East of z.
If f+g is large compared to e, x is primarily South of z.

In the cone-based approach, for x to be East of z, the angle from z to x would need to be between 0 and 45 degrees, but this would require the y-coordinate of x to be 0, which is not possible given the constraints.

For x to be South of z, the angle from z to x would need to be between 225 and 315 degrees. Given the positions of x and z, the angle would be between 270 and 315 degrees, so x could be South of z in the cone-based approach.

For x to be Southeast of z, the angle from z to x would need to be between 315 and 360 degrees. Given the positions of x and z, the angle could be between 270 and 315 degrees, so x could be Southeast of z in the cone-based approach.

For x to be any other cardinal direction of z, the angle would need to be in specific ranges that are not possible given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southeast, depending on the specific locations of x, y, and z.

Actually, I think I'm mixing up different conventions. Let me be consistent.

For directions, I'll use the standard Cartesian convention: 0 degrees is East, 90 degrees is North, 180 degrees is West, and 270 degrees is South.

Now, let me see which directions are possible for x relative to z.

Given that y is Southeast of z, y could be at (e, -f) relative to z for positive real numbers e and f. If x is South of y, x would be at (e, -f-g) relative to z for a positive real number g.

The angle from z to x would be atan2(-f-g, e). This angle is in the fourth quadrant, so it's between 270 and 360 degrees.

For x to be South of z in the cone-based approach, the angle from z to x would need to be between 247.5
