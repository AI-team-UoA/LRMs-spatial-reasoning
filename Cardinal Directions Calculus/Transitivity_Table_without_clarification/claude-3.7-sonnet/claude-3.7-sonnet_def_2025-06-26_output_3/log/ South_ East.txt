PROMPT: Let  South and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z, given that region x is South of region y and region y is East of region z.

Let's use the notation S for the South relation, and E for the East relation.

We have:
- x is South of y: x S y
- y is East of z: y E z

To determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider the composition of these relations.

Let's think about what it means for x to be South of y and y to be East of z:
- If x is South of y, then x is located at a lower latitude than y (more towards the Southern direction).
- If y is East of z, then y is located at a higher longitude than z (more towards the Eastern direction).

Now, if we combine these, what can we say about the position of x relative to z?

x is South of y, and y is East of z. So x is South of a region that is East of z.

Looking at this on a conceptual map:
z is at some position (lat_z, long_z)
y is East of z, so y is at position (lat_y, long_z + some positive value)
x is South of y, so x is at position (lat_y - some positive value, long_y)

So x is at position (lat_y - some positive value, long_z + some positive value) relative to z.

This means x is both South and East of z, which corresponds to the Southeast direction.

However, I need to check if there could be other possible relations. Let me think more carefully.

Actually, let me re-examine this. The cardinal direction relations might not be as strictly defined as I initially thought. I need to consider how the cardinal direction relations are typically defined in qualitative spatial reasoning.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the space is often divided into 9 regions: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and a central region often called "Bounding Box" (B).

Given that x is South of y and y is East of z, I need to determine which of these 9 regions x could be in, relative to z.

To do this, I'll consider the possible positions of x, y, and z.

Let's say z is at the origin (0,0).
Since y is East of z, y could be in regions E, NE, or SE relative to z.

Case 1: y is in region E relative to z.
In this case, y is directly East of z. Now, x is South of y. So x is South of a point that is directly East of z. This means x is in the SE region relative to z.

Case 2: y is in region NE relative to z.
In this case, y is Northeast of z. Now, x is South of y. Depending on how far South x is from y, x could be in regions E, SE, or even NE (if x is only slightly South of y).

Case 3: y is in region SE relative to z.
In this case, y is Southeast of z. Now, x is South of y. This means x is even further South, so x is in the SE region relative to z.

So the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, SE.

Wait, I'm not sure this analysis is correct. Let me try again with a more systematic approach.

Actually, I think my initial approach was more correct. Let's consider cardinal directions as binary relations rather than dividing the space into 9 regions.

If z is at the origin (0,0):
- y is East of z, so y is at some position (0, y_long) where y_long > 0.
- x is South of y, so x is at some position (x_lat, y_long) where x_lat < 0.

So x is at position (x_lat, y_long) relative to z, where x_lat < 0 and y_long > 0. This places x in the Southeast direction from z.

But wait, I think I'm still not considering the full range of possibilities.

Let's try a different approach, using a more standard interpretation of cardinal direction relations.

In the standard interpretation of cardinal direction relations, we consider the Bounding Box of a region and then divide the space around it into 8 directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.

Given this interpretation:
- If x is South of y, then x is entirely below the lower edge of y's Bounding Box.
- If y is East of z, then y is entirely to the right of the right edge of z's Bounding Box.

Now, let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z.

If x is South of y and y is East of z, then x is below a region that is to the right of z. 

Let me draw this out:

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+
            +---+
            | y |
            +---+
            
                    +---+
                    | x |
                    +---+
```

From this diagram, it seems like x could be Southeast of z.

But wait, what if the regions have different widths?

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+
                +-------+
                |   y   |
                +-------+
                
        +---+
        | x |
        +---+
```

In this case, x could be South of z.

Let's consider another possibility:

```
    +-------+
    |   z   |
    +-------+
                +---+
                | y |
                +---+
                
        +---+
        | x |
        +---+
```

In this case, x could be Southwest of z.

Wait, actually I think we need to be even more careful here. The composition of cardinal direction relations can be quite complex.

Let's try to be more systematic by considering the 9-intersection model of cardinal directions.

Actually, I think I should step back and reconsider the problem. The cardinal direction relations "South" and "East" are binary relations between regions. When we say "x is South of y", we mean that every point in x is South of some point in y, and every point in y is North of some point in x.

Given this interpretation:
- If x is South of y, then for every point p_x in x, there exists a point p_y in y such that p_x is South of p_y. And for every point p_y in y, there exists a point p_x in x such that p_y is North of p_x.
- If y is East of z, then for every point p_y in y, there exists a point p_z in z such that p_y is East of p_z. And for every point p_z in z, there exists a point p_y in y such that p_z is West of p_y.

Now, the question is, what are the possible relations between x and z?

Let's approach this by considering the possible positions of the regions:

1. If x is entirely South of the Bounding Box of y, and y is entirely East of the Bounding Box of z, then x could be Southeast of z.

2. But if y extends far enough South, and z extends far enough East, then x could overlap with z in a way that makes x South of z.

3. Similarly, if y extends far enough South, and z extends far enough West, then x could overlap with z in a way that makes x Southwest of z.

4. If y and z overlap significantly, then x could potentially be West, South, or East of z.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this problem, perhaps I can find some references.

Actually, it looks like I should use the composition table for cardinal direction relations. If we have A rel1 B and B rel2 C, then the composition table gives us the possible relations between A and C.

For the cardinal direction calculus, the composition of South and East is typically Southeast. But there might be other possibilities depending on the exact definitions of the relations.

Let me think this through more carefully.

When we say "x is South of y", we're saying that x is entirely South of y. Similarly, when we say "y is East of z", we're saying that y is entirely East of z.

Now, let's think about where x can be relative to z.

If x is South of y, then x is below y. And if y is East of z, then y is to the right of z. So x is below and to the right of z, which makes it Southeast of z.

However, depending on the exact positions and sizes of the regions, x could also be South or East of z.

For example, if y is very wide and extends far to the West, and x is below the western part of y, then x could be South of z.

Similarly, if z is very tall and extends far to the South, and y is to the right of the southern part of z, then x could be East of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: South, East, and Southeast.

Wait, I think I need to be more precise about the cardinal direction relations. Let me clarify the definitions using the standard interpretation in qualitative spatial reasoning.

In the standard interpretation, the cardinal direction relations are defined using the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of regions, also known as the Bounding Box:
- A is North of B if the lowest latitude of A is greater than the highest latitude of B.
- A is South of B if the highest latitude of A is less than the lowest latitude of B.
- A is East of B if the westmost longitude of A is greater than the eastmost longitude of B.
- A is West of B if the eastmost longitude of A is less than the westmost longitude of B.
- A is Northeast of B if A is both North and East of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North and West of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is both South and East of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is both South and West of B.

With these definitions, let's analyze the composition:
If x is South of y, and y is East of z, then:
- The highest latitude of x is less than the lowest latitude of y.
- The westmost longitude of y is greater than the eastmost longitude of z.

From these, we can't directly infer a single relation between x and z. x could be:
- Southeast of z (if x is both South and East of z).
- South of z (if x is directly South of z).
- East of z (if x is directly East of z).

Let's see if x can also be Southwest of z, Northwest of z, or West of z.

For x to be Southwest of z, x would need to be both South and West of z. We know x is South of y, so it's likely South of z as well. But for x to be West of z, its eastmost longitude would need to be less than the westmost longitude of z. Given that y is East of z, and x is likely East of y (since it's South of y), it's unlikely that x is West of z. So, x is unlikely to be Southwest of z.

For x to be Northwest of z, x would need to be both North and West of z. We know x is South of y, so it's unlikely to be North of z. Therefore, x is unlikely to be Northwest of z.

For x to be West of z, its eastmost longitude would need to be less than the westmost longitude of z. As I reasoned earlier, given that y is East of z, and x is likely East of y, it's unlikely that x is West of z.

For x to be North of z, its lowest latitude would need to be greater than the highest latitude of z. We know x is South of y, so it's unlikely to be North of z. Therefore, x is unlikely to be North of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Southeast, South, and East.

Actually, let me think if x can be Southwest of z. For this to happen, x would need to be both South and West of z.

We know x is South of y. If z extends further South than y, then x might not be South of z. But since the question is asking for possible relations, I'll assume x is South of z.

For x to be West of z, its eastmost longitude would need to be less than the westmost longitude of z. But y is East of z, which means y's westmost longitude is greater than z's eastmost longitude. And since x is South of y, it's not necessarily East of y. x could be Southwest of y, in which case it could be West of z.

So, x can indeed be Southwest of z, if x is Southwest of y.

Similarly, x could be South of z if it's directly below z, or Southeast of z if it's Southeast of z.

Let me draw this again but more systematically. Let's denote the North, South, East, and West extents of a region using subscripts. For example, y_N is the northmost extent of region y. Then, for the specific case of cardinal direction relations as defined above:

- x is South of y: x_N < y_S
- y is East of z: y_W > z_E

Now, let's see the possible relations:

1. South: x_N < z_S and (x_E ≥ z_W) and (x_W ≤ z_E)
2. Southeast: x_N < z_S and x_W > z_E
3. Southwest: x_N < z_S and x_E < z_W
4. East: (x_N ≥ z_S) and (x_S ≤ z_N) and x_W > z_E
5. West: (x_N ≥ z_S) and (x_S ≤ z_N) and x_E < z_W

From the given conditions:
- x_N < y_S
- y_W > z_E

To determine if x can be South of z, we need to check if x_N < z_S. We know x_N < y_S, but we don't have a direct relation between y_S and z_S. So, it's possible for x to be South of z.

To determine if x can be Southeast of z, we need to check if x_N < z_S and x_W > z_E. We know x_N < y_S, but, again, we don't have a direct relation between y_S and z_S. We also don't have a direct relation between x_W and z_E. So, it's possible for x to be Southeast of z.

To determine if x can be Southwest of z, we need to check if x_N < z_S and x_E < z_W. As before, it's possible for x_N < z_S. We don't have a direct relation between x_E and z_W, so it's possible for x to be Southwest of z.

To determine if x can be East of z, we need to check if (x_N ≥ z_S) and (x_S ≤ z_N) and x_W > z_E. We know x_N < y_S, but we don't have a direct relation between y_S and z_S, or between x_S and z_N. We also don't have a direct relation between x_W and z_E. So, it's possible for x to be East of z.

To determine if x can be West of z, we need to check if (x_N ≥ z_S) and (x_S ≤ z_N) and x_E < z_W. As before, it's possible for (x_N ≥ z_S) and (x_S ≤ z_N). We don't have a direct relation between x_E and z_W, so it's possible for x to be West of z.

Actually, I feel like I'm not making progress. Let me start from basics again, using a different approach.

The composition of two cardinal direction relations, R1 and R2, is the set of all possible cardinal direction relations that can hold between two regions A and C, given that A R1 B and B R2 C for some region B.

In our case, we have:
- x is South of y
- y is East of z

And we want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's think of these in terms of coordinates. If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then:
- y is East of z, so y is at some coordinates (y_x, y_y) where y_x > 0.
- x is South of y, so x is at some coordinates (x_x, x_y) where x_y < y_y.

Now, the question is, what is the relation between x and z? That is, what is the relation between (x_x, x_y) and (0, 0)?

Given the constraints above, x_y could be less than, equal to, or greater than 0, and x_x could be less than, equal to, or greater than 0.

If x_y < 0 and x_x > 0, then x is Southeast of z.
If x_y < 0 and x_x = 0, then x is South of z.
If x_y < 0 and x_x < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
If x_y = 0 and x_x > 0, then x is East of z.
If x_y = 0 and x_x < 0, then x is West of z.
If x_y > 0 and x_x > 0, then x is Northeast of z.
If x_y > 0 and x_x = 0, then x is North of z.
If x_y > 0 and x_x < 0, then x is Northwest of z.

Given the constraints x_y < y_y and y_x > 0, let's analyze each case:

Southeast: x_y < 0 and x_x > 0. This is possible if y_y > 0 and x_y is negative.
South: x_y < 0 and x_x = 0. This is possible if y_y > 0 and x_y is negative.
Southwest: x_y < 0 and x_x < 0. This is possible if y_y > 0 and x_y is negative.
East: x_y = 0 and x_x > 0. This is possible if y_y = 0 and x_y = 0.
West: x_y = 0 and x_x < 0. This is not possible given the constraint y_x > 0, because if y_y = 0, then y is at (y_x, 0) with y_x > 0, and x is South of y, so x is at (x_x, x_y) with x_y < 0, which contradicts x_y = 0.
Northeast: x_y > 0 and x_x > 0. This is possible if y_y > 0 and 0 < x_y < y_y.
North: x_y > 0 and x_x = 0. This is not possible given the constraint y_x > 0, because if x_x = 0 and y_x > 0, then x is not East of z, but we know y is East of z. So if x is South of y, it should also be East of z, contradicting x_x = 0.
Northwest: x_y > 0 and x_x < 0. This is not possible given the constraint y_x > 0, for similar reasons as the North case.

So the possible relations between x and z are: Southeast, South, Southwest, East, and Northeast.

Oh wait, I think I made an error, the South, East, etc. I've been given are binary relations, not the regions of the 9-intersection model I've been discussing. Let me use the definitions more directly this time:

- A is North of B if all points in A have a higher latitude than all points in B.
- A is South of B if all points in A have a lower latitude than all points in B.
- A is East of B if all points in A have a higher longitude than all points in B.
- A is West of B if all points in A have a lower longitude than all points in B.

Given these definitions, we know:
- All points in x have a lower latitude than all points in y (x is South of y).
- All points in y have a higher longitude than all points in z (y is East of z).

Now, I have a problem: these definitions don't account for the combined directions like Northeast, Southeast, etc. But I think the approach to solve the problem remains the same. I need to determine the possible positions of x relative to z given the constraints.

Let's use lat(p) and long(p) to denote the latitude and longitude of a point p. Then:
- x is South of y means for all points p_x in x and p_y in y, lat(p_x) < lat(p_y).
- y is East of z means for all points p_y in y and p_z in z, long(p_y) > long(p_z).

Now, the question is, what are the possible positions of x relative to z?

For x to be South of z, all points in x must have a lower latitude than all points in z. Given that all points in x have a lower latitude than all points in y, and we don't have a direct relation between the latitudes of y and z, it's possible for x to be South of z.

For x to be East of z, all points in x must have a higher longitude than all points in z. We know all points in y have a higher longitude than all points in z. But we don't have a direct relation between the longitudes of x and y. So, it's possible for x to be East of z.

For x to be Southeast of z, it would need to be both South and East of z. As I've shown, both are possible. So, it's possible for x to be Southeast of z.

For x to be Southwest of z, it would need to be both South and West of z. We've already established that it's possible for x to be South of z. For it to be West of z, all points in x must have a lower longitude than all points in z. Given that all points in y have a higher longitude than all points in z, and x is South of y, it's possible for x to be West of z if it's positioned west of y.

For x to be North of z, all points in x must have a higher latitude than all points in z. Given that all points in x have a lower latitude than all points in y, for x to be North of z, all points in z would need to have a lower latitude than all points in x. But this would mean all points in z have a lower latitude than all points in y, which doesn't necessarily follow from the given constraints. So, it's possible for x to be North of z, but it depends on the specific positions of the regions.

For x to be Northeast of z, it would need to be both North and East of z. As I've discussed, it's possible for x to be East of z. But the possibility of x being North of z depends on the specific positions of the regions. So, the possibility of x being Northeast of z also depends on the specific positions.

For x to be Northwest of z, it would need to be both North and West of z. As I've discussed, the possibility of x being North of z depends on the specific positions of the regions. For it to be West of z, all points in x must have a lower longitude than all points in z. Given that all points in y have a higher longitude than all points in z, and x is South of y, it's possible for x to be West of z if it's positioned west of y. So, the possibility of x being Northwest of z depends on the specific positions.

For x to be West of z, all points in x must have a lower longitude than all points in z. Given that all points in y have a higher longitude than all points in z, and x is South of y, it's possible for x to be West of z if it's positioned west of y.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: South, East, Southeast, Southwest, West, and potentially North, Northeast, and Northwest, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

That doesn't seem right. Let's think about it differently.

Actually, a key point I missed is that these are binary relations as opposed to the 9-intersection model. So for the region to be Southeast, I'd have to define that.

Wait, I think I've been overthinking this problem. Let me start from the beginning and stick to the standard definitions of cardinal direction relations:

- A is North of B if all points in A have a higher latitude than all points in B.
- A is South of B if all points in A have a lower latitude than all points in B.
- A is East of B if all points in A have a higher longitude than all points in B.
- A is West of B if all points in A have a lower longitude than all points in B.
- A is Northeast of B if A is both North and East of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North and West of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is both South and East of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is both South and West of B.

Given these definitions, I can analyze the composition of "x is South of y" and "y is East of z":

For x to be South of z, all points in x must have a lower latitude than all points in z. Given that all points in x have a lower latitude than all points in y, x will be South of z if all points in z have a higher latitude than all points in y. But that's not necessarily true. So, whether x is South of z depends on the specific positions of the regions.

For x to be East of z, all points in x must have a higher longitude than all points in z. We know all points in y have a higher longitude than all points in z. But we don't have a direct relation between the longitudes of x and y. So, whether x is East of z also depends on the specific positions.

Let me use a different approach. Let's imagine a 2D plane and plot some possible configurations of x, y, and z that satisfy the constraints.

Constraint 1: x is South of y. This means x is entirely below y in the plane.
Constraint 2: y is East of z. This means y is entirely to the right of z in the plane.

Now, let's consider a few configurations:

Configuration 1:
z is at position (0, 2)
y is at position (2, 2)
x is at position (2, 0)

In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

Configuration 2:
z is at position (0, 2)
y is at position (2, 2)
x is at position (0, 0)

In this configuration, x is South of z.

Configuration 3:
z is at position (2, 2)
y is at position (4, 2)
x is at position (1, 0)

In this configuration, x is Southwest of z.

Configuration 4:
z is at position (0, 1)
y is at position (2, 1)
x is at position (3, 0)

In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

Configuration 5:
z is at position (0, 0)
y is at position (2, 0)
x is at position (1, -1)

In this configuration, x is South of z.

I think I see a pattern. Given the constraints that x is South of y and y is East of z, the possible relations between x and z are:
- South (if x is directly below z)
- Southeast (if x is both South and East of z)
- Southwest (if x is both South and West of z)

Let me double-check to see if there are any other possible relations. For instance, could x be East or West of z?

Configuration 6:
z is at position (0, 0)
y is at position (2, 1)
x is at position (3, 0)

In this configuration, x is East of z.

Configuration 7:
z is at position (2, 0)
y is at position (4, 1)
x is at position (1, 0)

In this configuration, x is West of z.

So, x can also be East or West of z.

Now, could x be North, Northeast, or Northwest of z?

For x to be North of z, all points in x must have a higher latitude than all points in z. Given that all points in x have a lower latitude than all points in y, for x to be North of z, all points in z would need to have a lower latitude than all points in x. But this would mean all points in z have a lower latitude than all points in y, which doesn't necessarily follow from the given constraints. So, it's possible for x to be North of z, but it depends on the specific positions of the regions.

Let me try to construct a configuration where x is North of z:

Configuration 8:
z is at position (0, -2)
y is at position (2, 2)
x is at position (1, 0)

In this configuration, x is North of z.

So, x can also be North of z. By extension, it can also be Northeast or Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

I'm not sure I'm doing this correctly. Let me revisit the definition of the relations.

Actually, here's what I think the issue might be. I'm defining regions as points, but in reality, regions have extent. I think I'm asked to use the following definitions: if two regions x and y have bounding boxes x_bb and y_bb, then the cardinal directions are defined as:

North(x, y): y_bb is entirely North of x_bb.
South(x, y): y_bb is entirely South of x_bb.
East(x, y): y_bb is entirely East of x_bb.
West(x, y): y_bb is entirely West of x_bb.
Northeast(x, y): y_bb is entirely Northeast of x_bb.
Southeast(x, y): y_bb is entirely Southeast of x_bb.
Southwest(x, y): y_bb is entirely Southwest of x_bb.
Northwest(x, y): y_bb is entirely Northwest of x_bb.
Bounding Box(x, y): y_bb overlaps with x_bb (or vice versa).

Given these definitions, I can analyze the composition of "x is South of y" and "y is East of z":

For x to be South of z, x_bb must be entirely South of z_bb. Given that x_bb is entirely South of y_bb, x will be South of z if z_bb is aligned with y_bb in the North-South direction. This is possible but not guaranteed.

Let me now construct some example configurations with rectangular regions and see what relations are possible between x and z.

Configuration 1:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, 2) and its lower-right corner at (1, 1).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, 2) and its lower-right corner at (3, 1).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, 0) and its lower-right corner at (3, -1).

In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

Configuration 2:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, 2) and its lower-right corner at (2, 1).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (3, 2) and its lower-right corner at (4, 1).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (1, 0) and its lower-right corner at (2, -1).

In this configuration, x is South of z.

Configuration 3:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, 2) and its lower-right corner at (3, 1).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (4, 2) and its lower-right corner at (5, 1).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (1, 0) and its lower-right corner at (2, -1).

In this configuration, x is Southwest of z.

Configuration 4:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, 1) and its lower-right corner at (1, 0).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, 1) and its lower-right corner at (3, 0).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (4, -1) and its lower-right corner at (5, -2).

In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

Configuration 5:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, 1) and its lower-right corner at (1, 0).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, 1) and its lower-right corner at (3, 0).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, -1) and its lower-right corner at (3, -2).

In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

So far I've seen three possible relations: South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Can x be East of z?

Configuration 6:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, 0) and its lower-right corner at (1, -1).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, 2) and its lower-right corner at (3, 1).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (4, 0) and its lower-right corner at (5, -1).

In this configuration, x is East of z.

So the list of possible relations gets updated to: South, Southeast, Southwest, and East.

Can x be West of z?

Configuration 7:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (4, 0) and its lower-right corner at (5, -1).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (6, 2) and its lower-right corner at (7, 1).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, 0) and its lower-right corner at (1, -1).

In this configuration, x is West of z.

So the list of possible relations gets updated to: South, Southeast, Southwest, East, and West.

Can x be in the Bounding Box of z (overlapping with z)?

Configuration 8:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, 0) and its lower-right corner at (2, -2).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (3, 2) and its lower-right corner at (4, 1).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (1, -1) and its lower-right corner at (3, -3).

In this configuration, x overlaps with z, so x is in the Bounding Box of z.

So the list of possible relations gets updated to: South, Southeast, Southwest, East, West, and Bounding Box.

Can x be North of z?

Let's construct a configuration where z is entirely South of x. But, we know x is South of y. So, for x to be North of z, z must be entirely South of y. But we also know y is East of z, which means z is entirely West of y. So, for x to be North of z, z must be Southwest of y.

Configuration 9:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, -3) and its lower-right corner at (1, -4).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, 2) and its lower-right corner at (3, 1).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, 0) and its lower-right corner at (3, -1).

In this configuration, x is North of z.

So the list of possible relations gets updated to: North, South, Southeast, Southwest, East, West, and Bounding Box.

Can x be Northeast of z?

Configuration 10:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, -3) and its lower-right corner at (1, -4).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (2, 2) and its lower-right corner at (3, 1).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (4, 0) and its lower-right corner at (5, -1).

In this configuration, x is Northeast of z.

So the list of possible relations gets updated to: North, Northeast, South, Southeast, Southwest, East, West, and Bounding Box.

Can x be Northwest of z?

Configuration 11:
z: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (4, -3) and its lower-right corner at (5, -4).
y: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (6, 2) and its lower-right corner at (7, 1).
x: A rectangle with its upper-left corner at (0, 0) and its lower-right corner at (1, -1).

In this configuration, x is Northwest of z.

So the list of possible relations gets updated to: North, Northeast, Northwest, South, Southeast, Southwest, East, West, and Bounding Box.

It seems like all cardinal direction relations are possible.

Let me step back and rethink. Maybe I'm not interpreting the cardinal direction relations correctly. Let's double-check the standard definitions:

- If region A is North of region B, then all points in A have a higher latitude than all points in B.
- If region A is South of region B, then all points in A have a lower latitude than all points in B.
- If region A is East of region B, then all points in A have a higher longitude than all points in B.
- If region A is West of region B, then all points in A have a lower longitude than all points in B.
- A is Northeast of B if A is both North and East of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North and West of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is both South and East of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is both South and West of B.

Given these definitions, we have:
- x is South of y: All points in x have a lower latitude than all points in y.
- y is East of z: All points in y have a higher longitude than all points in z.

I think the issue is with the "Bounding Box" relation. In the context of cardinal direction relations, there's usually no "Bounding Box" relation. Instead, a region is either in one of the eight cardinal directions, or it overlaps with the reference region.

Let's refine the analysis:

For x to be South of z, all points in x must have a lower latitude than all points in z. We know all points in x have a lower latitude than all points in y. But we don't have a direct relation between the latitudes of y and z. So, x can be South of z if all points in z have a higher latitude than all points in x.

For x to be North of z, all points in x must have a higher latitude than all points in z. But we know all points in x have a lower latitude than all points in y. For x to be North of z, all points in z must have a lower latitude than all points in x. This doesn't contradict the given constraints.

For x to be East of z, all points in x must have a higher longitude than all points in z. We know all points in y have a higher longitude than all points in z. But we don't have a direct relation between the longitudes of x and y. So, x can be East of z if all points in x have a higher longitude than all points in z.

For x to be West of z, all points in x must have a lower longitude than all points in z. But we know all points in y have a higher longitude than all points in z. For x to be West of z, all points in x must have a lower longitude than all points in z. This doesn't contradict the given constraints, since x is South of y, not West of y.

For x to be Northeast of z, it must be both North and East of z. We've established that both are possible. So, x can be Northeast of z.

For x to be Northwest of z, it must be both North and West of z. We've established that both are possible. So, x can be Northwest of z.

For x to be Southeast of z, it must be both South and East of z. We've established that both are possible. So, x can be Southeast of z.

For x to be Southwest of z, it must be both South and West of z. We've established that both are possible. So, x can be Southwest of z.

For x to overlap with z, some points in x must be in the same location as some points in z. There's no direct constraint preventing this. But if x is South of y and y is East of z, it means all points in x are South of all points in y, and all points in y are East of all points in z. If x were to overlap with z, it would mean some points in x are at the same location as some points in z. But given the constraints, these points would need to be South of all points in y and East of all points in z. This doesn't seem to contradict the given constraints.

So, in summary, given that x is South of y and y is East of z, the relation between x and z can be any of the eight cardinal directions or an overlap.

I'm not fully confident in this. Let me go back to the definitions and do the same analysis more carefully.

Let's define the latitude and longitude of regions as sets:
- Lat(A) = {lat(p) | p is a point in A}
- Long(A) = {long(p) | p is a point in A}

Given these definitions, the cardinal direction relations can be defined as:
- A is North of B if min(Lat(A)) > max(Lat(B)).
- A is South of B if max(Lat(A)) < min(Lat(B)).
- A is East of B if min(Long(A)) > max(Long(B)).
- A is West of B if max(Long(A)) < min(Long(B)).
- A is Northeast of B if A is both North and East of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North and West of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is both South and East of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is both South and West of B.
- A and B overlap (or are in the Bounding Box of each other) if neither of the above holds.

Given these definitions, we have:
- x is South of y: max(Lat(x)) < min(Lat(y)).
- y is East of z: min(Long(y)) > max(Long(z)).

Now, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z:

For x to be South of z, max(Lat(x)) < min(Lat(z)). We know max(Lat(x)) < min(Lat(y)), but we don't have a direct relation between Lat(y) and Lat(z). So, x can be South of z if min(Lat(z)) > max(Lat(x)).

For x to be North of z, min(Lat(x)) > max(Lat(z)). But we know max(Lat(x)) < min(Lat(y)). For x to be North of z, it would require max(Lat(z)) < min(Lat(x)) < max(Lat(x)) < min(Lat(y)). This means z is even further South than x, which is possible.

For x to be East of z, min(Long(x)) > max(Long(z)). We know min(Long(y)) > max(Long(z)), but we don't have a direct relation between Long(x) and Long(y). So, x can be East of z if min(Long(x)) > max(Long(z)).

For x to be West of z, max(Long(x)) < min(Long(z)). We know min(Long(y)) > max(Long(z)). For x to be West of z, it would require max(Long(x)) < min(Long(z)) < max(Long(z)) < min(Long(y)). This means x is even further West than z, which is possible.

For x to be Northeast of z, it must be both North and East of z. We've established that both are possible. So, x can be Northeast of z.

For x to be Northwest of z, it must be both North and West of z. We've established that both are possible. So, x can be Northwest of z.

For x to be Southeast of z, it must be both South and East of z. We've established that both are possible. So, x can be Southeast of z.

For x to be Southwest of z, it must be both South and West of z. We've established that both are possible. So, x can be Southwest of z.

For x and z to overlap (or be in the Bounding Box of each other), it would mean none of the cardinal direction relations hold between them. This is possible. For instance, if x and z share the same latitude range but have disjoint longitude ranges, or if they share the same longitude range but have disjoint latitude ranges. This is not ruled out by the given constraints.

So, in summary, given that x is South of y and y is East of z, the relation between x and z can be any of the eight cardinal directions or they can overlap. But is it possible for them to overlap given the specific constraints?

Actually, I think I'm mixing up two things. Let's revisit the problem. The cardinal direction relations are typically defined in a way that every region is in one and only one of the eight directions or they overlap. So, let's define the relations more precisely:

- A is North of B if min(Lat(A)) > max(Lat(B)) and Long(A) ∩ Long(B) ≠ ∅.
- A is South of B if max(Lat(A)) < min(Lat(B)) and Long(A) ∩ Long(B) ≠ ∅.
- A is East of B if min(Long(A)) > max(Long(B)) and Lat(A) ∩ Lat(B) ≠ ∅.
- A is West of B if max(Long(A)) < min(Long(B)) and Lat(A) ∩ Lat(B) ≠ ∅.
- A is Northeast of B if min(Lat(A)) > max(Lat(B)) and min(Long(A)) > max(Long(B)).
- A is Northwest of B if min(Lat(A)) > max(Lat(B)) and max(Long(A)) < min(Long(B)).
- A is Southeast of B if max(Lat(A)) < min(Lat(B)) and min(Long(A)) > max(Long(B)).
- A is Southwest of B if max(Lat(A)) < min(Lat(B)) and max(Long(A)) < min(Long(B)).
- A and B overlap (or are in the Bounding Box of each other) if none of the above holds.

This definition is a bit more nuanced, but it ensures that every pair of regions is in exactly one of the nine relations. Let's revisit the analysis:

Given that x is South of y, max(Lat(x)) < min(Lat(y)) and Long(x) ∩ Long(y) ≠ ∅.
Given that y is East of z, min(Long(y)) > max(Long(z)) and Lat(y) ∩ Lat(z) ≠ ∅.

I'm making a mistake in this interpretation, I think. Let's revisit the definitions. In the standard interpretation of cardinal direction relations, a region is in one of the eight cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) with respect to a reference region, or it overlaps with the reference region. 

I think that "Bounding Box" is included as an option because regions can potentially overlap, but the "Bounding Box" is not a direction.

But I think we need to be more clear on the definition:

First, given a reference region B, we divide the plane into nine parts using B's Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR). The central part corresponds to B's MBR. The eight other parts correspond to the eight cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.

Then, given another region A, we say that A is in a certain direction with respect to B if all of A is in that part of the plane. If A spans multiple parts, we might say it's in the Bounding Box of B or that it overlaps with B.

Given this interpretation, let's reason once more about the constraints that x is South of y and y is East of z. This means:
- x is entirely in the South part of the plane with respect to y. So, x lies below y's MBR.
- y is entirely in the East part of the plane with respect to z. So, y lies to the right of z's MBR.

To determine where x is with respect to z, we need to calculate where x lies with respect to z's MBR. Given that y is to the right of z and x is below y, the most straightforward case is that x is Southeast of z. But, depending on the exact positions of the regions, x could be in other directions as well. Let's rule out some possibilities:

For x to be North of z, it must be entirely above z's MBR. But since x is below y, and y is to the right of z, it's unlikely that x is entirely above z's MBR.

Wait, let me think of a more systematic way to tackle this. Let's imagine a simple scenario:

z: A rectangle at (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: A rectangle at (2, 0) to (3, 1)
x: A rectangle at (2, -1) to (3, -2)

In this scenario, y is East of z and x is South of y. But what's the relation between x and z? X is Southeast of z.

Now, let's try another configuration:

z: A rectangle at (0, 0) to (3, 1)
y: A rectangle at (4, 0) to (5, 1)
x: A rectangle at (1, -1) to (2, -2)

In this case, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x is South of z.

Another configuration:

z: A rectangle at (3, 0) to (4, 1)
y: A rectangle at (5, 0) to (6, 1)
x: A rectangle at (1, -1) to (2, -2)

In this case, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x is Southwest of z.

Let's try one more:

z: A rectangle at (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: A rectangle at (2, 0) to (3, 1)
x: A rectangle at (4, -1) to (5, -2)

In this case, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x is East and South of z, which might be classified as Southeast.

Actually, in the standard cardinal direction calculus, a region can only be in one of the nine relations with respect to another region. It can't be both East and South. If a region is both East and South, it's classified as Southeast.

So, from the example configurations I tried, the possible relations between x and z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

But could there be other relations? Let me try more configurations...

Configuration where x is East of z:

z: A rectangle at (0, -2) to (1, -1)
y: A rectangle at (2, 0) to (3, 1)
x: A rectangle at (2, -2) to (3, -3)

In this configuration, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x is East of z.

Configuration where x is West of z:

z: A rectangle at (3, -2) to (4, -1)
y: A rectangle at (5, 0) to (6, 1)
x: A rectangle at (1, -2) to (2, -3)

In this configuration, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x is West of z.

Configuration where x is Northeast of z:

z: A rectangle at (0, -4) to (1, -3)
y: A rectangle at (2, 0) to (3, 1)
x: A rectangle at (2, -2) to (3, -1)

In this configuration, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x is Northeast of z. But wait, is this right? Let me recheck.

Actually, for x to be Northeast of z, x would need to be both North and East of z. If x is South of y, and y is East of z, it's hard to imagine a scenario where x is North of z. But with a bit of creativity, we can come up with one:

z: A rectangle at (0, -4) to (1, -3)
y: A rectangle at (2, 0) to (3, 1)
x: A rectangle at (2, -2) to (3, -1)

In this scenario, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x is still North of z because z is even further South than x. And since x is to the right of z, x is Northeast of z.

Configuration where x is in the Bounding Box of z (overlaps with z):

z: A rectangle at (1, -2) to (3, 0)
y: A rectangle at (4, 0) to (5, 1)
x: A rectangle at (2, -3) to (4, -1)

In this configuration, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x overlaps with z.

So the possible relations between x and z include:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Bounding Box (overlaps)

Let's check if North, Northwest, or Northwest are possible:

For x to be North of z, it must be entirely above z's MBR. If x is South of y, and y and z have a similar latitude, it's challenging to position x such that it's North of z. But as I showed earlier, if z is far enough South, x can be North of z.

Configuration where x is North of z:

z: A rectangle at (1, -4) to (2, -3)
y: A rectangle at (3, 0) to (4, 1)
x: A rectangle at (1, -2) to (2, -1)

In this configuration, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x is North of z.

Configuration where x is Northwest of z:

z: A rectangle at (3, -4) to (4, -3)
y: A rectangle at (5, 0) to (6, 1)
x: A rectangle at (1, -2) to (2, -1)

In this configuration, y is East of z and x is South of y. But x is Northwest of z.

So, in summary, given the constraints that x is South of y and y is East of z, the relation between x and z can be any of the eight cardinal directions or they can overlap.

Actually, my problem is that I'm getting lost and not being systematic. So let me try this one more time using the relative positions of the regions.

First, to define the cardinal direction relations, I'll use the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of each region. Let's denote the MBR of a region X as X_mbr. Then, the nine cardinal direction relations are defined as:
- North(A, B): A_mbr is entirely above B_mbr.
- Northeast(A, B): A_mbr is entirely above and to the right of B_mbr.
- East(A, B): A_mbr is entirely to the right of B_mbr and at the same vertical level.
- Southeast(A, B): A_mbr is entirely below and to the right of B_mbr.
- South(A, B): A_mbr is entirely below B_mbr and at the same horizontal level.
- Southwest(A, B): A_mbr is entirely below and to the left of B_mbr.
- West(A, B): A_mbr is entirely to the left of B_mbr and at the same vertical level.
- Northwest(A, B): A_mbr is entirely above and to the left of B_mbr.
- Bounding Box(A, B): A_mbr overlaps with B_mbr.

Given the constraints that x is South of y and y is East of z, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

I'll use a coordinate system where the x-coordinate corresponds to the horizontal position (longitude) and the y-coordinate corresponds to the vertical position (latitude). In this system, South corresponds to a lower y-coordinate.

Given that x is South of y, the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of y. And given that y is East of z, the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z.

Let me visualize this with concrete coordinates:
z is at position (0, 0).
y is at position (1, 0) (East of z).
x is at position (1, -1) (South of y).

In this scenario, x is Southeast of z.

Now, I can vary the positions to explore other possibilities:
z is at position (0, 0).
y is at position (1, 0) (East of z).
x is at position (0, -1) (South of y).

In this scenario, x is South of z.

z is at position (0, 0).
y is at position (1, 0) (East of z).
x is at position (-1, -1) (South of y).

In this scenario, x is Southwest of z.

These examples cover South, Southeast, and Southwest. Let's check other relations:

East: For x to be East of z, the x-coordinate of x must be greater than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x must be the same as the y-coordinate of z. But if x is South of y, the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of y. If the y-coordinate of y is the same as the y-coordinate of z (as in the configurations I've been using), then the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of z, which means x is not at the same vertical level as z. But if the y-coordinate of y is greater than the y-coordinate of z, then x could be East of z. For example:
z is at position (0, -1).
y is at position (1, 0) (East of z).
x is at position (1, -1) (South of y).

In this scenario, x is East of z.

West: Following a similar logic as above, x could be West of z if the y-coordinate of y is greater than the y-coordinate of z. For example:
z is at position (0, -1).
y is at position (1, 0) (East of z).
x is at position (-1, -1) (South of y).

In this scenario, x is West of z.

North: For x to be North of z, the y-coordinate of x must be greater than the y-coordinate of z. If x is South of y, the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of y. But if the y-coordinate of z is even less than the y-coordinate of x, then x could be North of z. For example:
z is at position (0, -2).
y is at position (1, 0) (East of z).
x is at position (0, -1) (South of y).

In this scenario, x is North of z.

Northeast: For x to be Northeast of z, it must be both North and East of z. Using the same logic as above, if the y-coordinate of z is less than the y-coordinate of x, and the x-coordinate of z is less than the x-coordinate of x, then x could be Northeast of z. For example:
z is at position (0, -2).
y is at position (1, 0) (East of z).
x is at position (1, -1) (South of y).

In this scenario, x is Northeast of z.

Northwest: For x to be Northwest of z, it must be both North and West of z. Using the same logic as above, if the y-coordinate of z is less than the y-coordinate of x, and the x-coordinate of z is greater than the x-coordinate of x, then x could be Northwest of z. For example:
z is at position (0, -2).
y is at position (1, 0) (East of z).
x is at position (-1, -1) (South of y).

In this scenario, x is Northwest of z.

Bounding Box: For x to overlap with z, their MBRs must intersect. This is possible in many configurations. For example:
z is a rectangle from (-1, -1) to (1, 0).
y is a rectangle from (2, -1) to (3, 1).
x is a rectangle from (0, -2) to (2, -1).

In this configuration, x overlaps with z.

So, in summary, given the constraints that x is South of y and y is East of z, the relation between x and z can be any of the eight cardinal directions or they can overlap (be in the Bounding Box of each other).

Let me make one last check with a diagram on the plane. Given that x is South of y, and y is East of z:

```
z     y
      
      x
```

In this arrangement, x is Southeast of z. But I've already shown examples where x can be in any of the eight cardinal directions or can overlap with z. So, my final answer is:

Given the constraints that x is South of y and y is East of z, the possible relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
- Bounding Box (overlaps)

That is, any of the nine possible cardinal direction relations can hold between x and z. This is because the constraints are not restrictive enough to eliminate any of the possibilities. So the answer is all of the choices.

Wait, I should double check that a few more times. I think the approach I was using was correct, but I kept getting thrown off. Let me try again.

In the cardinal direction calculus, a reference region (e.g., z) partitions the plane into 9 regions based on its MBR: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the region covered by the MBR itself (Bounding Box). 

For a region to be in a specific cardinal direction with respect to another, it must be entirely in that specific partition. If it spans multiple partitions, we say it overlaps with the reference region.

Now, let's reason about the constraints:
- x is South of y: All points in x are below the southmost point of y.
- y is East of z: All points in y are to the right of the eastmost point of z.

Let's consider the MBR of z. This divides the plane into 9 regions. Where can x be with respect to these regions?

For x to be in the Bounding Box of z, it must overlap with z's MBR. Given the constraints, x is South of y, and y is East of z. But these constraints don't explicitly state that x is East of z. So, if x is South of y but not East of z, it could overlap with z. This is possible.

For x to be North of z, it must be entirely above z's MBR. If x is South of y, and y is East of z, for x to be North of z, z must be even further South than x. This is possible.

For x to be Northeast of z, it must be both North and East of z. Using the same logic as above, if z is even further South than x, and x is East of z, then x could be Northeast of z. This is possible.

For x to be East of z, it must be entirely to the right of z's MBR and at the same vertical level. If x is South of y, and y is East of z, for x to be East of z, x must be at the same vertical level as z. This is possible if the bottom of y aligns with the top of x, and the top of z aligns with the bottom of y.

For x to be Southeast of z, it must be both South and East of z. If x is South of y, and y is East of z, then x is likely South of z. If x is also East of z, then it's Southeast of z. This is the most straightforward configuration.

For x to be South of z, it must be entirely below z's MBR and at the same horizontal level. If x is South of y, and y is East of z, for x to be South of z, x must be at the same horizontal level as z. This is possible if the right edge of z aligns with the left edge of y, and the right edge of y aligns with the left edge of x.

For x to be Southwest of z, it must be both South and West of z. If x is South of y, and y is East of z, for x to be Southwest of z, x must be West of z. This is possible if the left edge of x is to the left of the right edge of z.

For x to be West of z, it must be entirely to the left of z's MBR and at the same vertical level. If x is South of y, and y is East of z, for x to be West of z, x must be at the same vertical level as z. This is possible if the bottom of y aligns with the top of x, and the top of z aligns with the bottom of y. Additionally, the left edge of x must be to the left of the right edge of z.

For x to be Northwest of z, it must be both North and West of z. Using the same logic as above, if z is even further South than x, and x is West of z, then x could be Northwest of z. This is possible.

So, in conclusion, given the constraints that x is South of y and y is East of z, the relation between x and z can be any of the nine cardinal direction relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box (overlaps).

Hmm, what am I missing? Ok, let me try and be more precise. 

I think I just don't have enough constraints to rule out any of the possibilities. The constraints only tell me that x is South of y and y is East of z. These constraints don't restrict the possible relations between x and z in a way that rules out any of the nine cardinal direction relations.

Hmm, maybe I should try a more systematic way to try and rule these out. Let me draw a grid, and see if I can place x, y, and z so that x and z have each of the 9 possible relations while respecting the constraints.

Alright, I'll try to place regions x, y, and z on a grid in a way that x and z have each of the 9 possible relations. Let's denote positions on the grid as (row, column).

Constraint 1: x is South of y. This means
