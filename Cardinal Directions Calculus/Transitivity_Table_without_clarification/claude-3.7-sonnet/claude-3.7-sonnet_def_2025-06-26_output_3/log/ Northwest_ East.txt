PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's denote the cardinal directions as follows:

- N: North
- NE: Northeast
- E: East
- SE: Southeast
- S: South
- SW: Southwest
- W: West
- NW: Northwest
- BB: Bounding Box (when one region contains another)

We are given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is E of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

To solve this problem, I need to think about the composition of cardinal direction relations. Specifically, I need to determine what relation(s) are possible between x and z given the constraints.

Let's think about what it means for x to be NW of y:
- x is to the northwest of y, which means x is both north and west of y.

And for y to be E of z:
- y is to the east of z, which means y is directly east of z.

Now, let's try to visualize this and determine the possible locations of x relative to z.

If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then y is to the east, so y is at some point (a, 0) where a > 0.
Now, x is to the northwest of y, so x is at some point (a - b, c) where b > 0 and c > 0.

So, x is at (a - b, c) and z is at (0, 0). What's the relation between x and z?

We need to compare the coordinates:
- If a - b > 0, then x is to the east of z.
- If a - b < 0, then x is to the west of z.
- c > 0, so x is to the north of z.

Now, let's consider different values of a, b, and c to see the possible relations:

1. If a - b > 0 and c > 0, then x is to the northeast (NE) of z.
2. If a - b = 0 and c > 0, then x is to the north (N) of z.
3. If a - b < 0 and c > 0, then x is to the northwest (NW) of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (Northeast)
- N (North)
- NW (Northwest)

But wait, let's double-check this by thinking about it geometrically.

Hmm I think there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me approach this differently. Let's place y at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity.

Given:
- x is NW of y, so x is at some point (-a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0.
- z is W of y (since y is E of z), so z is at some point (-c, 0) where c > 0.

Now, what's the relation between x at (-a, b) and z at (-c, 0)?

- If a > c, then x is to the west of z.
- If a < c, then x is to the east of z.
- If a = c, then x is directly north of z.
- b > 0, so x is to the north of z.

So, the possible relations are:
- N (North) when a = c
- NE (Northeast) when a < c
- NW (Northwest) when a > c

But there's another mistake in my reasoning. Let me try again with a clearer approach.

Let's use a coordinate system where:
- East is the positive x-axis.
- North is the positive y-axis.

Given:
- Region y is at the origin (0, 0).
- Region x is NW of y, so x is in the region where x-coordinate < 0 and y-coordinate > 0.
- Region z is W of y (since y is E of z), so z is in the region where x-coordinate < 0 and y-coordinate = 0.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z. We know:
- x is at some point (-a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0.
- z is at some point (-c, 0) where c > 0.

The relation between x and z depends on the values of a and c:

- If a > c, then x is to the west of z.
- If a < c, then x is to the east of z.
- If a = c, then x is directly north of z.
- Since b > 0, x is always to the north of z.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North) when a = c
- NE (Northeast) when a < c
- NW (Northwest) when a > c

Oh wait, I think there's another mistake. Let me think more clearly.

Given:
- Region y is E of region z. This means z is W of y.
- Region x is NW of region y.

Now, let's place y at the origin (0, 0):
- z is to the west of y, so z is at some point (-c, 0) where c > 0.
- x is to the northwest of y, so x is at some point (-a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

The relation between x and z depends on the relative values of a and c:

- If a > c, then x is to the west of z.
- If a < c, then x is to the east of z.
- If a = c, then x is directly north of z.
- Since b > 0, x is always to the north of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North) when a = c
- NE (Northeast) when a < c
- NW (Northwest) when a > c

Wait, I need to be careful here. Let me think about the cardinal directions in terms of regions, not just points. The cardinal direction relations partition the plane into 9 regions (including the reference region itself).

For the relation "x is NW of y", x is in the region that is both north and west of y. Similarly, for "y is E of z", y is in the region that is east of z.

Given:
- y is E of z
- x is NW of y

The possible regions for x relative to z depend on the relative positions of y and z. Since y is E of z, y is somewhere to the east of z. And since x is NW of y, x is somewhere to the northwest of y.

Let's approach this differently. Let's imagine a grid, and then let's talk about regions.

1. Imagine a 3x3 grid labeled as follows:
   NW | N | NE
   ---+---+---
   W  | O | E
   ---+---+---
   SW | S | SE

2. Given that "y is E of z", z is in the W region relative to y, or equivalently, y is in the E region relative to z.

3. Given that "x is NW of y", x is in the NW region relative to y.

4. Now, to find the possible regions for x relative to z, we need to consider all possible positions of x, y, and z given the constraints.

5. Since y is E of z, let's place z at the origin O and y in the E region.

6. Since x is NW of y, x is in the NW region relative to y.

7. The possible positions of x relative to z depend on where exactly y is in the E region and where exactly x is in the NW region relative to y.

Hmm, let me draw this out more explicitly.

Let's denote the regions relative to z:
   NW_z | N_z | NE_z
   -----+-----+-----
   W_z  | z   | E_z
   -----+-----+-----
   SW_z | S_z | SE_z

And given that y is E of z, y is in E_z.

Now, let's denote the regions relative to y:
   NW_y | N_y | NE_y
   -----+-----+-----
   W_y  | y   | E_y
   -----+-----+-----
   SW_y | S_y | SE_y

Given that x is NW of y, x is in NW_y.

Now, where can NW_y overlap with the regions relative to z? Let's consider the possible positions of y in E_z and the corresponding positions of NW_y.

Actually, I realize now that thinking in terms of a 3x3 grid for cardinal directions might simplify the problem, but it doesn't capture the full spectrum of possible positions. 

Let me reconsider with a more comprehensive approach. I'll use the standard definition of cardinal direction relations.

Given:
- Region y is E of region z.
- Region x is NW of region y.

Now, I want to find the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Ah, I got confused above. Let me solve this problem more systematically. 

The cardinal direction relations can be represented using the 9-intersection model. We can think of the relations in terms of the relative positions of the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions.

Given that region y is E of region z, the MBR of y is strictly to the east of the MBR of z. And given that region x is NW of region y, the MBR of x is strictly to the northwest of the MBR of y.

Now, let's determine the possible positions of x relative to z.

If y is directly east of z, and x is directly northwest of y, then x could be:
- Directly north of z (if x aligns with z in the east-west direction).
- Northeast of z (if x is east of z).
- Northwest of z (if x is west of z).

Let's visualize this. Let's say we have the coordinates:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (a, 0) where a > 0 (since y is E of z).
- x is at (a - b, c) where b > 0 and c > 0 (since x is NW of y).

Now, the position of x relative to z depends on the values of a and b:
- If a - b > 0, then x is east of z, which combined with x being north of z, means x is NE of z.
- If a - b = 0, then x is directly north of z, so x is N of z.
- If a - b < 0, then x is west of z, which combined with x being north of z, means x is NW of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

Ah, this matches my earlier conclusions, which gives me confidence in this result.

Let me double-check to make sure we're on the right track.

Actually, let's use the formal definition of cardinal direction relations.

For two regions A and B:
- B is N of A if ymin(B) ≥ ymax(A) and xmin(B) ≤ xmax(A) and xmax(B) ≥ xmin(A).
- B is S of A if ymax(B) ≤ ymin(A) and xmin(B) ≤ xmax(A) and xmax(B) ≥ xmin(A).
- B is E of A if xmin(B) ≥ xmax(A) and ymin(B) ≤ ymax(A) and ymax(B) ≥ ymin(A).
- B is W of A if xmax(B) ≤ xmin(A) and ymin(B) ≤ ymax(A) and ymax(B) ≥ ymin(A).
- B is NE of A if xmin(B) ≥ xmax(A) and ymin(B) ≥ ymax(A).
- B is SE of A if xmin(B) ≥ xmax(A) and ymax(B) ≤ ymin(A).
- B is SW of A if xmax(B) ≤ xmin(A) and ymax(B) ≤ ymin(A).
- B is NW of A if xmax(B) ≤ xmin(A) and ymin(B) ≥ ymax(A).

Given:
- y is E of z, so xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z) and ymin(y) ≤ ymax(z) and ymax(y) ≥ ymin(z).
- x is NW of y, so xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) and ymin(x) ≥ ymax(y).

Now, let's derive the possible relations between x and z.

We know:
- xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) (from x is NW of y)
- xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z) (from y is E of z)

Combining these, we get:
- xmax(x) ≤ xmax(z)

But wait, I think I've made an error. Let's correct it.

From:
- xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) (from x is NW of y)
- xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z) (from y is E of z)

We get:
- xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) ≤ xmax(z)
  
Wait this is wrong. I need to be more careful. 

From:
- xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) (from x is NW of y)
- xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z) (from y is E of z)

We can infer:
- xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) and xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z)
- So, xmax(x) ≤ xmax(z) [actually, this doesn't directly follow from the premises]

Let's be even more systematic.

Given:
- y is E of z, so xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z).
- x is NW of y, so xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) and ymin(x) ≥ ymax(y).

From these, we can infer:
- xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) (from x is NW of y)
- xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z) (from y is E of z)
- Therefore, xmax(x) ≤ xmax(z) [No, this is wrong, I meant xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z)]

OK this is still wrong. Let me try a different approach.

Let's approach this problem geometrically.

Given:
- y is E of z: This means y is strictly to the east of z. If we visualize z as a rectangle, y is entirely to the right of it.
- x is NW of y: This means x is strictly to the northwest of y. If we visualize y as a rectangle, x is entirely to the upper-left of it.

The question is: What is the possible relationship between x and z?

If y is E of z, then y is entirely to the right of z. If x is NW of y, then x is entirely to the upper-left of y.

Considering the relative positions, x can be:
- Strictly to the northwest of z (NW).
- Strictly to the north of z (N).
- Strictly to the northeast of z (NE).

Let me verify this with a simple diagram.

Scenario 1:
```
    x
    |
z---y
```
Here, x is N of z.

Scenario 2:
```
x
| \
z---y
```
Here, x is NW of z.

Scenario 3:
```
      x
     /
z---y
```
Here, x is NE of z.

Given the constraints, these are the three possible scenarios for the relationship between x and z. Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

Oh, it looks like I've been making an error above. Let me verify my reasoning more carefully. 

From:
- xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) (from x is NW of y)
- xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z) (from y is E of z)

We can deduce:
- xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y)
- xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z)

So, xmax(x) ≤ xmin(y) ≥ xmax(z).

This tells us that xmax(x) ≤ xmax(z) does NOT necessarily follow. We can't directly compare xmax(x) and xmax(z) based on the given constraints.

In fact, I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider the problem.

Let's denote:
- z's bounding box as [z_left, z_right] × [z_bottom, z_top].
- y's bounding box as [y_left, y_right] × [y_bottom, y_top].
- x's bounding box as [x_left, x_right] × [x_bottom, x_top].

Given:
- y is E of z, so y_left ≥ z_right.
- x is NW of y, so x_right ≤ y_left and x_bottom ≥ y_top.

Now, what can we deduce about the relationship between x and z?

We know:
- x_right ≤ y_left (from x is NW of y)
- y_left ≥ z_right (from y is E of z)

From these, we can infer:
- x_right ≤ y_left
- y_left ≥ z_right

So, x_right ≤ y_left ≥ z_right. This means x_right ≤ z_right, but since this is not a strict inequality, x_right ≤ z_right. This implies that x is either to the west of z, or it touches z's eastern border.

For the north-south relationship, we know:
- x_bottom ≥ y_top (from x is NW of y)
- But we don't have a direct constraint relating y's vertical extent to z's.

Given y is E of z, their vertical extents can overlap in any manner. So, we need to consider all possibilities for the vertical relationship between y and z, and consequently, between x and z.

If y is vertically aligned with z (i.e., their vertical extents overlap), then x, being above y, is either strictly to the north of z or to the north and west of z.

If y is above z, then x, being above y, is strictly to the north of z, or to the north and west of z.

If y is below z, then x, being above y, can be to the east, west, or aligned with z in the east-west direction. Given that x is also to the west of y and y is to the east of z, x can be to the west of z, to the east of z, or aligned with z in the east-west direction.

Combining all possibilities, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

I think my analysis is correct now, and it matches my earlier conclusion.

Given:
- y is E of z
- x is NW of y

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

Let me double-check with more concrete visualizations.

Scenario 1: y is directly east of z, and x is directly northwest of y.
```
   x
   |
z--y
```
Here, x is N of z.

Scenario 2: y is east of z, and x is northwest of y but more to the west.
```
x
| \
z--y
```
Here, x is NW of z.

Scenario 3: y is east of z, and x is northwest of y but more to the east.
```
     x
    /
z--y
```
Here, x is NE of z.

Visualization with regions:

Scenario 1:
```
+---+   +---+
| x |   |   |
+---+   |   |
        | y |
+---+   |   |
| z |   |   |
+---+   +---+
```
Here, x is N of z.

Scenario 2:
```
+---+
| x |
+---+   +---+
        |   |
+---+   | y |
| z |   |   |
+---+   +---+
```
Here, x is NW of z.

Scenario 3:
```
    +---+
    | x |
    +---+
        
+---+   +---+
| z |   | y |
+---+   +---+
```
Here, x is NE of z.

Given these visualizations, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

Given:
- y is E of z
- x is NW of y

Based on the analysis and visualizations, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

Let me sanity check this again. Actually, I think the issue in my reasoning above had to do with the 2D nature of these directions.

When we say "y is E of z", we're saying that y is strictly to the east of z, but y can be at any vertical position relative to z.

Similarly, when we say "x is NW of y", we're saying that x is strictly to the northwest of y.

For x to be N of z, x would need to be directly above z.
For x to be NE of z, x would need to be to the northeast of z.
For x to be NW of z, x would need to be to the northwest of z.

It seems like x could be N, NE, or NW of z, depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z.

Let's approach this differently. Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity.

Given:
- y is E of z, so y is at some point (a, b) where a > 0.
- x is NW of y, so x is at some point (a - c, b + d) where c > 0 and d > 0.

The position of x relative to z depends on the values of a, b, c, and d:
- If a - c > 0, then x is east of z. Combined with x being north of z (since b + d > b), this means x is NE of z.
- If a - c = 0, then x is directly north of z, so x is N of z.
- If a - c < 0, then x is west of z. Combined with x being north of z, this means x is NW of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

Ok let's take a further step back. Let me try and use the definition of cardinal directions.

The cardinal direction relations partition the plane into 9 regions (including the reference region itself).

For the relation "y is E of z", y is in the region that is east of z. Similarly, for "x is NW of y", x is in the region that is northwest of y.

Given:
- y is E of z
- x is NW of y

The possible regions for x relative to z depend on the relative positions of y and z.

Let's approach this problem geometrically. The figure below shows the 9 tiles for the cardinal directions, centered at z.

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | z | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Now, given that y is E of z, y lies in the E region. And given that x is NW of y, x lies in a region that is northwest of y.

If y is in the E region relative to z, and x is NW of y, then x can be in various regions relative to z, depending on where exactly y is in the E region and where exactly x is northwest of y.

Let's consider a more specific example. Suppose y is directly east of z (i.e., at the center of the E region). Then, x, being NW of y, could be in the N region relative to z.

Alternatively, if y is in the upper part of the E region, x, being NW of y, could be in the NE region relative to z.

And if y is in the lower part of the E region, x, being NW of y, could be in the NW region relative to z.

So, the possible regions for x relative to z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

OK, I think I understand the problem now.

For this we need to do a composition of the cardinal direction relations. Using the transitivity table, we can determine what the relationship between x and z could be.

Given that:
- x is NW of y
- y is E of z

What is the relationship between x and z? 

I think from the above, we have:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

Let me see if there's an easy way to verify this. Maybe by drawing examples?

Actually, I think a more systematic approach would be to use a transitivity table for cardinal direction relations. These tables specify the possible relations for the composition of two relations.

Let's use the transitivity table:

NW ∘ E: What are the possible relations when we compose NW with E?

NW ∘ E = {N, NE, NW}

Why?
- If y is E of z, y is strictly to the east of z, but can be at any vertical position relative to z.
- If x is NW of y, x is strictly to the northwest of y.
- Depending on the exact positions, x can be N, NE, or NW of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

Great, I think I've exhausted all the ways of addressing the problem, and they've all led to the same answer. To be precise, let me state the answer:

Given that:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is E of region z

The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- NW (Northwest)

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- North
- Northeast
- Northwest
