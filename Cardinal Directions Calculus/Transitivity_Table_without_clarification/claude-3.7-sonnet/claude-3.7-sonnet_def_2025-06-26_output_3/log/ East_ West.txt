PROMPT: Let  East and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I need to analyze the constraints that we're given to figure out the possible cardinal direction relation between regions x and z.

We're told that:
- x is East of y
- y is West of z

Let's visualize this:

x is East of y means that x is located to the east of y.
y is West of z means that y is located to the west of z.

So we have:
x is East of y, and y is West of z.

This means, from left to right on a map (west to east), we'd have:
y (west) --> z (east)
And separately:
y (west) <-- x (east)

Combining these, we get:
y is west of both x and z.
x is east of y.
z is east of y.

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z. They could be arranged in various ways. Let's consider the possibilities.

1. x could be East of z. This would mean all three regions are in a line from west to east: y --> z --> x.
2. x could be West of z. This would mean y --> x --> z from west to east.
3. x could be North of z. This means x is above z on a map.
4. x could be South of z. This means x is below z on a map.
5. x could be Northeast of z. This means x is above and to the right of z on a map.
6. x could be Southeast of z. This means x is below and to the right of z on a map.
7. x could be Northwest of z. This means x is above and to the left of z on a map.
8. x could be Southwest of z. This means x is below and to the left of z on a map.
9. x and z could overlap, in which case the relation would be "Bounding Box".

Given the constraints:
- x is East of y
- y is West of z

All we know for sure is that x is east of y and z is east of y. We don't have any constraint directly relating x and z. Therefore, any of the cardinal directions could be possible for the relation between x and z.

Wait, let me double-check that. Actually, can x be West of z? If y is West of z, and x is East of y, then x could still be West of z if x is between y and z. So, x could be West of z.

Similarly, for other directions, since we don't have direct constraints on the positions of x and z relative to each other, all cardinal directions (and combinations thereof) seem possible.

But let's double check these by drawing some specific scenarios for each case:

1. x East of z:
   y --- z --- x
   (Here, x is east of y and z, and z is east of y)

2. x West of z:
   y --- x --- z
   (Here, x is east of y but west of z, and z is east of y and x)

3. x North of z (top view):
   x
   |
   z --- y
   (Here, x is north of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

4. x South of z (top view):
   z --- y
   |
   x
   (Here, x is south of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

5. x Northeast of z (top view):
   x
  /
 z --- y
   (Here, x is northeast of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

6. x Southeast of z (top view):
 z --- y
  \
   x
   (Here, x is southeast of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

7. x Northwest of z (top view):
   x
  /
 y --- z
   (Here, x is northwest of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

Hmm, wait. This doesn't quite look right. Let me think again. If x is East of y and y is West of z, then:

- x is to the east of y
- z is to the east of y (since y is to the west of z)

So both x and z are to the east of y. But their relative positions to each other can vary.

Let's redraw the scenarios:

1. x East of z:
   y --- z --- x
   (Here, x is east of y and z, z is east of y)

2. x West of z:
   y --- x --- z
   (Here, x is east of y but west of z, z is east of y and x)

3. x North of z (top view):
    x
    |
y ---z
   (Here, x is north of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

4. x South of z (top view):
y ---z
    |
    x
   (Here, x is south of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

5. x Northeast of z (top view):
     x
    /
y --z
   (Here, x is northeast of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

6. x Southeast of z (top view):
y --z
    \
     x
   (Here, x is southeast of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

7. x Northwest of z (top view):
    x
   /
y --- z
   (Here, x is northwest of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

Wait, that still doesn't look right for case 7. Let me reconsider.

If x is East of y, then x is to the right of y on a west-east axis.
If y is West of z, then y is to the left of z on a west-east axis.

So, we have:
y is to the left of both x and z.
x is to the right of y.
z is to the right of y.

But the relative positions of x and z are not constrained. 

Let's think about it in terms of coordinates. If we place y at the origin (0, 0), then:
- x is somewhere to the east (right) of y, so x's x-coordinate is positive.
- z is somewhere to the east (right) of y, so z's x-coordinate is positive.
- The y-coordinates of x and z are unconstrained.

So, x and z can be in any cardinal direction relation to each other as long as they both have positive x-coordinates (both are to the east of y).

Let's analyze each cardinal direction relation:

1. x East of z:
   This means x's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate. This is possible.

2. x West of z:
   This means x's x-coordinate is less than z's x-coordinate. This is possible, as long as both x and z have positive x-coordinates.

3. x North of z:
   This means x's y-coordinate is greater than z's y-coordinate, and x's x-coordinate equals z's x-coordinate. This is possible.

4. x South of z:
   This means x's y-coordinate is less than z's y-coordinate, and x's x-coordinate equals z's x-coordinate. This is possible.

5. x Northeast of z:
   This means x's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate and x's y-coordinate is greater than z's y-coordinate. This is possible.

6. x Southeast of z:
   This means x's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate and x's y-coordinate is less than z's y-coordinate. This is possible.

7. x Northwest of z:
   This means x's x-coordinate is less than z's x-coordinate and x's y-coordinate is greater than z's y-coordinate. This is possible, as long as both x and z have positive x-coordinates.

8. x Southwest of z:
   This means x's x-coordinate is less than z's x-coordinate and x's y-coordinate is less than z's y-coordinate. This is possible, as long as both x and z have positive x-coordinates.

So, all cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

Wait, I need to be more careful about the definitions of cardinal directions. Let me re-check my understanding.

For cardinal directions, we typically divide the plane into regions based on the position of a reference point. For instance, if z is our reference point, then:
- East of z means the region to the right of z without any overlap in the y-direction.
- West of z means the region to the left of z without any overlap in the y-direction.
- North of z means the region above z without any overlap in the x-direction.
- South of z means the region below z without any overlap in the x-direction.
- Northeast of z means the region to the right and above z.
- Southeast of z means the region to the right and below z.
- Northwest of z means the region to the left and above z.
- Southwest of z means the region to the left and below z.

Given these definitions, and given that:
- x is East of y
- y is West of z

Let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

If y is West of z, then y is directly to the left of z (without any overlap in the y-direction).
If x is East of y, then x is directly to the right of y (without any overlap in the y-direction).

Hmm, actually, I need to rethink this. The definitions of cardinal directions I provided might not be the same as those implied in the question. Let's go back to the basic understanding of cardinal directions:

- East means to the right on a map.
- West means to the left on a map.
- North means upwards on a map.
- South means downwards on a map.
- Northeast means to the right and upwards on a map.
- Southeast means to the right and downwards on a map.
- Northwest means to the left and upwards on a map.
- Southwest means to the left and downwards on a map.

Given these definitions, let's revisit the constraints:
- x is East of y (x is to the right of y)
- y is West of z (y is to the left of z)

This means:
- y is to the left of z
- x is to the right of y

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z. We just know that x is to the right of y and z is to the right of y. The relative positions of x and z to each other are not directly constrained.

x could be to the right of z (East), to the left of z (West), above z (North), below z (South), to the right and above z (Northeast), to the right and below z (Southeast), to the left and above z (Northwest), or to the left and below z (Southwest).

Actually, I think my analysis from earlier stands. All cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

Hmm, but given the definition that "x is East of y" means x is directly to the right of y without any overlap in the y-direction (as I mentioned earlier), and "y is West of z" means y is directly to the left of z without any overlap in the y-direction, then both x and z would be at the same y-coordinate (or height on the map).

This would mean:
- If x is to the right of z, then x is East of z.
- If x is to the left of z, then x is West of z.
- x and z are at the same y-coordinate, so x cannot be North, South, Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, or Southwest of z.

But I'm not sure if this is the definition being used in the question. Let me re-read the question.

The question asks about cardinal direction relations without providing specific definitions. Let's go with the most common interpretation:

- East means to the right on a map.
- West means to the left on a map.
- North means upwards on a map.
- South means downwards on a map.
- Northeast means to the right and upwards on a map.
- Southeast means to the right and downwards on a map.
- Northwest means to the left and upwards on a map.
- Southwest means to the left and downwards on a map.

Given these definitions, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z based on the constraints:
- x is East of y (x is to the right of y)
- y is West of z (y is to the left of z, or z is to the right of y)

Let's visualize this:
We have y to the left of z, and x to the right of y.

y --- z
  \
   x

or

y --- z
     /
    x

or

    x
   /
y --- z

or

y --- z --- x

The relative positions of x and z are not directly constrained. Thus, all cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, now I realize that the definitions I provided earlier might be mixing up different concepts. Let me try to clarify.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations are often formalized using a partitioning of the plane around a reference point or region. For instance, using the Minimal Bounding Rectangle (MBR) or a centroid of a region as a reference.

Let's consider the most basic model, where regions are abstracted as points and cardinal directions partition the plane into eight sectors and a center:
- North (N): The sector directly above the reference point.
- Northeast (NE): The sector above and to the right of the reference point.
- East (E): The sector directly to the right of the reference point.
- Southeast (SE): The sector below and to the right of the reference point.
- South (S): The sector directly below the reference point.
- Southwest (SW): The sector below and to the left of the reference point.
- West (W): The sector directly to the left of the reference point.
- Northwest (NW): The sector above and to the left of the reference point.
- Bounding Box (B): The reference point itself.

If regions x and y are abstracted as points, then the statement "x is East of y" means that x lies in the East sector with y as the reference point. Similarly, "y is West of z" means that y lies in the West sector with z as the reference point.

Now, if we're asked to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to use these constraints to deduce the possible sectors x could lie in, with z as the reference point.

Given:
- x is East of y
- y is West of z

Let's think about the possible configurations. If y is in the West sector of z, then y is directly to the left of z. If x is in the East sector of y, then x is directly to the right of y.

These constraints give us x to the right of y, and y to the left of z. But the relative positions of x and z are not directly constrained.

Let's try to visualize some configurations to determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. x could be East of z:
   y --- z --- x
   (Here, x is east of y and z, and z is east of y)

2. x could be West of z:
   y --- x --- z
   (Here, x is east of y but west of z, and z is east of y and x)

3. x could be North of z:
   y --- z
         |
         x
   (Here, x is north of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

4. x could be South of z:
         x
         |
   y --- z
   (Here, x is south of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

5. x could be Northeast of z:
   y --- z
         \
          x
   (Here, x is northeast of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

6. x could be Southeast of z:
         x
         /
   y --- z
   (Here, x is southeast of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

7. x could be Northwest of z:
          x
         /
   y --- z
   (Here, x is northwest of z, east of y, and z is east of y)

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me start over.

Given that x is East of y and y is West of z, let's define these relations more carefully.

In a cardinal direction framework, "x is East of y" means that x is in the East sector with y as the reference point. This means x is directly to the right of y, without any vertical displacement.

Similarly, "y is West of z" means that y is in the West sector with z as the reference point. This means y is directly to the left of z, without any vertical displacement.

If we place these on a Cartesian plane with y at the origin (0, 0), then:
- z is directly to the right of y, so z would be at (a, 0) where a > 0.
- x is directly to the right of y, so x would be at (b, 0) where b > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to compare the positions of x and z.

If b > a, then x is to the right of z, which means x is East of z.
If b < a, then x is to the left of z, which means x is West of z.
If b = a, then x and z are at the same position, which is not a valid scenario for distinct regions.

So, the possible relations between x and z are East and West.

Actually, I think I misunderstood cardinal direction relations again. Let's go back to the basic definitions.

In the context of regions (not points), cardinal direction relations are often defined using the minimal bounding rectangle (MBR) of the regions. The MBR is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given the MBRs of two regions, we can define cardinal direction relations based on how the MBRs relate to each other. For instance, if the entire MBR of region A is to the east (right) of the MBR of region B, then we say "A is East of B."

Let's denote the MBRs of regions x, y, and z as MBR_x, MBR_y, and MBR_z, respectively.

Given that:
- x is East of y: This means MBR_x is entirely to the right of MBR_y.
- y is West of z: This means MBR_y is entirely to the left of MBR_z.

From these, we can infer that:
- MBR_x is to the right of MBR_y.
- MBR_z is to the right of MBR_y.

But this doesn't directly tell us how MBR_x and MBR_z relate to each other. MBR_x could be to the right, left, above, below, or overlapping with MBR_z.

So, the cardinal direction relations between x and z could be any of: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or they could be overlapping (Bounding Box).

Actually, this feels correct. Given that regions can have spatial extent (they're not just points), and given the constraints that x is East of y and y is West of z, there's no direct constraint on the relation between x and z. They could have any cardinal direction relation between them.

But wait, let me think about this more carefully. I want to be certain about what the question is asking.

The question is about cardinal direction relations, which relate to the positions of regions relative to each other. We're given two constraints:
1. x is East of y
2. y is West of z

We're asked to deduce the possible cardinal direction relation(s) between x and z.

If we use the MBR interpretation I described earlier, then "x is East of y" means MBR_x is entirely to the right of MBR_y. Similarly, "y is West of z" means MBR_y is entirely to the left of MBR_z.

From these, we know that MBR_x is to the right of MBR_y and MBR_z is to the right of MBR_y. But this doesn't directly constrain the relation between MBR_x and MBR_z. They could be arranged in various ways.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or they could overlap (Bounding Box).

Actually, now I realize I need to be more careful. In some formalizations of cardinal direction relations for regions, the relation is determined not just by the relative position of the MBRs, but also by the exact way the regions intersect with the partitioned space around the reference region.

But, going with the most straightforward interpretation and assuming the question's intent is based on the MBR interpretation, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Actually, let me take a step back and consider a different formalization, which might be closer to what the question is asking.

In one formalization of cardinal direction relations for regions, the space around a reference region is partitioned into nine tiles (8 cardinal directions plus a central tile). The relation between two regions is determined by which of these tiles the second region intersects.

Using this framework, if x is East of y, it means region x intersects only the East tile of the partitioned space around y. Similarly, if y is West of z, it means region y intersects only the West tile of the partitioned space around z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

We know that:
- x is in the East tile of y.
- y is in the West tile of z.

Let's visualize this:
- The East tile of y is the region directly to the right of y.
- The West tile of z is the region directly to the left of z.

Given that y is in the West tile of z, y is to the left of z. And given that x is in the East tile of y, x is to the right of y.

So, we have:
- y is to the left of z.
- x is to the right of y.

But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between x and z. x could be to the right of z, to the left of z, above z, below z, or overlapping with z.

So, based on this formalization, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Hmm, let me go back to the basics. 

In the most basic interpretation of cardinal direction relations, if x is East of y, it means x is directly to the right of y. And if y is West of z, it means y is directly to the left of z.

If y is to the left of z, then z is to the right of y. And if x is to the right of y, then the relation between x and z depends on their relative positions.

Let's consider a 1D scenario (since we're only talking about East and West, which are along the x-axis):
- y is at the origin (0).
- z is to the right of y, so z is at position a where a > 0.
- x is to the right of y, so x is at position b where b > 0.

Now, if b > a, then x is to the right of z, which means x is East of z.
If b < a, then x is to the left of z, which means x is West of z.
If b = a, then x and z are at the same position, which is not a valid scenario for distinct regions.

So, in this 1D scenario, the possible relations between x and z are East and West.

But, if we consider a 2D scenario (allowing for North and South as well), then the relative positions of x and z are not fully constrained by the given conditions. x could be above, below, or at the same height as z.

Wait, I think I see where my confusion is coming from. Let's define cardinal direction relations more rigorously.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the relation between two regions A and B is often described using the projection of A onto the partitioned space around B. If the projection of A falls entirely within one of the cardinal direction tiles around B, then that's the cardinal direction relation.

Given this, if x is East of y, it means the projection of x falls entirely within the East tile of the partitioned space around y. Similarly, if y is West of z, it means the projection of y falls entirely within the West tile of the partitioned space around z.

From these, we can deduce that:
- y is to the left of z.
- x is to the right of y.

But, as I've been considering, this doesn't fully constrain the relation between x and z. x could be to the right of z (East), to the left of z (West), above z (North), below z (South), or in any of the combined directions (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest).

So, based on this formalization, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

Actually, I forgot to consider the possibility of x and z overlapping. If they overlap, then the relation would be "Bounding Box" (or "Equal" if they overlap completely). So, we need to add that to the list of possible relations.

Actually, no, I need to be more precise. "Bounding Box" in the context of cardinal direction relations typically refers to a special case where one region is entirely contained within the minimum bounding rectangle of another region. Given that:
- x is East of y
- y is West of z

It's possible for x and z to have a "Bounding Box" relation, meaning one of them is entirely contained within the MBR of the other. This is because being East of y doesn't restrict x from potentially being inside z, and being West of z doesn't restrict y from potentially being inside x.

Actually, let me further refine my understanding.

Looks like I've been mixing up multiple interpretations. Let's go with the standard Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) for regions, which divides the plane into 9 tiles based on a reference region: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, S, SW, SE, where B represents the reference region itself.

With this model, if region x is East of region y, it means region x intersects only the East tile of the partitioned space around y. Similarly, if region y is West of region z, it means region y intersects only the West tile of the partitioned space around z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

We know that:
- x is in the East tile of y.
- y is in the West tile of z.

Let's visualize this. If y is in the West tile of z, then from the perspective of the partitioned space around z, y is entirely to the left of z. And if x is in the East tile of y, then from the perspective of the partitioned space around y, x is entirely to the right of y.

So, we have:
- y is entirely to the left of z.
- x is entirely to the right of y.

But this doesn't fully constrain the relation between x and z. x could be anywhere relative to z, as long as it's to the right of y.

Hmm, let me think. If y is in the West tile of z, then z is to the right of y. And if x is in the East tile of y, then x is to the right of y.

So, both x and z are to the right of y. But their relative positions to each other are not fully constrained.

Let's try to reason through this by considering specific examples:

Imagine y is at the origin (0, 0). If y is in the West tile of z, then z would be somewhere to the right of the x-axis and y would be entirely to the left of z. For simplicity, let's say z is at (2, 0).

Now, if x is in the East tile of y, then x would be somewhere to the right of the y-axis and x would be entirely to the right of y. x could be at (1, 0), (3, 0), (1, 1), (3, -1), etc.

If x is at (1, 0), then x is to the left of z, which means x is West of z.
If x is at (3, 0), then x is to the right of z, which means x is East of z.
If x is at (1, 1), then x is to the left and above z, which means x is Northwest of z.
If x is at (3, -1), then x is to the right and below z, which means x is Southeast of z.

This shows that the possible relations between x and z are varied and depend on the exact positions of the regions.

Actually, now let's consider a more rigorous approach. In the Cardinal Direction Calculus, the relation between two regions A and B is often described using a 9-intersection pattern, indicating which of the 9 tiles around B that A intersects.

Given that:
- x is East of y: This means x intersects only the East tile of the partitioned space around y.
- y is West of z: This means y intersects only the West tile of the partitioned space around z.

Let's denote the x-coordinates of the leftmost and rightmost points of region y as y_min_x and y_max_x, respectively. Similarly, for regions x and z.

If y is West of z, then:
y_max_x < z_min_x

If x is East of y, then:
x_min_x > y_max_x

From these, we can derive:
x_min_x > y_max_x > y_min_x
z_min_x > y_max_x > y_min_x

This means both x and z are to the right of y. But we can't directly determine the relation between x and z without additional information.

Given this formalization, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Actually, let me try to reason in another way, perhaps using coordinates, to see if I can get a clearer understanding.

If y is West of z, then any point in y has an x-coordinate less than any point in z. Let's say y is in the range (y_min_x, y_max_x) and z is in the range (z_min_x, z_max_x), with y_max_x < z_min_x.

Similarly, if x is East of y, then any point in x has an x-coordinate greater than any point in y. So, x is in the range (x_min_x, x_max_x) with x_min_x > y_max_x.

From these, we know:
x_min_x > y_max_x > y_min_x
z_min_x > y_max_x > y_min_x

But this doesn't directly constrain the relation between x and z. If x_min_x > z_max_x, then x is East of z. If x_max_x < z_min_x, then x is West of z. But neither of these is guaranteed by the given constraints.

If we allow for variations in the y-coordinates as well, then the relation between x and z can be any of the cardinal directions.

So, based on this reasoning, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Wait, I think I was overthinking this. Given that Cardinal Direction Calculus involves the division of the plane into 9 regions, and given the constraints that "x is East of y" and "y is West of z", let's determine the possible relations between x and z using the 9-region model.

x is East of y means x is entirely in the East tile of y.
y is West of z means y is entirely in the West tile of z.

From the perspective of z, y is in its West tile. If we now consider where x is from the perspective of z, it becomes clear that the only constraint is that x is to the East of a region that is to the West of z. This doesn't fully constrain the relation between x and z.

Imagine a 3x3 grid with z at the center. y is in the West tile of this grid. x is to the East of y, but that doesn't specify which tile of the grid around z that x falls into. x could be in any of the 9 tiles.

Actually, there is a constraint: if y is in the West tile of z, then y is entirely to the left of z. And if x is in the East tile of y, then x is entirely to the right of y. Given that y is entirely to the left of z, and x is entirely to the right of y, there's a constraint on the possible positions of x relative to z.

But this constraint still allows for various relative positions. x could be to the right of z (East), to the left of z (West), above z (North), below z (South), or in any of the combined directions (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest), or even overlapping with z (Bounding Box).

Actually, let me be more precise. Let's again consider the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates, but also the bottommost and topmost y-coordinates, for each region. If y is West of z, then:
y_max_x < z_min_x

If x is East of y, then:
x_min_x > y_max_x

From these, we derive:
x_min_x > y_max_x > y_min_x
z_min_x > y_max_x > y_min_x

This means:
x_min_x > y_max_x
z_min_x > y_max_x

But it doesn't directly constrain the relation between x_min_x and z_min_x, or between the y-coordinates of x and z.

Given this, x could be to the left of z (if x_max_x < z_min_x), to the right of z (if x_min_x > z_max_x), or overlapping with z in the x-direction. Similarly, x could be above z, below z, or overlapping with z in the y-direction.

This allows for all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Actually, I think my analysis was correct. Let's reason through it methodically.

In Cardinal Direction Calculus, the relation between two regions is described by a 9-intersection pattern, indicating which of the 9 tiles around one region the other region intersects.

Given the constraints:
- x is East of y: This means x intersects only the East tile of the partitioned space around y.
- y is West of z: This means y intersects only the West tile of the partitioned space around z.

Let's visualize this in terms of a spatial layout. If y is West of z, then y is entirely to the left of z. And if x is East of y, then x is entirely to the right of y.

So, we have:
- y is entirely to the left of z.
- x is entirely to the right of y.

But this doesn't directly constrain the relation between x and z. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, above z, below z, or even overlapping with z. The only constraint is that x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z.

I'll try to make this clearer using an example. Consider a simple 1D case, where we're only considering positions along the x-axis:
- y is at position 0.
- z is at position 2.
- x could be at positions 1, 3, 4, etc.

If x is at position 1, then x is between y and z, which means x is West of z.
If x is at position 3, then x is to the right of both y and z, which means x is East of z.

Now, if we allow for variations in the y-coordinate, then x could be above, below, or at the same height as z. This adds the possibilities of North, South, Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest.

Additionally, if x overlaps with z in both x and y, then the relation would be Bounding Box.

Actually, I don't think Bounding Box is actually a possible relation.

A Bounding Box relation, in the context of Cardinal Direction Calculus, typically refers to a situation where one region is entirely contained within the minimum bounding rectangle of another region. Given that:
- x is East of y
- y is West of z

If y is West of z, then y is entirely to the left of z. And if x is East of y, then x is entirely to the right of y. Given these constraints, it's not obvious that either x is entirely contained within the minimum bounding rectangle of z, or z is entirely contained within the minimum bounding rectangle of x.

But, actually, let's reason more carefully. If we think about the extension of the minimum bounding rectangle of y, it would cover the entire plane, extending infinitely in all directions from y. Similarly for z. So, both x and z are contained within the extended minimum bounding rectangle of y, and both y and x are contained within the extended minimum bounding rectangle of z.

But, specifically for a Bounding Box relation between x and z, we need to determine if either x is entirely contained within the minimum bounding rectangle of z, or vice versa.

Given the constraints, it's possible for x to overlap with z or be entirely contained within z (or vice versa), which would result in a Bounding Box relation.

Let me further validate this. Consider the following configuration:
- y is a unit square at the origin, spanning from (0, 0) to (1, 1).
- z is a unit square shifted to the right of y, spanning from (2, 0) to (3, 1).
- x is a unit square shifted to the right of y, overlapping with z, spanning from (2, 0) to (3, 1).

In this configuration, x and z are exactly the same, so they have a Bounding Box relation. And, y is West of z, and x is East of y, satisfying the given constraints.

So, a Bounding Box relation between x and z is possible.

Actually, to be more precise, the Bounding Box relation typically refers to situations where one region is inside or equals another region. If x and z are the same, then their relation is "Equal", which is a specific case of the Bounding Box relation. If x is entirely contained within z (or vice versa), then their relation is "Inside" (or "Contains"), which is another specific case of the Bounding Box relation.

Actually, I need to be even more careful. Let's be very explicit about the definition. In the context of Cardinal Direction Calculus for regions, the "Bounding Box" relation (often denoted as "O", standing for "Origin") refers to the central tile in the 9-tile partitioning. Two regions have a Bounding Box relation if one region intersects only the central tile of the partitioned space around the other region.

Given this definition, if x is East of y, it means x intersects only the East tile of the partitioned space around y. Similarly, if y is West of z, it means y intersects only the West tile of the partitioned space around z.

These constraints don't directly prohibit a Bounding Box relation between x and z. It's possible for x to be positioned in such a way that it intersects only the central tile of the partitioned space around z, while still being East of y. And, y can still be West of z.

So, a Bounding Box relation between x and z is possible.

But wait, if y is in the West tile of z, how can x be in the central tile of z while still being in the East tile of y? Actually, I'm confused. I need to reason more explicitly about what these directions mean.

OK, let's be very basic. We'll refer to the standard cardinal direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, O), where O is the central, or "origin", tile. That is, the origin refers to the tile that y is in, with respect to y. 

So the statement "x is East of y" means that x is in the E tile of y, with respect to y.  Similarly, the statement "y is West of z" means that y is in the W tile of z, with respect to z.

Let's think of it as a grid. Then we can draw a grid showing where each region is with respect to the others.

x is in the E tile of y.
y is in the W tile of z.

So if we imagine a grid with y at the origin, x is in the East tile of this grid.
And if we imagine a grid with z at the origin, y is in the West tile of this grid.

But the question asks about the relation between x and z, which means we need to determine which tile of the grid around z that x falls into.

Given that:
- y is in the West tile of z's grid.
- x is in the East tile of y's grid.

If y is in the West tile of z, then y is to the left of z. And if x is in the East tile of y, then x is to the right of y.

So, x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z. But this doesn't directly constrain the relative position of x and z. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, above z, below z, or overlapping with z.

Let's visualize a concrete example. if we set up a coordinate system where the tiles are:

NW | N | NE
---+---+---
W  | O | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE

Imagine z is at the origin (0, 0), spanning the O tile. If y is in the West tile of z, then y is somewhere in the W tile, let's say at (-2, 0). If x is in the East tile of y, then x is somewhere in the E tile of y, let's say at (0, 0).

In this example, x is at the same position as z, so x would be in the O tile of z, which corresponds to a Bounding Box relation. But x could also be in any of the other tiles of z's grid, by choosing different positions for x.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Let me double-check that these are all possible:

- North: x is directly above z. Yes, this is possible.
- Northeast: x is above and to the right of z. Yes, this is possible.
- East: x is directly to the right of z. Yes, this is possible.
- Southeast: x is below and to the right of z. Yes, this is possible.
- South: x is directly below z. Yes, this is possible.
- Southwest: x is below and to the left of z. Yes, this is possible.
- West: x is directly to the left of z. Yes, this is possible.
- Northwest: x is above and to the left of z. Yes, this is possible.
- Bounding Box: x overlaps with z. Yes, this is possible.

Actually, wait. Let me verify once more that these are all possible. I'll be very precise.

We know that:
- x is East of y, which means x is in the East tile of y's grid.
- y is West of z, which means y is in the West tile of z's grid.

If y is in the West tile of z, then y is to the left of z. And if x is in the East tile of y, then x is to the right of y.

The question is asking for the possible relations between x and z, which means we need to determine which tile(s) of z's grid that x can fall into.

Let's visualize this on a grid. For simplicity, let's set z at the origin (0, 0) and use integer coordinates. If y is in the West tile of z, then y is at a negative x-coordinate, say (-1, 0). If x is in the East tile of y, then x is to the right of y. Now I think it's clearer that x can be in any tile of z, even the West tile (if y is at -2 and x is at -1, for example). 

Actually, wait, we need to be more careful. Let's really reason through this. The tile is the spatial region around z, not the point where z is at. Let me be explicit.

In the Cardinal Direction Calculus, the plane is partitioned into 9 tiles based on a reference region. For simplicity, if we consider the reference region as a point, then the partitioning is based on the horizontal and vertical lines passing through the point. Let's denote the x-coordinate of the rightmost point of region y as y_max_x, and the x-coordinate of the leftmost point of region z as z_min_x. Likewise for all other extrema of all regions.

If y is West of z, then:
y_max_x < z_min_x

If x is East of y, then:
x_min_x > y_max_x

From these, we derive:
x_min_x > y_max_x > y_min_x
z_min_x > y_max_x > y_min_x

This means:
x_min_x > y_max_x
z_min_x > y_max_x

But it doesn't directly constrain the relation between x_min_x and z_min_x, or between the y-coordinates of x and z.

Actually, wait, let's try to make this clearer. Imagine that y, z, and x are three houses. If y is to the West of z (i.e., y is in the West tile of z), then house y is completely to the left of house z. And if x is to the East of y (i.e., x is in the East tile of y), then house x is completely to the right of house y.

Now, where can house x be relative to house z? We know that house x is completely to the right of house y, and house y is completely to the left of house z. But this doesn't fully constrain the position of house x relative to house z. House x could be anywhere relative to house z, as long as it's to the right of house y.

For instance, house x could be to the left of house z (if it's between houses y and z), to the right of house z, above house z, below house z, or even at the same position as house z. There's no direct constraint on the relative position of houses x and z based on the given information.

So, using Cardinal Direction Calculus, the possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Actually, let me check that the "West" relation is indeed possible. In order for x to be West of z, x should be to the left of z. 

If y is West of z, then y is to the left of z. And if x is East of y, then x is to the right of y. 

If x is to the right of y and y is to the left of z, can x be to the left of z?

It's possible if x is not far enough to the right of y. For instance, if y is at position -3, z is at position 0, and x is at position -1, then x is to the right of y (East of y) and to the left of z (West of z).

So, yes, it's possible for x to be West of z.

Let me double-check that the other relations are also possible.

- North: x is directly above z. Yes, this is possible. For instance, if y is at (-1, 0), z is at (0, 0), and x is at (0, 1), then x is North of z.
- Northeast: x is above and to the right of z. Yes, this is possible. For instance, if y is at (-1, 0), z is at (0, 0), and x is at (1, 1), then x is Northeast of z.
- East: x is directly to the right of z. Yes, this is possible. For instance, if y is at (-1, 0), z is at (0, 0), and x is at (1, 0), then x is East of z.
- Southeast: x is below and to the right of z. Yes, this is possible. For instance, if y is at (-1, 0), z is at (0, 0), and x is at (1, -1), then x is Southeast of z.
- South: x is directly below z. Yes, this is possible. For instance, if y is at (-1, 0), z is at (0, 0), and x is at (0, -1), then x is South of z.
- Southwest: x is below and to the left of z. Yes, this is possible. For instance, if y is at (-2, 0), z is at (0, 0), and x is at (-1, -1), then x is Southwest of z.
- West: x is directly to the left of z. Yes, this is possible. For instance, if y is at (-2, 0), z is at (0, 0), and x is at (-1, 0), then x is West of z.
- Northwest: x is above and to the left of z. Yes, this is possible. For instance, if y is at (-2, 0), z is at (0, 0), and x is at (-1, 1), then x is Northwest of z.
- Bounding Box: x overlaps with z. Yes, this is possible. For instance, if y is at (-1, 0), z is at (0, 0), and x is also at (0, 0), then x and z overlap, resulting in a Bounding Box relation.

So, all of the cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

So, the answer to the question would be that any of the cardinal direction relations are possible between regions x and z. These are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Actually, OK, let me make sure one more time. The question asks for the possible relations between x and z, given that x is East of y and y is West of z. Using the Cardinal Direction Calculus, we've analyzed that x could be in any of the 9 tiles of the grid around z, as long as it's to the right of y.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box. So any of the cardinal direction relations.

Actually, since the question explicitly refers to "cardinal direction relations", which in the context of qualitative spatial reasoning often refers to the 8 cardinal directions (excluding the Bounding Box), I'll separate out the Bounding Box relation:

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, or Northwest. Additionally, x and z could have a Bounding Box relation.

But actually, the correct interpretation of the question is likely that we're being asked to find all possible directional relations between regions x and z. Since the problem is asking about the cardinal directions, the possible cardinal directions in general (not just restricted to the East/West directions mentioned in the first part of the question) between regions x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest. And they can also have a Bounding Box relation.

So those are all the possibilities. 

In conclusion: given that:
- x is East of y
- y is West of z

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine what cardinal direction relations are possible between regions x and z.

Given:
- x is East of y
- y is West of z

From these constraints, I know that:
- x is to the right of y
- y is to the left of z

However, these constraints don't fully determine the relationship between x and z. Let me analyze the possibilities:

If y is to the left of z, and x is to the right of y, then x could be:
- West of z (if x is between y and z)
- East of z (if x is further right than z)
- North of z (if x is directly above z)
- South of z (if x is directly below z)
- Northeast of z (if x is above and to the right of z)
- Southeast of z (if x is below and to the right of z)
- Northwest of z (if x is above and to the left of z, but still right of y)
- Southwest of z (if x is below and to the left of z, but still right of y)
- Bounding Box (if x and z overlap)

Therefore, all cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z.
