PROMPT: Let  West and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's determine the possible relations between regions x and z given that region x is West of region y and region y is South of region z.

In cardinal direction relations:
- West means the region is directly to the west (leftward) of the reference region.
- South means the region is directly to the south (downward) of the reference region.

Let me use a coordinate system to represent this situation, where:
- East is the positive x-direction
- West is the negative x-direction
- North is the positive y-direction
- South is the negative y-direction

Given:
- x is West of y: This means x is to the left of y. So if y is at position (y_x, y_y), then x is at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x, and x_y could be any value.
- y is South of z: This means y is below z. So if z is at position (z_x, z_y), then y is at position (y_x, y_y) where y_y < z_y, and y_x could be any value.

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's consider what we know:
- x_x < y_x (x is to the left of y)
- y_y < z_y (y is below z)

But we don't know the exact relationship between x_x and z_x, or between x_y and z_y, except for the constraints above.

Let's analyze all possible cases:

1. If x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y:
   In this case, x is to the southwest of z (both to the left and below).

2. If x_x < z_x and x_y = z_y:
   In this case, x is directly to the west of z (to the left at the same height).

3. If x_x < z_x and x_y > z_y:
   In this case, x is to the northwest of z (to the left and above).

4. If x_x = z_x and x_y < z_y:
   In this case, x is directly to the south of z (below at the same horizontal position).

5. If x_x = z_x and x_y = z_y:
   This would mean x and z are at the same position, which can't be the case given our constraints.

6. If x_x = z_x and x_y > z_y:
   In this case, x is directly to the north of z (above at the same horizontal position).

7. If x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y:
   In this case, x is to the southeast of z (to the right and below).

8. If x_x > z_x and x_y = z_y:
   In this case, x is directly to the east of z (to the right at the same height).

9. If x_x > z_x and x_y > z_y:
   In this case, x is to the northeast of z (to the right and above).

But wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning. I didn't fully account for the constraints we have.

We know:
- x is West of y, so x_x < y_x, but we don't know the relationship between x_y and y_y.
- y is South of z, so y_y < z_y, but we don't know the relationship between y_x and z_x.

So, we only know that x is somewhere to the left of y and y is somewhere below z, but we don't have enough information to fully determine the relationship between x and z.

Let me visualize this more concretely:

Let me use a grid to represent this. Suppose z is at position (0, 0). Then y is somewhere below z, so y is at (y_x, y_y) where y_y < 0, and y_x could be any value. Now, x is somewhere to the left of y, so x is at (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x, and x_y could be any value.

Let's consider different cases:

1. If y_x < 0 (y is to the west of z), then x_x < y_x < 0, so x is to the west of z. But we don't know the relationship between x_y and z_y, so x could be northwest, west, or southwest of z.

2. If y_x = 0 (y is directly south of z), then x_x < 0, so x is to the west of z. Again, we don't know the relationship between x_y and z_y, so x could be northwest, west, or southwest of z.

3. If y_x > 0 (y is to the east of z), then x_x < y_x, but we don't know if x_x < 0, x_x = 0, or x_x > 0, so we don't know if x is to the west, at the same longitude, or to the east of z. And again, we don't know the relationship between x_y and z_y.

OK so it's a bit more complex than I initially thought. Let me reason it through more carefully.

Given that x is West of y and y is South of z, we know that x is to the left of y and y is below z. But we don't have direct information about the relative positions of x and z.

Let's use a different approach. I'll think about the possible quadrants or regions where x could be relative to z.

If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then y is somewhere in the South quadrant (y_y < 0). Now, x is to the West of y, which means x_x < y_x.

Case 1: y is in the Southwest quadrant relative to z (y_x < 0, y_y < 0).
If y is in the Southwest quadrant, then x is even further to the west (x_x < y_x < 0). This means x is to the west of z (x_x < 0). But the vertical relationship between x and z is unclear; x could be above, at the same level, or below z. So, x could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

Case 2: y is directly South of z (y_x = 0, y_y < 0).
If y is directly South of z, then x is to the West of y, which means x_x < 0. Again, the vertical relationship between x and z is unclear, so x could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

Case 3: y is in the Southeast quadrant relative to z (y_x > 0, y_y < 0).
If y is in the Southeast quadrant, then x is to the West of y, but that doesn't necessarily mean x is to the West of z. It depends on how far West x is from y. If x_x < 0, then x is to the West of z. If x_x = 0, then x is on the same vertical line as z. If x_x > 0, then x is to the East of z. And again, the vertical relationship between x and z is unclear.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be Northwest, West, Southwest, North, directly on top of z (which is not one of our cardinal directions), South, Northeast, East, or Southeast.

But that doesn't seem right. Let me rethink this, now using bounding boxes to represent the regions.

When we say "x is West of y", it means that the entirety of region x is to the west of the entirety of region y. Similarly, "y is South of z" means that the entirety of region y is to the south of the entirety of region z.

So, if we place z at the origin (0, 0) with some extent, then y is entirely to the south of z, meaning the northernmost point of y is still south of the southernmost point of z. And x is entirely to the west of y, meaning the easternmost point of x is still west of the westernmost point of y.

But again, this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z. 

Hmm, I realize I'm making things too complex. Let's simplify and consider the extreme case: 

Case: We place z at the origin (0, 0) (as a point), y directly south of z at (0, -1), and x directly west of y at (-1, -1).

In this specific case, x would be to the southwest of z. 

But as we move y around (keeping it south of z), and move x around (keeping it west of y), we can achieve different relations between x and z.

Actually, I think I have been making an error in my reasoning. Let me try a new approach, leveraging the properties of cardinal direction relations.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the relation "West" typically means that the region is entirely to the west, with no part of it being north, south, or east. Similarly, "South" means the region is entirely to the south.

Given:
- x is West of y: This means x is entirely to the west of y, with no overlap in the north-south direction.
- y is South of z: This means y is entirely to the south of z, with no overlap in the east-west direction.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. Considering the east-west axis:
   - x is West of y, but the relationship between y and z on the east-west axis is not specified. 
   - If y is to the West of z or at the same longitude, then x is definitely to the West of z.
   - If y is to the East of z, then x might be to the West, at the same longitude, or to the East of z, depending on the specific positions.

2. Considering the north-south axis:
   - y is South of z, but the relationship between x and y on the north-south axis is not specified.
   - If x is to the South of y or at the same latitude, then x is definitely to the South of z.
   - If x is to the North of y, then x might be to the North, at the same latitude, or to the South of z, depending on the specific positions.

OK let me take a step back. I'm thinking of cardinal directions as points, but they are actually relations between regions. Let me re-examine this. 

We have:
- "x is West of y": This means that if we move horizontally from y to x, we go westward. Equivalently, x is in the Western part of our reference frame as seen from y.
- "y is South of z": This means that if we move vertically from z to y, we go southward. Equivalently, y is in the Southern part of our reference frame as seen from z.

So, what does this tell us about the relation between x and z?

Given that "x is West of y", we know that x is somewhere to the left of y.
Given that "y is South of z", we know that y is somewhere below z.

But to determine the exact relation between x and z, we need to know the exact relative positions. Since we're only given qualitative relations, we need to consider all possible configurations that satisfy our constraints.

Let's try a different approach. I'll use a grid to represent the possible locations and then deduce the possible cardinal direction relations.

If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then y is somewhere in the south half-plane (y_y < 0). And given that x is west of y, x is somewhere in the west half-plane relative to y (x_x < y_x).

Now, let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If x_x < 0 and x_y < 0, then x is to the southwest of z.
2. If x_x < 0 and x_y = 0, then x is to the west of z.
3. If x_x < 0 and x_y > 0, then x is to the northwest of z.
4. If x_x = 0 and x_y < 0, then x is to the south of z.
5. If x_x = 0 and x_y = 0, then x is at the same position as z, which is not possible given our constraints.
6. If x_x = 0 and x_y > 0, then x is to the north of z.
7. If x_x > 0 and x_y < 0, then x is to the southeast of z.
8. If x_x > 0 and x_y = 0, then x is to the east of z.
9. If x_x > 0 and x_y > 0, then x is to the northeast of z.

But, given our constraints, not all of these cases are possible.

x is West of y means x_x < y_x, and y is South of z means y_y < z_y (or in our grid, y_y < 0).

Let's place y at position (y_x, y_y) where y_y < 0 (y is below z). Now, x is at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x (x is to the left of y).

Cases 5, 6, 8, and 9 involve x_x ≥ 0. But we know that x_x < y_x, and y_x could be ≤ 0. So, these cases are only possible if y_x > 0, meaning y is to the right of z.

Let's reconsider all cases based on the possible values of y_x:

If y_x < 0 (y is to the left of z):
- Since x_x < y_x < 0, x is also to the left of z (x_x < 0).
- The vertical relationship between x and z depends on x_y, which could be any value.
- So, x could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

If y_x = 0 (y is directly below z):
- Since x_x < y_x = 0, x is to the left of z (x_x < 0).
- The vertical relationship between x and z depends on x_y, which could be any value.
- So, x could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

If y_x > 0 (y is to the right of z):
- x_x < y_x, but x_x could be < 0, = 0, or > 0, depending on the value of y_x.
- If x_x < 0, x is to the left of z, and could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.
- If x_x = 0, x is on the same vertical line as z, and could be North or South of z.
- If x_x > 0, x is to the right of z, and could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of z.

Actually, I made an error. I forgot to take into account the constraint "x is West of y". This means that the entirety of region x is to the west of the entirety of region y. Now I need to be more careful with my reasoning.

Wait, let me revisit the problem. I'm not considering the constraints correctly.

Given:
- "x is West of y": This means the easternmost point of x is to the west of the westernmost point of y.
- "y is South of z": This means the northernmost point of y is to the south of the southernmost point of z.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Then, y is somewhere to the south of z, meaning the northernmost point of y, denoted by y_north, satisfies y_north < 0. The x-coordinate of y, denoted by y_x, can be any value.

Now, x is to the west of y, meaning the easternmost point of x, denoted by x_east, satisfies x_east < y_west, where y_west is the westernmost point of y. The y-coordinate of x, denoted by x_y, can be any value.

Given these constraints, what are the possible relations between x and z?

Let me simplify and consider bounding boxes. Let's say we have:
- Region z with bounding box [z_left, z_right, z_bottom, z_top]
- Region y with bounding box [y_left, y_right, y_bottom, y_top]
- Region x with bounding box [x_left, x_right, x_bottom, x_top]

Given "y is South of z", we have y_top < z_bottom.
Given "x is West of y", we have x_right < y_left.

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

OK, I'll try a slightly different approach. Let's use a grid for simplicity and define regions using their coordinates.

Let's say we have the following setup:
- Region z at position (z_x, z_y)
- Region y at position (y_x, y_y)
- Region x at position (x_x, x_y)

Given "x is West of y", we have x_x + ε < y_x - ε for some small ε > 0, ensuring that x is strictly to the west of y.
Given "y is South of z", we have y_y + ε < z_y - ε, ensuring that y is strictly to the south of z.

Now, we want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Actually, I don't need to include ε in the computations. I can simplify as:
Given "x is West of y", we have x_x < y_x.
Given "y is South of z", we have y_y < z_y.

Now, for x and z:
- East-west relation: We know x_x < y_x, but we don't know the relation between y_x and z_x. So, x could be to the west, at the same longitude, or to the east of z.
- North-south relation: We know y_y < z_y, but we don't know the relation between x_y and y_y. So, x could be to the north, at the same latitude, or to the south of y, and hence to the north, at the same latitude, or to the south of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be: Northwest, North, Northeast, West, (directly over z, which isn't a cardinal direction), East, Southwest, South, Southeast.

Let me see if there are any impossible positions based on the existing constraints.

Let's see. "x is West of y" and "y is South of z". 

From these, I cannot derive direct constraints between x and z. For example, I can place x to the far west of y and y to the far south of z, making x southwest of z. Or, I can place x just a bit west of y and y just a bit south of z, and then move x northward, making x northwest of z. It's all about the relative positions.

OK, it seems like all cardinal directions are possible relations between x and z, given the constraints.

Actually, I'm forgetting an important detail. The question asks which could be the possible relations between region x and region z. 

In the theory of cardinal direction relations, the 9 basic relations are: Northwest (NW), North (N), Northeast (NE), West (W), Equal (EQ), East (E), Southwest (SW), South (S), Southeast (SE).

If we include the Bounding Box, it defines a more precise relation where regions can have multiple cardinal direction relations due to their size and shape.

Given the constraints:
- "x is West of y": The entirety of region x is to the west of the entirety of region y.
- "y is South of z": The entirety of region y is to the south of the entirety of region z.

Let's reason through each of the basic cardinal direction relations to determine if it's a possible relation between x and z:

1. Northwest (NW): This means x is to the northwest of z. Is this possible? Yes, I can place x to the west of y and have y to the south of z, and by adjusting the vertical position of x, I can make x northwest of z.

2. North (N): This means x is directly north of z (same longitude, but x is above z). Is this possible? Yes, I can place y south of z and slightly to the east, and then place x west of y and to the north of z, aligning the longitudes of x and z.

3. Northeast (NE): This means x is to the northeast of z. Is this possible? Yes, I can place y to the south of z and very far to the east, and then place x west of y but still to the east of z.

4. West (W): This means x is directly west of z (same latitude, but x is to the left of z). Is this possible? Yes, I can place y south of z and slightly to the west, and then place x west of y and at the same latitude as z.

5. Equal (EQ): This means x and z occupy the same location. Given the constraints, this is not possible because if x is west of y and y is south of z, then x and z cannot be at the same place.

6. East (E): This means x is directly east of z (same latitude, but x is to the right of z). Is this possible? Yes, I can place y to the south of z and very far to the east, and then place x west of y but still to the east of z, and align the latitudes of x and z.

7. Southwest (SW): This means x is to the southwest of z. Is this possible? Yes, I can place y to the south of z and slightly to the west, and then place x west of y, making x southwest of z.

8. South (S): This means x is directly south of z (same longitude, but x is below z). Is this possible? Yes, I can place y to the south of z and slightly to the east, and then place x west of y but still to the south of z, aligning the longitudes of x and z.

9. Southeast (SE): This means x is to the southeast of z. Is this possible? Yes, I can place y to the south of z and very far to the east, and then place x west of y but still to the east and south of z.

So, all of the basic cardinal direction relations except for Equal (EQ) are possible between x and z, given the constraints.

But wait, I missed something. Let me reason through this more carefully.

"x is West of y" means that the entirety of region x is to the west of the entirety of region y. In the cardinal direction calculus, this means that the projection of x onto the east-west axis is entirely to the west of the projection of y onto the same axis.

Similarly, "y is South of z" means that the entirety of region y is to the south of the entirety of region z. The projection of y onto the north-south axis is entirely to the south of the projection of z onto the same axis.

Now, when we try to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to consider all possible configurations that satisfy these constraints.

Ohhh wait.

Actually, there's a simpler way to think about this. If "x is West of y" and "y is South of z", then x is to the west of a point that is to the south of z. So, x is southwest of z.

But, that would only be true if "West" and "South" implied "strictly to the west" and "strictly to the south" in their own axes. Cardinal directions like Northwest, Southwest, etc., might not be in the basic set of relations in some formalizations.

Actually cardinal directions like NW and SW certainly are in the basic set, but my issue is that the problem statement is not clear on whether "West" and "South" are primitive relations or compositional relations.

Let me reason it more.

Ah, I think I've been overthinking this problem, sorry. The intent of the problem is to find the possible cardinal direction relations that could hold between regions x and z.

Given "x is West of y" and "y is South of z", I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Let's set up a Cartesian coordinate system, where:
- The East-West direction is along the x-axis, with East as the positive direction.
- The North-South direction is along the y-axis, with North as the positive direction.

Given the constraints:
- "x is West of y" means x.max_x < y.min_x, where x.max_x is the easternmost point of region x and y.min_x is the westernmost point of region y.
- "y is South of z" means y.max_y < z.min_y, where y.max_y is the northernmost point of region y and z.min_y is the southernmost point of region z.

Now, for region x relative to region z, the possible cardinal direction relations would be determined by the relative positions of the projections of the regions onto the x and y axes.

Since "x is West of y" and "y is South of z", we can place x, y, and z in various configurations that satisfy these constraints, and then determine the cardinal direction relation between x and z.

For instance, one extreme configuration is where y is directly South of z and x is directly West of y. In this case, x would be Southwest of z.

But, I'm realizing now, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z depend on the exact formulation of the cardinal direction calculus. In the basic 9-relation system, the possible relations between two regions are:

1. Northwest (NW)
2. North (N)
3. Northeast (NE)
4. West (W)
5. Equal (EQ) - which is not possible in our scenario as discussed earlier
6. East (E)
7. Southwest (SW)
8. South (S)
9. Southeast (SE)

In addition, in the tighter formulation, there's also the "Bounding Box" relation, where the regions overlap in a certain way.

In our case, considering all possible placements of x, y, and z that satisfy our constraints, I think all of the basic relations except Equal (EQ) are possible between x and z. 

Actually, let me think more carefully. We know that "x is West of y" and "y is South of z". So, x is to the west of y, and y is to the south of z. Let me constrain things a bit further.

Let's place z at position (0, 0). Given that "y is South of z", y is at position (y_x, y_y) where y_y < 0. The value of y_x can be any real number.

Now, given that "x is West of y", x is at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x. The value of x_y can be any real number.

Given these constraints, the possible positions of x relative to z are:

1. If x_x < 0 and x_y < 0, then x is to the southwest of z.
2. If x_x < 0 and x_y = 0, then x is to the west of z.
3. If x_x < 0 and x_y > 0, then x is to the northwest of z.
4. If x_x = 0 and x_y < 0, then x is to the south of z.
5. If x_x = 0 and x_y = 0, then x is at the same position as z, which is not possible given our constraints (as it would mean y is south of z and x is west of y, so x cannot be at the same position as z).
6. If x_x = 0 and x_y > 0, then x is to the north of z.
7. If x_x > 0 and x_y < 0, then x is to the southeast of z.
8. If x_x > 0 and x_y = 0, then x is to the east of z.
9. If x_x > 0 and x_y > 0, then x is to the northeast of z.

But, given that "x is West of y" implies x_x < y_x, and "y is South of z" implies y_y < 0, we need to consider the possible values of y_x to determine which of the above 9 cases are actually possible.

Let's think about the possible values of y_x:

a. If y_x < 0, then given that x_x < y_x, we have x_x < 0. This means cases 1, 2, and 3 are possible.
b. If y_x = 0, then given that x_x < y_x, we have x_x < 0. Again, cases 1, 2, and 3 are possible.
c. If y_x > 0, then given that x_x < y_x, we have x_x < y_x, but x_x could be less than 0, equal to 0, or greater than 0. So, any of the cases 1 to 9 (except 5) are possible.

Combining all these, it seems that any of the cardinal direction relations, except Equal (EQ), are possible between x and z.

But, let me double-check:

Case 4 (South): x_x = 0 and x_y < 0. For this to be possible, we need y_x > 0 (from case c above). But given that "y is South of z", y_y < 0. So, y is at position (y_x, y_y) with y_x > 0 and y_y < 0, which places y to the southeast of z. Given that "x is West of y", x_x < y_x. Since y_x > 0, it's possible for x_x to be 0. And x_y can be any value. So, case 4 is possible.

Case 6 (North): x_x = 0 and x_y > 0. Similar to the reasoning for case 4, this is also possible.

Case 7 (Southeast): x_x > 0 and x_y < 0. For this to be possible, we need y_x > x_x > 0. So, y is to the east of z, and x is between y and z in terms of longitude. Given that "y is South of z", y is to the south of z. If x_y < 0, x is to the south of z. So, x can be to the southeast of z. This is possible.

Case 8 (East): x_x > 0 and x_y = 0. The reasoning is similar to case 7, and this is also possible.

Case 9 (Northeast): x_x > 0 and x_y > 0. For this to be possible, we need y_x > x_x > 0. So, y is to the east of z, and x is between y and z in terms of longitude. Given that "y is South of z", y is to the south of z. If x_y > 0, x is to the north of z. So, x can be to the northeast of z. This is possible.

So, it seems that all the cardinal direction relations, except Equal (EQ), are possible between x and z, given the constraints.

Actually I'll think of it differently. Let me, for definiteness, place z at origin.
- Since y is South of z, we know that y is somewhere on the bottom half-plane, i.e. y_y < 0.
- Since x is West of y, we know that x is to the left of y, i.e. x_x < y_x.

Now let's consider different scenarios based on where y might be:

Scenario 1: y is South-West of z (i.e. y_x < 0 and y_y < 0):
In this case, since x is West of y, x is even further to the left (x_x < y_x < 0). So x is to the west of z.
But the vertical position of x is unrestricted; x can be to the north, at the same vertical position, or to the south of z.
Therefore, in this scenario, x can be North-West, West, or South-West of z.

Scenario 2: y is South of z (i.e. y_x = 0 and y_y < 0):
In this case, since x is West of y, x is to the left of y (x_x < 0). So x is to the west of z.
Again, the vertical position of x is unrestricted.
Therefore, in this scenario, x can be North-West, West, or South-West of z.

Scenario 3: y is South-East of z (i.e. y_x > 0 and y_y < 0):
In this case, since x is West of y, x is to the left of y (x_x < y_x). But the exact value of x_x can be < 0, = 0, or > 0 (as long as it's less than y_x).
If x_x < 0, then x is to the west of z. If x_x = 0, then x is at the same east-west position as z. If x_x > 0, then x is to the east of z (though still to the west of y).
And, as always, the vertical position of x is unrestricted.
Therefore, in this scenario, x can be North-West, West, South-West, North, South, North-East, East, or South-East of z. In fact, x can be in any of the 8 cardinal direction regions around z (all possible relations except Equal).

Let me double-check scenario 3.

Scenario 3: y is South-East of z (i.e. y_x > 0 and y_y < 0):
In this case, we have the constraint x_x < y_x. Now, let's consider three cases for x_x:

1. If x_x < 0, then x is to the west of z. Depending on the vertical position of x, it can be North-West, West, or South-West of z.

2. If x_x = 0, then x is on the same east-west line as z. Depending on the vertical position of x, it can be North or South of z. It can't be Equal to z because that would violate the constraint (x is West of y).

3. If 0 < x_x < y_x, then x is to the east of z, but still to the west of y. Depending on the vertical position of x, it can be North-East, East, or South-East of z.

So yes, indeed, in scenario 3, x can be in any of the 8 cardinal direction regions around z. Combined with scenarios 1 and 2, I can say that the possible relations between x and z include: North-West, West, South-West, North, South, North-East, East, and South-East.

To summarize:
The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, given the constraints:
- x is West of y
- y is South of z

are: North-West, West, South-West, North, South, North-East, East, and South-East. The only relation that is not possible is Equal. If I include the Bounding Box relation, then that could also be possible (when regions overlap in a certain way). But Equal is definitely not possible.

Hmm, but let me double check the meaning of the bounding box relationship. In the AMIE system, the "Bounding Box" (BB) relation holds when the minimum bounding rectangle of region x contains the minimum bounding rectangle of region y, and vice versa.

I don't think this can hold based on the given constraints. Let me check. 

If the BB relation holds between x and z, it means the bounding box of x and the bounding box of z are equal. But, given that "x is West of y" and "y is South of z", it's not possible for the bounding boxes of x and z to be the same. If the bounding boxes were the same, it would mean that x, y, and z all have the same projected extents, which would contradict the given constraints.

So, I believe that the Bounding Box relation is also not possible between x and z, given the constraints.

But wait, maybe we are using different definitions of the Bounding Box relation. Let me check again.

In some cardinal direction calculi, the Bounding Box (BB) relation might refer to a situation where one region is partly inside and partly outside the bounding box of another region, leading to a more complex directional relation.

Given our constraints, is it possible for x to be partly inside and partly outside the bounding box of z? Let's see.

"x is West of y" means that the easternmost point of x is to the west of the westernmost point of y. "y is South of z" means that the northernmost point of y is to the south of the southernmost point of z.

Given these constraints, if x is a large enough region, it could overlap with the bounding box of z. For instance, if x extends upwards and y is just slightly to the south of z, then x could be to the west of y and still overlap with the bounding box of z.

Yes, the Bounding Box relation in this context is possible, but it would depend on the exact definition used in the cardinal direction calculus.

Actually, I believe I've been a bit confused in my reasoning. Let me try to clarify. In most cardinal direction calculi, the BB relation is not a separate relation but a way to compute the cardinal direction relation. In the case of regions, we first compute the bounding box of each region, and then determine the cardinal direction relation based on the relative positions of these bounding boxes.

Let's restate the problem: Given that "x is West of y" and "y is South of z", what are the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z?

"x is West of y" means that the easternmost point of x is to the west of the westernmost point of y. "y is South of z" means that the northernmost point of y is to the south of the southernmost point of z.

Based on the constraints, as I've reasoned earlier, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North-West, West, South-West, North, South, North-East, East, and South-East. The only relation that is not possible is Equal.

I'm not sure if "Bounding Box" is itself a cardinal direction relation, or the name of a specific variation of the cardinal direction calculus. Assuming it's a relation, given the constraints we have, I think it's reasonable to consider it as a possibility, but I'd need more context on its exact definition.

Actually, I think I've been making things more complicated. "Bounding Box" is indeed a way to compute the relation, not a relation itself.

So, to answer the original question: Given that "x is West of y" and "y is South of z", the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North-West, West, South-West, North, South, North-East, East, and South-East. The only relation among the 9 basic cardinal direction relations that is not possible is Equal.

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box. So actually all of them are allowed.

Actually, I'm not sure if the problem considers "Bounding Box" as a relation. I think Equal and Bounding Box are typically considered separate, but I don't have enough information to be sure. But since the question asks for the "possible answer", and it includes "Bounding Box" as an option, I'll certainly consider it. 

OK, so I need to be really clear here. Given the constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, from the listed options, are:

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest. But not Bounding Box.

Actually, let me reconsider once more what "Bounding Box" can possibly mean. Maybe it refers to a situation where one region is fully contained within the bounding box of another, but not fully overlapping. That would make it distinct from the "Equal" relation.

Actually, let me try to double check the definition of "Bounding Box" again, in the context of cardinal direction relations.

Hmm, I was confusing myself. In many geospatial system, the way cardinal direction relations are computed is using a bounding box approach. However, "Bounding Box" itself is not a cardinal direction relation in the traditional 9-relation system.

I think what "Bounding Box" might be referring to is a situation where the regions have a more complex directional relation that's not captured by the basic 9 relations. For instance, if one region wraps around another, or if the regions overlap in certain ways. But, without a precise definition of "Bounding Box" in the context of the problem, I can't be certain.

Based on our constraints ("x is West of y" and "y is South of z"), and from the given options, the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z are:

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest. I don't believe "Bounding Box" is a possibility based on the traditional definition of cardinal direction relations, but I'm not 100% certain given the ambiguity of the term "Bounding Box" in this context.

Let me reason it out more carefully.

Given "x is West of y" and "y is South of z", let's check what cardinal direction relations are possible from among: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

From our previous analysis, we've established that all of the 8 cardinal direction relations (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest) are possible between x and z, given the constraints.

Now, what about the "Bounding Box" relation? I tried to find a clear definition of this as a cardinal direction relation, but without clear context, it's a bit ambiguous. However, if by "Bounding Box" the problem refers to a situation where one region is fully contained within the bounding box of another, then this is not always guaranteed to hold between x and z given our constraints.

For example, if z is a large region, and y is just slightly to the south of it, and x is just slightly to the west of y, then x might be partly outside of the bounding box of z, especially if x is large. However, if z, y, and x are all small regions, then x might be fully contained within the bounding box of z.

Since the constraints don't dictate the sizes or exact positions of the regions, but only the cardinal direction relations between them, it's possible for x to either be fully contained within the bounding box of z or not. So, if that's what "Bounding Box" refers to, then it's a potential relation between x and z.

But, without a precise definition of "Bounding Box" in the context of the problem, I'm making some assumptions.

So, to summarize, the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, from the given options and given the constraints, are:

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest. And, if by "Bounding Box" the problem refers to a relation where one region is fully contained within the bounding box of another, then that's also a possible relation.

Actually, rereading the problem statement, I see we're just asked for "what could the possible relations be?" i.e. we are looking for the set of relations that are allowed between x and z.

So based on the previous logic, we've established that the following 8 relations are possible: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest. If "Bounding Box" is a distinct relation, then it may or may not be possible, but my best guess is that it's not referring to a distinct cardinal relation, but rather a computational method for determining cardinal relations.

So my answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest.

Actually, I can't let go of this Bounding Box thing. Let's try once more. "Bounding Box" in the context of cardinal direction relations can refer to various things, and without precise context, it's ambiguous. However, one interpretation is that it refers to a situation where the regions have a complex directional relation, like when regions overlap in a way that's not captured by the basic 8 cardinal directions. Or it can refer to the method I talked about, where we determine the cardinal relation between two regions by examining the basic relation between the bounding box of each region.

Let's be more concrete, and have a case when the regions are not just points. Let's call the bounding box of a region r as BB(r), and the relation between two regions x and z as R(x, z). 

The basic 9 cardinal direction relations apply between points (or very small regions that we can approximate as points). In general, if we have two regions, we compute the cardinal direction relation by considering the relation between all point in one region and all points in the other.

Based on the constraints:
- "x is West of y" means R(x, y) = West
- "y is South of z" means R(y, z) = South

Now, to compute R(x, z), we need to consider the relation between all points in x and all points in z. But, we don't have a direct constraint between x and z. We only know the relationship between x and y, and between y and z.

Let's consider a specific case to make things concrete:
- z is a region around the origin, with its bounding box centered at (0, 0).
- y is a region to the south of z, with its bounding box centered at (0, -2).
- x is a region to the west of y, with its bounding box centered at (-2, -2).

In this specific case, R(x, z) = Southwest, because x is to the southwest of z. This means, all points of region x are to the southwest of all the points of region z. This means the SouthWest relation holds for the bounding boxes, i.e., R(BB(x), BB(z)) = Southwest as well.

But now, let's consider a different case where regions are more complex, and the bounding box does not adequately capture the shape of the region:
- z is a very large region (let's say L-shaped), with its bounding box covering much of the plane.
- y is a region to the south of z, with its bounding box centered at (0, -2).
- x is a region to the west of y, with its bounding box centered at (-2, -2).

Now, even though y is South of z and x is West of y, the relation between x and z can be more complex. x can be to the west of a part of z, to the southwest of another part of z, and so on. The bounding box of x might even overlap with the bounding box of z.

In such a case, computing R(x, z) becomes more complex and might require breaking down the regions into simpler shapes, which is what I think the "Bounding Box" approach is getting at. The bounding box approach, in particular, simplifies computation for these complex cases.

But, at the end of the day, the result of the computation should be one of the 9 cardinal direction relations.

Summing it up, I believe the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, given the constraints, are all the 8 cardinal direction relations (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest), excluding Equal.

So, my response to the original question: Given "x is West of y" and "y is South of z", the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest. I don't believe "Bounding Box" is a cardinal direction relation in the traditional sense, but it might represent a computational approach to determine cardinal directions between complex regions.

Actually, maybe bounding box isn't a relation. But actually, it's not a traditional one in most cardinal direction calculi. So the anwer is: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest.

ANSWER:

Based on the constraints provided, I need to determine what cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is South of region z

To analyze this, I'll consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

When y is directly South of z:
- x must be West of y, but x's vertical position relative to z is unrestricted
- x could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z

When y is Southeast of z:
- x must be West of y
- If x is sufficiently west, it could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z
- If x is only slightly west of y, it could be North, South, Northeast, East, or Southeast of z (while still being west of y)

When y is Southwest of z:
- x must be West of y
- This places x firmly west of z, so x could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z

Considering all these scenarios together, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest
