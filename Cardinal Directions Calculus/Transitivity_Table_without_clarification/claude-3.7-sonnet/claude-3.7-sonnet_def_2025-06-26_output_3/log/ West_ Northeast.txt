PROMPT: Let  West and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's consider three regions, $x$, $y$, and $z$, and the cardinal direction relations between them.

We are given that:
- $x$ is West of $y$
- $y$ is Northeast of $z$

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$.

Let's visualize this on a 2D plane with the usual cardinal directions.

If $y$ is Northeast of $z$, that means $z$ is Southwest of $y$.

We also know $x$ is West of $y$.

Let's consider the possible positions of $x$ relative to $z$.

First, let's establish the relative coordinates.

If we place $z$ at the origin $(0, 0)$, and assuming cardinal directions like on a map (North is up, East is right), then:
- $y$ is Northeast of $z$, so $y$ is in the direction $(+, +)$ from $z$. That is, $y$ has a positive x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate relative to $z$.
- $x$ is West of $y$, so $x$ is in the direction $(-, 0)$ from $y$. That is, $x$ has a more negative x-coordinate than $y$, but the y-coordinate remains the same.

Given that $y$ is at some point in the Northeast quadrant relative to $z$, and $x$ is West of $y$, we need to determine the possible positions of $x$ relative to $z$.

Let's say $y$ is at coordinates $(a, b)$ where $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, since $y$ is Northeast of $z$.

Since $x$ is West of $y$, $x$ is at coordinates $(a - c, b)$, where $c > 0$ is some positive distance.

Now, we need to determine the position of $x$ relative to $z$. $x$ is at $(a - c, b)$ and $z$ is at $(0, 0)$.

To determine the cardinal direction of $x$ relative to $z$, we need to check the signs of the coordinates:
- If $a - c > 0$ and $b > 0$, then $x$ is Northeast of $z$.
- If $a - c = 0$ and $b > 0$, then $x$ is North of $z$.
- If $a - c < 0$ and $b > 0$, then $x$ is Northwest of $z$.
- If $a - c > 0$ and $b = 0$, then $x$ is East of $z$.
- If $a - c < 0$ and $b = 0$, then $x$ is West of $z$.
- If $a - c > 0$ and $b < 0$, then $x$ is Southeast of $z$.
- If $a - c = 0$ and $b < 0$, then $x$ is South of $z$.
- If $a - c < 0$ and $b < 0$, then $x$ is Southwest of $z$.

But we know $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ (since $y$ is Northeast of $z$), and $c > 0$ (since $x$ is West of $y$).

So, we have $a - c$ could be positive, zero, or negative, and $b > 0$.

This gives us the following possibilities:
1. If $a - c > 0$, then $x$ is Northeast of $z$.
2. If $a - c = 0$, then $x$ is North of $z$.
3. If $a - c < 0$, then $x$ is Northwest of $z$.

Actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. The relationship "West" doesn't mean just a negative x-coordinate with the same y-coordinate. It means the entire region to the west of y.

So, if $x$ is West of $y$, and $y$ is at coordinates $(a, b)$, then $x$ could be at any coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ where $x_1 < a$. The y-coordinate of $x$ could be anything.

Let's revisit the problem with this understanding.

If $y$ is Northeast of $z$, and $z$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$, then $y$ is at some coordinates $(a, b)$ where $a > 0$ and $b > 0$.

If $x$ is West of $y$, then $x$ is at coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ where $x_1 < a$. The value of $y_1$ could be anything.

So, the possible positions of $x$ relative to $z$ are:
1. If $x_1 > 0$ and $y_1 > 0$, then $x$ is Northeast of $z$.
2. If $x_1 = 0$ and $y_1 > 0$, then $x$ is North of $z$.
3. If $x_1 < 0$ and $y_1 > 0$, then $x$ is Northwest of $z$.
4. If $x_1 > 0$ and $y_1 = 0$, then $x$ is East of $z$.
5. If $x_1 < 0$ and $y_1 = 0$, then $x$ is West of $z$.
6. If $x_1 > 0$ and $y_1 < 0$, then $x$ is Southeast of $z$.
7. If $x_1 = 0$ and $y_1 < 0$, then $x$ is South of $z$.
8. If $x_1 < 0$ and $y_1 < 0$, then $x$ is Southwest of $z$.

But, we know that $x_1 < a$ and $a > 0$. This doesn't tell us the sign of $x_1$, only that it's less than $a$. And we don't have a constraint on $y_1$ from the given conditions.

Actually, no, I think I may be overthinking this. Let me try to reason about this more carefully.

If $y$ is Northeast of $z$, we can say that $y$ is in the Northeast quadrant relative to $z$. This means that $y$ is both to the North and to the East of $z$.

If $x$ is West of $y$, it means that $x$ is to the West of $y$. This doesn't tell us anything about the North-South relationship between $x$ and $y$.

Let's visualize this on a grid, with $z$ at the origin.

If $y$ is Northeast of $z$, it could be at any point in the Northeast quadrant of $z$, like (1, 1), (2, 3), etc.

Now, if $x$ is West of $y$, it means $x$ is to the West of $y$. So, if $y$ is at (1, 1), $x$ could be at (0, 1), (-1, 1), etc. If $y$ is at (2, 3), $x$ could be at (1, 3), (0, 3), (-1, 3), etc.

So, $x$ could be anywhere to the West of $y$, and $y$ is in the Northeast quadrant of $z$.

To determine the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$, we need to consider all possible positions of $x$ relative to $z$.

Let's simplify this. If $y$ is Northeast of $z$, it means $y$ is both to the North and to the East of $z$. If $x$ is West of $y$, it means $x$ is to the West of $y$.

So, $x$ is to the West of a point that is to the Northeast of $z$. This gives us a few possibilities for the position of $x$ relative to $z$:

1. $x$ could still be to the East of $z$ (if the Westward displacement from $y$ to $x$ is less than the Eastward displacement from $z$ to $y$).
2. $x$ could be directly North of $z$ (if the Westward displacement from $y$ to $x$ exactly cancels out the Eastward displacement from $z$ to $y$).
3. $x$ could be to the West of $z$ (if the Westward displacement from $y$ to $x$ is more than the Eastward displacement from $z$ to $y$).

Regardless of the East-West relationship, $x$ is always to the North of $z$ because $y$ is to the North of $z$, and the West relation doesn't change the North-South relationship.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. Northeast (if $x$ is to the East of $z$ and to the North of $z$)
2. North (if $x$ is directly North of $z$)
3. Northwest (if $x$ is to the West of $z$ and to the North of $z$)

Wait, but I think the above assumes that the West relation means that $x$ is directly to the West of $y$ with the same y-coordinate. But in general cardinal direction relations, "West" means the entire region to the west, not just points with the same y-coordinate.

Let me take a step back and think about this problem differently.

Cardinal direction relations partition the 2D space into 9 regions around a reference object: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the reference object itself. 

If $y$ is Northeast of $z$, it means $y$ is in the Northeast region of $z$.
If $x$ is West of $y$, it means $x$ is in the West region of $y$.

To determine the possible positions of $x$ relative to $z$, we need to find the intersection of "West of $y$" with the possible positions of $y$ being "Northeast of $z$".

Let me redefine our approach using the cardinal direction formalism. Let's denote the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of an object $a$ as $MBR(a)$. The MBR is the smallest rectangle with sides parallel to the axes that contains the object.

For simplicity, let's denote the x-coordinate and y-coordinate extents of $MBR(a)$ as $[a_{\min}^x, a_{\max}^x]$ and $[a_{\min}^y, a_{\max}^y]$ respectively.

Now, the cardinal direction relations are defined as follows:
- $a$ is North of $b$ if $a_{\min}^y > b_{\max}^y$.
- $a$ is South of $b$ if $a_{\max}^y < b_{\min}^y$.
- $a$ is East of $b$ if $a_{\min}^x > b_{\max}^x$.
- $a$ is West of $b$ if $a_{\max}^x < b_{\min}^x$.
- $a$ is Northeast of $b$ if $a$ is both North of $b$ and East of $b$.
- $a$ is Northwest of $b$ if $a$ is both North of $b$ and West of $b$.
- $a$ is Southeast of $b$ if $a$ is both South of $b$ and East of $b$.
- $a$ is Southwest of $b$ if $a$ is both South of $b$ and West of $b$.

Let's now apply these to our problem.

We have:
- $x$ is West of $y$, which means $x_{\max}^x < y_{\min}^x$.
- $y$ is Northeast of $z$, which means $y_{\min}^y > z_{\max}^y$ and $y_{\min}^x > z_{\max}^x$.

We want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$.

From $x_{\max}^x < y_{\min}^x$ and $y_{\min}^x > z_{\max}^x$, we can infer that $x_{\max}^x < y_{\min}^x$ and $y_{\min}^x > z_{\max}^x$. But this doesn't give us a direct relation between $x_{\max}^x$ and $z_{\max}^x$. So, $x$ could be East, directly above (North), or West of $z$ in terms of the x-coordinate.

From $y_{\min}^y > z_{\max}^y$, we know that $y$ is strictly to the North of $z$. But this doesn't give us a direct relation between $x_{\min}^y$ and $z_{\max}^y$. $x$ could be North, at the same level, or South of $z$ in terms of the y-coordinate.

Wait, I need to be more precise here.

Let's consider the cardinal direction relations with a bit more formality.

The cardinal direction relations partition the 2D space around a reference object into 9 tiles (or regions): North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and the same location as the reference (O).

Given two objects, let's say $a$ and $b$, the cardinal direction relation of $a$ with respect to $b$ is determined by the tile in which $a$ falls relative to $b$.

For simplicity, let's consider the objects as points.

Let's place the origin of our coordinate system at the location of $z$.

Given:
- $y$ is Northeast of $z$. This means $y$ is in the Northeast quadrant relative to the origin, so $y$ has coordinates $(y_x, y_y)$ where $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$.
- $x$ is West of $y$. This means $x$ is to the West of $y$, so $x$ has coordinates $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x$. Note that the y-coordinate is not constrained, so $x_y$ could be less than, equal to, or greater than $y_y$.

Now, we want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$.

Comparing the coordinates of $x$ and $z$ (with $z$ at the origin):
- If $x_x > 0$, then $x$ is to the East of $z$.
- If $x_x = 0$, then $x$ is neither to the East nor to the West of $z$.
- If $x_x < 0$, then $x$ is to the West of $z$.
- If $x_y > 0$, then $x$ is to the North of $z$.
- If $x_y = 0$, then $x$ is neither to the North nor to the South of $z$.
- If $x_y < 0$, then $x$ is to the South of $z$.

We know $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$ (from $y$ being Northeast of $z$), and $x_x < y_x$ (from $x$ being West of $y$).

The constraint $x_x < y_x$ means $x_x$ could be positive, zero, or negative.

For $x_y$, we don't have any constraints from the given information, so $x_y$ could be positive, zero, or negative.

Based on the possible combinations of $x_x$ and $x_y$, the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. Northeast (if $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$)
2. North (if $x_x = 0$ and $x_y > 0$)
3. Northwest (if $x_x < 0$ and $x_y > 0$)
4. East (if $x_x > 0$ and $x_y = 0$)
5. Same location as $z$ (if $x_x = 0$ and $x_y = 0$)
6. West (if $x_x < 0$ and $x_y = 0$)
7. Southeast (if $x_x > 0$ and $x_y < 0$)
8. South (if $x_x = 0$ and $x_y < 0$)
9. Southwest (if $x_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$)

So, all nine cardinal direction relations are possible between $x$ and $z$ based on the given information.

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider the problem.

We have:
- $y$ is Northeast of $z$. This means $y$ has coordinates $(y_x, y_y)$ where $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$.
- $x$ is West of $y$. This means $x$ has coordinates $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x$. The y-coordinate is not constrained by this relation.

But I missed a potential constraint on $x_y$. If $x$ is West of $y$, can $x_y$ really take any value, or is there an implicit constraint?

The cardinal direction "West" means that the object is to the west of the reference, but it doesn't specify anything about the north-south positioning. So, $x$ being West of $y$ doesn't place any constraint on $x_y$ relative to $y_y$.

Let's revise my reasoning.

We know $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$ (from $y$ being Northeast of $z$), and $x_x < y_x$ (from $x$ being West of $y$).

For $x_y$, we don't have any constraints from the given relations, so $x_y$ could be any value.

Based on the possible combinations of $x_x$ and $x_y$, the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. Northeast (if $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$)
2. North (if $x_x = 0$ and $x_y > 0$)
3. Northwest (if $x_x < 0$ and $x_y > 0$)
4. East (if $x_x > 0$ and $x_y = 0$)
5. Same location as $z$ (if $x_x = 0$ and $x_y = 0$)
6. West (if $x_x < 0$ and $x_y = 0$)
7. Southeast (if $x_x > 0$ and $x_y < 0$)
8. South (if $x_x = 0$ and $x_y < 0$)
9. Southwest (if $x_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$)

So, based on the given information, $x$ could have any of the nine cardinal direction relations with respect to $z$.

But I realize I keep flip-flopping on the constraints of "West". Let me go back to the basic definition of cardinal direction relations.

In cardinal direction relations, the "West" relation means that the object is to the west of the reference object, but it can be at any latitude. The "Northeast" relation means that the object is both to the north and to the east of the reference object.

So, if $y$ is Northeast of $z$, it means $y$ is both to the North and to the East of $z$. In our coordinate system with $z$ at the origin, $y$ has coordinates $(y_x, y_y)$ where $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$.

If $x$ is West of $y$, it means $x$ is to the West of $y$. In our coordinate system, $x$ has coordinates $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x$. Note that the y-coordinate of $x$ is not constrained by this relation, so $x_y$ could be any value.

Combining these, we have:
- $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$ (from $y$ being Northeast of $z$).
- $x_x < y_x$ (from $x$ being West of $y$).
- $x_y$ could be any value.

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ (with $z$ at the origin):
1. If $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$, then $x$ is Northeast of $z$.
2. If $x_x = 0$ and $x_y > 0$, then $x$ is North of $z$.
3. If $x_x < 0$ and $x_y > 0$, then $x$ is Northwest of $z$.
4. If $x_x > 0$ and $x_y = 0$, then $x$ is East of $z$.
5. If $x_x = 0$ and $x_y = 0$, then $x$ is at the same location as $z$.
6. If $x_x < 0$ and $x_y = 0$, then $x$ is West of $z$.
7. If $x_x > 0$ and $x_y < 0$, then $x$ is Southeast of $z$.
8. If $x_x = 0$ and $x_y < 0$, then $x$ is South of $z$.
9. If $x_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$, then $x$ is Southwest of $z$.

So, based on the given information, $x$ could have any of the nine cardinal direction relations with respect to $z$.

Now I realize I made a mistake. I skipped an important detail for the North, South, East, and West relations. Specifically, I defined the "North" relation incorrectly. Let me redefine the single cardinal direction relations:

1. $a$ is North of $b$ if $a_y > b_y$ and $a_x = b_x$.
2. $a$ is South of $b$ if $a_y < b_y$ and $a_x = b_x$.
3. $a$ is East of $b$ if $a_x > b_x$ and $a_y = b_y$.
4. $a$ is West of $b$ if $a_x < b_x$ and $a_y = b_y$.

And the composite cardinal direction relations:
5. $a$ is Northeast of $b$ if $a_x > b_x$ and $a_y > b_y$.
6. $a$ is Northwest of $b$ if $a_x < b_x$ and $a_y > b_y$.
7. $a$ is Southeast of $b$ if $a_x > b_x$ and $a_y < b_y$.
8. $a$ is Southwest of $b$ if $a_x < b_x$ and $a_y < b_y$.

With these definitions, if $x$ is West of $y$, it means $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y = y_y$. And if $y$ is Northeast of $z$, it means $y_x > z_x$ and $y_y > z_y$. Placing $z$ at the origin, we have $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$. And since $x$ is West of $y$, we have $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y = y_y$. This means $x_y > 0$ and $x_x < y_x$.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. If $x_x > 0$, then $x$ is Northeast of $z$ (since $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$).
2. If $x_x = 0$, then $x$ is North of $z$ (since $x_x = 0$ and $x_y > 0$).
3. If $x_x < 0$, then $x$ is Northwest of $z$ (since $x_x < 0$ and $x_y > 0$).

In summary, based on the given information and the strict definitions of cardinal direction relations, $x$ could be Northeast, North, or Northwest of $z$.

Actually, I think the above formulation is too restricted for cardinal directions. Let me go back to a more standard definition.

We can partition the 2D space around a reference point using the cardinal directions. This creates 9 tiles: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and O (the reference itself). The relations are defined based on the relative coordinates. For instance, if $a$ is to the north of $b$, it doesn't necessarily mean they're on the same longitude; it just means $a$ is in the northern tile of $b$.

Given this definition, if $y$ is Northeast of $z$, it means $y$ is in the NE tile of $z$, so $y_x > z_x$ and $y_y > z_y$. Placing $z$ at the origin, we have $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$.

If $x$ is West of $y$, it means $x$ is in the W tile of $y$, so $x_x < y_x$ and $y_y - k \leq x_y \leq y_y + k$ for some value $k$ (representing the latitude extent of the West tile). But this means $x_y$ could be slightly above or below $y_y$, but not significantly so. For simplicity, let's say $x_y \approx y_y$.

Given that $y_y > 0$ (since $y$ is NE of $z$), we have $x_y \approx y_y > 0$. Also, $x_x < y_x$ and $y_x > 0$, which means $x_x$ could be positive, zero, or negative.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ (with $z$ at the origin) are:
1. If $x_x > 0$, then $x$ is in the N or NE tile of $z$ (since $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$).
2. If $x_x = 0$, then $x$ is in the N tile of $z$ (since $x_x = 0$ and $x_y > 0$).
3. If $x_x < 0$, then $x$ is in the NW tile of $z$ (since $x_x < 0$ and $x_y > 0$).

But the definition I gave for "West" is still not right. Let me rethink this.

I think I've been overcomplicating this. The cardinal direction relations can be defined as follows:
- North (N): The object is above the reference.
- Northeast (NE): The object is above and to the right of the reference.
- East (E): The object is to the right of the reference.
- Southeast (SE): The object is below and to the right of the reference.
- South (S): The object is below the reference.
- Southwest (SW): The object is below and to the left of the reference.
- West (W): The object is to the left of the reference.
- Northwest (NW): The object is above and to the left of the reference.

With these simplified definitions, if $y$ is Northeast of $z$, it means $y$ is above and to the right of $z$. Placing $z$ at the origin, $y$ has coordinates $(y_x, y_y)$ where $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$.

If $x$ is West of $y$, it means $x$ is to the left of $y$. So, $x$ has coordinates $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x$. The y-coordinate of $x$ is not constrained by this relation, so $x_y$ could be any value.

Combining these, we have:
- $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$ (from $y$ being Northeast of $z$).
- $x_x < y_x$ (from $x$ being West of $y$).
- $x_y$ could be any value.

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ (with $z$ at the origin):
1. If $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$, then $x$ is Northeast of $z$.
2. If $x_x > 0$ and $x_y = 0$, then $x$ is East of $z$.
3. If $x_x > 0$ and $x_y < 0$, then $x$ is Southeast of $z$.
4. If $x_x = 0$ and $x_y > 0$, then $x$ is North of $z$.
5. If $x_x = 0$ and $x_y = 0$, then $x$ is at the same location as $z$.
6. If $x_x = 0$ and $x_y < 0$, then $x$ is South of $z$.
7. If $x_x < 0$ and $x_y > 0$, then $x$ is Northwest of $z$.
8. If $x_x < 0$ and $x_y = 0$, then $x$ is West of $z$.
9. If $x_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$, then $x$ is Southwest of $z$.

So, based on the given information, $x$ could have any of the nine cardinal direction relations with respect to $z$.

Wait, I think the issue here is that I've been thinking of cardinal directions for point objects, but the problem is about regions.

In cardinal direction relations for regions, the reference region creates a grid that partitions the space. For example, if region $a$ is West of region $b$, it means all points in $a$ are to the west of all points in $b$. The definition for other cardinal directions would be similar.

Let's revise our approach.

Given:
- Region $x$ is West of region $y$: This means all points in $x$ are to the west of all points in $y$.
- Region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$: This means all points in $y$ are to the northeast of all points in $z$.

We want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region $x$ and region $z$.

Let's denote the leftmost, rightmost, topmost, and bottommost coordinates of a region $a$ as $a_{\text{left}}$, $a_{\text{right}}$, $a_{\text{top}}$, and $a_{\text{bottom}}$ respectively.

If region $x$ is West of region $y$, then $x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$.
If region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$, then $y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}$ and $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$.

From these, we can infer:
$x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$ and $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$.
This means $x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$ and $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$, but it doesn't give us a direct relation between $x_{\text{right}}$ and $z_{\text{right}}$. So, region $x$ could be to the East, directly above, or to the West of region $z$ in terms of longitude.

Also, from $y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}$, we know that region $y$ is strictly to the North of region $z$. But this doesn't give us a direct relation between $x_{\text{bottom}}$ and $z_{\text{top}}$. Region $x$ could be to the North, at the same latitude, or to the South of region $z$.

So, based on the given information, region $x$ could have any of the cardinal direction relations with respect to region $z$.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try a simpler approach.

We can define the cardinal direction relations between regions as follows:
- Region $a$ is North of region $b$ if all points in $a$ are to the north of all points in $b$.
- Region $a$ is South of region $b$ if all points in $a$ are to the south of all points in $b$.
- Region $a$ is East of region $b$ if all points in $a$ are to the east of all points in $b$.
- Region $a$ is West of region $b$ if all points in $a$ are to the west of all points in $b$.
- Region $a$ is Northeast of region $b$ if all points in $a$ are to the northeast of all points in $b$. And so on for the other composite directions.

Given:
- Region $x$ is West of region $y$: This means all points in $x$ are to the west of all points in $y$.
- Region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$: This means all points in $y$ are to the northeast of all points in $z$.

Now, let's visualize this. If all points in $y$ are to the northeast of all points in $z$, then $y$ is entirely in the Northeast quadrant of $z$. And if all points in $x$ are to the west of all points in $y$, then $x$ is entirely to the west of $y$.

Given these constraints, what are the possible positions of $x$ relative to $z$?

Let's introduce a coordinate system with $z$ at the origin.

If $y$ is Northeast of $z$, then all points in $y$ have positive x and y coordinates.
If $x$ is West of $y$, then for every point $(x_i, y_i)$ in $x$ and every point $(y_j, y_j)$ in $y$, we have $x_i < y_j$. However, there's no constraint on the y-coordinates.

The possible positions of $x$ relative to $z$ are determined by the possible x and y coordinates of points in $x$.

For the x-coordinate, the constraint $x_i < y_j$ for all $i$ and $j$ means that the x-coordinate of any point in $x$ is less than the x-coordinate of any point in $y$. Since all points in $y$ have positive x-coordinates, the x-coordinate of points in $x$ could be positive, zero, or negative.

For the y-coordinate, there's no direct constraint from the given information, so the y-coordinate of points in $x$ could be positive, zero, or negative.

This means $x$ could be in any of the nine cardinal direction regions relative to $z$.

But actually, let's go back to the basic definitions again.

Cardinal direction relations are typically defined for rectangular regions or for centroid-based relations. If we assume centroid-based relations, then the relation is determined by the position of the centroid of one region relative to the other.

Given:
- Region $x$ is West of region $y$: This means the centroid of $x$ is to the west of the centroid of $y$.
- Region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$: This means the centroid of $y$ is to the northeast of the centroid of $z$.

Let's denote the centroid of a region $a$ as $(a_x, a_y)$.

If region $x$ is West of region $y$, then $x_x < y_x$.
If region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$, then $y_x > z_x$ and $y_y > z_y$.

Placing $z$ at the origin, we have $y_x > 0$ and $y_y > 0$. From $x_x < y_x$, we know that $x_x < y_x$ and $y_x > 0$, which means $x_x$ could be positive, zero, or negative. For $x_y$, we don't have any constraints from the given information, so $x_y$ could be positive, zero, or negative.

Based on the possible combinations of $x_x$ and $x_y$, the possible cardinal direction relations between region $x$ and region $z$ are:
1. Northeast (if $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$)
2. North (if $x_x = 0$ and $x_y > 0$)
3. Northwest (if $x_x < 0$ and $x_y > 0$)
4. East (if $x_x > 0$ and $x_y = 0$)
5. Same location as $z$ (if $x_x = 0$ and $x_y = 0$)
6. West (if $x_x < 0$ and $x_y = 0$)
7. Southeast (if $x_x > 0$ and $x_y < 0$)
8. South (if $x_x = 0$ and $x_y < 0$)
9. Southwest (if $x_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$)

So, based on the given information, region $x$ could have any of the nine cardinal direction relations with respect to region $z$.

I think I keep forgetting about the "bounding box" concept. In many systems, cardinal direction relations for regions are defined using the bounding box of the regions.

Let's again reconsider the definitions. In many GIS systems, cardinal direction relations between regions are determined using the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) or the bounding box of the regions.

For regions $a$ and $b$ with their respective bounding boxes $MBR(a)$ and $MBR(b)$:
- $a$ is North of $b$ if the bottom edge of $MBR(a)$ is above the top edge of $MBR(b)$.
- $a$ is South of $b$ if the top edge of $MBR(a)$ is below the bottom edge of $MBR(b)$.
- $a$ is East of $b$ if the left edge of $MBR(a)$ is to the right of the right edge of $MBR(b)$.
- $a$ is West of $b$ if the right edge of $MBR(a)$ is to the left of the left edge of $MBR(b)$.
- $a$ is Northeast of $b$ if $a$ is both North of $b$ and East of $b$.
- And so on for the other composite directions.

Given:
- Region $x$ is West of region $y$: This means the right edge of $MBR(x)$ is to the left of the left edge of $MBR(y)$.
- Region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$: This means the bottom edge of $MBR(y)$ is above the top edge of $MBR(z)$ and the left edge of $MBR(y)$ is to the right of the right edge of $MBR(z)$.

Let's denote the leftmost, rightmost, topmost, and bottommost coordinates of the bounding box of a region $a$ as $a_{\text{left}}$, $a_{\text{right}}$, $a_{\text{top}}$, and $a_{\text{bottom}}$ respectively.

From the given information:
- $x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$ (since $x$ is West of $y$).
- $y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}$ and $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$ (since $y$ is Northeast of $z$).

From these, we can infer:
- $x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$ and $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$.
- $y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}$.

For the East-West relationship between $x$ and $z$, we have $x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$ and $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$. But this doesn't give us a direct relation between $x_{\text{right}}$ and $z_{\text{right}}$. So, region $x$ could be to the East, directly above (or below, or bounding), or to the West of region $z$ in terms of East-West positioning.

For the North-South relationship between $x$ and $z$, we know $y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}$, which means region $y$ is strictly to the North of region $z$. But this doesn't give us a direct relation between $x_{\text{bottom}}$ and $z_{\text{top}}$ or between $x_{\text{top}}$ and $z_{\text{bottom}}$. So, region $x$ could be to the North, bounding, or to the South of region $z$ in terms of North-South positioning.

Given these possibilities, region $x$ could have any of the cardinal direction relations with respect to region $z$, or even a bounding or overlapping relationship.

Ok, based on my understanding of cardinal directions in the context of regions, and after multiple revisions, I believe the correct answer is that region $x$ could have any of the cardinal direction relations with respect to region $z$. The given information doesn't constrain the relationship enough to narrow it down.

To be more precise, based on the possible positions of $x$ relative to $z$, the relations could be:
1. North
2. Northeast
3. East
4. Southeast
5. South
6. Southwest
7. West
8. Northwest
9. Bounding Box (which means $x$ overlaps or contains $z$)

Let me try to think this through more carefully. We have a relation algebra where the basic relations are cardinal direction relations.

Let's introduce a more systematic notation for the cardinal direction relations. For two regions $a$ and $b$, let $R(a, b)$ denote the cardinal direction relation from $a$ to $b$. Then we can have the following relations:
- $R(a, b) = N$ if $a$ is North of $b$.
- $R(a, b) = NE$ if $a$ is Northeast of $b$.
- $R(a, b) = E$ if $a$ is East of $b$.
- $R(a, b) = SE$ if $a$ is Southeast of $b$.
- $R(a, b) = S$ if $a$ is South of $b$.
- $R(a, b) = SW$ if $a$ is Southwest of $b$.
- $R(a, b) = W$ if $a$ is West of $b$.
- $R(a, b) = NW$ if $a$ is Northwest of $b$.
- $R(a, b) = O$ if $a$ overlaps with $b$ or contains $b$.

Given:
- $R(x, y) = W$ (region $x$ is West of region $y$).
- $R(y, z) = NE$ (region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$).

We want to determine the possible values of $R(x, z)$.

Let's consider a composition table for cardinal direction relations, which gives us $R(a, c)$ given $R(a, b)$ and $R(b, c)$. 

The composition of West and Northeast would give us:
$W \circ NE = \{?? \}$

Now, let's try to reason about this. If region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$, it means $y$ is above and to the right of $z$. If region $x$ is West of region $y$, it means $x$ is to the left of $y$.

Given these constraints, region $x$ could be:
1. Above and to the left of $z$ (Northwest).
2. Directly above $z$ (North).
3. Above and to the right of $z$ (Northeast).
4. Directly to the left of $z$ (West).
5. Overlapping with or containing $z$ (O).
6. Directly to the right of $z$ (East).
7. Below and to the left of $z$ (Southwest).
8. Directly below $z$ (South).
9. Below and to the right of $z$ (Southeast).

So, $W \circ NE = \{N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, O\}$.

Let me visualize this to ensure I'm reasoning correctly.

Let's visualize a grid where $z$ is in the middle. The grid is as follows:
```
NW N NE
W  O  E
SW S SE
```

If $y$ is Northeast of $z$, it's in the NE position. If $x$ is West of $y$, it's to the left of the NE position. But "to the left of the NE position" could still be in the N position or the NW position, or even further to the left or below. So, $x$ could be in any of the positions on the grid.

Actually I think the bounding box issue does add a complication. In cardinal direction relations for regions, if regions overlap, they typically have a bounding box relation rather than a cardinal direction relation. Let's think this through again.

Given:
- Region $x$ is West of region $y$: This means there is no overlap in the East-West direction; region $x$ is completely to the left of region $y$.
- Region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$: This means there is no overlap in both the North-South and East-West directions; region $y$ is completely above and to the right of region $z$.

With these strict definitions, can region $x$ overlap with region $z$?

If region $y$ is completely above and to the right of region $z$, and region $x$ is completely to the left of region $y$, then in the most general case, region $x$ can be anywhere to the left of region $y$. It could be above, at the same level, or below region $z$ in terms of North-South positioning. And it could be to the right, at the same level, or to the left of region $z$ in terms of East-West positioning.

So, region $x$ could overlap with region $z$, or it could have any of the cardinal direction relations with respect to region $z$.

Actually, I think I was wrong about the bounding box relation. The term "bounding box" in this context doesn't refer to an overlap or containment relation, but rather to the concept of using the minimum bounding rectangle of a region for determining cardinal direction relations.

Given the standard definitions of cardinal direction relations for regions, the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$ are:
1. North (if $x$ is directly above $z$)
2. Northeast (if $x$ is above and to the right of $z$)
3. East (if $x$ is directly to the right of $z$)
4. Southeast (if $x$ is below and to the right of $z$)
5. South (if $x$ is directly below $z$)
6. Southwest (if $x$ is below and to the left of $z$)
7. West (if $x$ is directly to the left of $z$)
8. Northwest (if $x$ is above and to the left of $z$)
9. Overlapping or Containing (if $x$ overlaps with or contains $z$)

So, all nine cardinal direction relations (including the overlapping relation) are possible between region $x$ and region $z$ based on the given information.

That said, let me try to break down a case analysis to see whether I can establish a more precise relationship between $x$ and $z$.

Assuming the standard definitions of cardinal direction relations for regions:

- If region $y$ is Northeast of region $z$, then the bottom edge of the bounding box of $y$ is above the top edge of the bounding box of $z$, and the left edge of the bounding box of $y$ is to the right of the right edge of the bounding box of $z$. In other words, $y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}$ and $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$.

- If region $x$ is West of region $y$, then the right edge of the bounding box of $x$ is to the left of the left edge of the bounding box of $y$. In other words, $x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$.

Combining these, we have:
- $y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}$ and $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$ (from $y$ being Northeast of $z$).
- $x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$ (from $x$ being West of $y$).

From $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$ and $x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$, we can infer $x_{\text{right}} < y_{\text{left}}$ and $y_{\text{left}} > z_{\text{right}}$. But this doesn't give us a direct relation between $x_{\text{right}}$ and $z_{\text{right}}$. $x_{\text{right}}$ could be less than, equal to, or greater than $z_{\text{right}}$.

Similarly, from $y_{\text{bottom}} > z_{\text{top}}$, we don't get a direct relation between $x_{\text{bottom}}$ and $z_{\text{top}}$ or between $x_{\text{top}}$ and $z_{\text{bottom}}$. The bottom of $x$ could be above, at the same level, or below the top of $z$. And the top of $x$ could be above, at the same level, or below the bottom of $z$.

Based on these possible relationships, region $x$ could have any of the cardinal direction relations with respect to region $z$, or it could overlap with or contain region $z$.

Actually, wait. I just realized I'm forgetting something. The question is asking for "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?". This means we're looking for all possibilities, not the definitive relation.

But also, I think with region-based cardinal directions, the term "Bounding Box" refers to a specific relation, not the method of determining other relations. So, the possible relations could indeed include "Bounding Box", referring to a situation where the regions overlap or one contains the other.

For completeness, let's define the cardinal direction relations for regions, taking into account the possible overlapping:

1. $a$ is North of $b$ if the bottom edge of the bounding box of $a$ is above the top edge of the bounding box of $b$.
2. $a$ is South of $b$ if the top edge of the bounding box of $a$ is below the bottom edge of the bounding box of $b$.
3. $a$ is East of $b$ if the left edge of the bounding box of $a$ is to the right of the right edge of the bounding box of $b$.
4. $a$ is West of $b$ if the right edge of the bounding box of $a$ is to the left of the left edge of the bounding box of $b$.
5. $a$ is Northeast of $b$ if $a$ is both North of $b$ and East of $b$.
6. $a$ is Northwest of $b$ if $a$ is both North of $b$ and West of $b$.
7. $a$ is Southeast of $b$ if $a$ is both South of $b$ and East of $b$.
8. $a$ is Southwest of $b$ if $a$ is both South of $b$ and West of $b$.
9. $a$ has a "Bounding Box" relation with $b$ if the bounding boxes of $a$ and $b$ overlap.

Given these definitions, and based on the previous analysis, the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$ are:
1. North
2. Northeast
3. East
4. Southeast
5. South
6. Southwest
7. West
8. Northwest
9. Bounding Box

So, all nine cardinal direction relations (including the "Bounding Box" relation) are possible between region $x$ and region $z$ based on the given information.

Ok, so actually all possibilities are open to us. Given that region $y$ is strictly above and to the right of region $z$, and region $x$ is strictly to the left of region $y$, region $x$ could be in any of the cardinal directions relative to region $z$, or it could have a bounding box relation with region $z$.

All possible cardinal direction relations between region $x$ and region $z$ are valid based on the given information.

So, the answer to the question "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" is:
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box.

Hmm, but wait, if $x$ is West of $y$ and $y$ is Northeast of $z$, can $x$ truly be East of $z$? Let's visualize this:

If $z$ is at the origin (0, 0), then $y$ is somewhere in the NE quadrant, say at (3, 3).
If $x$ is West of $y$, then $x$ is at a position with a smaller x-coordinate than $y$, say at (2, 3).
Now, is $x$ East of $z$? At (2, 3), $x$ is certainly to the East of $z$ at (0, 0).

So, yes, even if $x$ is West of $y$ and $y$ is Northeast of $z$, $x$ can still be East of $z$.

Let's double-check this with a more extreme example:

If $z$ is at (0, 0), $y$ is at (10, 10), and $x$ is at (9, 10), then $x$ is West of $y$ and $y$ is Northeast of $z$, but $x$ is still in the NE quadrant relative to $z$, so $x$ is Northeast of $z$.

This checks out. So, all cardinal directions (and the bounding box relation) are possible for the relationship between $x$ and $z$ based on the given information.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Northeast of region z

To find the possible relations between region x and region z:

When y is Northeast of z, it means y is both north and east of z.
When x is West of y, it means x is directly to the west of y.

Since y is northeast of z, and x is west of y, region x could be in various positions relative to z:

1. Northwest - if x is sufficiently west of y
2. North - if x is west of y but still directly north of z
3. Northeast - if x is west of y but still northeast of z
4. West - if x is west of both y and z
5. Bounding Box - if x overlaps with z
6. East - if x is west of y but still east of z
7. Southwest - if x is west of y and south of z
8. South - if x is west of y but directly south of z
9. Southeast - if x is west of y but southeast of z

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box
