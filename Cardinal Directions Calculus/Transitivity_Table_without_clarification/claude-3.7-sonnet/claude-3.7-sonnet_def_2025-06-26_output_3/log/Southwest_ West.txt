PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's define a coordinate system where I place region z at the origin $(0, 0)$. 

Given that region y is West of region z, this means that y has coordinates $y = (y_x, y_y)$ where $y_x < 0$ and $y_y = 0$. So y is somewhere on the negative x-axis.

Given that region x is Southwest of region y, this means that x has coordinates $x = (x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y < y_y = 0$. So $x_x < y_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$.

So region x is somewhere in the third quadrant (negative x, negative y), i.e., to the Southwest of the origin. 

Therefore, region x is Southwest of region z.

Wait, I made a mistake. If y is West of z, then y has coordinates $y = (y_x, y_y)$ where $y_x < 0$ and $y_y = 0$. Then if x is Southwest of y, we have $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y < y_y = 0$. So $x_x < y_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$. This means that x is somewhere in the third quadrant, to the Southwest of the origin.

So the relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

Actually, I should be more careful. Let me define the directions more precisely.

I'll use a coordinate system where the positive y-axis points North, and the positive x-axis points East.

If region y is West of region z, that means that $y_x < z_x$ and $y_y = z_y$. Let's set $z = (0, 0)$ for convenience. Then $y = (y_x, 0)$ where $y_x < 0$.

If region x is Southwest of region y, that means that $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y < y_y$. Since $y = (y_x, 0)$ where $y_x < 0$, we get $x = (x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$.

So region x has coordinates $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$. This is indeed the third quadrant, so the relation between x and z is Southwest.

But wait, I now realize that I've been assuming specific models of what it means for a region to be, say, "West" or "Southwest" of another. I've been assuming that the regions are points, but since the problem statement explicitly refers to them as "regions", they likely have non-zero area.

When we say that a region y is West of another region z, do we mean that every point in y is to the west of every point in z? Let me think...

I think a more reasonable interpretation is to use centroids. We say that region y is West of region z if the centroid of y is to the west of the centroid of z. And region x is Southwest of region y if the centroid of x is to the southwest of the centroid of y.

Given that, my previous analysis still holds. If the centroid of z is at the origin, and the centroid of y is at $(y_x, 0)$ where $y_x < 0$, and the centroid of x is at $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$, then the centroid of x is to the southwest of the centroid of z. So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, wait, there's also the issue of whether all of these direction relations are jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD). For example, does "West" mean strictly west, or does it include northwest and southwest as well? I think I should assume the former, i.e., that the relation "West" only holds if the relative position is strictly west, without any north or south component.

Given these, let's revisit the problem.

If y is strictly West of z, then the centroid of y is at $(y_x, 0)$ where $y_x < 0$ and $z$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$.

If x is strictly Southwest of y, then the centroid of x is at $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y < 0$.

So, using the origin for z, we have x at position $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$.

Actually, it occurs to me that maybe these direction relations are not JEPD. In particular, it's possible that the "West" relation might not be pairwise disjoint with the "Northwest" and "Southwest" relations. Let's see if we can make more progress using a slightly different approach.

Actually, let's try to use the definition of direction relations based on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle whose sides are aligned with the coordinate axes and which completely contains the region.

Given two regions A and B with MBRs specified by the corners $(A_{min_x}, A_{min_y})$, $(A_{max_x}, A_{max_y})$ and $(B_{min_x}, B_{min_y})$, $(B_{max_x}, B_{max_y})$, we can define the direction relations as follows:

- A is North of B if $A_{min_y} > B_{max_y}$.
- A is South of B if $A_{max_y} < B_{min_y}$.
- A is East of B if $A_{min_x} > B_{max_x}$.
- A is West of B if $A_{max_x} < B_{min_x}$.
- A is Northeast of B if $A_{min_x} > B_{max_x}$ and $A_{min_y} > B_{max_y}$.
- A is Northwest of B if $A_{max_x} < B_{min_x}$ and $A_{min_y} > B_{max_y}$.
- A is Southeast of B if $A_{min_x} > B_{max_x}$ and $A_{max_y} < B_{min_y}$.
- A is Southwest of B if $A_{max_x} < B_{min_x}$ and $A_{max_y} < B_{min_y}$.

Let's use this to analyze the problem.

Given that y is West of z, we have $y_{max_x} < z_{min_x}$.

Given that x is Southwest of y, we have $x_{max_x} < y_{min_x}$ and $x_{max_y} < y_{min_y}$.

Since $y_{max_x} < z_{min_x}$ and $x_{max_x} < y_{min_x}$, we get $x_{max_x} < y_{min_x} < y_{max_x} < z_{min_x}$, which gives us $x_{max_x} < z_{min_x}$. This means that x is to the west of z.

Also, since $x_{max_y} < y_{min_y}$, and we don't have any constraint on the relative positions of $y_{min_y}$ and $z_{min_y}$, or $y_{max_y}$ and $z_{max_y}$, we don't immediately know whether x is to the north, south, or at the same level as z.

Let's think step by step. We know that $x_{max_x} < z_{min_x}$, so x is to the west of z. We also know that $x_{max_y} < y_{min_y}$, so x is to the south of y. But we don't know the north-south relationship between y and z. So x could be to the south of z, or at the same level as z, or even to the north of z. That is, the relation between x and z could be Southwest, West, or Northwest.

Wait, I think I've been making a mistake. If y is strictly West of z, and x is strictly Southwest of y, then x should be strictly to the southwest of z. Let me try yet another approach.

Actually, I think there's an important clue in the problem statement: it asks for "which could the possible relations" be. This suggests that there might be multiple possible relations, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Let me use a different approach based on the traditional 9-intersection model for direction relations. In this model, we partition the plane into 9 regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and a "Bounding Box" or "Same" relation where the regions overlap.

If y is West of z, then the centroid of y is in the "West" region of z. If x is Southwest of y, then the centroid of x is in the "Southwest" region of y.

I want to determine in which region(s) of z the centroid of x could be.

Consider a coordinate system with z at the origin. If y is in the "West" region of z, then $y_x < 0$ and $-\varepsilon < y_y < \varepsilon$ for some small $\varepsilon$ (ideally $\varepsilon = 0$, but that would make the West region have measure zero, which isn't very useful).

Now, if x is in the "Southwest" region of y, then $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y < y_y - \varepsilon$.

So we have $x_x < y_x < 0$ and $x_y < y_y - \varepsilon < \varepsilon - \varepsilon = 0$. This puts x in the third quadrant (minus a small strip near the axes), which corresponds to the "Southwest" region of z.

So it seems like the relation between x and z is Southwest.

But wait, if $y_y$ is very close to the lower end of its range, i.e., $y_y \approx -\varepsilon$, and $x_y$ is just slightly less than $y_y - \varepsilon$, then $x_y$ could be very close to $-2\varepsilon$. In the limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$, this approaches $x_y = 0$, which would put x in the "West" region of z, not the "Southwest" region.

So it seems like the relation between x and z could be either Southwest or West, depending on the exact positions.

Actually, I think I might be overthinking this problem. Let's try a simpler approach. Suppose the location of a region is represented by a single point (its centroid, say), and the direction relations are defined in the obvious way: y is West of z if y is directly to the left of z, with the same vertical coordinate; y is Southwest of z if y is both to the left and below z.

Given that y is West of z, we have $y_x < z_x$ and $y_y = z_y$. Given that x is Southwest of y, we have $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y < y_y$.

So we have $x_x < y_x < z_x$ and $x_y < y_y = z_y$. This means that x is both to the left and below z, i.e., x is Southwest of z.

But I'm still not sure if the problem is asking for the definite relation (which is Southwest) or the possible relations. To be safe, let me make sure I haven't missed any possible configurations.

If y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y, then x is definitely to the west (i.e., to the left) of z, since "west" is transitive in this sense. But is x definitely to the south (i.e., below) z? Since y has the same vertical coordinate as z, and x is below y, x is definitely below z. So x is both to the west and to the south of z, i.e., x is to the southwest of z.

So I believe the answer is that the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, I'm now thinking that perhaps the problem is considering more complex regions than just points, and more complex direction relations than just the simple ones based on centroids. Let me explore this a bit.

Let's say the direction relations are defined based on the MBRs, and we're using the standard 9-intersection model. In this model, we have:

- y is West of z if the MBR of y is entirely to the left of the MBR of z.
- x is Southwest of y if the MBR of x is entirely to the left and below the MBR of y.

Given these, can we determine the relation between x and z? We know that the MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is entirely to the left of the MBR of z. So the MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of z. We also know that the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y, but we don't immediately know the vertical relationship between the MBRs of x and z.

Actually, the fact that y is West of z implies that the MBR of y has the same vertical span as the MBR of z. So, if the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y, then it's also entirely below the MBR of z. This puts the MBR of x entirely to the left and below the MBR of z, which means that x is Southwest of z.

So my final answer is that the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Wait, I think I need to clarify the vertical relationship some more. If y is West of z, then the MBR of y is entirely to the left of the MBR of z. But this doesn't impose any constraints on the vertical relationship between the MBRs of y and z. The MBR of y could be above, below, or overlap vertically with the MBR of z, and y would still be West of z as long as the MBR of y is entirely to the left of the MBR of z.

So, given that x is Southwest of y, and y is West of z, we can't determine the vertical relationship between the MBRs of x and z without additional information.

Hmm, I think I'm going to have to reconsider how direction relations are defined. When we say that "y is West of z", we're saying that no matter where we are in region y, we'd have to go east to get to region z. And when we say that "x is Southwest of y", we're saying that no matter where we are in region x, we'd have to go northeast to get to region y.

Now, if we're in region x and want to get to region z, we know that we have to go northeast to get to region y, and then east to get to region z. Going northeast and then east is equivalent to going east and then northeast, or more directly, going east-northeast. But the cardinal direction that best approximates east-northeast depends on the relative distances and angles.

OK, I think I've been overthinking this problem. Let's go back to a simple model where regions are represented by points (e.g., their centroids).

If y is West of z, then y is at position $(y_x, y_y)$ and z is at position $(z_x, z_y)$ where $y_x < z_x$ and $y_y = z_y$.

If x is Southwest of y, then x is at position $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y < y_y$.

So we have x at position $(x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x < z_x$ and $x_y < y_y = z_y$. This means that $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$, i.e., x is Southwest of z.

Actually, I realize now what my problem is. I've been thinking too hard about the meaning of direction relations for complex, extended regions. But the problem statement uses terms like "region x is Southwest of region y", which suggests that the problem is using a simple model where the relation between two regions is a single direction. In such a model, the direction relation is typically based on the relative positions of the centroids of the regions.

Given that interpretation, my analysis is correct: if y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y, then x is Southwest of z.

Actually, wait. I just realized that in spatial reasoning, the composition of direction relations can sometimes yield multiple possible relations. For instance, the composition of "North" and "North" is clearly "North", but the composition of "North" and "East" could be "Northeast" or "North" or "East", depending on the exact positions. So I should be careful about assuming that the composition of "Southwest" and "West" is uniquely "Southwest".

Let's try a different approach. I'll consider the space of all possible configurations of x, y, and z (represented as points) where y is West of z and x is Southwest of y, and see what relations between x and z are possible.

For convenience, let's place z at the origin, i.e., $z = (0, 0)$. If y is West of z, then $y = (y_x, 0)$ where $y_x < 0$. If x is Southwest of y, then $x = (x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y < 0$.

So we have $x = (x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$. This means that $x$ is in the third quadrant, which corresponds to the "Southwest" direction from the origin. So x is Southwest of z.

Hmm, it seems like the relation between x and z is uniquely determined to be "Southwest". Let me double-check by considering some specific examples.

Example 1: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-1, 0)$, $x = (-2, -1)$. In this case, y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. The relation between x and z is indeed Southwest.

Example 2: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-1, 0)$, $x = (-3, -0.1)$. Again, y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. The relation between x and z is Southwest, although it's very close to being West.

Example 3: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-1, 0)$, $x = (-1.1, -10)$. Here, y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. The relation between x and z is Southwest, although it's very close to being South.

I can't come up with an example where the relation between x and z is anything other than Southwest. So my final answer is that the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, let me just double check that I'm understanding the question correctly. The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z. This suggests that there might be multiple possible relations. But my analysis suggests that the relation is uniquely Southwest. So I might be missing something.

Ah, I see. I think I might have been misunderstanding how the composition of direction relations works. Let's think of it more generally.

We have that y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. Now, West is a basic cardinal direction, and Southwest is a composed cardinal direction (of South and West). When we compose the directions, we get a composition of the components.

The composition of "West" and "West" is "West". The composition of "West" and "South" could be "Southwest" or "South" or "West", depending on the relative distances. So the composition of "West" and "Southwest" could be "Southwest" or "West" or "South", depending on the relative distances and directions.

Let me try to visualize some examples to verify this intuition.

Example 1: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-1, 0)$, $x = (-2, -1)$. In this case, y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. The relation between x and z is Southwest.

Example 2: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-100, 0)$, $x = (-101, -1)$. Here, y is very far to the west of z, and x is slightly to the southwest of y. The relation between x and z, for all practical purposes, is West.

Example 3: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-1, 0)$, $x = (-1.1, -100)$. Here, y is West of z, and x is far to the south-southwest of y. The relation between x and z, for all practical purposes, is South.

Example 4: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-10, 0)$, $x = (-12, -8)$. Here, y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. The relation between x and z is Southwest.

So it seems like the possible relations between x and z could be Southwest, or West, or South, depending on the exact positions.

But actually, no, this is not right. In Example 2, x is at $(-101, -1)$ and z is at $(0, 0)$, so x is to the southwest of z, not just to the west. Similarly, in Example 3, x is at $(-1.1, -100)$ and z is at $(0, 0)$, so x is to the southwest of z, not just to the south.

In fact, if y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y, then x is always Southwest of z. This is because x is both to the west and to the south of y, and y is to the west of z. So x is to the west of z (by transitivity of the "to the west of" relation), and x is to the south of y, which has the same vertical coordinate as z, so x is to the south of z. Thus, x is both to the west and to the south of z, i.e., x is to the southwest of z.

So the relation between x and z is uniquely Southwest.

Actually, I just had a different thought. When we say that the composition of "West" and "South" could be "Southwest" or "South" or "West", we're saying that if y is South of z, and x is West of y, then x could be Southwest, South, or West of z, depending on the exact positions. This is because, if we're at z and go south to y, and then west to x, our overall displacement could be mostly southward, mostly westward, or roughly equal in both directions.

But in our problem, we have that y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. So if we're at z and go west to y, and then southwest to x, our overall displacement is southwestward. So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Just to be even more sure, let me work through a couple of examples, where this time I'll actually compute the direction from x to z.

Example 1: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-1, 0)$, $x = (-2, -1)$. The direction from x to z is $\vec{xz} = (0, 0) - (-2, -1) = (2, 1)$, which is northeastward. So z is Northeast of x, which means that x is Southwest of z.

Example 2: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-100, 0)$, $x = (-101, -1)$. The direction from x to z is $\vec{xz} = (0, 0) - (-101, -1) = (101, 1)$, which is northeastward, though mostly eastward. So z is Northeast of x, which means that x is Southwest of z.

Example 3: $z = (0, 0)$, $y = (-1, 0)$, $x = (-1.1, -100)$. The direction from x to z is $\vec{xz} = (0, 0) - (-1.1, -100) = (1.1, 100)$, which is northeastward, though mostly northward. So z is Northeast of x, which means that x is Southwest of z.

So in all of these examples, the relation between x and z is Southwest. I can't see how it could be anything else.

Actually, I was a bit confused earlier. If we are given that y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y, and we want to find the possible relations between x and z, we're essentially asking: if we go east from y to z, and northeast from x to y, what's the overall direction from x to z? The overall direction is from x to z is northeastward, which means that z is Northeast of x, which means that x is Southwest of z.

Actually, I'm really overthinking this problem. Let me just draw it out:

If y is West of z, then y is directly to the left of z. If x is Southwest of y, then x is down and to the left from y. So if we place z at the origin, then y is somewhere on the negative x-axis, and x is somewhere in the third quadrant. This means that x is to the southwest of z.

So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Now I realize that there has been a shift in perspective. I've been using the direction relation in the sense of "to go from point A to point B, go in direction X". But the problem is using the direction relation in the sense of "point B is in direction X of point A". So when the problem says "y is West of z", it means that, to go from z to y, go west. And when the problem says "x is Southwest of y", it means that, to go from y to x, go southwest.

So, if y is west of z, and x is southwest of y, then to go from z to x, first go west to y, then go southwest to x. This overall path goes west and south, i.e., southwest. So x is southwest of z.

So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, let's just use the opposite convention to avoid confusion. When I say "y is West of z", I mean that, to go from y to z, go east. And when I say "x is Southwest of y", I mean that, to go from x to y, go northeast.

So, if y is west of z, and x is southwest of y, then to go from x to z, first go northeast to y, then go east to z. This overall path goes east and north, i.e., northeast. So z is northeast of x, which means that x is southwest of z.

So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, to make sure that I'm being precise, let me be explicit. When the problem states "region x is Southwest of region y", it means that, from the perspective of y, region x is in the southwest direction. Equivalently, to go from y to x, go southwest. Equivalently, to go from x to y, go northeast.

Similarly, when the problem states "region y is West of region z", it means that, from the perspective of z, region y is in the west direction. Equivalently, to go from z to y, go west. Equivalently, to go from y to z, go east.

Given that y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y, I want to determine the possible relations between x and z, i.e., from the perspective of z, in which direction is x?

From z, I go west to y. From y, I go southwest to x. The overall direction from z to x is southwest. So x is Southwest of z.

So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, I think my confusion stemmed from thinking of the composition of directions like "North" and "East". If y is North of z, and x is East of y, then x could be Northeast, North, or East of z, depending on the exact distances. But this is because "North" and "East" are orthogonal directions. The composition of directions like "Southwest" and "West" is more constrained.

Let me verify my reasoning with another example. If y is West of z, and x is Northwest of y, then what's the relation between x and z? From z, I go west to y. From y, I go northwest to x. The overall direction from z to x is west and north, i.e., northwest. So x is Northwest of z.

And one more: If y is West of z, and x is South of y, then what's the relation between x and z? From z, I go west to y. From y, I go south to x. The overall direction from z to x is west and south, i.e., southwest. So x is Southwest of z.

These examples confirm my reasoning.

So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually wait a minute, I'm getting confused again. So many shifts of perspective.

Let's start completely from scratch. We are given:
- Region y is West of region z.
- Region x is Southwest of region y.

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Step 1: Let's establish the positions of the regions in absolute terms. For convenience, I'll place region z at the origin, i.e., $z = (0, 0)$.

Step 2: If region y is West of region z, then, from the perspective of z, region y is in the west direction. This means that $y = (y_x, y_y)$ where $y_x < 0$ and $y_y = 0$. (The $y_y = 0$ part follows from the fact that "West" means directly to the west, with no north or south component.)

Step 3: If region x is Southwest of region y, then, from the perspective of y, region x is in the southwest direction. This means that $x = (x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < y_x$ and $x_y < y_y = 0$. So we have $x_x < y_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$.

Step 4: Now, from the perspective of z, in which direction is region x? We have $x = (x_x, x_y)$ where $x_x < 0$ and $x_y < 0$. This means that region x is in the southwest direction from region z. So the relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

OK, I think I have the correct reasoning this time, and I'm confident that the answer is Southwest.

Actually, let me double-check that I'm correctly interpreting the problem statement. The problem asks for the *possible* relations between region x and region z. I've been assuming that the relation between x and z is uniquely determined, and my analysis suggests that it is. But the wording of the problem suggests that there might be multiple possible relations. So let me try to think of a scenario where the relation between x and z might be something other than Southwest.

Upon reflection, I think I was confused because I was overthinking the problem. The relation between x and z is indeed uniquely determined to be Southwest. The problem is asking for the possible relations, but there's only one possible relation in this case. I was also confused because I kept going back and forth between two perspective's : "region x is Southwest of region y" versus "to go from x to y, go Northeast". But these are equivalent and correct perspectives. I've verified my reasoning with various examples, and they all confirm that the relation between x and z is Southwest.

So my final answer is that the relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

Actually, let me try one more approach. Let's define a Cartesian coordinate system, with the origin at (0, 0), positive x to the east and positive y to the north.

If region z is at the origin (0, 0), and region y is to the west of it, then region y is at some coordinate (-a, 0) where a > 0.

Now, if region x is to the southwest of region y, then region x is at some coordinate (-a-b, -c) where b, c > 0.

So the vector from z to x is (-a-b, -c). This is pointing southwest. So, from the perspective of z, region x is in the southwest direction.

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

Actually, I just realized that I've been using a point-based model, where regions are represented by points (e.g., their centroids). But the problem is about regions, which have spatial extent. So I should be using a model where regions are represented by sets of points, and the direction relations are defined accordingly.

But, even with a region-based model, the relation between x and z would still be Southwest. This is because, if y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y, then all points in x are to the southwest of all points in z.

So my final answer is that the relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

Actually, let me reconsider the problem using a region-based model. Specifically, let me use the RCC-8 (Region Connection Calculus 8) model, which includes the following base relations: DC (Disconnected), EC (Externally Connected), PO (Partially Overlapping), TPP (Tangential Proper Part), NTPP (Non-Tangential Proper Part), TPPi (Tangential Proper Part Inverse), NTPPi (Non-Tangential Proper Part Inverse), and EQ (Equal).

But no, this doesn't make sense because the problem is about cardinal directions, not topological relations. Let me try a different approach.

Actually, I should be using a region-based model for cardinal directions, such as the cone-based model or the MBR-based model.

In the cone-based model, the space around a region is divided into cones corresponding to the cardinal directions. If region A is in the "West" cone of region B, then we say that A is West of B.

In the MBR-based model, the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a region is used, and direction relations are defined based on the relative positions of the MBRs.

Let me try using the MBR-based model. If y is West of z, then the MBR of y is entirely to the west of the MBR of z. If x is Southwest of y, then the MBR of x is entirely to the southwest of the MBR of y. Given these, the MBR of x is entirely to the southwest of the MBR of z, so x is Southwest of z.

So, using the MBR-based model, the relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

I'm confident that the answer is Southwest, but let me just double-check that I haven't missed anything.

Actually, one thing I haven't considered is the possibility that the regions might overlap. But this isn't relevant for the current problem because the given direction relations (West, Southwest) imply that the regions are disjoint.

OK I think I'm massively overthinking this problem. Let me take a step back and think:

1. We have three regions, x, y, and z.
2. We are told that y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. 
3. We want to find the possible directions from z to x, i.e., the possible relations between x and z.

Now, if we draw this out, we place z at the origin, y is to the west of z, and x is to the southwest of y. So x is even further to the west of z than y is, and x is also to the south of y, which has the same vertical coordinate as z, so x is to the south of z. Thus, x is both to the west and to the south of z, i.e., x is to the southwest of z.

So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Let's wrap up:

Given:
- Region y is West of region z.
- Region x is Southwest of region y.

To find: The possible relations between region x and region z.

The relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine what cardinal direction relation could exist between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is Southwest of region y
- Region y is West of region z

To solve this systematically, I'll track the relative positions:

When y is West of z, y is directly to the left of z (with no north/south displacement).

When x is Southwest of y, x is both to the left and below y.

Combining these relations:
- x must be to the left of y, which is already to the left of z, so x is definitely to the left of z
- x must be below y, which is at the same vertical level as z, so x is definitely below z

When a region is both to the left of and below another region, it is Southwest of that region.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: Southwest
