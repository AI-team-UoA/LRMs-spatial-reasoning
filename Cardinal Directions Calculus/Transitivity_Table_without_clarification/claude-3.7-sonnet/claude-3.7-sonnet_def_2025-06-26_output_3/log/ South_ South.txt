PROMPT: Let  South and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's denote $x \mathbin{S} y$ to mean that region $x$ is south of region $y$. We're given that $x \mathbin{S} y$ and $y \mathbin{S} z$. We want to determine the possible relations between $x$ and $z$.

Cardinal direction relations typically have certain properties. For instance, if $x$ is south of $y$, then $y$ is north of $x$. Also, cardinal direction relations are often defined in terms of the bounding boxes of regions: if the entirety of the bounding box of $x$ is to the south of the bounding box of $y$, then $x$ is south of $y$.

So we have $x \mathbin{S} y$ and $y \mathbin{S} z$. This means that $x$ is to the south of $y$, and $y$ is to the south of $z$. If we consider the north-south axis, we have that $x$ is "more south" than $y$, and $y$ is "more south" than $z$. By transitivity, $x$ is "more south" than $z$, i.e., $x \mathbin{S} z$.

So we have that $x \mathbin{S} z$, i.e., $x$ is South of $z$.

Actually, let me re-examine the definitions of cardinal direction relations more carefully. A directional relation like "South" typically means that the entirety of one region is to the south of the entirety of the other region. So when we say $x \mathbin{S} y$, we mean that the entirety of region $x$ is to the south of the entirety of region $y$.

Given that $x \mathbin{S} y$ and $y \mathbin{S} z$, we know that $x$ is entirely to the south of $y$ and $y$ is entirely to the south of $z$. This means that $x$ must be entirely to the south of $z$ as well. So we indeed have that $x \mathbin{S} z$, i.e., $x$ is South of $z$.

Wait, let me check: are the definitions of cardinal directions always defined in terms of bounding boxes? For complex regions, the bounding box is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the region. The direction relations are then defined in terms of these bounding boxes.

But hang on, I need to consider the definitions more carefully. In qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations can be defined in different ways. One common approach is to use bounding boxes or minimal bounding rectangles (MBRs) and then compare the projections of these boxes onto the coordinate axes.

Actually, let me reconsider the problem from the beginning, using the semantics based on bounding boxes.

Let me define the bounding box of a region as the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that completely contains the region.

For two regions $x$ and $y$, let's denote their bounding boxes as $bbox(x)$ and $bbox(y)$. We say that $x$ is South of $y$ if the northernmost point of $bbox(x)$ is to the south of the southernmost point of $bbox(y)$. Similarly, $y$ is South of $z$ if the northernmost point of $bbox(y)$ is to the south of the southernmost point of $bbox(z)$.

Given $x \mathbin{S} y$ and $y \mathbin{S} z$, we know that the northernmost point of $bbox(x)$ is to the south of the southernmost point of $bbox(y)$, and the northernmost point of $bbox(y)$ is to the south of the southernmost point of $bbox(z)$. From this, we can infer that the northernmost point of $bbox(x)$ is to the south of the southernmost point of $bbox(z)$. This means that $x \mathbin{S} z$, or $x$ is South of $z$.

So the answer is South.

Actually, I think I should use the notation more carefully. Let's call the south relation $S$. So what we have is $S(x, y)$ and $S(y, z)$, and we want to find the relation between $x$ and $z$.

Given that $S(x, y)$ and $S(y, z)$, we can infer that $S(x, z)$ based on the transitivity of the south relation in the standard cardinal direction model.

Wait, let me think about this a bit more. I'm considering cardinal direction relations between regions based on the bounding box model. In this model, a region is approximated by its bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing the region with sides parallel to the coordinate axes). Then, direction relations are defined based on the relative positions of these bounding boxes.

For South relation in particular, a region $x$ is South of a region $y$ if the northernmost point of $x$ is below (to the south of) the southernmost point of $y$. There's no overlap in the north-south direction.

Now, given that $x$ is South of $y$ and $y$ is South of $z$, it implies that:
1. The northernmost point of $x$ is below the southernmost point of $y$.
2. The northernmost point of $y$ is below the southernmost point of $z$.

From these two, we can infer that the northernmost point of $x$ is below the southernmost point of $z$, which means $x$ is South of $z$.

So, the possible relation between $x$ and $z$ is South.

Hmm but wait, let's think even more carefully. I'm trying to recall how cardinal direction relations are defined for regions. There are different frameworks, but a common one is the cone-based or projection-based model, where we talk about whether a region is partially or fully to the north, south, east, west, etc. of another.

In the projection-based model, "South" means that the entirety of one region is to the south of the entirety of the other. This is what I've been reasoning with.

But there's also the 9-intersection model, which divides the space around a reference region into 9 tiles: North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, and the region itself (often called "Same" or "Equal"). If region x is South of region y and region y is South of region z, what can we say about x and z?

In the 9-intersection model, "South" means that the entirety of one region is to the south of the reference region. Given x is South of y and y is South of z, it implies that the entirety of x is to the south of y and the entirety of y is to the south of z. From this, we can infer that the entirety of x is to the south of z, which means x is South of z in the 9-intersection model as well.

Actually, I think some of these "cardinal direction calculi" might also have a Bounding Box relation, where the regions have some overlap or one is contained in the other. But this doesn't apply in our case, because we're told explicitly that the relations are South.

OK, I'm now satisfied that the answer is South. Let's double-check by considering an example.

Imagine a number line representing the north-south axis, with north being the positive direction. Let's place the regions as follows:

z: [7, 10]
y: [3, 5]
x: [0, 2]

Here, the northernmost point of x is 2, which is below the southernmost point of y (which is 3). So, x is South of y.

Similarly, the northernmost point of y is 5, which is below the southernmost point of z (which is 7). So, y is South of z.

From this, we can observe that the northernmost point of x (which is 2) is below the southernmost point of z (which is 7). Hence, x is South of z.

But let me try to think of another way to approach this. Actually, I think there's some confusion arising from the ambiguity in the definition. "South" relation and "south" orientation are related but not the same. Let me clarify:

When we say "x is south of y", we're describing the orientation of x with respect to y. This doesn't necessarily mean that x and y are completely separated in the north-south direction. But when we say "x is South of y", we're using the cardinal direction relation "South", which usually implies a specific relationship in a formal model like the 9-intersection or bounding box model.

Let me go with the standard understanding of "x is South of y" as meaning that the bounding box of x is completely to the south of the bounding box of y with no overlap in the north-south direction.

Given "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", it means that the bounding box of x is completely to the south of the bounding box of y, and the bounding box of y is completely to the south of the bounding box of z. It follows that the bounding box of x is completely to the south of the bounding box of z, which means "x is South of z".

I think the confusing thing is that in my original approach, I was mixing orientations and specific directional relations.

In summary, if "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", then "x is South of z".

Actually, let me now think if there are other possible relations as well, in the answer space. Other possibilities might arise if "South" doesn't have the strict definition I've been assuming. For instance, if "South" can also mean "partially to the South", then other relations might be possible.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. In most common spatial reasoning systems, "South" specifically refers to a cardinal direction relation where one region is strictly to the south of another (no overlap in the north-south direction). Given the transitive nature of "South", if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x is South of z. There's no ambiguity here.

So, the answer is South.

Actually, let me try to be even more precise. I'll refer to cardinal direction relations as defined in the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) combined with the 9-intersection model.

In this model, the "South" relation means that the entirety of one region is to the south of the entirety of the other. If x is South of y and y is South of z, it implies that the entirety of x is to the south of y and the entirety of y is to the south of z. From this, we can deduce that the entirety of x is to the south of z, which means x is South of z.

So, the answer remains South.

Wait, let me clarify further. I'm referring to "South" as a basic directional relation, not as a specialized RCC relation. I haven't seen a spatial reasoning system that integrates both RCC and cardinal directions. So please ignore the mention of RCC. The reasoning still holds: If x is South of y and y is South of z, then x is South of z.

Alright, I think I've exhausted this problem from various angles, and I'm confidently sticking with South as the answer.

Actually wait. Let me take a step back. I've been making assumptions about the meaning of the South relation based on common interpretations in qualitative spatial reasoning. However, let's make sure I'm not missing any nuances.

The problem states, "If region x is South of region y and region y is South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" The phrasing suggests that there might be multiple relations that could hold between x and z.

I've been arguing that x must be South of z due to the transitivity of the South relation. But let's check if there are any cases where this might not be the only possible relation.

Ok, I think I see the problem with my current reasoning. Certain cardinal direction relations, like South, can be ambiguous, as they can be interpreted as "directly south", "slightly to the southeast", or "slightly to the southwest". I think the reason the problem is asking about potential relations is to account for this.

Actually, no, I think I'm still over-thinking. In standard qualitative spatial reasoning, "South" is unambiguous and refers to a specific cardinal direction relation. If it was meant to be ambiguous, the problem would have specified so.

Let's be very clear about what South means. Typically, in spatial reasoning, South is a directional relation such that if region a is South of region b, then the northernmost point of a is to the south of the southernmost point of b. This creates a clear separation between the two regions in the north-south direction.

Given this definition, and the premises that "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", we can deduce that "x is South of z". This is because:
1. The northernmost point of x is to the south of the southernmost point of y.
2. The northernmost point of y is to the south of the southernmost point of z.
3. By transitivity, the northernmost point of x is to the south of the southernmost point of z, which means "x is South of z".

This logic is sound and I believe the answer is South.

Actually, it seems like there's still a gap in my understanding. Let me consider the directional relations in the 2D plane.

In the 2D plane, regions have both latitude (north-south) and longitude (east-west) dimensions. When we say "x is South of y", we're primarily making a statement about the north-south dimension, but it doesn't constrain the east-west dimension as strictly.

For instance, region x could be to the South and slightly to the East of region y. In such a case, x could be considered South, Southwest, or Southeast of y.

Given this understanding, if "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", what are the possible relations between x and z? In the north-south dimension, x is definitely to the south of z due to transitivity. But in the east-west dimension, there's more flexibility:

- If x is directly South of y and y is directly South of z, then x is directly South of z.
- If x is to the South and slightly to the East of y, and y is to the South and slightly to the East of z, then x is to the South and more to the East of z. Depending on the exact positions, this could be interpreted as South, Southeast, or East of z.
- Similarly, if both directions involve the West, x could be South, Southwest, or West of z.
- And there are mixed cases where x is to the South and slightly to the East of y, but y is to the South and slightly to the West of z (or vice versa). In such cases, the east-west orientation of x relative to z could go either way.

OK, let me try to think about this more precisely. Actually, I think "South" as a cardinal direction relation is often defined in a way that constrains both the north-south and east-west dimensions. Specifically, "x is South of y" means:

1. The northernmost point of x is to the south of the southernmost point of y (i.e., x is to the south of y).
2. The westernmost point of x is to the east of the westernmost point of y OR the easternmost point of x is to the west of the easternmost point of y (i.e., x has some overlap with y in the east-west dimension).

This is the projection-based approach to cardinal directions.

Given this definition, if "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", can we always say that "x is South of z"? 

Let's check:
1. From "x is South of y", we know that x is to the south of y and has some overlap with y in the east-west dimension.
2. From "y is South of z", we know that y is to the south of z and has some overlap with z in the east-west dimension.

From these, we can infer that x is to the south of z. But will x always have some overlap with z in the east-west dimension? Not necessarily. If the overlap between x and y is in a different portion of the east-west dimension than the overlap between y and z, then x and z might not have any overlap.

For instance, imagine a case where x is to the southeast of y and y is to the southwest of z. In this setup, x is still to the south of z, but it's also to the east of z, and there might not be any east-west overlap. In such a case, "x is Southeast of z" would be more accurate than "x is South of z".

Actually, the defintion that I'm referring to (with the overlap) actually would specify simply "South" if x is to the South of z. But if x is both to the South and to the East of z (and doesn't overlap in the East-West axis), we would say x is "Southeast" of z.

Wait, I think I'm still not being clear enough on the definitions. Let me re-define the cardinal direction relations:

For any two regions a and b, the relation between them is:
- North (N): a is entirely to the north of b.
- South (S): a is entirely to the south of b.
- East (E): a is entirely to the east of b.
- West (W): a is entirely to the west of b.
- Northeast (NE): a is entirely to the north and east of b.
- Northwest (NW): a is entirely to the north and west of b.
- Southeast (SE): a is entirely to the south and east of b.
- Southwest (SW): a is entirely to the south and west of b.
- Bounding Box (BB): a and b have some overlap (one could be inside the other or they could merely intersect).

Given these definitions, if "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", we know that x is entirely to the south of y and y is entirely to the south of z. From this, we can infer that x is entirely to the south of z. But what about the east-west dimension?

If we're only given that "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", without additional constraints on the east-west dimension, then x could be to the east of z, to the west of z, or have some overlap with z in the east-west dimension. So, the possible relations between x and z could be South, Southeast, or Southwest.

Actually, maybe I should backtrack. The problem says "If region x is South of region y and region y is South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" The way the problem is phrased, it's assuming "South" has a specific definition. If "South" means that a region is entirely to the south of another, with no constraint on the east-west dimension, then if "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", we can definitely say that "x is South of z". But we don't have information on the east-west relation, so other relations like Southeast or Southwest could be possible depending on where x is relative to z in the east-west dimension.

Actually, I think the South relation is even more refined. From a bit more reflection, I think I've been implicitly assuming a bounding box model of cardinal direction relations. Let me restate it:

The bounding box model divides the space around a reference region y into 9 tiles, using the bounding box of y as the center. 
Given region x, the relation of x to y is:
- North (N): x is completely in the north tile.
- South (S): x is completely in the south tile.
- East (E): x is completely in the east tile.
- West (W): x is completely in the west tile.
- Northeast (NE): x is completely in the northeast tile.
- Northwest (NW): x is completely in the northwest tile.
- Southeast (SE): x is completely in the southeast tile.
- Southwest (SW): x is completely in the southwest tile.
- Bounding Box (BB): x is in the center tile.

With this definition, if "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", does it necessarily mean "x is South of z"? Yes, it does, because the south tile of y is entirely to the south of the south tile of z, so if x is in the south tile of y, it must also be in the south tile of z.

Actually, I think I'm making this too complicated. The problem is asking which could be the possible relations between x and z, not which must be the relation. Given the premises, there's a clear constraint on the north-south dimension (x must be to the south of z), but no clear constraint on the east-west dimension. So, the possible relations are South, Southeast, and Southwest. This is the answer I will stick with.

Actually, I think what I'm missing is if the relation is "South," that is defined in cardinal directions. So if x is South of y, then x is completely to the south of y (and not to the east or west). So the east-west axis can vary. And when a region is strictly to the south, it's also not to the east or west. So South, Southeast, and Southwest are all possibilities. And similarly for the other directions.

So to recap, if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x is to the south of z, but the east-west relationship is not fixed. So possible relations from our answer space include South, Southwest, or Southeast.

But wait, I should be even more precise. 

Actually, I think the standard definition of "South" in cardinal direction calculus refers to the case where region x is entirely to the south of region y, without constraining the east-west relationship. This is different from "Southeast", which means x is entirely to the south and entirely to the east of y. The answer space provided in the problem makes it clearer since it includes both basic cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) and combined directions (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest).

Given this understanding, if "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", we can deduce the following:
1. x is entirely to the south of y.
2. y is entirely to the south of z.
3. By transitivity, x is entirely to the south of z.

The east-west relationship between x and z is not fixed based on the premises. So, possible relations from our answer space could be:
- South: If x has significant overlap with z in the east-west dimension.
- Southeast: If x is entirely to the east of z.
- Southwest: If x is entirely to the west of z.

But here's where I think I'm making a mistake. In the answer space, "South" refers to the case where x is entirely to the south of z, with no constraint on the east-west direction. So, "South" is the primary relation that can hold. The relations "Southeast" and "Southwest" are only possible if x is also entirely to the east or entirely to the west of z, respectively.

Since the problem is asking which could be the possible relations, and we only know that x is to the south of z (but not necessarily to the east or west), the possible relations are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Actually, let's try one more approach. Let me imagine this problem geometrically, with regions represented by bounding boxes. If I place region z at the top, y in the middle, and x at the bottom, what's the relationship of x to z?

Clearly, x is below z (to the south of z) because y is below z and x is below y. But what about the east-west relationship? I can slide x left or right without violating the premises.

If I slide x to the left, it might become entirely to the west of z. In that case, x is to the southwest of z.
If I slide x to the right, it might become entirely to the east of z. In that case, x is to the southeast of z.
If I don't slide x much, it can still have overlap with z in the east-west dimension. In that case, x is to the south of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

But actually, I think South is the only relation that's strictly implied by the premises. However, the problem isn't asking which relation must hold, but which relations could potentially hold.

OK, I think the crux of the problem lies in understanding what the question is asking and the semantics of the directional relations. The problem states, "If region x is South of region y and region y is South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Let's first clarify the directional relation "South" in the context of regions. The usual understanding is that region x is South of region y if x is entirely to the south of y in the north-south dimension, but there's no constraint on the east-west dimension. This means x can be to the east of y, to the west of y, or have some overlap with y in the east-west dimension, but it's still considered to be "South" of y as long as it's entirely to the south.

Given this definition, if x is South of y and y is South of z, we can infer that x is entirely to the south of z. But the premises don't constrain the east-west relationship between x and z. Therefore, x could be:
- South of z: If x has some overlap with z in the east-west dimension.
- Southeast of z: If x is entirely to the east of z.
- Southwest of z: If x is entirely to the west of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z from the given answer space are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Let me see if I can further clarify. In cardinal direction reasoning, the 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, BB) form a partition of the 2D space around a reference region. Each point in space belongs to exactly one of these tiles. So when I say "region x is South of region y", I mean the entirety of region x falls within the south tile of region y.

Given this understanding, if x is entirely in the south tile of y and y is entirely in the south tile of z, can we determine the tile of z where x resides? Definitely, x will be to the south of z. But the east-west relationship depends on the exact positions. 

OK let me try to draw it out:

```
            +---------+
            |    z    |
            +---------+
                 |
                 v
            +---------+
            |    y    |
            +---------+
                 |
                 v
            +---------+
            |    x    |
            +---------+
```

Here, region x is directly below y, and y is directly below z. In this case, x is South of z.

But we can shift x to the left or right:

```
            +---------+
            |    z    |
            +---------+
                 |
                 v
            +---------+
            |    y    |
            +---------+
                 |
                 v
         +---------+
         |    x    |
         +---------+
```

Now, region x is to the west of where z is, but still to the south. In this case, x is Southwest of z.

Similarly, we can shift x to the right, making it Southeast of z.

So, based on the premises, x is definitely to the south of z, but it can be South, Southeast, or Southwest depending on the exact east-west relationship.

Actually, I realize that I'm operating under the assumption that South is transitive, and that the premises have more structure than what was explicitly given in the problem. South, as a directional relation, is typically transitive, but I should be clear about this.

In a formal reasoning system for cardinal direction relations, transitivity is a well-established property. If South is defined as "entirely to the south" (in the north-south dimension), then it's transitive: if A is South of B and B is South of C, then A is South of C. This is because "entirely to the south" is a strict ordering in the north-south dimension.

So, the premises "x is South of y" and "y is South of z" do imply that x is to the south of z. But the east-west relationship remains unconstrained, allowing for South, Southeast, and Southwest as possible relations between x and z.

So, the answer is South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Actually, let me reread the prompt. It asks for a cardinal direction relation, and the answer choices are North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box. 

So it doesn't seem to be asking which combination of directions, just asking which of the above could be the relation between region x and region z.

In that case, as I've been reasoning, the possible relations are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Actually, looking back at the question, it's asking "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" So it's asking about the set of possible relations, not a single relation. I think the intended answer is indeed "South, Southeast, Southwest", which is the set of all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z based on the premises.

No, let me be even more precise. The prompt is asking "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" It says "the possible answer can be one or more of these: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box." So I need to choose one or more of these cardinal directions that are possible relations between x and z, given the premises.

As I've been reasoning, based on the premises, x is definitely to the south of z. But the east-west relationship can vary. So, the possible relations are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

My final answer is: South, Southeast, Southwest.

Actually, let's try to think about this one more time. The problem refers to "South" and "South" as "cardinal direction relations," which are formal qualitative spatial relations. The question is fairly straightforward. "If region x is South of region y and region y is South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Based on the formalization of cardinal direction relations, if "region x is South of region y" and "region y is South of region z", then we can infer the following:
1. Region x is entirely to the south of region y.
2. Region y is entirely to the south of region z.
3. By transitivity of the South relation (which is a standard property in cardinal direction calculus), region x is entirely to the south of region z.

So, region x is definitely to the south of region z. But the east-west relationship between x and z is not constrained by the premises. Depending on the east-west positions, region x could be:
- South of region z (if it has some overlap with z in the east-west dimension)
- Southeast of region z (if it's entirely to the east of z)
- Southwest of region z (if it's entirely to the west of z)

Given the answer space and the question's wording, the possible relations between region x and region z are: South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Actually, let me think a bit more carefully: can x be both South and Southeast to z? Or South and Southwest?

Let's clarify the semantics of cardinal direction relations:
- South (S): x is entirely to the south of z. This does not preclude x from being to the east or west of z.
- Southeast (SE): x is entirely to the south and entirely to the east of z.
- Southwest (SW): x is entirely to the south and entirely to the west of z.

From these definitions, it's clear that "South" is a broader relation than "Southeast" or "Southwest". If x is Southeast of z, it is also South of z. Similarly, if x is Southwest of z, it is also South of z. However, if x is strictly South of z (with some east-west overlap), it can't also be Southeast or Southwest of z.

So, to be precise, if the premises only tell us that x is to the south of z (without constraining the east-west dimension), then the possible relations from the answer space are:
- South, if x has some overlap with z in the east-west dimension.
- Southeast, if x is entirely to the east of z.
- Southwest, if x is entirely to the west of z.

Ok, but I think the problem is asking which of the relations {North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box} could hold between x and z. It's clear that North, Northeast, East, Northwest, West, and Bounding Box are not possible based on the premises.

That leaves South, Southeast, and Southwest. The premises imply that x is to the south of z, but the east-west relationship is unconstrained. So, the possible relations are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

But actually, let me think: given the definitions, are these relations mutually exclusive? Can a region be both South and Southeast of another region? Or South and Southwest? I said above that they are not, and I think this is correct for the standard formulation.

But I don't think we can pick multiple options. The problem statement asks "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", and specifies that "the possible answer can be one or more of these". This phrasing suggests that we're looking for the set of relations that could potentially hold, but on the understanding that only one of these can be the real relation.

OK from the semantics of the problem, I think the intended meaning is: given the premises, which of the relations in the answer space could potentially hold between region x and region z?

The premises tell us that x is to the south of z, but don't constrain the east-west relationship. So, the possible relations are:
- South, if x has some overlap with z in the east-west dimension.
- Southeast, if x is entirely to the east of z.
- Southwest, if x is entirely to the west of z.

The answer is: South, Southeast, and Southwest.

So I am sticking to "South, Southeast, Southwest" as my answer, which comprises all the possible relations that could hold between region x and region z based on the premises.

Actually, I'm reading more and getting confused again. Let's be totally precise. Formally speaking, we typically partition 2D space into 9 regions: 4 quadrants (NE, NW, SE, SW), 4 half-axes (N, E, S, W), and the center (Bounding Box). These regions are mutually exclusive. So, a point can be in exactly one of these regions. For a region that spans multiple points, it can span multiple direction regions, but even in that case, the relation "A is South of B" typically means that the entirety of A is to the south of B.

Given this formulation, and the premises "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", we can infer that x is South of z.

I'm overcomplicating this. The answer is "South". The premises imply that x is entirely to the south of z, which means the relation between x and z is "South".

Actually, no. I think the misunderstanding lies in the distinction between the concepts of "cardinal direction relation" versus "cardinal direction."

A cardinal direction is simply a conceptual or physical direction: North, East, South, West, etc.

But a cardinal direction relation between two regions is more nuanced. It depends on how the regions are spatially arranged. For instance:
- Region A is North of Region B: This means that Region A is entirely to the north of Region B. It doesn't constrain the east-west relationship.
- Region A is Northeast of Region B: This means that Region A is entirely to the north and entirely to the east of Region B.

The premises state that "region x is South of region y" and "region y is South of region z". This means x is entirely to the south of y, and y is entirely to the south of z. From this, we can infer that x is entirely to the south of z. But the east-west relationship between x and z is not constrained.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z from the given answer space are:
- South, if x has some east-west overlap with z.
- Southeast, if x is entirely to the east of z.
- Southwest, if x is entirely to the west of z.

The answer is: South, Southeast, and Southwest.

OK, no, let me go back to first principles. 

The cardinal direction relations in 2D space are typically divided into 9 basic relations, based on the bounding box of a reference region:
1. North (N)
2. Northeast (NE)
3. East (E)
4. Southeast (SE)
5. South (S)
6. Southwest (SW)
7. West (W)
8. Northwest (NW)
9. Bounding Box (BB) or Equal (EQ)

These relations are defined based on the position of one region relative to the bounding box of another. The relation "South" means that the entire region is to the south of the bounding box of the reference region. Similarly, "Southeast" means the entire region is to the southeast of the bounding box of the reference region.

Given the premises "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", we know:
1. x is entirely to the south of y.
2. y is entirely to the south of z.

It's a basic property of the "South" relation that it's transitive. So, from the premises, we can infer that x is entirely to the south of z, which means the relation "South" holds between x and z.

Now, can the relation "Southeast" also hold between x and z? Only if x is entirely to the east of z, in addition to being entirely to the south. But the premises don't provide any information about the east-west relationship between x and z. So, while "Southeast" is a possible relation (as is "Southwest"), we can't deduce it purely from the premises.

Similarly, can the relation "Southwest" hold between x and z? Only if x is entirely to the west of z. Again, the premises don't provide this information.

The problem is asking which relations could possibly hold, not which relations necessarily hold. From the premises, the only relation we can deduce with certainty is "South". However, since the east-west relationship is unconstrained, the relations "Southeast" and "Southwest" are also possible, depending on the specific east-west arrangement of x and z.

So, the possible relations are: South, Southeast, and Southwest.

OK, to be super duper clear: the premises tell us that x is South of y and y is South of z. We can infer that x is entirely to the south of z. Depending on the east-west arrangement (which is not constrained by the premises), x could be:
- South of z (if x has some east-west overlap with z).
- Southeast of z (if x is entirely to the east of z).
- Southwest of z (if x is entirely to the west of z).

So, the possible relations from the answer space are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Actually, let me try to draw a concrete counterexample to the idea that x must be South of z, not Southeast or Southwest. This will clarify if I really think these three relations are possible.

Imagine a grid system where north is up, east is right, south is down, and west is left. Let's place the regions as follows:

```
+--+--+--+--+--+
|           z  |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|              |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|     y        |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|              |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x           |
+--+--+--+--+--+
```

Here, region x is to the south of region y, and region y is to the south of region z. But region x is also to the west of region z. So, the relation between x and z is "Southwest".

Similarly, I can construct examples where the relation is "Southeast" or "South".

So, the possible relations between x and z are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Alright, so the answer is South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Hmm, what's the defintional difference? Is region X being Southeast of region Y, the same as saying that region X is South of and East of region Y?

Let me re-evaluate. In the standard formulation of cardinal direction relations, "Southeast" means a region is entirely to the southeast, not overlapping in either the north-south or east-west axes. Similarly, "South" means a region is entirely to the south, but can overlap in the east-west axis. These are distinct and mutually exclusive relations.

Let's clarify with an example. Imagine a grid system:

```
+--+--+--+--+--+
|           z  |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|              |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|     y        |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|              |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x           |
+--+--+--+--+--+
```

As described, region x is to the southwest of region z. It's not "South" of z because it's also to the west, and "South" requires overlap in the east-west axis.

But let me try a different configuration:

```
+--+--+--+--+--+
|        z     |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|              |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|     y        |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|              |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|     x        |
+--+--+--+--+--+
```

Now, region x is directly below region z. In this case, the relation is "South".

And another:

```
+--+--+--+--+--+
|  z           |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|              |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|     y        |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|              |
+--+--+--+--+--+
|           x  |
+--+--+--+--+--+
```

In this configuration, region x is to the southeast of region z.

Given the premises "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", the relation between x and z could be South, Southeast, or Southwest, depending on the east-west arrangement.

So, the possible relations are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Actually, let me re-explain once more. I think I've been conflating some concepts.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, I believe the relation "South" means that a region is entirely to the south of another, without constraining the east-west relationship. That is, the region could be to the southeast, directly south, or to the southwest, but the relation is still referred to as "South" because the primary characteristic is that it's to the south.

However, there are more specific relations like "Southeast" and "Southwest", which provide additional constraints on the east-west relationship. If a region is "Southeast" of another, it's entirely to the south and entirely to the east. Similarly, if it's "Southwest", it's entirely to the south and entirely to the west.

Given the premises "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", we know for certain that x is entirely to the south of z (by transitivity of the "South" relation). But the premises don't provide any constraint on the east-west relationship between x and z. x could be to the east of z, to the west of z, or have some east-west overlap with z. So, the possible relations from the answer space are:
- South, if x has some east-west overlap with z.
- Southeast, if x is entirely to the east of z.
- Southwest, if x is entirely to the west of z.

So, the answer is South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Actually, I think I misunderstood. Let me try once more.

In the standard formulation of cardinal direction relations, the relation "South" means that a region is entirely to the south of another, without constraining the east-west relationship. The relation "Southeast" means a region is entirely to the south and entirely to the east of another. Similarly, "Southwest" means a region is entirely to the south and entirely to the west.

Given the premises "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", we know for certain that x is entirely to the south of z (by transitivity of the "South" relation). However, the premises don't provide any constraint on the east-west relationship between x and z. x could be to the east of z, to the west of z, or have some east-west overlap with z.

So, x must be entirely to the south of z. But depending on the east-west arrangement (which is not constrained by the premises), the relation could be "South", "Southeast", or "Southwest". These are mutually exclusive relations in the standard formulation.

The question asks which could be the possible relations, and the answer is South, Southeast, and Southwest.

OK, I now remember the standard formulation, which I'm calling the projection-based approach (because you can calculate it by projecting the regions onto the axes).

Given two regions A and B, A is:
- South of B if A_ymax <= B_ymin
- East of B if A_xmin >= B_xmax
- North of B if A_ymin >= B_ymax
- West of B if A_xmax <= B_xmin
- Northeast of B if A is North of B and A is East of B
- Northwest of B if A is North of B and A is West of B
- Southeast of B if A is South of B and A is East of B
- Southwest of B if A is South of B and A is West of B
- Bounding Box of B (or B is Bounding Box of A) if none of the above holds (indicating some form of overlap).

With this formulation, the 9 cardinal direction relations are mutually exclusive and cover all possible arrangements of two regions.

Given the premises "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", we know for certain that x is entirely to the south of z (by transitivity of the "South" relation). But the premises don't provide any constraint on the east-west relationship between x and z. x could be to the east of z, to the west of z, or have some east-west overlap with z.

So, the possible relations from the answer space are:
- South, if x has some east-west overlap with z (i.e., neither x_xmax <= z_xmin nor x_xmin >= z_xmax).
- Southeast, if x is entirely to the east of z (i.e., x_xmin >= z_xmax).
- Southwest, if x is entirely to the west of z (i.e., x_xmax <= z_xmin).

So, the answer is South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Hmm but on second thought, this projection-based approach doesn't seem quite right. In standard Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC), the relations are typically defined with respect to a grid created by the bounding box of the reference region.

OK, I think I was mixing up different approaches to cardinal direction reasoning. Clearly, South, Southeast, and Southwest are valid possible relations from the given answer space, based on the premises.

So, my final answer is South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Hmm I can see an example where z is at the origin, and y is directly south, and x is to the south-east of y. This means that x is to the southeast of z. And on this example, "x is South of y" and "y is South of z" are both true, but "x is South of z" is false, because "x is Southeast of z" is true.

OK, based on my reflection on the formal semantics of cardinal direction relations, the answer is South, Southeast, and Southwest. It seems like the problem is asking which cardinal relations are compatible with the given constraints.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this problem a bit. Let's take South to mean that a region is strictly to the south of another, without any constraint on the east-west dimension.

Given the premises "x is South of y" and "y is South of z", it's clear that x is south of z (by transitivity). But the premises don't tell us anything about the east-west relationship between x and z. 

So, the possible relations are:
- South: If x has some east-west overlap with z.
- Southeast: If x is entirely to the east of z.
- Southwest: If x is entirely to the west of z.

So, the answer is South, Southeast, and Southwest.

I'm overthinking the problem definition. Since the problem refers to cardinal directions, I'll use the standard projection-based approach, where South, Southeast, and Southwest are distinct relations based on both north-south and east-west positioning, as outlined previously. With that, the premises "x is South of y" and "y is South of z" imply x is to the south of z, but don't constrain the east-west relationship. So, the possible relations are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

ANSWER:

The cardinal direction relation "South" means that one region is entirely to the south of another, without specifying any east-west relationship.

Given that:
- x is South of y
- y is South of z

By transitivity, we know that x must be entirely to the south of z. However, the premises don't constrain the east-west relationship between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z could be:
- South (if x has some east-west overlap with z)
- Southeast (if x is entirely to the east of z)
- Southwest (if x is entirely to the west of z)
