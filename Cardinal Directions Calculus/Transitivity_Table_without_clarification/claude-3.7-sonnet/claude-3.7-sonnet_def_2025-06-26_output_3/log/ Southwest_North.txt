PROMPT: Let  Southwest and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

We have the following information:
1. Region x is Southwest of region y
2. Region y is North of region z

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z.

Let's think about this step by step using coordinate directions.

The cardinal directions can be thought of in terms of coordinate directions:
- North means going up (positive y-direction)
- South means going down (negative y-direction)
- East means going right (positive x-direction)
- West means going left (negative x-direction)
- Northeast means going up and right (positive x and positive y)
- Southeast means going down and right (positive x and negative y)
- Northwest means going up and left (negative x and positive y)
- Southwest means going down and left (negative x and negative y)

Given:
- Region x is Southwest of region y: This means x is to the southwest of y, so x is both south (down) and west (left) of y.
- Region y is North of region z: This means y is to the north of z, so y is north (up) from z.

Now, let's try to establish the relationship between x and z.

We know:
- x is southwest of y (x is down and left from y)
- y is north of z (y is up from z)

So, going from z to y, we move north (up).
Going from y to x, we move southwest (down and left).

Now, to find the relation from z to x, we need to combine these movements:
- From z to y: Move north (up)
- From y to x: Move southwest (down and left)

Moving north and then southwest doesn't give us a direct cardinal direction because the north and south components partially cancel out. The west component remains.

Let's think about the relative positions more carefully.

If z is south of y, and y is northeast of x, then:
- z is south of y
- x is southwest of y

To determine the relation between x and z, we need to consider their relative positions.

From the given information:
- z is to the south of y
- x is to the southwest of y

This means:
- z has the same x-coordinate as y but is south of it.
- x is west and south of y.

So, x is west of z and might be north, south, or at the same latitude as z depending on how far north y is from z compared to how far south x is from y.

Let's analyze the possible positions:

1. If x is further south of y than z is south of y, then x would be southwest of z.
2. If x is less south of y than z is south of y, then x would be northwest of z.
3. If x is exactly as south of y as z is south of y, then x would be directly west of z.

Actually, I made a mistake in my analysis. Let's reconsider.

If:
- Region x is Southwest of region y
- Region y is North of region z

Then:
- From y's perspective, x is to the southwest and z is to the south.
- From z's perspective, y is to the north.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to consider their relative positions.

Let's use a coordinate system where y is at the origin (0, 0).
- x would be at (-a, -b) for some positive values a and b, since x is southwest of y.
- z would be at (0, -c) for some positive value c, since z is south of y.

Now, the relation between x and z would be determined by the relative values of b and c:
- If b < c, then x is higher than z, so x is northwest of z.
- If b > c, then x is lower than z, so x is southwest of z.
- If b = c, then x and z are at the same height, so x is directly west of z.

Wait, I need to be more careful with my coordinate system. Let me redefine:

Let's set up a coordinate system where y is at the origin (0, 0).
- If x is southwest of y, then x is at position (-a, -b) for some positive values a and b.
- If z is south of y, then z is at position (0, -c) for some positive value c.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z:
- x is at (-a, -b)
- z is at (0, -c)

The relation from z to x would be:
- x is to the west of z (because x has a negative x-coordinate compared to z)
- The y-relationship depends on the relative values of b and c:
  - If b < c, then x is north of z, so x is northwest of z.
  - If b > c, then x is south of z, so x is southwest of z.
  - If b = c, then x and z have the same y-coordinate, so x is directly west of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Oh wait, I made an error in my interpretation. The problem states "Region y is North of region z". This means y is to the north of z, not z is to the south of y. I need to be careful with the perspective.

Let's redefine our coordinate system with z at the origin (0, 0).
- If y is north of z, then y is at position (0, d) for some positive value d.
- If x is southwest of y, then x is at position relative to y: (-a, -b) for some positive values a and b.

So, relative to z, x is at position:
- x is at (-a, d-b)

The relation from z to x would be determined by the values of d and b:
- If d > b, then x is north of z.
- If d < b, then x is south of z.
- If d = b, then x and z have the same y-coordinate.

And, since a is positive, x is always to the west of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if d > b)
- West (if d = b)
- Southwest (if d < b)

No, wait, I'm going to be a bit more careful. 

Let's define a coordinate system where:
- North corresponds to the positive y-axis.
- East corresponds to the positive x-axis.
- South corresponds to the negative y-axis.
- West corresponds to the negative x-axis.

Now, let's define the positions of our regions:
- Let's place z at the origin, (0, 0).
- Since y is north of z, y is at (0, a) for some positive value a.
- Since x is southwest of y, x is at a position (-b, -c) relative to y, for some positive values b and c.

So, relative to z, x is at position:
- x is at (-b, a-c)

The relation from z to x would be:
- x is to the west of z (because x has a negative x-coordinate compared to z)
- The y-relationship depends on the relative values of a and c:
  - If a > c, then x is north of z, so x is northwest of z.
  - If a < c, then x is south of z, so x is southwest of z.
  - If a = c, then x and z have the same y-coordinate, so x is directly west of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Hmm, actually, I also need to consider the possibility that x and z might have the same location, or one might be completely enclosed within the other. But the problem explicitly states "Southwest of" and "North of", which suggests that the regions are separate and have a definite directional relationship.

Given the information provided, I believe the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Let me try to double-check with a different approach. The cardinal direction relation "Southwest" means that x is both south and west of y. Similarly, "North" means that y is directly above z.

Now, if we trace the path from z to x, we first go from z to y, which is a movement northward. Then, we go from y to x, which is a movement southwestward.

The southward component of the southwest movement might cancel out some or all of the northward movement from z to y, or it might even go beyond it, making x south of z. The westward component of the southwest movement is always present, making x west of z.

So, depending on the relative distances, x could be:
- Northwest of z (if the northward movement from z to y is greater than the southward component of the southwest movement from y to x)
- West of z (if the northward movement from z to y exactly equals the southward component of the southwest movement from y to x)
- Southwest of z (if the northward movement from z to y is less than the southward component of the southwest movement from y to x)

This confirms my earlier conclusion.

In summary, given the information that region x is Southwest of region y and region y is North of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest
