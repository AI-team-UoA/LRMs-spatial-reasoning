PROMPT: Let  West and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about the cardinal directions:

North
Northeast
East
Southeast
South
Southwest
West
Northwest
Bounding Box

We need to determine which of these could be the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
- region x is West of region y
- region y is Southeast of region z

Let's visualize this. If we place region z at the origin (0, 0), then region y is to the southeast of z. So y is somewhere in the Southeast quadrant relative to z.

Now, region x is to the west of region y. So x is somewhere to the west of y.

Let's see where region x could be relative to region z:

1. If y is directly southeast of z (i.e., at a 135-degree angle from z, assuming 0 degrees is East), and x is directly west of y, then x would be somewhat south of z, but not directly south. It would be in the South or Southwest direction from z.

2. If y is closer to the east direction (but still southeast of z), and x is directly west of y, then x could be directly south of z or even slightly southeast of z.

3. If y is closer to the south direction (but still southeast of z), and x is directly west of y, then x would be southwest of z.

4. There's also a possibility where x could be west of z. This would happen if y is positioned such that it's southeast of z but also such that when we go west from y, we end up directly west of z.

5. Similarly, x could be northwest of z if y is positioned such that it's southeast of z but when we go west from y, we end up northwest of z.

Let me try to reason more formally. I'll use a coordinate system where:
- North is the positive y-axis.
- East is the positive x-axis.
- South is the negative y-axis.
- West is the negative x-axis.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0).

If y is southeast of z, then y has coordinates (a, -b) for some positive values of a and b.

If x is west of y, then x has coordinates (a - c, -b) for some positive value of c. In fact, c needs to be large enough that a - c < 0 for x to be west of y.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z.

For x to be west of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b = 0. But since b is positive, -b cannot be 0. So x cannot be directly west of z.

For x to be northwest of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b > 0. Since b is positive, -b is negative, not positive. So x cannot be northwest of z.

For x to be north of z, we'd need a - c = 0 and -b > 0. Again, since -b is negative, x cannot be north of z.

For x to be northeast of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b > 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be northeast of z.

For x to be east of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b = 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be east of z.

For x to be southeast of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b < 0. This is possible if a - c > 0, which means c < a.

For x to be south of z, we'd need a - c = 0 and -b < 0. This is possible if c = a.

For x to be southwest of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b < 0. This is possible if c > a.

Let's double-check my reasoning. I'm realizing there's an issue with the way I set things up. If y is southeast of z, it doesn't mean y's coordinates are simply (a, -b). It means y's coordinates are (a, -b) where a and b are positive, representing the east and south components, respectively. Given these values, if x is to the west of y, it means x's x-coordinate is less than y's x-coordinate. I need to be more clear about the relation.

Actually, wait, let me do this again and be clearer in my thinking.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0).

If y is southeast of z, then y has coordinates (a, -b) for some positive values of a and b. This means y is a units east and b units south of z.

If x is west of y, then x is west of the point (a, -b). This means x has coordinates (a - c, -b) for some positive value of c, where c is large enough that x is west of y. For x to be strictly west of y, we need a - c < a, which is always true for positive c. So, x's coordinates are (a - c, -b) for some positive c.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z by comparing the coordinates of x (a - c, -b) to the coordinates of z (0, 0).

For x to be west of z, we'd need a - c < 0 (x is to the west of z) and -b = 0 (x and z have the same y-coordinate). Since b is positive, -b is negative, so -b cannot be 0. Therefore, x cannot be directly west of z.

However, I realize I might be getting confused with the formal definitions of cardinal directions. Let me redefine:

- North: (0, 1)
- Northeast: (1, 1)
- East: (1, 0)
- Southeast: (1, -1)
- South: (0, -1)
- Southwest: (-1, -1)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northwest: (-1, 1)

Now, let's place z at the origin. If y is southeast of z, then y is in the direction (1, -1) from z. Let's say y's coordinates are (a, -b) for some positive values a and b.

If x is west of y, then x is in the direction (-1, 0) from y. So, x's coordinates are (a - c, -b) for some positive value c.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we compare the coordinates of x (a - c, -b) to the coordinates of z (0, 0).

For x to be strictly west of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b = 0. Since b is positive, -b is negative, so x cannot be strictly west of z.

For x to be strictly southwest of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b < 0. Since -b is negative, this is a possibility.

For x to be strictly south of z, we'd need a - c = 0 and -b < 0. Since -b is negative, this is a possibility.

For x to be strictly southeast of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b < 0. Since -b is negative, this is a possibility.

For x to be strictly east of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b = 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be strictly east of z.

For x to be strictly northeast of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b > 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be strictly northeast of z.

For x to be strictly north of z, we'd need a - c = 0 and -b > 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be strictly north of z.

For x to be strictly northwest of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b > 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be strictly northwest of z.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

However, I realize that there's a subtlety here. Cardinal directions aren't just about points but also about regions. The question asks about regions, not points. So, I need to think about how regions relate to each other in terms of cardinal directions.

Let me reevaluate and see if there are other possibilities.

Let's think more broadly. If y is southeast of z, it means y lies somewhere in the quadrant that is both east and south of z. Similarly, if x is west of y, it means x lies somewhere to the west of y.

Hmm, I realized there's a possibility I missed earlier. We have that y is to the southeast of z, but I didn't consider that y and z might be adjacent regions (shares a boundary). Similarly, x and y might also be adjacent. In such a case, the possible directions can expand. But for now, I'll stick to the strict definitions of cardinal directions.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). If y is southeast of z, then y is in the region where x-coordinates are positive (east of z) and y-coordinates are negative (south of z). Let's say y is at position (a, -b) for some positive values a and b.

If x is west of y, then x is in the region where its x-coordinate is less than a. So, x's coordinates are (a - c, -b) for some positive value c.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we compare the coordinates of x (a - c, -b) to the coordinates of z (0, 0).

The relationship depends on the values of a, b, and c:

- If a - c < 0 (i.e., c > a), then x is to the west of z.
- If a - c = 0 (i.e., c = a), then x and z have the same x-coordinate.
- If a - c > 0 (i.e., c < a), then x is to the east of z.

Since -b < 0 (because b is positive), x is to the south of z.

Based on these, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- Southwest (if c > a)
- South (if c = a)
- Southeast (if c < a)

Actually, let me revise once more just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). If y is southeast of z, then y has coordinates (a, -b) for some positive values of a and b.

If x is west of y, then x has coordinates (a - c, -b) for some positive value of c. For x to be strictly west of y, we need a - c < a, which is always true for positive c. But for x to be strictly west (and not northwest or southwest) of y, we might need additional constraints. Let's assume that the "west" relationship means that x is directly to the west of y (i.e., they have the same y-coordinate).

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z by comparing the coordinates of x (a - c, -b) to the coordinates of z (0, 0).

For x to be strictly west of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b = 0. Since b is positive, -b is negative, so x cannot be strictly west of z.

For x to be strictly northwest of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b > 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be strictly northwest of z.

For x to be strictly north of z, we'd need a - c = 0 and -b > 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be strictly north of z.

For x to be strictly northeast of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b > 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be strictly northeast of z.

For x to be strictly east of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b = 0. Since -b is negative, x cannot be strictly east of z.

For x to be strictly southeast of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b < 0. This is possible if c < a.

For x to be strictly south of z, we'd need a - c = 0 and -b < 0. This is possible if c = a.

For x to be strictly southwest of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b < 0. This is possible if c > a.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Let me double check by thinking a different way.

I'm given that:
- x is West of y
- y is Southeast of z

From the first relation, I know that x is to the west of y, which means x has a smaller x-coordinate than y.

From the second relation, I know that y is to the southeast of z, which means y has a larger x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z.

Now, I want to determine the possible directions of x relative to z.

If y is to the southeast of z, and x is to the west of y, then x is to the west of something that is to the southeast of z.

The x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y. And the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z. So, the x-coordinate of x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinate of z, depending on how much to the west x is of y.

The y-coordinate of x is the same as the y-coordinate of y (since x is directly to the west of y). And the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z. So, the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of z.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- Southwest (if the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of z)
- South (if the x-coordinate of x is equal to the x-coordinate of z)
- Southeast (if the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of z)

Wait, I need to clarify. When we say "x is West of y", we often mean that the region x is completely to the west of region y. Similarly for the southeast relationship. Let me re-evaluate.

Let's think of it this way:

If region y is Southeast of region z, then for any point in y, there exists a point in z such that the point in y is southeast of the point in z. Conversely, there might be points in y that are strictly south or strictly east of some points in z.

Similarly, if region x is West of region y, then for any point in x, there exists a point in y such that the point in x is west of the point in y. Again, there might be points in x that are southwest or northwest of some points in y.

Given these, let's think about the possible relationships between regions x and z.

Since region y is to the southeast of region z, and region x is to the west of region y, the region x can be:
- Southwest of region z (if x is "far enough" to the west of y)
- South of region z (if x is "just the right distance" to the west of y)
- Southeast of region z (if x is "not too far" to the west of y)
- West of region z (if y is "far enough" to the east of z)

So, the possible cardinal directions for region x relative to region z are: Southwest, South, Southeast, and West.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me approach this by considering specific examples.

Let's denote the coordinates as (x, y) with positive x pointing east and positive y pointing north. 

Example 1:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, -1), which is Southeast of z
- x is at (0, -1), which is West of y and South of z

Example 2:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, -1), which is Southeast of z
- x is at (-1, -1), which is West of y and Southwest of z

Example 3:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (2, -1), which is Southeast of z
- x is at (1, -1), which is West of y and Southeast of z

Example 4:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, -1), which is Southeast of z
- x is at (-2, -1), which is West of y and Southwest of z
- Note: This is more to the southwest than Example 2, but it's still Southwest.

Are there any other possible directions? Let's check:

- North: x would need to be at (0, a) for some a > 0. But if y is at (b, -c) for some b, c > 0, and x is West of y, then x would be at (b - d, -c) for some d > 0, which can't have a positive y-coordinate. So, x can't be North of z.

- Northeast: Similar to North, x can't be Northeast of z.

- East: x would need to be at (a, 0) for some a > 0. Following the same logic as for North, x can't be East of z.

- West: x would need to be at (-a, 0) for some a > 0. If y is at (b, -c) for some b, c > 0, and x is West of y, then x would be at (b - d, -c) for some d > 0. For x to be West of z, we'd need b - d < 0 and -c = 0, which is a contradiction since c > 0. So, x can't be strictly West of z.

Wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me reevaluate the West case. Actually, x can be West of z. We have:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (b, -c) for some b, c > 0, which means y is Southeast of z
- x at (b - d, -c) for some d > 0, which means x is West of y

For x to be West of z, we'd need b - d < 0 and -c = 0. But -c isn't 0, so it seems like x can't be strictly West of z.

But, I realized I might be confusing "strictly west" with "west". If we say "x is West of z", it doesn't mean x is directly to the west of z with the same y-coordinate. It means x is in the western half-plane relative to z.

So, for x to be West of z, we just need b - d < 0 (the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of z). Whether -c is 0 or not doesn't matter for the determination of the western direction.

Given this, let's list the possible directions again:

Example 5:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, -1), which is Southeast of z
- x is at (-1, -1), which is West of y and both Southwest and West of z

So, the possible cardinal directions for region x relative to region z are: Southwest, South, Southeast, and West.

Wait, can x be Northwest of z? Let's check:

For x to be Northwest of z, we'd need x to be at (-a, b) for some a, b > 0. If y is at (c, -d) for some c, d > 0, and x is West of y, then x would be at (c - e, -d) for some e > 0. For x to be Northwest of z, we'd need c - e < 0 and -d > 0, which is a contradiction since d > 0. So, x can't be Northwest of z.

I think x can be West of z, but I'm unsure. Let me redo the analysis:

If y is at (a, -b) for some a, b > 0 (Southeast of z), and x is at (a - c, -b) for some c > 0 (West of y), then for x to be West of z, we'd need a - c < 0 (the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of z).

So, if c > a, then x is West of z. This is indeed possible.

Let's check if x can be strictly West of z (i.e., directly to the west with the same y-coordinate). For this, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b = 0. Since b > 0, -b < 0, so x can't be strictly West of z. But in the context of cardinal directions, this distinction might not be that relevant.

I'm having an issue with the definition of "West" in the context of cardinal directions. From what I've been reasoning with, directions like "West" imply that one region is in a specific direction relative to another, but doesn't give more details. But then, if x can be both Southwest and West of z, there's a bit of an overlap in these definitions.

OK. Let me clarify my reasoning. I was thinking about the directions in a more absolute sense, but regions can have multiple direction relations due to their extents.

If we think of directions as cones emanating from a region, then:
- West is the 90-degree cone centered around the negative x-axis.
- Southwest is the 90-degree cone centered around the vector (-1, -1).
- South is the 90-degree cone centered around the negative y-axis.
- Southeast is the 90-degree cone centered around the vector (1, -1).

Given these, let's check which directions are possible for region x relative to region z.

For region y to be Southeast of region z, y must lie entirely within the Southeast cone from z. Similarly, for region x to be West of region y, x must lie entirely within the West cone from y.

Now, if I place y in the Southeast cone from z, and then place x in the West cone from y, where can x be relative to z? The answer depends on the exact positions of y and x within their respective cones.

OK, wait. Let's approach this a bit differently. I want to check the possible cardinal directions one by one.

Northeast: I already checked that x cannot be in the Northeast of z. When we place y in the Southeast of z and then place x in the West of y, x will always have a y-coordinate that's less than z's y-coordinate, which means x cannot be in the Northeast of z.

North: For similar reasons, x cannot be in the North of z.

Northwest: I already checked that x cannot be in the Northwest of z.

East: If y is in the Southeast of z and x is in the West of y, then x's x-coordinate can be greater than, equal to, or less than z's x-coordinate, depending on the exact positions. If x's x-coordinate is greater than z's, then x can be in the East of z. But, the condition that x is in the West of y means that x's x-coordinate is less than y's. And the condition that y is in the Southeast of z means that y's x-coordinate is greater than z's. So, there's a range of possible x-coordinates for x. If x's x-coordinate falls in the range (z's x-coordinate, y's x-coordinate), then x is in the East of z. So, East is a possible direction.

Wait, I'm getting confused again with the definitions. Let me go back to the basic definitions of cardinal directions.

For two regions A and B, we say:
- A is North of B if all points in A are above (i.e., have a higher y-coordinate than) all points in B.
- A is East of B if all points in A are to the right of (i.e., have a higher x-coordinate than) all points in B.
- A is South of B if all points in A are below (i.e., have a lower y-coordinate than) all points in B.
- A is West of B if all points in A are to the left of (i.e., have a lower x-coordinate than) all points in B.
- A is Northeast of B if all points in A are above and to the right of all points in B.
- A is Southeast of B if all points in A are below and to the right of all points in B.
- A is Southwest of B if all points in A are below and to the left of all points in B.
- A is Northwest of B if all points in A are above and to the left of all points in B.

Given these definitions, let's check which directions are possible for region x relative to region z.

For region y to be Southeast of region z, all points in y must be below and to the right of all points in z. Similarly, for region x to be West of region y, all points in x must be to the left of all points in y.

So, all points in y are below all points in z. And all points in x are to the left of all points in y. This means all points in x are below all points in z (i.e., x is South of z), and the x-coordinates of points in x can be to the left, right, or equal to the x-coordinates of points in z.

Let's check each direction:

North, Northeast, East, Northwest: For x to be in any of these directions relative to z, at least some points in x would need to be above points in z. But all points in x are below all points in z. So, these are not possible directions.

South: All points in x are below all points in z. And if the x-coordinates of points in x are all close to the x-coordinates of points in z, then x is South of z.

Southeast: All points in x are below all points in z. If the x-coordinates of points in x are all to the right of the x-coordinates of points in z, then x is Southeast of z.

Southwest: All points in x are below all points in z. If the x-coordinates of points in x are all to the left of the x-coordinates of points in z, then x is Southwest of z.

West: For x to be West of z, all points in x must be to the left of all points in z. But this doesn't guarantee anything about the y-coordinates. Since all points in x are below all points in z, x is both West and South of z, which would make x Southwest of z. So, West is not a standalone possibility.

Actually, I realized I'm interpreting the cardinal directions incorrectly. Let me try again.

In the context of cardinal directions between regions, a region A is in a specific direction (like North, East, South, West, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest) relative to another region B if all of region A is in that direction from region B.

Let's go through each direction and check if region x can be in that direction relative to region z.

Region y is Southeast of region z, which means all of region y is to the southeast of region z. Region x is West of region y, which means all of region x is to the west of region y.

Let's place region z at the origin. Then, region y would be in the quadrant where x-coordinates are positive and y-coordinates are negative. Region x would be to the west of region y, which means region x has x-coordinates less than all x-coordinates of region y.

I think I'm making it more complicated than it is. Let me go back to a simple analysis.

- North: If all of region x is to the north of region z, then all of region x has y-coordinates greater than all y-coordinates of region z. But since region y is to the southeast of region z, all of region y has y-coordinates less than all y-coordinates of region z. And since region x is to the west of region y, the y-coordinates of region x are the same as the y-coordinates of region y. So, region x cannot be to the north of region z.

- Northeast: Similar to North, region x cannot be to the northeast of region z.

- East: For region x to be to the east of region z, all of region x needs to have x-coordinates greater than all x-coordinates of region z. But since region x is to the west of region y, all of region x has x-coordinates less than all x-coordinates of region y. And we don't know the exact relationship between the x-coordinates of region x and region z. So, region x could be to the east of region z, but only if region y is far enough to the east of region z and region x is not too far to the west of region y.

Wait, I mixed up the y-coordinates again. When I say region x is to the west of region y, I'm specifying a constraint on the x-coordinates, but I'm not saying anything about the y-coordinates. The same goes for the southeast relationship between regions y and z. So, I need to be more careful.

Let me approach this in a different way.

Assume region z is at the origin (0, 0).

Region y is to the southeast of region z. This means region y is somewhere in the quadrant where x-coordinates are positive and y-coordinates are negative.

Region x is to the west of region y. This means the x-coordinates of region x are less than the x-coordinates of region y.

Now, we want to determine where region x can be relative to region z.

The y-coordinates of region x can be anything, so region x can be in any horizontal stripe. The x-coordinates of region x are less than the x-coordinates of region y, but since region y has positive x-coordinates (it's to the southeast of region z), the x-coordinates of region x can be positive, zero, or negative. This means region x can be in any vertical stripe.

Hmm, actually, I don't think the constraints are as weak as I just made them out to be. Let me be more precise and reapproach.

Ok, let me try a specific simple example. 

Assume:
- Region z is a point at (0, 0).
- Region y is a point at (1, -1), which is to the southeast of region z.
- Region x is a point at (0, -1), which is to the west of region y.

In this example, region x is to the south of region z.

Let's try another example:

Assume:
- Region z is a point at (0, 0).
- Region y is a point at (1, -1), which is to the southeast of region z.
- Region x is a point at (-1, -1), which is to the west of region y.

In this example, region x is to the southwest of region z.

And one more:

Assume:
- Region z is a point at (0, 0).
- Region y is a point at (2, -1), which is to the southeast of region z.
- Region x is a point at (1, -1), which is to the west of region y.

In this example, region x is to the southeast of region z.

Let's try one where region x is to the west of region z:

Assume:
- Region z is a point at (0, 0).
- Region y is a point at (2, 0), which is to the east of region z. But wait, this doesn't satisfy the condition that region y is to the southeast of region z.

Let's try again:
- Region z is a point at (0, 0).
- Region y is a point at (2, -1), which is to the southeast of region z.
- Region x is a point at (-1, -1), which is to the west of region y.

In this example, region x is to the southwest of region z.

It seems I'm getting consistent results with South, Southeast, and Southwest as the possible directions for region x relative to region z. Let me double-check if any other directions are possible.

For region x to be in any of the northern directions (Northwest, North, Northeast) relative to region z, region x would need to have positive y-coordinates. But since region y is to the southeast of region z, region y has negative y-coordinates. And since the question only specifies a constraint on the x-coordinates of region x relative to region y, not the y-coordinates, region x could potentially have any y-coordinates.

Actually I realized I've been making a mistake. For region x to be West of region y, it doesn't mean that the regions have the same y-coordinates. "West" only constrains the x-coordinates, it doesn't say anything about the y-coordinates.

Given a region at (a, b) that region's West is the half-plane {(x, y) | x < a}. In other words, any point with an x-coordinate less than a is to the West of the region at (a, b), regardless of its y-coordinate.

So, if region y is at (a, -b) for some positive a and b (i.e., to the southeast of region z), then region x being to the west of region y only tells us that region x is in the half-plane {(x, y) | x < a}. It doesn't give us any information about the y-coordinates of region x.

This means region x can be at (a - c, d) for any positive c and any real d. 

Now, for region x to be to the north of region z, we'd need all y-coordinates of region x to be greater than all y-coordinates of region z. Since region z is at the origin, this means we'd need d > 0.

For region x to be to the south of region z, we'd need all y-coordinates of region x to be less than all y-coordinates of region z. Since region z is at the origin, this means we'd need d < 0.

For region x to be to the east of region z, we'd need all x-coordinates of region x to be greater than all x-coordinates of region z. Since region z is at the origin, this means we'd need a - c > 0, or c < a.

For region x to be to the west of region z, we'd need all x-coordinates of region x to be less than all x-coordinates of region z. Since region z is at the origin, this means we'd need a - c < 0, or c > a.

So, region x can be:
- Northwest of region z if c > a and d > 0.
- North of region z if c = a and d > 0.
- Northeast of region z if c < a and d > 0.
- West of region z if c > a and d = 0.
- East of region z if c < a and d = 0.
- Southwest of region z if c > a and d < 0.
- South of region z if c = a and d < 0.
- Southeast of region z if c < a and d < 0.

But wait, I'm still making a mistake somewhere. Let me revise my approach.

Ok wait, let me think in a more abstract way. Imagine I have the Cartesian plane. Let's define the different regions based on the cardinal directions from the origin:

North is the positive y-axis.
Northeast is the region between the positive y-axis and the positive x-axis.
East is the positive x-axis.
Southeast is the region between the positive x-axis and the negative y-axis.
South is the negative y-axis.
Southwest is the region between the negative y-axis and the negative x-axis.
West is the negative x-axis.
Northwest is the region between the negative x-axis and the positive y-axis.

If region z is at the origin, and region y is to the southeast of region z, then region y is in the region between the positive x-axis and the negative y-axis.

If region x is to the west of region y, then the x-coordinates of region x are less than the x-coordinates of region y.

Let's try a concrete example. Imagine region y is a point at (3, -4). Since region y is to the southeast of region z (the origin), all points in region y are both to the east and to the south of region z.

Now, region x is to the west of region y. This means all points in region x are to the west of all points in region y. If region y is a point at (3, -4), then all points in region x have x-coordinates less than 3. Region x could be at (2, -4), (1, -4), (0, -4), (-1, -4), etc. 

If region x is at (2, -4), then it's to the southeast of region z. If region x is at (0, -4), then it's to the south of region z. If region x is at (-1, -4), then it's to the southwest of region z.

But wait, I just realized I'm making an assumption that the y-coordinates of region x and region y are the same. This doesn't have to be the case. When I say region x is to the west of region y, all I'm constraining are the x-coordinates, not the y-coordinates.

Let me clarify. If region y is at (3, -4) and region x is to the west of region y, then all I know is that the x-coordinates of region x are less than 3. Region x could be at (2, -4), (2, 0), (2, 5), etc. So, the y-coordinates of region x can be anything.

Given this, if region x is at (2, 5), then it's to the northeast of region z. If region x is at (2, 0), then it's to the east of region z. If region x is at (2, -4), then it's to the southeast of region z.

If region x is at (0, 5), then it's to the north of region z. If region x is at (0, 0), then it's at the same position as region z. If region x is at (0, -4), then it's to the south of region z.

If region x is at (-1, 5), then it's to the northwest of region z. If region x is at (-1, 0), then it's to the west of region z. If region x is at (-1, -4), then it's to the southwest of region z.

So, it seems that region x can be in any of the cardinal or ordinal directions relative to region z, or even at the same position as region z. This contradicts my earlier analysis. Let me re-evaluate.

Actually, wait. I'm forgetting one key constraint here: the condition is that region y is to the southeast of region z. This means all points in region y are both to the east and to the south of region z.

Given this, if region y is at (a, -b) for some positive a and b, and all points in region y are to the southeast of region z, then all points in region y have x-coordinates greater than all x-coordinates of region z and y-coordinates less than all y-coordinates of region z.

Now, if region x is to the west of region y, then all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all x-coordinates of region y. This means all x-coordinates of region x are less than a.

But there's still the question of the y-coordinates of region x. Given only the constraint that region x is to the west of region y, the y-coordinates of region x can be anything.

Actually, I think my mistake was that I am not taking into account the fact that x, y, and z are regions, not points. I'm going to restart my analysis and consider them as proper regions.

Let me approach this differently. I want to imagine the Cartesian plane and identify where region x can be relative to region z, given the constraints.

The key insight is that the relationships "x is West of y" and "y is Southeast of z" don't just constrain the x and y coordinates, they also constrain how the regions are related.

If y is Southeast of z, then all points in y are to the southeast of all points in z. Similarly, if x is West of y, then all points in x are to the west of all points in y.

Consider what these constraints tell us about the y-coordinate of region x relative to region z. Since y is to the southeast of z, all points in y have y-coordinates less than all points in z. And since the "west" relation doesn't constrain the y-coordinates, the y-coordinates of region x can be anything.

But, if the y-coordinates of region x are greater than all y-coordinates of region z, then region x would be to the north (or northwest or northeast) of region z. If the y-coordinates of region x are less than all y-coordinates of region z, then region x would be to the south (or southwest or southeast) of region z. And if the y-coordinates of region x are the same as the y-coordinates of region z, then region x would be to the west or east of region z.

Given that there's no constraint on the y-coordinates of region x based on our given conditions, all of these scenarios are possible.

Now, consider what these constraints tell us about the x-coordinate of region x relative to region z. Since y is to the southeast of z, all points in y have x-coordinates greater than all points in z. And since x is to the west of y, all points in x have x-coordinates less than all points in y.

So, the x-coordinates of region x are less than the x-coordinates of region y, which are greater than the x-coordinates of region z. This means the x-coordinates of region x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinates of region z, depending on exactly how far to the west region x is from region y.

Considering both the x and y coordinates, the possible directions for region x relative to region z are:
- Northwest (if x-coordinates of x < x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x > y-coordinates of z)
- North (if x-coordinates of x = x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x > y-coordinates of z)
- Northeast (if x-coordinates of x > x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x > y-coordinates of z)
- West (if x-coordinates of x < x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x = y-coordinates of z)
- East (if x-coordinates of x > x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x = y-coordinates of z)
- Southwest (if x-coordinates of x < x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x < y-coordinates of z)
- South (if x-coordinates of x = x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x < y-coordinates of z)
- Southeast (if x-coordinates of x > x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x < y-coordinates of z)

Actually, let me rethink this, because I think I've been overthinking. 

Let's place region z at the origin (0, 0). If region y is to the southeast of region z, then region y is somewhere in the quadrant where x-coordinates are positive and y-coordinates are negative.

Let's imagine a simple scenario where region y is a single point at (3, -4). Since region y is to the southeast of region z (the origin), all points in region y are both to the east and to the south of region z.

Now, region x is to the west of region y. This means all points in region x are to the west of all points in region y. If region y is a point at (3, -4), then all points in region x have x-coordinates less than 3.

So far, I haven't constrained the y-coordinates of region x at all. But there's another important constraint: we're considering regions, not points. For region x to be to the west of region y, it's not just that all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all points in region y. It's also the case that region x should be "predominantly" to the west of region y.

Actually I realize that there is an issue with my analysis. I shouldn't use "predominantly" as a rule; that's not a formal definition. I shouldn't introduce a concept that wasn't in the original question. I was overthinking.

I'll revise and take a step back. It says that region x is West of region y, which means all points in region x are to the west of all points in region y. Similarly, region y being Southeast of region z means all points in region y are to the southeast of all points in region z.

Given these, what are the possible cardinal directions for region x relative to region z?

Since region y is to the southeast of region z, all points in region y have x-coordinates greater than all points in region z, and all points in region y have y-coordinates less than all points in region z.

Since region x is to the west of region y, all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all points in region y.

So, all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all x-coordinates of region y, which are greater than all x-coordinates of region z. This means the x-coordinates of region x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinates of region z, depending on exactly how far to the west region x is from region y.

The y-coordinates of region x are not constrained by the west relation. But given that all points in region y have y-coordinates less than all points in region z, and the y-coordinates of region x can be anything, the y-coordinates of region x can be greater than, equal to, or less than the y-coordinates of region z.

Considering the possible combinations of x and y coordinates, region x can be in any of the cardinal or ordinal directions relative to region z.

Actually I just realized a mistake. I've been saying "the y-coordinates of region x can be anything", but I didn't take into account that region x is West of region y. For region x to be West of region y, points in region x must have x-coordinates less than all points in region y. But this also implicitly places constraints on the y-coordinates of region x.

If all points in region y are to the southeast of all points in region z, then all points in region y are in the quadrant where x > 0 and y < 0. Now, if all points in region x are to the west of all points in region y, then all points in region x are in the half-plane where x < x_y, where x_y is the smallest x-coordinate of region y. Since all points in region y have x-coordinates greater than all points in region z, x_y is greater than all x-coordinates of region z. This means all points in region x have x-coordinates less than x_y.

But, the y-coordinates of region x can be anything. This means region x can be in the quadrant where x < 0 and y > 0 (northwest of the origin), or the quadrant where x < 0 and y < 0 (southwest of the origin), or the quadrant where x > 0 and y > 0 (northeast of the origin), or the quadrant where x > 0 and y < 0 (southeast of the origin).

Actually, let me simplify even more. 

Given:
- Region y is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is West of region y.

Simplifying:
- For region y to be Southeast of region z, all points in region y must be both east and south of all points in region z.
- For region x to be West of region y, all points in region x must be west of all points in region y.

Since all points in region y are east of all points in region z, and all points in region x are west of all points in region y, the x-coordinates of region x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinates of region z, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Since all points in region y are south of all points in region z, and there's no constraint on the y-coordinates of region x from the West relationship, the y-coordinates of region x can be greater than, equal to, or less than the y-coordinates of region z.

Considering the possible combinations of x and y coordinates, the possible cardinal directions for region x relative to region z are:
- Northwest (if x-coordinates of x < x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x > y-coordinates of z)
- North (if x-coordinates of x = x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x > y-coordinates of z)
- Northeast (if x-coordinates of x > x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x > y-coordinates of z)
- West (if x-coordinates of x < x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x = y-coordinates of z)
- East (if x-coordinates of x > x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x = y-coordinates of z)
- Southwest (if x-coordinates of x < x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x < y-coordinates of z)
- South (if x-coordinates of x = x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x < y-coordinates of z)
- Southeast (if x-coordinates of x > x-coordinates of z and y-coordinates of x < y-coordinates of z)

But also, since region y is strictly to the Southeast of region z, all y-coordinates of region y are less than all y-coordinates of region z. If region x's y-coordinates are all below region y's, then all of region x's y-coordinates are also below region z's. This would mean that region x must be South, Southeast, or Southwest of region z, depending on its x-coordinate relative to region z.

But, if we don't assume that region x's y-coordinates are related to region y's y-coordinates (which is a valid assumption given only the West relationship), then region x could potentially be in any of the cardinal or ordinal directions relative to region z.

OK I'm overthinking again. Region x is West of region y. For region x to be west of region y, all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all points in region y. Similarly, region y being Southeast of region z means all points in region y are to the southeast of all points in region z.

Hmm, I'm realizing that I've been making a mistake in my analysis. The West relationship in the context of cardinal directions doesn't necessarily mean that all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all points in region y. It means that region x is in the west direction from region y, which could be interpreted in various ways.

Actually for cardinal directions like "West" between two regions, the typical definition is that all points in the first region are to the west of all points in the second region. This is the definition I've been using.

So, let's stick with the interpretation that for region x to be West of region y, all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all points in region y. And for region y to be Southeast of region z, all points in region y are both east and south of all points in region z.

Given these, let's determine the possible cardinal directions for region x relative to region z. One way to approach this is to consider specific scenarios.

Imagine we place region z at the origin (0, 0). For simplicity, let's consider regions as points for now.

Scenario 1:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (2, 5), which is West of region y (because the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y).
In this scenario, region x is Northeast of region z.

Scenario 2:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (-1, 0), which is West of region y.
In this scenario, region x is West of region z.

Scenario 3:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (2, -10), which is West of region y.
In this scenario, region x is Southeast of region z.

OK I'm making this too complicated. Let me simplify:

Given:
- Region y is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is West of region y.

For region y to be Southeast of region z, the following constraints apply:
- All x-coordinates of y are greater than all x-coordinates of z.
- All y-coordinates of y are less than all y-coordinates of z.

For region x to be West of region y, the following constraint applies:
- All x-coordinates of x are less than all x-coordinates of y.

Combining these constraints:
- All x-coordinates of x are less than all x-coordinates of y, which are greater than all x-coordinates of z. This means the x-coordinates of x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinates of z.
- The y-coordinates of x are not constrained by the West relationship, so they can be greater than, equal to, or less than the y-coordinates of z.

Given these possibilities, the cardinal directions for region x relative to region z can be:
- Northwest, North, Northeast (if y-coordinates of x > y-coordinates of z)
- West, East (if y-coordinates of x = y-coordinates of z)
- Southwest, South, Southeast (if y-coordinates of x < y-coordinates of z)

Actually, I want to check if Northwest is really a possibility. For region x to be Northwest of region z, the following constraints would apply:
- All x-coordinates of x are less than all x-coordinates of z.
- All y-coordinates of x are greater than all y-coordinates of z.

From our earlier analysis, we know that the x-coordinates of x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinates of z. If the x-coordinates of x are less than the x-coordinates of z, and the y-coordinates of x are greater than the y-coordinates of z, then region x would be Northwest of region z. This is a valid possibility.

Similarly, we can check other directions and confirm they're also possible, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

So, the possible cardinal directions for region x relative to region z are:
- Northwest, North, Northeast
- West, East
- Southwest, South, Southeast

Actually wait.  I keep using "greater than" and "less than" imprecisely when reasoning about the west and southeast relationships.

For regions y and z, for region y to be to the southeast of region z, all points in region y must be to the southeast of all points in region z. This means all points in y have x-coordinates greater than all points in z, and all points in y have y-coordinates less than all points in z.

For regions x and y, for region x to be to the west of region y, all points in region x must be to the west of all points in region y. This means all points in x have x-coordinates less than all points in y.

Now, let's reason about the possible relationship between regions x and z.

For the x-coordinates:
- All points in y have x-coordinates greater than all points in z.
- All points in x have x-coordinates less than all points in y.
- This means the x-coordinates of region x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinates of region z, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

For the y-coordinates:
- All points in y have y-coordinates less than all points in z.
- The west relationship doesn't constrain the y-coordinates of region x relative to region y, so the y-coordinates of region x can be greater than, equal to, or less than the y-coordinates of region y.
- Given that all points in y have y-coordinates less than all points in z, if all points in x have y-coordinates less than or equal to all points in y, then all points in x would have y-coordinates less than all points in z.
- But, if all points in x have y-coordinates greater than all points in y, the y-coordinates of region x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the y-coordinates of region z, depending on the exact positions.

Given these possibilities, the possible cardinal directions for region x relative to region z are:
- Northwest (if all x-coordinates of x < all x-coordinates of z and all y-coordinates of x > all y-coordinates of z)
- North (if all x-coordinates of x = all x-coordinates of z and all y-coordinates of x > all y-coordinates of z)
- Northeast (if all x-coordinates of x > all x-coordinates of z and all y-coordinates of x > all y-coordinates of z)
- West (if all x-coordinates of x < all x-coordinates of z and all y-coordinates of x = all y-coordinates of z)
- East (if all x-coordinates of x > all x-coordinates of z and all y-coordinates of x = all y-coordinates of z)
- Southwest (if all x-coordinates of x < all x-coordinates of z and all y-coordinates of x < all y-coordinates of z)
- South (if all x-coordinates of x = all x-coordinates of z and all y-coordinates of x < all y-coordinates of z)
- Southeast (if all x-coordinates of x > all x-coordinates of z and all y-coordinates of x < all y-coordinates of z)

I want to check specifically if region x can be to the west of region z. For this to be true, all points in region x would have x-coordinates less than all points in region z, and the y-coordinates of the two regions would be the same. Let's see if this is possible given our constraints.

We know that all points in region y have x-coordinates greater than all points in region z. And all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all points in region y. This means the x-coordinates of region x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinates of region z, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

If the x-coordinates of region x are less than the x-coordinates of region z, and the y-coordinates of the two regions are the same, then region x would be to the west of region z. This is a valid possibility.

Let's check a concrete example:
- Region z is located at x-coordinates around 0.
- Region y is located at x-coordinates around 5. Since y is to the southeast of z, all y-coordinates of y are less than all y-coordinates of z.
- Region x is located at x-coordinates around -2. Since x is to the west of y, all x-coordinates of x are less than all x-coordinates of y.
In this scenario, all x-coordinates of x are less than all x-coordinates of z, making region x to the west of region z (if the y-coordinates of the two regions are the same).

I just realized that I might be making things more complicated than they are. If y is in a specific direction from z, it means y is strictly in that direction, not just component-wise. Similarly, if x is in a specific direction from y, it means x is strictly in that direction.

So, let's simplify once more.

Given:
- Region y is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is West of region y.

For region y to be strictly Southeast of region z, region y must be in the quadrant that is both east and south of region z.

For region x to be strictly West of region y, region x must be directly to the west of region y. This means all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all points in region y, but the y-coordinates of region x can be anything.

If we place region z at the origin, and region y somewhere in the southeast quadrant, then region y would have positive x-coordinates and negative y-coordinates. Region x, being to the west of region y, would have x-coordinates less than region y's x-coordinates, but its y-coordinates could be anything.

So, the x-coordinates of region x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinates of region z, depending on how far to the west region x is from region y. The y-coordinates of region x can be greater than, equal to, or less than the y-coordinates of region z.

Given these possibilities, the possible cardinal directions for region x relative to region z can be any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

I still think I'm making a mistake somewhere, because it seems unintuitive that x could be in any cardinal direction relative to z given the constraints. Let's think about it differently.

Let's consider the constraint that y is to the southeast of z. This means y is in the direction (1, -1) from z. And the constraint that x is to the west of y means x is in the direction (-1, 0) from y.

In a Cartesian system where the origin is at z, y would be in the quadrant where x > 0 and y < 0. If y is at (a, -b) for some positive a and b, then x, being to the west of y, would be at (a - c, -b + d) for some positive c and any real d. The term -b + d represents the fact that the west relation doesn't constrain the y-coordinates, so they can be anything.

For x to be:
- Northwest of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b + d > 0, or equivalently, c > a and d > b.
- North of z, we'd need a - c = 0 and -b + d > 0, or equivalently, c = a and d > b.
- Northeast of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b + d > 0, or equivalently, c < a and d > b.
- West of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b + d = 0, or equivalently, c > a and d = b.
- East of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b + d = 0, or equivalently, c < a and d = b.
- Southwest of z, we'd need a - c < 0 and -b + d < 0, or equivalently, c > a and d < b.
- South of z, we'd need a - c = 0 and -b + d < 0, or equivalently, c = a and d < b.
- Southeast of z, we'd need a - c > 0 and -b + d < 0, or equivalently, c < a and d < b.

All of these scenarios are mathematically possible, depending on the values of a, b, c, and d. So, region x can be in any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions relative to region z, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

OK I'm overthinking. Let's simplify. So for region x to be West of region y, all of region x is to the west of all of region y. This constrains the x-coordinates, but not the y-coordinates. 

Scenario 1:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (-1, 5), which is West of region y (because all x-coordinates of x are less than all x-coordinates of y). In this scenario, region x is Northwest of region z.

Scenario 2:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (2, 5), which is West of region y (because all x-coordinates of x are less than all x-coordinates of y). In this scenario, region x is Northeast of region z.

Scenario 3:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (-1, 0), which is West of region y. In this scenario, region x is West of region z.

Scenario 4:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (2, 0), which is West of region y. In this scenario, region x is East of region z.

Scenario 5:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (-1, -10), which is West of region y. In this scenario, region x is Southwest of region z.

Scenario 6:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (0, -10), which is West of region y. In this scenario, region x is South of region z.

Scenario 7:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (2, -10), which is West of region y. In this scenario, region x is Southeast of region z.

Scenario 8:
- Region z is at (0, 0).
- Region y is at (3, -4), which is Southeast of region z.
- Region x is at (0, 5), which is West of region y. In this scenario, region x is North of region z.

So, it seems that region x can be in any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions relative to region z, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

wait a second. I think I'm making a fundamental mistake here. For region x to be West of region y, all of region x is to the west of all of region y. But "West" isn't just about the x-coordinates; it's about the direction.

Actually, let me double check the definition to make sure I'm being rigorous. According to the definition of "West" in the context of cardinal directions, if a region A is West of a region B, then all points in region A are to the west of all points in region B. This means all points in region A have x-coordinates less than all points in region B, and the y-coordinates are not constrained.

Similarly, for a region A to be "Southeast" of a region B, all points in region A are to the southeast of all points in region B. This means all points in region A have x-coordinates greater than all points in region B and y-coordinates less than all points in region B.

I think the mistake I'm making is in the visualization. I need to consider regions and their extents, not just their centers.

So, let's say region z is centered at the origin (0, 0), and region y is to the southeast of region z. This means all points in region y have x-coordinates greater than all points in region z, and y-coordinates less than all points in region z. If I denote the extent of region z as (z_x_min, z_x_max) for the x-coordinates and (z_y_min, z_y_max) for the y-coordinates, then all points in region y have x-coordinates greater than z_x_max and y-coordinates less than z_y_min.

Now, if region x is to the west of region y, all points in region x have x-coordinates less than all points in region y. If I denote the extent of region y as (y_x_min, y_x_max) for the x-coordinates, then all points in region x have x-coordinates less than y_x_min.

If y_x_min > z_x_max (which is guaranteed by the Southeast relationship between y and z), then the x-coordinates of region x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinates of region z, depending on the exact value of y_x_min and how far to the west region x is from region y.

The y-coordinates of region x are not constrained by the West relationship, so they can be greater than, equal to, or less than the y-coordinates of region z.

Given these possibilities, the possible cardinal directions for region x relative to region z can be any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Actually, one thing I just realized is that maybe the West relationship also constrains the y-coordinates implicitly, just like the Southeast relationship constrains both the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

But from what I understand, West, East, North, and South only constrain one coordinate, while Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast constrain both coordinates.

Given these definitions, I've been correct in my analysis. The West relationship only constrains the x-coordinates, not the y-coordinates. Similarly, the East relationship only constrains the x-coordinates, and the North and South relationships only constrain the y-coordinates. The diagonal relationships (Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast) constrain both the x and y coordinates.

So, if region y is to the southeast of region z, all points in region y have x-coordinates greater than all points in region z, and y-coordinates less than all
