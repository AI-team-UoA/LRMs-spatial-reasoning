PROMPT: Let  East and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's approach this step-by-step using cardinal direction reasoning.

Let's first understand what each cardinal direction relation means:
- East: A region is east of another if it is located directly to the east
- Northeast: A region is northeast of another if it is located in the northeast direction, i.e., both north and east

Given:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is Northeast of region z

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let's place z at the origin (0,0) of a coordinate system. Then:
- y is Northeast of z, so y is in the first quadrant, both north and east of z. Let's say y is at some point (a,b) where a > 0 and b > 0.
- x is East of y, so x is directly to the east of y. Let's say x is at (a+c, b) where c > 0.

So, relative to z at (0,0), x is at position (a+c, b).

Now, we need to determine the direction of x relative to z. To do this, we need to see which quadrant or axis x is in relative to z.

Since a > 0, c > 0, and b > 0, we have a+c > 0 and b > 0. This places x in the first quadrant relative to z. But we need to be more specific.

To determine the exact cardinal direction, we need to compare the relative magnitudes of the east-west displacement (a+c) and the north-south displacement (b).

1. If a+c = b, then x is Northeast of z.
2. If a+c > b, then x is more east than north, so it could be considered East-Northeast (which isn't one of our standard 8 directions, but is between East and Northeast).
3. If a+c < b, then x is more north than east, so it could be considered North-Northeast.

But, considering our 8 standard cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW), and given that x is in the first quadrant relative to z, the possible directions are:
- Northeast: If the angle is close to 45 degrees.
- East: If the angle is close to 0 degrees (horizontal).
- North: If the angle is close to 90 degrees (vertical).

Wait, let me think about this more carefully.

When we say "x is East of y", we mean that x is directly to the east of y, so x and y have the same north-south coordinate.

When we say "y is Northeast of z", we mean that y is both north and east of z.

Let's reconsider:
- z is at the origin (0,0).
- y is Northeast of z, so y is at (a,b) where a > 0 and b > 0.
- x is East of y, so x is at (a+c, b) where c > 0.

Now, the direction of x relative to z:
- x is at (a+c, b) and z is at (0,0).
- The east-west displacement is a+c > 0.
- The north-south displacement is b > 0.
- Since both displacements are positive, x is in the first quadrant relative to z, which corresponds to the Northeast direction.

But let's double-check by looking at the angle:
- The angle between the line connecting z to x and the positive x-axis is given by atan2(b, a+c).
- If 0° < angle < 45°, then x is closer to East of z.
- If 45° < angle < 90°, then x is closer to North of z.
- If angle = 45°, then x is exactly Northeast of z.

Since a > 0, c > 0, and b > 0, we know that 0° < angle < 90°. This means that x is somewhere in the northeastern quadrant relative to z.

Given the constraints of our standard 8 cardinal directions, the possible directions are:
- Northeast
- East (if the angle is very close to 0°)
- North (if the angle is very close to 90°)

Actually, I think there's a simpler approach.

Let's define the directions in terms of coordinate changes:
- East: (+dx, 0)
- Northeast: (+dx, +dy)

Given:
- x is East of y: x is at position (y_x + dx, y_y) where dx > 0.
- y is Northeast of z: y is at position (z_x + dx', z_y + dy') where dx' > 0 and dy' > 0.

Substituting, x is at position ((z_x + dx') + dx, z_y + dy') or (z_x + (dx' + dx), z_y + dy').

Relative to z, x has moved (dx' + dx) to the east and dy' to the north. Since dx' + dx > 0 and dy' > 0, x is in the northeast quadrant relative to z.

The question becomes: what is the exact cardinal direction? It depends on the relative magnitudes of dx' + dx and dy'.

Actually, I think I was overthinking this. Let's go back to basics:

- If x is East of y, then x is directly to the east of y.
- If y is Northeast of z, then y is both north and east of z.

Visually, if we place z at the origin, y would be in the northeast quadrant, and x would be directly to the east of y.

Here's what we know for sure:
- x is farther east from z than y is.
- x is the same distance north from z as y is.

Given that y is northeast of z, x is definitely north of z and definitely east of z. This places x in the northeast quadrant relative to z.

The specific cardinal direction (among our 8 standard ones) depends on the angle, which we can't determine without specific coordinates. But given that x is in the northeast quadrant, it could be:
- Northeast (if the angle is close to 45°)
- East (if the angle is close to 0°)
- North (if the angle is close to 90°)

The thing I'm still considering is whether x can be directly East of z, given our constraints. Let's reason through this:

For x to be directly East of z, x would need to be on the same north-south line as z, which means x would have a north-south coordinate of 0 relative to z. However, given that y is Northeast of z, y has a positive north-south displacement from z. Since x is directly East of y, x has the same north-south coordinate as y, which means x also has a positive north-south displacement from z. This implies that x cannot be directly East of z.

Similarly, for x to be directly North of z, x would need to be on the same east-west line as z, which means x would have an east-west coordinate of 0 relative to z. However, given that y is Northeast of z, y has a positive east-west displacement from z. Since x is directly East of y, x has an even larger east-west displacement from z. This implies that x cannot be directly North of z.

So, the only possible cardinal direction for x relative to z among our 8 standard ones is Northeast.

Wait, let me double-check this.

Given:
- x is East of y: This means x is at (y_x + dx, y_y) where dx > 0.
- y is Northeast of z: This means y is at (z_x + dx', z_y + dy') where dx' > 0 and dy' > 0.

Substituting, x is at position ((z_x + dx') + dx, z_y + dy') or (z_x + (dx' + dx), z_y + dy').

Relative to z, x has moved (dx' + dx) to the east and dy' to the north. This gives the vector (dx' + dx, dy').

For x to be East of z, we'd need dy' = 0, but we know dy' > 0 due to y being Northeast of z. So, x can't be directly East of z.

For x to be North of z, we'd need dx' + dx = 0, but we know dx' > 0 and dx > 0, so dx' + dx > 0. This means x can't be directly North of z.

For x to be Northeast of z, the vector (dx' + dx, dy') should make an angle of approximately 45° with the east-west axis. This is possible.

For x to be East-Northeast of z (which is between East and Northeast), the angle would be between 0° and 45°. This is also possible.

For x to be North-Northeast of z (which is between North and Northeast), the angle would be between 45° and 90°. This is also possible.

But considering the 8 standard cardinal directions, the possible directions are:
- Northeast

Hmm, wait. Let me think about this a bit more.

I think my mistake was in trying to be too precise. The problem is asking for "possible relations" and the cardinal directions are quite broad.

Let's look at some examples to understand the relation better:

Example 1:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, 1), which is Northeast of z.
- x is at (2, 1), which is East of y.
- The direction of x relative to z is atan2(1, 2) ≈ 26.6°, which is between East and Northeast, but closer to East.

Example 2:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, 10), which is Northeast of z, but much more North than East.
- x is at (2, 10), which is East of y.
- The direction of x relative to z is atan2(10, 2) ≈ 78.7°, which is between North and Northeast, but closer to North.

Example 3:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (10, 1), which is Northeast of z, but much more East than North.
- x is at (11, 1), which is East of y.
- The direction of x relative to z is atan2(1, 11) ≈ 5.2°, which is between East and Northeast, but very close to East.

From these examples, it's clear that the direction of x relative to z can be anywhere in the northeastern quadrant, but the exact direction depends on the specific positions of the regions.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Northeast
- North (if y is significantly more north than east of z)
- East (if y is significantly more east than north of z)

But given our standard 8 cardinal directions, and without any additional information, the possible directions are:
- Northeast
- East
- North

Wait, there's one more subtlety I want to address. The problem statement asks about "relations" between region x and region z, not just the cardinal direction from z to x.

However, the possible relations are indeed the cardinal directions, so my answer is still valid.

Actually, thinking about it more, and to be more precise:

If we're strictly using the 8 standard cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW), and if we're determining the direction based on which octant the point falls into, then:

- If 0° ≤ angle < 22.5° or 337.5° ≤ angle < 360°, the direction is East.
- If 22.5° ≤ angle < 67.5°, the direction is Northeast.
- If 67.5° ≤ angle < 112.5°, the direction is North.
- If 112.5° ≤ angle < 157.5°, the direction is Northwest.
- If 157.5° ≤ angle < 202.5°, the direction is West.
- If 202.5° ≤ angle < 247.5°, the direction is Southwest.
- If 247.5° ≤ angle < 292.5°, the direction is South.
- If 292.5° ≤ angle < 337.5°, the direction is Southeast.

Given our constraints:
- x is East of y, so x is at (y_x + dx, y_y) where dx > 0.
- y is Northeast of z, so y is at (z_x + dx', z_y + dy') where dx' > 0 and dy' > 0.
- Thus, x is at (z_x + dx' + dx, z_y + dy'), making an angle of atan2(dy', dx' + dx) with the east-west axis.

For this angle to fall in the East octant, we'd need:
0° ≤ atan2(dy', dx' + dx) < 22.5° or 337.5° ≤ atan2(dy', dx' + dx) < 360°

Given that dy' > 0, the angle will always be positive, so we only consider the first condition.

For this angle to fall in the Northeast octant, we'd need:
22.5° ≤ atan2(dy', dx' + dx) < 67.5°

For this angle to fall in the North octant, we'd need:
67.5° ≤ atan2(dy', dx' + dx) < 112.5°

Given that dx' > 0 and dx > 0, the angle will always be less than 90°, so x cannot be Northwest, West, Southwest, South, or Southeast of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- North

But actually, I think I'm getting way too bogged down in the exact angles.

Let me try a clearer approach.

Let's use a qualitative description:
- x is East of y means x is directly to the east of y, so the north-south coordinate remains the same.
- y is Northeast of z means y is both north and east of z.

Given that:
1. y is both north and east of z.
2. x is directly east of y.

This implies:
1. x is east of z by a distance equal to the east-west distance from z to y plus the east-west distance from y to x.
2. x is north of z by the same distance as y is north of z.

Given these, x is definitely in the northeast quadrant relative to z.

Now, for the specific cardinal direction:
- If the east-west distance from z to x is much larger than the north-south distance, x would be close to being directly East of z.
- If the north-south distance from z to x is much larger than the east-west distance, x would be close to being directly North of z.
- If the two distances are similar, x would be close to being Northeast of z.

Without specific coordinates, we can't determine the exact cardinal direction. Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- North

Actually, let me just draw this out.

In the picture below, the 'z' is in the center of the grid, and the northeast quadrant is the upper right, which is where y must be if y is to the northeast of z. And x must be directly to the east of y. Therefore x must lie on a horizontal line eastward from y. That line lies entirely within the northeast quadrant. So x must be in the northeast quadrant, relative to z, somewhere along that horizontal line extending east from y.

```
NW   N    NE
 \    |    /
  \   |   /
   \  |  /
W ---z--- E
   /  |  \
  /   |   \
 /    |    \
SW    S    SE
```

So let's add to our picture, putting y somewhere in the northeast quadrant, and x somewhere on the horizontal line extending eastward from y. Note that any point on that line is a valid location for x, as long as it's to the east of y. And any point in the northeast quadrant is a valid position for y, as long as it's to the northeast of z.

```
NW   N    NE
 \    |    /
  \   |   /
   \  |  /
W ---z--- E
   /  |  \
  /   |   \
 /    |    \
SW    S    SE
```

Let's modify this:

```
NW   N     NE
 \    |    /
  \   |   /
   \  |  /
W ---z--- E
   /  |  \
  /   |   \
 /    |    \
SW    S    SE
```

Wait, let me try to be more concrete.

```
NW   N     NE    
 \    |    /      
  \   |   /       
   \  |  /        
W ---z--- E       
   /  |  \        
  /   |   \       
 /    |    \      
SW    S    SE     
```

Ok I'm struggling with the ASCII diagram. But the idea is that y has to be in the northeast quadrant, and x has to be on a horizontal line extending east from y. So x is always going to be in the northeast quadrant.

The question is: if we're categorizing the direction of x from z using the 8 standard cardinal directions, which ones are possible?

Let's define the 8 standard cardinal directions based on the angle θ from the positive east-west axis, measured counterclockwise:
- East: 0° ≤ θ < 22.5° or 337.5° ≤ θ < 360°
- Northeast: 22.5° ≤ θ < 67.5°
- North: 67.5° ≤ θ < 112.5°
- Northwest: 112.5° ≤ θ < 157.5°
- West: 157.5° ≤ θ < 202.5°
- Southwest: 202.5° ≤ θ < 247.5°
- South: 247.5° ≤ θ < 292.5°
- Southeast: 292.5° ≤ θ < 337.5°

Given that y is Northeast of z, the angle from z to y (let's call it θ_y) is between 22.5° and 67.5°. 

Since x is East of y, the angle from z to x (let's call it θ_x) is going to be smaller than θ_y, because x has moved farther east relative to z without changing its north-south position. 

This means:
- If 22.5° ≤ θ_y < 67.5° (which is the Northeast octant), then 0° ≤ θ_x < 67.5°.

This means θ_x could be in the East octant (0° ≤ θ_x < 22.5°) or the Northeast octant (22.5° ≤ θ_x < 67.5°).

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast

Wait, I think I've been inconsistent with my interpretation. If y is in the Northeast quadrant, it doesn't necessarily mean it's in the Northeast octant; it could also be in the North octant or the East octant, as long as it's in the first quadrant (the northeast quadrant).

So, let's reconsider:
- If y is in the Northeast octant (22.5° ≤ θ_y < 67.5°), then x could be in the East octant or the Northeast octant.
- If y is in the North octant (67.5° ≤ θ_y < 112.5°), then x could be in the East octant, the Northeast octant, or the North octant.
- If y is in the East octant (0° ≤ θ_y < 22.5°), then x will also be in the East octant.

Wait, I think I'm overthinking it. Let's go back to the definition:
- y is Northeast of z means y is both north and east of z.
- x is East of y means x is directly to the east of y.

Under these definitions, the angle from z to y can be anywhere between 0° and 90° (including exactly 0° or exactly 90°). Similarly, the angle from z to x can also be anywhere between 0° and 90°.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- North

Actually, wait. This is getting too complex. Let me try a simpler approach.

The fact that "y is Northeast of z" means that y is in the Northeast quadrant relative to z. In the context of the 8 cardinal directions, "Northeast" can be more specific, referring to a direction that's roughly 45° from the east-west axis. But if we're just saying "y is Northeast of z", it likely means that y is both north and east of z.

Similarly, "x is East of y" means that x is directly to the east of y, implying that x and y have the same north-south coordinate.

Given these, and without any further constraints or specifications:

1. y is both north and east of z.
2. x is directly east of y, meaning x is further east than y, but at the same north-south position.

This implies:
1. x is east of z.
2. x is north of z (by the same amount that y is north of z).

Given that x is both north and east of z, it is in the northeast quadrant relative to z.

Now, let me think about more specific cardinal directions. Again, this largely depends on the exact positions, but let me approach it mathematically.

Let's say:
- z is at the origin (0, 0).
- y is at (a, b), where a > 0 and b > 0 (since y is northeast of z).
- x is at (a + c, b), where c > 0 (since x is east of y).

The angle from z to x is given by atan2(b, a + c).

For x to be East of z, we'd need this angle to be close to 0°. This happens when b is much smaller than a + c.
For x to be Northeast of z, we'd need this angle to be close to 45°. This happens when b is approximately equal to a + c.
For x to be North of z, we'd need this angle to be close to 90°. This happens when b is much larger than a + c.

Since all these scenarios are possible with the right choice of a, b, and c, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- North

Actually, wait, let me reread the problem:

"If region x is East of region y and region y is Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

It asks for "possible relations," not "possible cardinal direction relations." Hmm, but I think it's clear from the context that we're looking for possible cardinal direction relations. So I think my interpretation is correct. The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- North

Actually, wait. If we are using the 8 standard cardinal directions (where N, NE, E, etc. are each a 45-degree octant), then for y to be "Northeast" of z, it specifically means that y is in the 45-degree octant centered at the northeast direction from z.

Let's be more specific with our definitions:
- East: -22.5° ≤ θ < 22.5°
- Northeast: 22.5° ≤ θ < 67.5°
- North: 67.5° ≤ θ < 112.5°
- Northwest: 112.5° ≤ θ < 157.5°
- West: 157.5° ≤ θ < 202.5°
- Southwest: 202.5° ≤ θ < 247.5°
- South: 247.5° ≤ θ < 292.5°
- Southeast: 292.5° ≤ θ < 337.5°

Under these definitions:
- If y is Northeast of z, then 22.5° ≤ θ_y < 67.5°.
- If x is East of y, then x is directly to the east of y.

Now, let's place z at the origin (0, 0) and reason about the possible positions of y and x.

If y is Northeast of z, then y is at a position (a, b) where a > 0, b > 0, and the angle θ_y = atan2(b, a) is between 22.5° and 67.5°.

If x is East of y, then x is at position (a + c, b) where c > 0. The angle from z to x is θ_x = atan2(b, a + c).

Since a > 0, b > 0, and c > 0, we have θ_x = atan2(b, a + c) < atan2(b, a) = θ_y. This means the angle from z to x is less than the angle from z to y.

Given that 22.5° ≤ θ_y < 67.5°, we have θ_x < 67.5°.

For θ_x to fall in the East octant, we'd need 0° ≤ θ_x < 22.5°, which is possible if a + c is sufficiently larger than b.

For θ_x to fall in the Northeast octant, we'd need 22.5° ≤ θ_x < 67.5°, which is possible if a + c is comparable to b.

For θ_x to fall in the North octant, we'd need 67.5° ≤ θ_x < 112.5°. But we've established that θ_x < 67.5°, so x cannot be in the North octant relative to z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast

Oh, but wait. "y is Northeast of z" could be understood as "y is in the northeast quadrant (first quadrant) relative to z" in a looser interpretation. Let's consider that alternative interpretation. In this scenario, y can be at any position (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0. This means the angle θ_y = atan2(b, a) can be anywhere between 0° and 90°.

If y is very close to the positive east-west axis, then θ_y is close to 0°, and y would be East of z under the 8 standard cardinal directions.
If y is in the middle of the northeast quadrant, then θ_y is close to 45°, and y would be Northeast of z.
If y is very close to the positive north-south axis, then θ_y is close to 90°, and y would be North of z.

Now, if x is directly east of y, then x is at position (a + c, b) where c > 0. The angle from z to x is θ_x = atan2(b, a + c).

Since a > 0, b > 0, and c > 0, we have θ_x = atan2(b, a + c) < atan2(b, a) = θ_y. This means the angle from z to x is less than the angle from z to y.

Given that 0° ≤ θ_y < 90°, we have θ_x < 90°.

For θ_x to fall in the East octant, we'd need 0° ≤ θ_x < 22.5°, which is possible if a + c is sufficiently larger than b.
For θ_x to fall in the Northeast octant, we'd need 22.5° ≤ θ_x < 67.5°, which is possible if a + c is comparable to b.
For θ_x to fall in the North octant, we'd need 67.5° ≤ θ_x < 90° (since we've established that θ_x < 90°), which is possible if a + c is significantly smaller than b.

Therefore, under this interpretation, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- North

But I think the problem would be clearer if the strict interpretation (where "Northeast" specifically refers to the 45-degree octant) is used.

Actually, I don't think I can choose which interpretation to use. It's ambiguous. So, I will consider both interpretations and provide the combined result.

Under the interpretation where "Northeast" refers to the 45-degree octant centered at the northeast direction, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast

Under the interpretation where "y is Northeast of z" means "y is in the northeast quadrant relative to z", the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- North

Combining both interpretations, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- North

But actually, let me double-check the North case. Let's go back to the strict interpretation where "Northeast" refers to the 45-degree octant.

If y is Northeast of z, then y is at a position (a, b) where a > 0, b > 0, and the angle θ_y = atan2(b, a) is between 22.5° and 67.5°.

If x is East of y, then x is at position (a + c, b) where c > 0. The angle from z to x is θ_x = atan2(b, a + c).

For θ_x to fall in the North octant, we'd need 67.5° ≤ θ_x < 112.5°. But we've established that θ_x < θ_y < 67.5°, so x cannot be in the North octant relative to z.

Ok, I think I've convinced myself that North should not be on the list in the strict interpretation.

So under the strict interpretation where "Northeast" refers to the 45-degree octant centered at the northeast direction, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast

Under the interpretation where "Northeast" means "in the northeast quadrant", the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- North

These two interpretations are both acceptable from a linguistic point of view. So we don't get to arbitrarily pick, we have to consider both. The answer should be:

East
Northeast
North

Actually, let's see if I can prove the North case is impossible. In fact, I'm going to be even more specific. We're asked about which relations are *possible*. So it's not sufficient to draw a picture and show that a north relation is possible in one scenario; we need to find a case where it's impossible, to rule it out.

Ok, so in the strict interpetation, if y is Northeast of z, then the angle from z to y is between 22.5 and 67.5 degrees. We need x to be north of z, which means the angle from z to x is between 67.5 and 112.5 degrees. But the angle from z to x must be less than the angle from z to y, because x is to the east of y. So the angle from z to x must be less than 67.5 degrees. So the angle from z to x is less than 67.5 degrees, which means that x can't be north of z. So North is impossible, and the possible relations are just East and Northeast, in the strict interpretation.

Ok, so I'm pretty confident that my earlier conclusion is correct. If we go with the strict interpretation, the possible relations are East and Northeast. If we go with the loose interpretation, the possible relations are East, Northeast, and North.

Given the phrasing of the problem, I'm going to assume the strict interpretation is intended, so the answer is East and Northeast.

Oh wait. Let me reconsider the problem, because I think my interpretation has been wrong.

Cardinal directions, specifically North, East, South, and West, each cover a 90-degree sector. The intermediate directions (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest) each cover a 90-degree sector centered at the respective 45-degree angle.

So, the directions are defined as:
- North: 315° < θ ≤ 45°
- East: 45° < θ ≤ 135°
- South: 135° < θ ≤ 225°
- West: 225° < θ ≤ 315°
- Northeast: 0° < θ ≤ 90°
- Southeast: 90° < θ ≤ 180°
- Southwest: 180° < θ ≤ 270°
- Northwest: 270° < θ ≤ 360°

Wait, this isn't right. Let me redefine it.

In the standard 8-direction compass, the directions are typically defined as:
- North: 337.5° < θ ≤ 22.5°
- Northeast: 22.5° < θ ≤ 67.5°
- East: 67.5° < θ ≤ 112.5°
- Southeast: 112.5° < θ ≤ 157.5°
- South: 157.5° < θ ≤ 202.5°
- Southwest: 202.5° < θ ≤ 247.5°
- West: 247.5° < θ ≤ 292.5°
- Northwest: 292.5° < θ ≤ 337.5°

Wait, this still doesn't seem right. Let me redefine it again, but I think it's just a shift.

Let's use the east-west axis as the reference and measure counterclockwise:
- East: -22.5° ≤ θ < 22.5°
- Northeast: 22.5° ≤ θ < 67.5°
- North: 67.5° ≤ θ < 112.5°
- Northwest: 112.5° ≤ θ < 157.5°
- West: 157.5° ≤ θ < 202.5°
- Southwest: 202.5° ≤ θ < 247.5°
- South: 247.5° ≤ θ < 292.5°
- Southeast: 292.5° ≤ θ < 337.5°

This looks right. So in the traditional 8 directions of a compass, each direction covers a 45-degree sector.

Given this:
- If y is Northeast of z, then 22.5° ≤ θ_y < 67.5°.
- If x is East of y, then -22.5° ≤ θ_{xy} < 22.5°, where θ_{xy} is the angle from y to x.

Since x is East of y, the angle from z to x (θ_x) is related to the angle from z to y (θ_y) and the angle from y to x (θ_{xy}) in a way that's not a simple addition.

Let's do this calculation differently.

Let's say z is at the origin (0, 0), y is at (a, b), and x is at (a + c, b).

The angle from z to y is θ_y = atan2(b, a). If y is Northeast of z, then 22.5° ≤ θ_y < 67.5°.

The angle from z to x is θ_x = atan2(b, a + c). Since a > 0, b > 0, and c > 0, we have θ_x < θ_y. This means the angle from z to x is less than the angle from z to y.

Given that 22.5° ≤ θ_y < 67.5°, we have θ_x < 67.5°.

For x to be East of z, we'd need 0° ≤ θ_x < 22.5°, which is possible if a + c is significantly larger than b.
For x to be Northeast of z, we'd need 22.5° ≤ θ_x < 67.5°, which is possible if a + c is comparable to b.
For x to be North of z, we'd need 67.5° ≤ θ_x < 112.5°. But we've established that θ_x < 67.5°, so x cannot be in the North octant relative to z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast

Ok, I'm convinced. The possible relations, using the strict interpretation of cardinal directions (which I believe is the standard one), are East and Northeast. 

Actually, wait, I think I've been very complicating a very simple problem. Let's go back to basics.

I interpret the problem as asking about the possible cardinal direction relations (among the 8 standard ones) between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is Northeast of region z.

First, let's visualize this. If z is at the origin, y is in the northeast direction from z, and x is to the east of y, then x is to the right of y on the same horizontal line.

Relative to z, x is going to be in the first quadrant (the northeast quadrant). The exact direction depends on the angle, which in turn depends on the exact positions of x, y, and z.

Let's do a concrete example:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (1, 1), which is Northeast of z.
- x is at (2, 1), which is East of y.
- The direction of x relative to z is atan2(1, 2) ≈ 26.6°, which falls in the Northeast octant.

But if we change the coordinates of y to (10, 1), which is still Northeast of z (but closer to the east-west axis), and x to (11, 1), which is East of y, then the direction of x relative to z becomes atan2(1, 11) ≈ 5.2°, which falls in the East octant.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast

Great, so I had it right. 

Actually, I'm realizing that maybe I've been misinterpreting the problem. If when they say region x is "East" of region y, that could also mean in the region sense, not in the directional sense. Let me check that interpretation.

Actually, let's not go there. I'm just going to use the standard interpretation of cardinal directions, where East, Northeast, etc. refer to specific octants.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast

ANSWER:

Given the information:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is Northeast of region z

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I'll analyze the relative positions.

When y is Northeast of z, it means y is both north and east of z. When x is East of y, it means x is directly to the east of y (same north-south position as y, but further east).

From z's perspective, x must be:
1. At least as far north as y is (since x and y share the same north-south coordinate)
2. Further east than y (since x is east of y, and y is already east of z)

This places x in the northeast quadrant relative to z, but the exact cardinal direction depends on the specific positions.

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
