PROMPT: Let  South and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

This question is asking me to determine the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is West of region z

Let me visualize this situation on a simple 2D coordinate system. If we take the origin as a reference:
- If region z is at the origin (0, 0)
- Then region y is West of z, so y is at some point (-a, 0) where a > 0
- And region x is South of y, so x is at some point (-a, -b) where b > 0

So in this configuration, x is at (-a, -b), y is at (-a, 0), and z is at (0, 0).

Now, what is the relation between x and z?
- x is at (-a, -b)
- z is at (0, 0)

This means x is:
- West of z (because -a < 0)
- South of z (because -b < 0)

When a point is both West and South of another point, it's in the Southwest direction relative to that point.

However, I need to be careful here. The problem specifies "South" and "West" as cardinal directions, but doesn't specify whether these are strict directions or if they can include points that are directly aligned. In other words, is "South" strictly due South, or can it include Southeast and Southwest?

Let's consider both interpretations:

Interpretation 1: "South" means strictly due South (same longitude, lower latitude)
In this case:
- If y is strictly West of z (same latitude, lower longitude)
- And x is strictly South of y (same longitude, lower latitude)
- Then x must be Southwest of z

Interpretation 2: "South" includes Southeast and Southwest (any direction with a southward component)
In this case:
- If y is West of z (could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z)
- And x is South of y (could be Southeast, South, or Southwest of y)
- Then x could be in several possible positions relative to z

Let me analyze this more systematically. I'll use a coordinate system where:
- East-West is the x-axis
- North-South is the y-axis
- North is +y, South is -y
- East is +x, West is -x

Now if:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is West of z, so y is at (-a, 0) for some a > 0
- x is South of y, so x is at (-a, -b) for some b > 0

So x is at (-a, -b) and z is at (0, 0). The relation between x and z depends on the relative magnitudes of a and b:
- x is West of z (because -a < 0)
- x is South of z (because -b < 0)
- Combining these, x is Southwest of z

Actually, I realize I'm assuming very strict definitions here. Let me reconsider using more general definitions of cardinal direction relations.

Cardinal direction relations are often defined in terms of the minimum bounding rectangles (MBR) of regions, not just points. 

Let me use Allen's interval algebra for reasoning about cardinal directions. For each pair of regions, we consider their projections onto the x and y axes, and determine the relation between these intervals.

Given:
- x is South of y: This means the y-projection of x is below the y-projection of y. Using Allen's interval algebra, this could be "before" (if there's a gap), or "meets" (if they're adjacent).
- y is West of z: This means the x-projection of y is to the left of the x-projection of z. Again, this could be "before" or "meets".

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to combine these constraints.

For the x-axis (East-West):
- If y is West of z, and x and y have some overlap or equality in their x-projections, then x can be West of z.
- If y is West of z, but x is significantly East of y, then x might not be West of z. It could be East of z, or overlap with z in the East-West direction.

For the y-axis (North-South):
- If x is South of y, and y and z have some overlap or equality in their y-projections, then x can be South of z.
- If x is South of y, but y is significantly North of z, then x might not be South of z. It could be North of z, or overlap with z in the North-South direction.

So the possible relations between x and z include:
- Southwest (if x is both West and South of z)
- South (if x is aligned with z on the East-West axis but South of it)
- West (if x is aligned with z on the North-South axis but West of it)
- Possibly other relations depending on the specific positions and sizes of the regions

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let me revisit the problem statement and make sure I'm interpreting it correctly.

The problem states "Let South and West be cardinal direction relations." This suggests we're working with a specific model of cardinal direction relations, possibly the 9-intersection model or a similar approach.

In cardinal direction reasoning, when we say "region x is South of region y," we typically mean that x is entirely in the Southern half-plane defined by y's bounding rectangle. Similarly, "region y is West of region z" means y is entirely in the Western half-plane defined by z's bounding rectangle.

Given these definitions:
1. x is South of y: All points in x have a y-coordinate less than the minimum y-coordinate of any point in y.
2. y is West of z: All points in y have an x-coordinate less than the minimum x-coordinate of any point in z.

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z:
- From (1), we know that x is entirely below y.
- From (2), we know that y is entirely to the left of z.

What can we say about x relative to z? 
- We know x is below y, and y is to the left of z.
- This places x in the Southwest quadrant relative to z.
- However, the exact cardinal direction relation depends on the specific boundaries of x and z.

I think I need to approach this more systematically. Let me define the cardinal direction relations more precisely, then analyze all possibilities.

In the standard cardinal direction model for regions, space is divided into 9 tiles relative to a reference region: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and the reference region itself (O).

Given:
- x is South of y: This means x is entirely in the S tile relative to y.
- y is West of z: This means y is entirely in the W tile relative to z.

Now, let's define the boundaries:
- The Western boundary of z defines the separation between W and E (relative to z).
- The Southern boundary of y defines the separation between S and N (relative to y).

Since y is West of z, y is entirely to the left of the Western boundary of z.
Since x is South of y, x is entirely below the Southern boundary of y.

So, where can x be relative to z?
- x is below the Southern boundary of y.
- y is to the left of the Western boundary of z.

Let's visualize this:
```
    |
----+----
    |
y   |  z
    |
----+----
    |
x   |
    |
```

If y is directly West of z (same latitude), and x is directly South of y (same longitude), then x would be in the Southwest tile relative to z.

But what if y is not directly West of z, or x is not directly South of y? Let's consider all possibilities.

If y can be anywhere in the Western half-plane of z, and x can be anywhere in the Southern half-plane of y, then:
1. y could be NW, W, or SW of z.
2. x could be SE, S, or SW of y.

Let's analyze each combination:

1. If y is NW of z and x is SE of y:
   - x could be W, O, or E of z (depending on how far East x extends).
   - x could be N, O, or S of z (depending on how far South x extends).
   - Combining these, x could be NW, N, NE, W, O, E, SW, S, or SE of z.

2. If y is NW of z and x is S of y:
   - x is West of z (since y is West of z and x is below y but aligned with y in the East-West direction).
   - x could be N, O, or S of z (depending on how far South y and x are).
   - Combining these, x could be NW, W, or SW of z.

3. If y is NW of z and x is SW of y:
   - x is West of z (since both y and x are West of z).
   - x could be N, O, or S of z (depending on how far South y and x are).
   - Combining these, x could be NW, W, or SW of z.

I'll continue with the other combinations...

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the basic definitions and constraints.

Given:
- x is South of y: This means all points in x have a y-coordinate less than the minimum y-coordinate of any point in y.
- y is West of z: This means all points in y have an x-coordinate less than the minimum x-coordinate of any point in z.

What can we say about x relative to z?
- We know x is entirely below y.
- We know y is entirely to the left of z.

But we don't know:
- How far South x is compared to z.
- How far West x is compared to z.

So, x could be:
- Southwest of z (if x is both West and South of z)
- South of z (if x is directly below z, but not necessarily to the left or right)
- West of z (if x is directly to the left of z, but not necessarily above or below)
- Some other relation, or a combination of relations, depending on the specific positions and sizes of x and z.

Actually, I think I'm now making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me think of it in terms of the eight cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). Given that x is South of y and y is West of z, which cardinal direction(s) could describe the relation between x and z?

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. 
- If y is West of z, then y is somewhere to the left of the y-axis, say at (-a, b) where a > 0 and b can be positive, negative, or zero.
- If x is South of y, then x is somewhere below the horizontal line passing through y, say at (-a+c, b-d) where d > 0 and c can be positive, negative, or zero.

So x is at (-a+c, b-d) relative to z. Depending on the values of a, b, c, and d, x could be in different positions relative to z.

- If c < a, then x is West of z.
- If c = a, then x is aligned with z on the East-West axis.
- If c > a, then x is East of z.

- If b-d < 0, then x is South of z.
- If b-d = 0, then x is aligned with z on the North-South axis.
- If b-d > 0, then x is North of z.

Combining these, x could be:
- Northwest of z (if c < a and b-d > 0)
- North of z (if c = a and b-d > 0)
- Northeast of z (if c > a and b-d > 0)
- West of z (if c < a and b-d = 0)
- Aligned with z (if c = a and b-d = 0) - this would mean x and z are the same point, which is unlikely for regions.
- East of z (if c > a and b-d = 0)
- Southwest of z (if c < a and b-d < 0)
- South of z (if c = a and b-d < 0)
- Southeast of z (if c > a and b-d < 0)

Actually, wait. I'm not correctly accounting for the fact that x is South of y. If x is South of y, then b-d < b, which doesn't tell us whether b-d is positive, negative, or zero. I need to be more careful.

Let's try a different approach. If z is at the origin, then y could be anywhere in the Western half-plane of z, which includes the Northwest, West, and Southwest directions. And x could be anywhere in the Southern half-plane of y, which includes the Southeast, South, and Southwest directions.

So, depending on the specific location of y relative to z, and x relative to y, x could be in various positions relative to z. Let's analyze a few cases:

1. If y is directly West of z (on the same horizontal line), then x is in the South or Southwest direction from y, placing x in the Southwest direction from z.

2. If y is in the Northwest direction from z, then x could be directly South, Southeast, or Southwest from y, which could place x in various directions from z including West, Southwest, South, or even Southeast or East if x is far enough to the right.

3. If y is in the Southwest direction from z, then x is further South and could be Southwest, South, or Southeast from z, depending on its East-West position.

It seems like without additional constraints, x could be in almost any direction from z except for the Northern half-plane (North, Northeast, Northwest).

Let me be even more systematic. Since we're dealing with cardinal directions, let's divide the plane into 9 regions relative to z: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the region itself (O).

- If y is West of z, then y is entirely in the W, NW, or SW region relative to z.
- If x is South of y, then x is entirely in the S, SE, or SW region relative to y.

Now, let's consider each possible location for y and see where x could be relative to z:

1. If y is in the W region relative to z:
   - And x is in the S region relative to y, then x is in the SW region relative to z.
   - And x is in the SE region relative to y, then x could be in the W, O, or E region relative to z (depending on how far East x extends).
   - And x is in the SW region relative to y, then x is in the SW region relative to z.

2. If y is in the NW region relative to z:
   - And x is in the S region relative to y, then x could be in the W region relative to z (if x is directly below y), or it could be in the NW or SW regions (depending on the exact positions).
   - And x is in the SE region relative to y, then x could be in the N, NW, W, O, SW, S, or E regions relative to z (depending on the exact positions).
   - And x is in the SW region relative to y, then x is in the W region relative to z.

3. If y is in the SW region relative to z:
   - And x is in the S region relative to y, then x is in the S region relative to z.
   - And x is in the SE region relative to y, then x could be in the SW, S, or SE regions relative to z (depending on how far East x extends).
   - And x is in the SW region relative to y, then x is in the SW region relative to z.

This analysis suggests that x could be in various regions relative to z, depending on the specific positions of x, y, and z. But x is definitely not in the N, NE, or NW regions relative to z. It could be in the E, SE, S, SW, W, or O regions.

Actually, let's simplify this to focus directly on the problem's constraints. We know:
- x is South of y (all points in x have a y-coordinate less than the minimum y-coordinate of any point in y).
- y is West of z (all points in y have an x-coordinate less than the minimum x-coordinate of any point in z).

To determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to find constraints on the positions of x relative to z based on the given information.

Since x is South of y, all points in x have a y-coordinate less than the minimum y-coordinate of any point in y. And since y is West of z, all points in y have an x-coordinate less than the minimum x-coordinate of any point in z.

These constraints don't directly tell us about the relation between x and z. However, we can infer:
- If y is West of z, it's to the left of z.
- If x is South of y, it's below y.

So, x is below and potentially to the left of z, but the exact relation depends on the specific positions of x, y, and z.

Hmm, I'm still not getting a clear answer. Let me visualize this more concretely.

Imagine the world is a flat plane, and we're viewing it from above, with North at the top.

- If z is a reference point, y is to the left of z (West).
- If y is a reference point, x is below y (South).

What's the relation between x and z?

x is below y, which is to the left of z. Without additional constraints, x could be:
- Southwest of z (if x is both to the left and below z).
- South of z (if x is directly below z, aligned with z on the East-West axis).
- Southeast of z (if x is to the right and below z).
- West of z (if x is to the left of z, aligned with z on the North-South axis).
- East of z (if x is to the right of z, aligned with z on the North-South axis).

Wait, let me be careful about this. If x is South of y, and y is West of z, can x really be East of z? Let's think about this.

If y is West of z, it's to the left of z. If x is directly below y, it's also to the left of z. But if x is far enough to the right of y, it could be to the right of z. However, for x to be East of z, it would need to be directly to the right of z, which means it would need to be aligned with z on the North-South axis. But we also know x is South of y, which is West of z. This seems to imply that x can't be directly East of z.

But let's consider a concrete example to check. Imagine:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (-2, 0), which is West of z.
- x is at (1, -1), which is Southeast of y (and hence South of y).

In this case, x is at (1, -1) relative to z, which means it's Southeast of z.

So, it seems like x could be Southeast of z. Let me re-evaluate.

The relation between x and z can be determined based on the x and y coordinates of x relative to z:
- If the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of z, then x is West of z.
- If the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of z, then x is East of z.
- If the x-coordinate of x is equal to the x-coordinate of z, then x is aligned with z on the East-West axis.
- If the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of z, then x is South of z.
- If the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of z, then x is North of z.
- If the y-coordinate of x is equal to the y-coordinate of z, then x is aligned with z on the North-South axis.

Given that x is South of y and y is West of z, we know:
- y is to the left of z.
- x is below y.

But we don't have constraints on how far to the right x might extend, or how far up y might extend. So, without additional constraints, x could be:
- Southwest of z (if x is to the left and below z).
- South of z (if x is directly below z).
- Southeast of z (if x is to the right and below z).
- West of z (if x is to the left of z and aligned with z on the North-South axis).

Let's revisit my earlier example to check:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (-2, 0), which is West of z.
- x is at (1, -1), which is Southeast of y.

In this case, x is Southeast of z. But x is also South of y, which fits the original constraint.

Now, let's check if x can be West of z:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (-2, 2), which is Northwest of z.
- x is at (-3, 1), which is Southwest of y (and hence South of y).

In this case, x is West of z. So, x can be West of z, given the constraints.

Can x be directly South of z?
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (-2, 2), which is Northwest of z.
- x is at (0, -1), which is Southeast of y (and hence South of y).

In this case, x is directly South of z. So, x can be directly South of z, given the constraints.

Can x be Southwest of z?
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (-2, 2), which is Northwest of z.
- x is at (-3, -1), which is South of y.

In this case, x is Southwest of z. So, x can be Southwest of z, given the constraints.

Let me check if x can be in any other direction relative to z.

I just realized I used a specific point to represent x, which is technically incorrect for regions. However, the general reasoning still applies; I'm just considering a point within the region for simplicity.

Ok, let me go back to a region-based analysis. The original problem asks for the cardinal direction relation between regions x and z, given that region x is South of region y and region y is West of region z.

In the region connection calculus for cardinal directions, if region x is South of region y, it means x is entirely in the South half-plane defined by y. Similarly, if region y is West of region z, it means y is entirely in the West half-plane defined by z.

Let's define the half-planes:
- South half-plane of y: All points with a y-coordinate less than the minimum y-coordinate of y.
- West half-plane of z: All points with an x-coordinate less than the minimum x-coordinate of z.

Given these definitions, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

- x is entirely in the South half-plane of y, which means all points in x have a y-coordinate less than the minimum y-coordinate of y.
- y is entirely in the West half-plane of z, which means all points in y have an x-coordinate less than the minimum x-coordinate of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- If the maximum y-coordinate of y is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z (i.e., y is entirely below z), then x is also entirely below z, which means x is South of z.
- If y and z overlap in their y-coordinates, then we can't say for sure if x is South of z without more information. However, x is definitely below the overlapping region of y and z.

For the x-coordinate:
- We know y is entirely to the left of z. But we don't know the x-coordinates of x. Without additional constraints, x could be to the left, right, or even overlap with z in the x-direction.

Let's analyze specific scenarios:

1. If y is directly West of z (aligned with z on the North-South axis) and x is directly South of y (aligned with y on the East-West axis), then x is Southwest of z.

2. If the region y is at an angle such that it's in the Northwest direction from z, then x (being South of y) could be in various directions from z, depending on the specific positions. In this case I need to explore the edge cases.

I need to be careful again. Let's try to define precise locations for the regions and then analyze.

Let's denote the minimum and maximum coordinates of a region with subscripts. For example, y_min_y is the minimum y-coordinate of region y.

If x is South of y, then:
max_y(x) < min_y(y)

If y is West of z, then:
max_x(y) < min_x(z)

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to compare their coordinates.

For the x-coordinate:
- If max_x(x) < min_x(z), then x is West of z.
- If min_x(x) > max_x(z), then x is East of z.
- Otherwise, x and z overlap in the x-direction.

For the y-coordinate:
- If max_y(x) < min_y(z), then x is South of z.
- If min_y(x) > max_y(z), then x is North of z.
- Otherwise, x and z overlap in the y-direction.

But we need to use the constraints we already have:
- x is South of y: max_y(x) < min_y(y)
- y is West of z: max_x(y) < min_x(z)

Can we derive a constraint for max_y(x) relative to min_y(z)?
We have:
max_y(x) < min_y(y)

But we don't have a direct relation between min_y(y) and min_y(z), so we can't say for sure if x is South of z.

Can we derive a constraint for max_x(x) relative to min_x(z)?
We have:
y is West of z: max_x(y) < min_x(z)

But we don't have a direct relation between max_x(x) and max_x(y), so we can't say for sure if x is West of z.

Actually, let's consider the spatial constraints more directly using the 9-intersection model or similar. If we divide the plane into 9 regions relative to z (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the region itself O), where can y be, and subsequently, where can x be?

If y is West of z, then y is entirely in the W, NW, or SW region relative to z. If x is South of y, then x is in the S, SE, or SW region relative to y.

Depending on which region y is in, x could be in various regions relative to z.

Let's consider the cases:
1. If y is in the W region relative to z, then x (being South of y) is in the SW region relative to z.
2. If y is in the NW region relative to z, then x (being South of y) could be in the W, SW, or S region relative to z (or even further East, depending on the exact position).
3. If y is in the SW region relative to z, then x (being South of y) is in the S or SE region relative to z.

Again it seems like a wide range of possiblities, and I need to explore some edge cases...

Ok, let me specifically list the possiblities.

1. If y is in the W region relative to z, then x (being South of y) is in the SW region relative to z.
2. If y is in the NW region relative to z, then x (being South of y) could be in the W, SW, or S region relative to z (or even further East, depending on the exact position).
3. If y is in the SW region relative to z, then x (being South of y) is in the S or SE region relative to z.

From this analysis, the possible regions for x relative to z are:
- W (West)
- SW (Southwest)
- S (South)
- SE (Southeast)

I'm now realizing a key flaw in my reasoning. I didn't account for the fact that x, y, and z are regions with some spatial extent, not just points. When working with cardinal directions for regions, we typically use the minimum bounding box of each region to determine the relation.

Let's be very precise and use RCC (Region Connection Calculus) combined with the 9-intersection model for cardinal directions.

In the 9-intersection model, space is divided into 9 tiles relative to a reference region: N (North), NE (Northeast), E (East), SE (Southeast), S (South), SW (Southwest), W (West), NW (Northwest), and B (the region's bounding box).

Here's the revised analysis:

If y is West of z, then the bounding box of y is entirely to the left of the bounding box of z. If x is South of y, then the bounding box of x is entirely below the bounding box of y.

Given these constraints, where can the bounding box of x be relative to the bounding box of z?

- If the bounding box of y is to the left of the bounding box of z, and the bounding box of x is below the bounding box of y, then the bounding box of x is to the left and below the bounding box of z (i.e., in the SW direction).

However, the exact cardinal direction relation between x and z depends on the relative positions and sizes of their bounding boxes. If the bounding box of x extends further to the right than the left boundary of the bounding box of z, then x might also have a South or Southeast relation with z.

Here are the possible cases:
1. The bounding box of x is entirely to the left of the bounding box of z, which means x is West of z.
2. The bounding box of x overlaps with the bounding box of z in the East-West direction but is entirely below it, which means x is South of z.
3. The bounding box of x is entirely to the left and below the bounding box of z, which means x is Southwest of z.
4. The bounding box of x is entirely to the right and below the bounding box of z, which means x is Southeast of z.

Hmm, I'm realizing I'm lacking a bit of information. Let me specifically analyze the cases one at a time.

We know the following:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is West of region z

Case 1: Can region x be North of region z?

If x is South of y, then the bounding box of x is entirely below the bounding box of y. For x to be North of z, the bounding box of x would have to be entirely above the bounding box of z. But since y is West of z, the bounding box of y is to the left of the bounding box of z. There's no constraint saying y is above or below z. If y is far enough above z, and x is just slightly below y, it's possible that x could still be above z. But I think this is not a general case; it's a specific arrangement that requires particular positions of the regions.

Actually, let's clarify. If y is West of z, their bounding boxes are separated in the East-West direction, but there's no constraint on their relative positions in the North-South direction. Similarly, if x is South of y, their bounding boxes are separated in the North-South direction, but there's no constraint on their relative positions in the East-West direction.

It's possible for y to be much further North than z, and for x to be slightly South of y but still North of z. So, without additional constraints, we can't rule out x being North of z.

But OK, let's think of it differently. The question asks for the cardinal direction relation between regions. One way to think of it is to consider the direction of lines connecting the regions' centers. Given that y is West of z and x is South of y, the direction from z to x would typically be some combination of South and West, which would be Southwest. But again, this depends on the specific arrangement of the regions.

I think the problem with my analysis is that I'm trying to be overly general. Let's simplify and focus on the most common interpretations of cardinal direction relations.

In the simple 9-intersection model, we have the basic cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the bounding box of the region itself (let's denote it as "B").

If y is West of z, then y is in the W (or potentially NW or SW) region relative to z. If x is South of y, then x is in the S (or potentially SE or SW) region relative to y.

But here's the key insight: we need to determine where x is relative to z. If we're only given that y is West of z, then the exact North-South relation between y and z is unspecified. Similarly, if we're only given that x is South of y, then the exact East-West relation between x and y is unspecified.

This means x could be in various positions relative to z, depending on the specific arrangement of the regions. Without more constraints, the possible relations between x and z would include: SW, S, SE, W, NW, B, E, N, NE. Basically, almost any relation is possible!

But this doesn't seem like a meaningful answer to the question. Let's reconsider.

Actually, I think in the context of this problem, the cardinal direction relations are probably defined in terms of the direction from one region's center to another region's center. For instance, if region x is South of region y, it means the center of x is directly below the center of y. Similarly, if region y is West of region z, it means the center of y is directly to the left of the center of z.

Given these interpretations, if the center of x is directly below the center of y, and the center of y is directly to the left of the center of z, then the center of x would be to the left and below the center of z. In cardinal direction terms, this would be Southwest.

But I'm not sure if this is the interpretation intended by the problem. Let's consider the more general case where "South" and "West" refer to half-planes, not just the basic compass directions.

Using the projection-based definition:
- If region x is South of region y, then all points in x have a y-coordinate less than the minimum y-coordinate of any point in y.
- If region y is West of region z, then all points in y have an x-coordinate less than the minimum x-coordinate of any point in z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relation between x and z?
- The constraint "x is South of y" does not say anything about the x-coordinates of x relative to y. Similarly, the constraint "y is West of z" does not say anything about the y-coordinates of y relative to z.
- This means x could have any relation to z in the East-West direction, and y could have any relation to z in the North-South direction.

But I know that x is below y, and y is to the left of z. This gives us a partial constraint on the position of x relative to z, but it doesn't fully determine the cardinal direction relation between them.

Actually, let me think a bit more fundamentally about this. If x is South of y, it means that when we draw a line from the center of y to the center of x, that line points in the South direction (or has a Southward component). Similarly, if y is West of z, it means that when we draw a line from the center of z to the center of y, that line points in the West direction (or has a Westward component).

Now, if we want to determine the cardinal direction relation between x and z, we need to determine the direction of the line from the center of z to the center of x.

Given that y is West of z, the center of y is to the left of the center of z. Given that x is South of y, the center of x is below the center of y. Combining these, the center of x is to the left and below the center of y, which is to the left of the center of z. This means the center of x is to the left and below the center of z, which in cardinal direction terms is Southwest.

But I'm not sure if the problem intends for us to use this interpretation of cardinal direction relations. I think we need to consider the more general case where the regions have spatial extent, and the cardinal direction relations are defined in terms of the relative positions of the regions' bounding boxes.

Let's first summarize what we've learned:

- If x is South of y, then x could be in the SE, S, or SW region relative to y.
- If y is West of z, then y could be in the NW, W, or SW region relative to z.
- This means that x could be in various regions relative to z, depending on the specific positions of x, y, and z.

Based on this, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z would include: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and possibly even overlap (B).

But as I said, that's not a meaningful answer. I'm convinced that with only the constraints provided, we can only say that x is in a South-west direction relative to z.

Hmm, the problem statement says "Let South and West be cardinal direction relations." So I'm supposing that these are strict, pure directions, rather than regions like SE or NW. That is, South means that the center of one region is strictly below the center of the other region. 

OK, using this interpretation, we get:
- y is strictly to the West of z (same y-coordinate, but a smaller x-coordinate).
- x is strictly to the South of y (same x-coordinate, but a smaller y-coordinate).

So, if y is West of z, and y and z have the same y-coordinate, then y and z are on the same horizontal line. And if x is South of y, and x and y have the same x-coordinate, then x and y are on the same vertical line.

Given these constraints, where would x be relative to z?

If y is on the same horizontal line as z but to the left of z, and x is on the same vertical line as y but below y, then x is to the left and below z. In cardinal direction terms, this is Southwest.

Actually, I'm wondering if the problem might be asking us to use the composition of direction relations. If South and West are considered as cardinal direction relations, then the problem might be asking us to determine the composition of South and West, which would be Southwest. 

If that's the case, the answer would be: x is Southwest of z.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me go back to the problem statement.

It says:
"Let South and West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is South of region y and region y is West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

The problem is asking for the possible relations between region x and region z, given the constraints that x is South of y and y is West of z. It's not specifically asking for the composition of the relations, but rather what the possible relations between x and z could be.

OK, I think I had it right the first time. The possible relations between x and z would depend on the specific positions of x, y, and z. But that said, I think there are a few assumptions I can make:

1. The cardinal direction relations are defined in terms of the bounding boxes of the regions.
2. The relations "South" and "West" refer to the basic compass directions (not half-planes).

Given these assumptions, and the constraints that x is South of y and y is West of z, the most consistent conclusion would be that x is Southwest of z. However, without more specific information about the extent of the regions, it's possible that x could also have other cardinal direction relations with z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z would be:
- Southwest (most likely)
- But I'm finding it hard to confidently rule out other possibilities like West, South, or Southeast without more information.

Actually, let me consider a concrete counter-example to check the plausibility of the Southwest relation.

Let's say:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box centered at (0, 0).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box centered at (-5, 0), which is West of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box centered at (-5, -5), which is South of y.

In this case, region x is Southwest of region z. This aligns with my intuition.

Now, let's try to find a counter-example where x is not Southwest of z:

Let's say:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box centered at (0, 0).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box centered at (-5, 10), which is West of z (and Northwest in the 9-intersection model, but we're assuming the strict direction interpretation).
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box centered at (-5, 5), which is South of y.

In this case, region x is North of region z, but also West of it. In the 9-intersection model, this would be Northwest. So x can indeed have other relations with z besides Southwest.

Actually, I think the strict direction interpretation I assumed might not be the intended one, because it doesn't capture the general concept of "West" or "South" for regions with spatial extent. Let's revert to the interpretation where:
- "South" means the bounding box of x is entirely below the bounding box of y.
- "West" means the bounding box of y is entirely to the left of the bounding box of z.

Given these interpretations, where can x be relative to z?

The constraint "y is West of z" means the bounding box of y is to the left of the bounding box of z. The constraint "x is South of y" means the bounding box of x is below the bounding box of y. This places the bounding box of x to the left and below the bounding box of y, which is to the left of the bounding box of z. This means the bounding box of x is to the left of the bounding box of z, making x West of z, and below the bounding box of z, making x South of z. Combining these, x is Southwest of z.

Wait, but my intuition says that without more constraints, x could potentially be in other positions relative to z. Let me try to visualize another counter-example:

- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 5) to (-10, 15), which is West of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-15, -5) to (-5, 4), which is South of y.

In this case, x is still West of z, but it's no longer strictly South of z; it's more South-west. But in the 9-intersection model, we'd call this West.

Actually, I think the problem is that I'm still not defining the cardinal direction relations correctly. In the 9-intersection model, for two regions x and z, space is divided into 9 tiles relative to the bounding box of z: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the bounding box of z itself (B). If x is entirely contained in the SW tile of z, then x is Southwest of z. If x is entirely contained in the W tile of z, then x is West of z. And so on.

Given this definition, and the constraints that x is South of y and y is West of z, where could x be relative to z?

- If y is West of z, then y is entirely contained in the W, NW, or SW tile of z (or some combination of these). Let's consider all these possibilities.
- If y is in the W tile of z and x is in the S tile of y, then x is in the SW tile of z.
- If y is in the NW tile of z and x is in the S tile of y, then x could be in the W or SW tile of z (depending on the exact position of x relative to z).
- If y is in the SW tile of z and x is in the S tile of y, then x is in the S or SE tile of z (again, depending on the exact position).

OK, so the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Southwest (if x is in the SW tile of z)
- West (if x is in the W tile of z)
- South (if x is in the S tile of z)
- Southeast (if x is in the SE tile of z)

Let me revisit to make sure. I could potentially make a case for other possiblities.

OK, here's the final rundown:

- South: If y is West of z, and x is exactly below y, and the right boundary of x aligns with the right boundary of y, and the right boundary of y aligns with the left boundary of z, then x is South of z.
- West: If y is West of z, and y is at the same level as z (i.e., the top and bottom boundaries of y align with the top and bottom boundaries of z), and x is directly below y with its left and right boundaries aligned with y's left and right boundaries, then x is West of z.
- Southwest: If y is West of z, and x is directly below y, then x is generally Southwest of z.
- Southeast: If y is West of z, but far enough North of z that its bottom boundary is above the top boundary of z, and x is directly below y but with its right boundary extending far enough to the right, then x could be Southeast of z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- West
- Southwest
- Southeast

actually let me go through a few of these cases again to make sure these relations are really possible.

South: Is it possible for x to be directly South of z?
Let's say:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 15) to (-10, 25), which is West of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-5, -10) to (5, -5), which is South of z.

In this case, x is directly South of z, not West or Southwest. It's South of y, and y is West of z, but x is South of z. So South is indeed a possible relation.

West: Is it possible for x to be directly West of z?
Let's say:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 0) to (-10, 10), which is West of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-15, -10) to (-5, -5), which is South of y.

In this case, the bottom-right corner of x is at (-5, -5), which is to the left of the bottom-left corner of z at (0, 0). This makes x West of z, and also South of z. In the 9-intersection model, we'd call this Southwest, not West.

Wait, let me modify the example:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 0) to (-10, 10), which is West of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-15, -5) to (-5, 5), which is South of y.

But even here, x is Southwest of z, not strictly West. In fact, it's hard to get a purely West relation when x is South of y and y is West of z. Let me reconsider.

If y is West of z and x is South of y, then the top-right corner of x is at or to the left of the top-left corner of z, and at or below the bottom-left corner of y. This means x is generally Southwest of z. It's hard to get a purely West relation, because if x is South of y, it's also South of z (assuming y and z are at the same level).

Southeast: Can x be Southeast of z?
Let's say:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 15) to (-10, 25), which is West and North of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (15, -10) to (25, 0), which is South and East of z.

In this case, x is Southeast of z. It's also South of y, and y is West of z. So the constraints are satisfied, and x is Southeast of z.

OK, it looks like, given only the constraints that x is South of y and y is West of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southwest
- Southeast

And West is not a possible relation. I think I can be sure of that now.

Let me try to think of whether there are any other possible relations I might have missed.

What about Bounding Box? Can x overlap with z?

Let's say:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 15) to (-10, 25), which is West and North of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (5, -5) to (15, 5), which overlaps with z.

In this case, x is South of y, and y is West of z, but x and z overlap. So Bounding Box is a possible relation.

Are there any other possible relations? Let me think...

What about East? Can x be East of z?

Let's say:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 15) to (-10, 25), which is West and North of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (15, 5) to (25, 15), which is East of z.

In this case, x is South of y (as its top-left corner is below the bottom-left corner of y), and y is West of z, but x is East of z. So East is also a possible relation.

OK, let me go through all the 9 relations:
- Bounding Box: we showed that x and z can overlap, so the Bounding Box relation is possible.
- North: I'm having trouble coming up with an example. To have x North of z, the bottom boundary of x would have to be above the top boundary of z. And since x is South of y, the top boundary of x would have to be below the bottom boundary of y. For this to work, y would have to be completely above z. But then, y would be Northwest of z, not West of z. So I don't think the North relation is possible.

Actually, now that I think about it, West is also not possible. If x is South of y and y is West of z, then x is either South, Southwest, Southeast, Bounding Box, or East of z. It can't be purely West, North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Let me double-check the East relation:

Let's say:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 15) to (-10, 25), which is West and North of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (15, 5) to (25, 15), which is East of z.

The top-right corner of y is at (-10, 25). The bottom-right corner of y is at (-10, 15). The top-left corner of x is at (15, 15). The top-right corner of x is at (25, 15). Wait, x is not South of y. For x to be South of y, the top boundary of x would have to be below the bottom boundary of y. In this case, the top boundary of x is at y = 15, which is the same as the bottom boundary of y. So x is not strictly South of y. East is not a possible relation, after all.

Let's fix the example:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 20) to (-10, 30), which is West and North of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (15, 5) to (25, 15), which is East of z.

Now, the bottom boundary of y is at y = 20, and the top boundary of x is at y = 15. So x is South of y. And y is West of z, so the constraints are satisfied. And x is East of z.

Let me verify once more:
- North: Not possible, because if x is South of y, it can't also be North of z (unless y is extremely North of z, but then y wouldn't be strictly West of z).
- Northeast: Similar reasoning as North. Not possible.
- East: Possible, as we showed above.
- Southeast: Possible, as we showed earlier.
- South: Possible, as we showed earlier.
- Southwest: Possible, as we showed earlier.
- West: Not possible, because if x is South of y and y is West of z, then x is either South, Southwest, Southeast, Bounding Box, or East of z. It can't be purely West.
- Northwest: Similar reasoning as North and West. Not possible.
- Bounding Box: Possible, as we showed earlier.

OK, so to summarize:

The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southwest
- Southeast
- East
- Bounding Box

OK, to summarize:

The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southwest
- Southeast
- East
- Bounding Box (i.e., x and z can overlap)

North, Northeast, West, and Northwest are not possible.

Oh wait, let me revisit my reasoning for the West relation. I said it's not possible, but I haven't actually verified this with a counter-example, i.e. with an attempt at a concrete example.

Let's say:
- Region z is a rectangle with its bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 10).
- Region y is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-20, 0) to (-10, 10), which is West of z.
- Region x is a rectangle with its bounding box from (-15, -10) to (-5, 0), which is South of y. The top-right corner of x is at (-5, 0), which is to the left of the bottom-left corner of z at (0, 0).

In this case, x is West of z, because the right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of z. But x is also South of z, because the top boundary of x is at the same level as the bottom boundary of z. In the 9-intersection model, this would be Southwest.

Actually, I'm being too strict. If x is in the SW tile of z in the 9-intersection model, we say x is Southwest of z. But that doesn't mean x can't also be South or West of z in other interpretations. In the strict "West" relation, the region is entirely to the left of the reference region. In my example, x is entirely to the left of z, so x is West of z. Similarly, for the strict "South" relation, the region is entirely below the reference region. In my example, x is entirely below z, so x is South of z. That makes it Southwest. I think what's throwing me off is the different definitions of the direction. 

But let me approach this differently. In the cardinal direction calculus for regions (and not just points) given in terms of the 9 tiles, the question is asking for which tile region x can occupy given the constraints. Based on our analysis, x can occupy the South, Southwest, Southeast, or East tile, or it can overlap with the bounding box of z.

Actually, in my example, x is in the tile SW of z, just like I'd expect. But if the tile is "SW", are the relations "South" and "West" both satisfied? Maybe I need to revisit the definitions.

OK, to clarify, when we say "x is South of y" in the cardinal direction calculus for regions, we mean that all of x is in the S tile of y. Similarly, when we say "y is West of z," we mean that all of y is in the W tile of z. The tiles are defined by extending the bounding box of the reference region.

Given this, can x be in the W tile of z? Let's check.

To be in the W tile of z, x would have to be to the left of z, aligned with z in the North-South direction. If y is in the W tile of z, and x is in the S tile of y, then x is to the left and below y, which is to the left of z. This places x to the left and below z, which is the SW tile, not the W tile. So x cannot be in the W tile of z.

OK, I think I'm overthinking this.

Given the interpretations:
- "South" means the bounding box of x is entirely below the bounding box of y.
- "West" means the bounding box of y is entirely to the left of the bounding box of z.

I'm asked to find the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, based on the defined 9 tiles. The only constraint is that x is South of y and y is West of z.

Given those constraints, and the examples we've considered, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southwest
- Southeast
- East
- Bounding Box (i.e., x and z can overlap)

West (and North, Northeast, Northwest) is not a possible relation because if x is South of y and y is West of z, then x is below and potentially to the left or right of z, but it can't be purely to the left of z without also being below it.

OK, so to summarize, the possible answer can be: South, Southwest, Southeast, East, Bounding Box.

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given, I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is West of region z

To find the possible relations between x and z, I'll analyze the constraints:

Since x is South of y, region x is below region y.
Since y is West of z, region y is to the left of region z.

From these constraints, region x is below and potentially to the left or right of region z. This means the possible relations between x and z are:

- Southwest (if x is both below and to the left of z)
- South (if x is directly below z)
- Southeast (if x is below and to the right of z)
- East (if x extends far enough to the right and aligns with z vertically)
- Bounding Box (if x overlaps with z)

The relations North, Northeast, Northwest, and West are not possible given the constraints.
