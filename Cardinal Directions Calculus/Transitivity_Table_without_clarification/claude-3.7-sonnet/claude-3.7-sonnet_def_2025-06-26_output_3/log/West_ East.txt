PROMPT: Let  West and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think carefully about this problem. We have three regions: x, y, and z.

We're given that:
- x is West of y
- y is East of z

And we need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Let's visualize this. If we use a simple coordinate system, where East is the positive x-direction and North is the positive y-direction:

- "x is West of y" means that x is located to the west of y. In other words, x has a smaller x-coordinate than y.
- "y is East of z" means that y is located to the east of z. In other words, y has a larger x-coordinate than z.

So, we have: x-coordinate of x < x-coordinate of y and x-coordinate of y > x-coordinate of z.

Combining these, we get: x-coordinate of x < x-coordinate of y > x-coordinate of z.

But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between the x-coordinates of x and z. We have two cases:

1. x-coordinate of x < x-coordinate of z: In this case, x is West of z.
2. x-coordinate of x > x-coordinate of z: In this case, x is East of z.
3. x-coordinate of x = x-coordinate of z: In this case, x and z have the same x-coordinate, which means x is neither East nor West of z.

Wait, I think I'm not considering the full definition of cardinal directions correctly. Let's be more precise:

- "x is West of y" means that x is located to the west of y, which implies that the entirety of region x is to the west of the entirety of region y. There's no overlap in the east-west direction.
- "y is East of z" means that y is located to the east of z, which implies that the entirety of region y is to the east of the entirety of region z. There's no overlap in the east-west direction.

Given these definitions, we can derive the transitive property: If x is West of y, and y is West of z, then x is West of z. 

But we're given that y is East of z, not West of z. So, we need to consider the relation between "West" and "East". These are inverse relations: if x is West of y, then y is East of x. 

So, we can rephrase the given information:
- x is West of y
- z is West of y

Now, both x and z are West of y, but we don't know their relative positions. x could be West of z, East of z, or they could overlap in the east-west direction.

But let's think about this differently:

If x is West of y, and y is East of z, then in terms of x-coordinates:
- The maximum x-coordinate of x (let's call it maxX_x) is less than the minimum x-coordinate of y (minX_y).
- The minimum x-coordinate of y (minX_y) is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z (maxX_z).

So, maxX_x < minX_y and minX_y > maxX_z.

Combining, we get: maxX_x < minX_y > maxX_z.

But this still doesn't directly tell us the relation between maxX_x and maxX_z. There are three possibilities:
1. maxX_x < maxX_z: In this case, x is completely to the west of z.
2. maxX_x > maxX_z and minX_x < minX_z: In this case, x and z overlap in the east-west direction.
3. minX_x > maxX_z: In this case, x is completely to the east of z.

Hmm, let's visualize this differently. 

The cardinal directions are: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), and Northwest (NW).

If we place y at the center of a 3x3 grid, then the relation "x is West of y" places x in the three cells to the left of y: NW, W, and SW. Similarly, the relation "y is East of z" places z in the three cells to the left of y: NW, W, and SW.

Given this, x and z can be in any of the three cells: NW, W, or SW. So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x is North of z (if x is in NW and z is in SW).
- x is Northeast of z (if x is in NW and z is in W).
- x is East of z (if x is in W or SW and z is in NW or W, respectively).
- x is Southeast of z (if x is in SW and z is in NW).
- x is South of z (if x is in SW and z is in NW).
- x is same as z (if both are in the same cell).
- x is West of z (if x is in NW or W and z is in W or SW, respectively).
- x is Northwest of z (if x is in NW and z is in SW).
- x is Southwest of z (if x is in W and z is in NW).

Wait, that's not right. Let's redo this. 

The cardinal directions are about the relative positions of two regions. If region A is West of region B, it means the entirety of A is to the west of the entirety of B. There's no overlap in the east-west direction.

Given:
- x is West of y
- y is East of z

We know:
- The entirety of x is to the west of the entirety of y.
- The entirety of y is to the east of the entirety of z.

Let's use a coordinate system and denote the extent of a region in the east-west direction by its minimum and maximum x-coordinates:
- x: [minX_x, maxX_x]
- y: [minX_y, maxX_y]
- z: [minX_z, maxX_z]

Given the constraints:
- maxX_x < minX_y (x is West of y)
- minX_y > maxX_z (y is East of z)

We have maxX_x < minX_y and minX_y > maxX_z, which implies maxX_x < minX_y > maxX_z.

But this doesn't directly give us the relation between maxX_x and maxX_z or between minX_x and minX_z.

Let's consider all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

For x to be North of z, the entirety of x should be to the north of the entirety of z. This means the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z. But the given constraints don't provide any information about the y-coordinates, so x may or may not be North of z.

Similarly, for x to be East of z, the entirety of x should be to the east of the entirety of z. This means minX_x > maxX_z. But from the given constraints, we can only derive that maxX_x < minX_y and minX_y > maxX_z. While this implies maxX_x < minX_y > maxX_z, it doesn't directly tell us the relation between minX_x and maxX_z. So, x may or may not be East of z.

Similarly, other cardinal directions such as South, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest are uncertain.

For x to be West of z, the entirety of x should be to the west of the entirety of z. This means maxX_x < minX_z. But again, the given constraints don't provide direct information about the relation between maxX_x and minX_z. So, x may or may not be West of z.

It seems that, based on the given constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be any of the eight cardinal directions or the regions could even overlap.

Let me draw out some specific scenarios to understand this better.

Scenario 1: x and z are separated and x is West of z.
x: [1, 2], y: [5, 6], z: [3, 4]
Here, maxX_x (2) < minX_y (5) and minX_y (5) > maxX_z (4). Also, maxX_x (2) < minX_z (3), so x is West of z.

Scenario 2: x and z are separated and x is East of z.
x: [3, 4], y: [5, 6], z: [1, 2]
Here, maxX_x (4) < minX_y (5) and minX_y (5) > maxX_z (2). Also, minX_x (3) > maxX_z (2), so x is East of z.

Scenario 3: x and z overlap.
x: [1, 3], y: [5, 6], z: [2, 4]
Here, maxX_x (3) < minX_y (5) and minX_y (5) > maxX_z (4). But x and z overlap in the x-direction.

From these scenarios, it seems that, based on the given constraints, the relation between x and z in the east-west direction can be:
1. x is West of z
2. x is East of z
3. x and z overlap

But I need to consider all the cardinal directions, not just east-west. 

Let's also consider the north-south direction (y-coordinates). We don't have any constraints on the y-coordinates. This means the relation between x and z in the north-south direction can be:
1. x is North of z
2. x is South of z
3. x and z overlap

Combining the possibilities for both directions, the possible cardinal directions and spatial relations between x and z are:
1. North (if x is North of z and they overlap in the east-west direction)
2. Northeast (if x is North of z and East of z)
3. East (if x is East of z and they overlap in the north-south direction)
4. Southeast (if x is South of z and East of z)
5. South (if x is South of z and they overlap in the east-west direction)
6. Southwest (if x is South of z and West of z)
7. West (if x is West of z and they overlap in the north-south direction)
8. Northwest (if x is North of z and West of z)
9. Bounding Box (if x and z overlap in both the east-west and north-south directions)

Wait, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's go back to the basics of cardinal direction relations.

Actually, I realized that I'm being sidetracked by thinking too much about the spatial extent of the regions. 

The cardinal direction relations typically define the position of one region relative to another in a qualitative manner. For instance, "x is West of y" means that, from a qualitative perspective, x is located to the west of y.

So, let's reconsider:
- x is West of y
- y is East of z

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From a transitive property perspective:
If region A is West of region B, and region B is West of region C, then region A is West of region C.

But in our case, we have:
If region x is West of region y, and region y is East of region z (or equivalently, region z is West of region y), then...

We can't directly apply transitivity here because the directions are not consistent. 

However, we can think of it in terms of a 1D line:
z --- y --- x (where z is to the West, y is in the middle, and x is to the East)

But this would contradict our givens. In the given, x is West of y, so it would be:
x --- y (with x to the West and y to the East)

And y is East of z, so it would be:
z --- y (with z to the West and y to the East)

Combining, we get:
x --- y, z --- y

But we don't know the relation between x and z directly from this. They could be arranged as:
x --- z --- y, or
z --- x --- y, or
x/z --- y (where x and z are at the same position).

So, the possible relations are:
1. x is West of z
2. x is East of z
3. x and z are at the same position (in the East-West direction)

But wait, the question is about cardinal directions, which include North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

OK let's try to be more precise now.

Regions x, y, and z are 2D objects. 

Cardinal direction relations in a 2D space can be determined using the relationship between the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the two regions. The MBR is the smallest rectangle that encloses the region and has sides parallel to the x and y axes.

Now, the given relations are "x is West of y" and "y is East of z". In the context of cardinal directions based on MBRs, these mean:
- "x is West of y" means the eastern edge of the MBR of x is to the west of the western edge of the MBR of y.
- "y is East of z" means the western edge of the MBR of y is to the east of the eastern edge of the MBR of z.

But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between the MBRs of x and z.

Let me denote the coordinates of the eastern and western edges of the MBRs as:
- x: W_x and E_x
- y: W_y and E_y
- z: W_z and E_z

Given:
- E_x < W_y (x is West of y)
- W_y > E_z (y is East of z)

We want to determine the relation between E_x and W_z, and W_x and E_z.

From the given conditions, we can only infer that E_x < W_y and W_y > E_z. So, E_x < W_y > E_z. But this doesn't directly give us the relationship between E_x and W_z, or between W_x and E_z.

Now, let's also consider the north-south (N-S) direction. Let's denote the coordinates of the northern and southern edges of the MBRs as:
- x: S_x and N_x
- y: S_y and N_y
- z: S_z and N_z

The given conditions don't provide any information about the N-S direction. So, the regions can have any relation in the N-S direction.

Actually, I realize I've been talking about this problem in a somewhat confusing manner. Let's talk about it a different way. In the literature on qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations typically have a precise definition. The most common is the cardinal direction model introduced by Frank, which divides the 2D space into 9 tiles:

NW | N | NE
---|---|---
W | O | E
---|---|---
SW | S | SE

Here, "O" (Origin) is a tile that represents the reference region. The other 8 tiles represent the 8 cardinal directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Given this model, "x is West of y" means x falls in the W, NW, or SW tile with respect to y. Similarly, "y is East of z" means y falls in the E, NE, or SE tile with respect to z.

So the issue is that given only these constraints, we don't have direct information about where x is with respect to z, because a region can be in any of three cells to the west of the reference point, and a different region can be in any of three cells to the east of the reference point.

Actually, I think the most precise way to talk about this is that cardinal directions in 2D space are only a partial order, and the operation of deducing relation(x, z) from relation(x, y) and relation(y, z) is called "composition." The composition of relations r1 and r2 gives the possible relations that can exist between two objects that are related to a third by r1 and r2, respectively.

Let's think more carefully. 

We have:
- x is West of y
- y is East of z

In terms of the Frank's cardinal direction model:
- x falls in the W, NW, or SW tile with respect to y.
- y falls in the E, NE, or SE tile with respect to z.

Now, let's determine all possible positions of x with respect to z.

Case 1: y is in the E tile with respect to z.
This means y is directly to the east of z. In this case, x can be in various positions with respect to z:
- If x is in the W tile with respect to y, it can be in the W, NW, N, NE, O (overlap), SE, S, or SW tile with respect to z.
- If x is in the NW tile with respect to y, it can be in the W, NW, N, or NE tile with respect to z.
- If x is in the SW tile with respect to y, it can be in the W, SW, S, or SE tile with respect to z.

Case 2: y is in the NE tile with respect to z.
This means y is to the northeast of z. In this case, x can be:
- If x is in the W tile with respect to y, it can be in the W, NW, N, NE, O, E, SE, S, or SW tile with respect to z.
- If x is in the NW tile with respect to y, it can be in the W, NW, N, or NE tile with respect to z.
- If x is in the SW tile with respect to y, it can be in the W, NW, N, NE, O, E, SE, S, or SW tile with respect to z.

Case 3: y is in the SE tile with respect to z.
This means y is to the southeast of z. In this case, x can be:
- If x is in the W tile with respect to y, it can be in the W, NW, N, NE, O, E, SE, S, or SW tile with respect to z.
- If x is in the NW tile with respect to y, it can be in the W, NW, N, NE, O, E, SE, S, or SW tile with respect to z.
- If x is in the SW tile with respect to y, it can be in the W, SW, S, or SE tile with respect to z.

Taking the union of all these cases, it seems that x can be in any of the 9 tiles (including the Origin) with respect to z. This means there's no definite relation between x and z.

But this is counter-intuitive. Let me think again.

Ah, OK, a cleaner approach is to use the constraints on the absolute positions of regions from East/West and North/South:

East/West:
- West: x-coordinate decreases
- East: x-coordinate increases

North/South:
- North: y-coordinate increases
- South: y-coordinate decreases

Given:
- x is West of y: implies x-coordinate of x < x-coordinate of y.
- y is East of z: implies x-coordinate of y > x-coordinate of z.

From these, we can infer that x-coordinate of x < x-coordinate of y > x-coordinate of z. But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between the x-coordinates of x and z. x could be to the west of z, to the east of z, or at the same longitude.

Similarly, the given conditions don't provide any information about the y-coordinates. So, x could be to the north of z, to the south of z, or at the same latitude.

Combining these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. North: x is at the same longitude as z, but to the north.
2. Northeast: x is to the east and north of z.
3. East: x is at the same latitude as z, but to the east.
4. Southeast: x is to the east and south of z.
5. South: x is at the same longitude as z, but to the south.
6. Southwest: x is to the west and south of z.
7. West: x is at the same latitude as z, but to the west.
8. Northwest: x is to the west and north of z.
9. Origin (or Overlap): x and z overlap.

Hmm but that doesn't sound right. Maybe I'm missing the precise constraints of "East" and "West" in the context of this problem.

Let's revisit. In the 2D cardinal direction model:
- "x is West of y" means the entire region x is to the west of region y.
- "y is East of z" means the entire region y is to the east of region z.

In terms of x-coordinates:
- "x is West of y" means the maximum x-coordinate of region x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of region y.
- "y is East of z" means the minimum x-coordinate of region y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of region z.

Let's denote the x-coordinate ranges of the regions as:
- x: [min_x, max_x]
- y: [min_y, max_y]
- z: [min_z, max_z]

Given:
- max_x < min_y (x is West of y)
- min_y > max_z (y is East of z)

From these, we can infer that max_x < min_y > max_z. But this still doesn't directly tell us the relation between max_x and min_z, or between min_x and max_z.

So, the possible relations in the East-West direction are:
1. x is West of z (if max_x < min_z)
2. x is East of z (if min_x > max_z)
3. x and z overlap in the East-West direction (if neither of the above is true)

And in the North-South direction, without any given constraints, all relations are possible.

Given the way "East" and "West" are typically defined in the context of cardinal directions, it indeed seems that the relation between x and z can be any of the 9 tiles in the 2D cardinal direction model.

Let me trace through some more examples to make sure.

Example 1:
- x: [1, 2] in longitude, [5, 6] in latitude.
- y: [4, 5] in longitude, [5, 6] in latitude.
- z: [0, 1] in longitude, [5, 6] in latitude.

Here, x is West of y (max_x = 2 < min_y = 4) and y is East of z (min_y = 4 > max_z = 1). But x is East of z (min_x = 1 > max_z = 1).

Wait, actually there might be a mistake I'm making in the comparisons. Let me try to be more careful:

- x is West of y (max_x = 2 < min_y = 4)
- y is East of z (min_y = 4 > max_z = 1)

For x to be East of z: min_x > max_z, which is 1 > 1. This is not true, so x is not East of z. But x is not West of z either, because the condition max_x < min_z is not met. Instead, x and z overlap in longitude, and specifically, the minimum longitude of both x and z is the same.

Let me try another example.

Example 2:
- x: [1, 2] in longitude, [5, 6] in latitude.
- y: [4, 5] in longitude, [5, 6] in latitude.
- z: [3, 3.5] in longitude, [5, 6] in latitude.

Here, x is West of y (max_x = 2 < min_y = 4) and y is East of z (min_y = 4 > max_z = 3.5). And x is West of z (max_x = 2 < min_z = 3).

Example 3:
- x: [2, 3] in longitude, [5, 6] in latitude.
- y: [4, 5] in longitude, [5, 6] in latitude.
- z: [0, 1] in longitude, [5, 6] in latitude.

Here, x is West of y (max_x = 3 < min_y = 4) and y is East of z (min_y = 4 > max_z = 1). And x is East of z (min_x = 2 > max_z = 1).

So, it seems that, based on the given constraints, x can be West of z, East of z, or overlap with z in the East-West direction. And without any constraints on the North-South direction, all relations are possible in that direction.

Let's be a bit more precise. East/West only constrains the x-coordinate, and North/South only constrains the y-coordinate.

Given the constraints on the East-West direction:
- x is West of y: max_x < min_y
- y is East of z: min_y > max_z

The possible relations between x and z in the East-West direction are:
1. x is West of z: max_x < min_z
2. z is West of x (or equivalently, x is East of z): max_z < min_x
3. x and z overlap in the East-West direction: neither of the above is true

For the North-South direction, without any given constraints, the possible relations are:
1. x is North of z: min_x_y > max_z_y (where the '_y' suffix indicates the y-coordinate)
2. z is North of x (or equivalently, x is South of z): min_z_y > max_x_y
3. x and z overlap in the North-South direction: neither of the above is true

Combining these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. North: x is at the same longitude as z, but to the north. This can happen if x and z overlap in the East-West direction (case 3 above) and x is North of z (case 1 above for North-South).
2. Northeast: x is to the east and north of z. This can happen if x is East of z (case 2 above) and x is North of z.
3. East: x is at the same latitude as z, but to the east. This can happen if x is East of z and x and z overlap in the North-South direction (case 3 above for North-South).
4. Southeast: x is to the east and south of z. This can happen if x is East of z and x is South of z.
5. South: x is at the same longitude as z, but to the south. This can happen if x and z overlap in the East-West direction and x is South of z.
6. Southwest: x is to the west and south of z. This can happen if x is West of z and x is South of z.
7. West: x is at the same latitude as z, but to the west. This can happen if x is West of z and x and z overlap in the North-South direction.
8. Northwest: x is to the west and north of z. This can happen if x is West of z and x is North of z.
9. Origin (or Overlap): x and z overlap in both East-West and North-South directions.

I think the answer to the question can be any of the 9 cardinal direction relations. But let me double check that I didn't make some error.

Given:
- x is West of y
- y is East of z

As previously discussed:
- x can be West of z, East of z, or overlap with z in the East-West direction.
- In the North-South direction, all relations are possible (North, South, or overlap).

Combining these, x can have any of the 9 cardinal direction relations with z: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box (Overlap).

But wait, I think that can't be right because intuitively, if x is west of y, and y is east of z, then x and z should have some constraints on their E-W relation, right? Let me think again.

Ah, maybe the issue is more subtle. 

Let's denote the coordinates of the regions as:
- x: [xW, xE] in the East-West direction, and [xS, xN] in the North-South direction.
- y: [yW, yE] in the East-West direction, and [yS, yN] in the North-South direction.
- z: [zW, zE] in the East-West direction, and [zS, zN] in the North-South direction.

Given:
- x is West of y: xE < yW
- y is East of z: yW > zE

Combining, we get: xE < yW > zE

But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between xE and zW, or between xW and zE. 

For x to be West of z, we need xE < zW, but the given constraints don't directly imply this.
For x to be East of z, we need xW > zE, but the given constraints don't directly imply this either.

Actually, let me try to find a counterexample for each. 

Suppose x can't be West of z. Then, xE ≥ zW. 

But does this contradict the given constraints? 
If xE < yW and yW > zE, can xE ≥ zW?

Well, from yW > zE, we can say that zW ≤ zE < yW. So, if xE ≥ zW, that's still consistent with xE < yW, because zW < yW.

So, x can be "not West of z" (i.e., x can overlap with z in the East-West direction or x can be East of z).

Similarly, suppose x can't be East of z. Then, xW ≤ zE. 

But does this contradict the given constraints? 
If xE < yW and yW > zE, can xW ≤ zE?

Well, from xE < yW, we can say that xW ≤ xE < yW. So, if xW ≤ zE, and given that zE < yW, that's still consistent with xW < yW.

So, x can be "not East of z" (i.e., x can overlap with z in the East-West direction or x can be West of z).

Therefore, x can be West of z, East of z, or overlap with z in the East-West direction. 

Given the freedom in the North-South direction, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are all the 9 possibilities: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box (Overlap).

But one more careful check, and thinking about it physically, I think the conclusion that x and z can have any of the 9 cardinal direction relations is correct. Here's a way to visualize it:

Imagine y is fixed. x is somewhere to the west of y, and z is somewhere to the east of y. But x and z can be positioned in various ways in the North-South direction. They can also be positioned such that x is either to the west of z, to the east of z, or overlaps with z in the East-West direction.

For example, consider this in the East-West direction:
1. x is entirely to the west of y: [1, 2]
2. y is entirely to the east of z: [5, 6]
3. z's range is [3, 4]

In this case, x is entirely to the west of z, and we have x West of z.

Now, consider this in the East-West direction:
1. x is entirely to the west of y: [3, 4]
2. y is entirely to the east of z: [5, 6]
3. z's range is [1, 2]

In this case, x is entirely to the east of z, and we have x East of z.

Finally, consider this in the East-West direction:
1. x is entirely to the west of y: [2, 3]
2. y is entirely to the east of z: [5, 6]
3. z's range is [2, 3]

In this case, x and z overlap in the East-West direction, and depending on their positions in the North-South direction, x can be North of z, South of z, or overlap with z in the North-South direction as well.

Okay, I think I've verified that the answer is that x and z can have any of the 9 cardinal direction relations.

Actually, wait. Let me think more carefully about the constraints. If we're saying that region x is West of region y, then the entirety of region x is to the west of the entirety of region y. 

Similarly, if region y is East of region z, then the entirety of region y is to the east of the entirety of region z.

This is a stronger constraint than I was considering earlier. It implies that there's no overlap between the East-West extents of the regions in the relations.

So, for the East-West direction:
- x is West of y: xE < yW (the eastmost point of x is to the west of the westmost point of y)
- y is East of z: yW > zE (the westmost point of y is to the east of the eastmost point of z)

Combining, we get: xE < yW > zE.

But what about the relation between xE and zE, or between xW and zW?

We need to rely on the transitivity property of West and East. If A is West of B, and B is West of C, then A is West of C.

But in our case, we have:
- x is West of y
- z is West of y (which is equivalent to saying y is East of z)

Since both x and z are West of y, the relations between x and z are not directly constrained.

Based on the constraints, both x and z can be to the west of y, but they can be positioned in various ways. x can be West of z, East of z, or overlap with z in the East-West direction.

And, without any constraints on the North-South direction, x can be North of z, South of z, or overlap with z in the North-South direction.

Combining these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are all the 9 possibilities.

Actually, let me try some specific examples to make sure.

Example 1:
- x is located at longitude [1, 2] and latitude [5, 6].
- y is located at longitude [3, 4] and latitude [5, 6].
- z is located at longitude [0, 1] and latitude [5, 6].

Here, x is West of y (xE = 2 < yW = 3) and y is East of z (yW = 3 > zE = 1). However, x is East of z (xW = 1 > zE = 1).

Wait, I made a mistake. Let me check again. For x to be East of z, I need xW > zE, but I have xW = 1 = zE, which is not strictly greater. So, x is not East of z. But x is not West of z either, because the condition xE < zW is not met (since xE = 2 > zW = 0). This means x and z overlap in the East-West direction. And since they have the same latitude range, x and z overlap.

Let me try another example.

Example 2:
- x is located at longitude [1, 2] and latitude [5, 6].
- y is located at longitude [3, 4] and latitude [5, 6].
- z is located at longitude [2, 3] and latitude [5, 6].

Here, x is West of y (xE = 2 < yW = 3) and y is East of z (yW = 3 > zE = 3). And, x is West of z (xE = 2 = zW, but I need xE < zW, so this is not strictly satisfied). 

Hmm, I think I'm making a computation error. For x to be West of z, I need xE < zW. Here, xE = 2 and zW = 2, so xE is not strictly less than zW. This means x is not West of z. And, for x to be East of z, I need xW > zE, but I have xW = 1 < zE = 3, so x is not East of z. Therefore, x and z overlap in the East-West direction. And, since they have the same latitude range, x and z overlap.

But clearly, x and z can be West of each other, or East of each other, or overlap. Let me try once more.

Example 3:
- x is located at longitude [1, 2] and latitude [5, 6].
- y is located at longitude [4, 5] and latitude [5, 6].
- z is located at longitude [3, 4] and latitude [5, 6].

Here, x is West of y (xE = 2 < yW = 4) and y is East of z (yW = 4 > zE = 4). And, x is West of z (xE = 2 < zW = 3).

Example 4:
- x is located at longitude [2, 3] and latitude [5, 6].
- y is located at longitude [4, 5] and latitude [5, 6].
- z is located at longitude [0, 1] and latitude [5, 6].

Here, x is West of y (xE = 3 < yW = 4) and y is East of z (yW = 4 > zE = 1). And, x is East of z (xW = 2 > zE = 1).

So, from these examples, it's clear that x can be West of z, East of z, or overlap with z in the East-West direction.

And, without any constraints on the North-South direction, all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible.

Actually, wait. With North, South, East, and West being the primary cardinal directions, and NE, NW, SE, SW being the combinations, there are 8 primary directions. The 9th relation is when regions overlap.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. North
2. Northeast
3. East
4. Southeast
5. South
6. Southwest
7. West
8. Northwest
9. Bounding Box (or Overlap)

Actually, wait. Let me check the options provided by the problem: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

Yes, these match with the 9 relations I've listed.

I feel the most confidence in the answer that the relation between x and z can be any of the 9 cardinal direction relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box (Overlap). This is because the given constraints don't provide enough information to restrict the possible relations between x and z.

Actually, this isn't quite right. I've been focusing on the spatial extent of the regions, but cardinal directions are usually points, not regions. But since we're talking about region x being West of region y, I think my analysis is appropriate.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y: The entirety of region x is to the west of the entirety of region y.
- Region y is East of region z: The entirety of region y is to the east of the entirety of region z.

As demonstrated through examples, region x can be West of region z, East of region z, or overlap with region z in the East-West direction. And without any constraints on the North-South direction, region x can have any relation with region z in that direction.

Therefore, all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z.

Actually, wait. Let me re-read the question: "Which could be the possible relations between region x and region z be?" It's asking for the possible relations, not the definite relation.

Yeah, so my answer seems right that all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible.

Let's re-list them:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
- Bounding Box (or Overlap)

Actually, Bounding Box is probably not the right name for the 9th relation. In the context of spatial reasoning, the 9th relation might be called "Overlap" or sometimes "Equal" if the regions are identical.

Okay, based on the reasoning above, the answer to the question "Which could be the possible relations between region x and region z be?" is that x and z can have any of the 9 cardinal direction relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Overlap.

One more important point: The question states "Let West and East be cardinal direction relations". I'm assuming that these are defined in the standard way, where West means that one region is entirely to the west of another, and East means one region is entirely to the east of another. 

But, let me just double check that I haven't missed any constraints.

If "x is West of y" means "the entirety of region x is to the west of the entirety of region y" and "y is East of z" means "the entirety of region y is to the east of the entirety of region z", then the relative positions of x, y, and z could be visualized as:

x lies to the west of y, and z lies to the west of y. But x and z can be positioned in various ways relative to each other.

So, my final answer is that, based on the given constraints, x and z can have any of the 9 cardinal direction relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Overlap.

Actually, I'm having second thoughts on whether the Overlap relation is possible. Let me check once more.

For x and z to overlap, they need to have some common area. This means their longitude ranges and latitude ranges both overlap.

Given:
- x is West of y: xE < yW
- y is East of z: yW > zE

From the second constraint, we have zE < yW. 

For x and z to overlap in the East-West direction, we need xW < zE and zW < xE. 

But we know xE < yW, which, combined with zE < yW, doesn't directly constrain the relation between xE and zE, or between xW and zW.

So, from the given constraints, it's still possible for x and z to overlap.

Let's check with a specific example:
- x is located at longitude [1, 2] and latitude [5, 6].
- y is located at longitude [3, 4] and latitude [5, 6].
- z is located at longitude [1.5, 2.5] and latitude [5, 6].

Here, x is West of y (xE = 2 < yW = 3) and y is East of z (yW = 3 > zE = 2.5). And, x and z overlap in the East-West direction since xW = 1 < zE = 2.5 and zW = 1.5 < xE = 2. And, since they have the same latitude range, x and z overlap.

So, the Overlap relation is indeed possible.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are all 9 possibilities, including the Overlap relation.

OK let me take a step back and think about what the question is asking carefully. 

The question is: "Let West and East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is West of region y and region y is East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Here, "cardinal direction relations" refers to the 8 primary compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) plus the Bounding Box (or Overlap) relation, making it 9 in total.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y.
- Region y is East of region z.

As I've demonstrated through multiple examples and reasoning, the relation between x and z can be any of the 9 cardinal direction relations. There's no constraint on their relative positions based on the given information.

Therefore, the answer to the question is that all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box (or Overlap).

Wait, I just realized something. Let me re-read the question: "If region x is West of region y and region y is East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

"which could the possible relations" means I need to give all the possible relations that can occur, not just one relation. 

Based on my analysis and examples, the relation between region x and region z can be any of the 9 cardinal direction relations. Therefore, the answer is that all 9 relations are possible.

This means the possible relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box (or Overlap).

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is East of region z

I need to determine all possible spatial relations between regions x and z.

When x is West of y, it means x is located entirely to the west of y.
When y is East of z, it means y is located entirely to the east of z.

From these constraints, we know that both x and z are positioned to the west of y, but their relative positions to each other are not directly constrained.

The possible relations between x and z are:

- North: x could be directly north of z (same longitude, different latitude)
- Northeast: x could be to the northeast of z
- East: x could be directly east of z
- Southeast: x could be to the southeast of z
- South: x could be directly south of z
- Southwest: x could be to the southwest of z
- West: x could be directly west of z
- Northwest: x could be to the northwest of z
- Bounding Box: x and z could overlap

All nine cardinal direction relations are possible between regions x and z.
