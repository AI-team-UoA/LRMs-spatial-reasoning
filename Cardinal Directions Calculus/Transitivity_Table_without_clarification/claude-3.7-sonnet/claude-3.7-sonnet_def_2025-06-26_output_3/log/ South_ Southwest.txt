PROMPT: Let  South and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

We need to determine the cardinal relation(s) that are possible between regions x and z, given that x is South of y, and y is Southwest of z.

Let's visualize this.

- x is South of y: This means x is directly below y.
- y is Southwest of z: This means y is below and to the left of z.

So, if x is directly below y, and y is below and to the left of z, where is x relative to z?

Let's consider this using a coordinate system where:
- North corresponds to the positive y-axis.
- East corresponds to the positive x-axis.
- South corresponds to the negative y-axis.
- West corresponds to the negative x-axis.
- Southwest corresponds to the negative x-axis and negative y-axis (diagonally).
- Southeast corresponds to the positive x-axis and negative y-axis (diagonally).
- Northeast corresponds to the positive x-axis and positive y-axis (diagonally).
- Northwest corresponds to the negative x-axis and positive y-axis (diagonally).

If y is at the origin (0, 0):
- x would be at (0, -a) for some a > 0 (since x is South of y).
- z would be at (b, c) for some b > 0 and c > 0 (since y is Southwest of z).

Now, x relative to z would be at (0, -a) relative to (b, c), which is (0-b, -a-c) = (-b, -a-c).

Since b > 0 and -a-c < 0 (because both a and c are positive), x is below and to the left of z, which corresponds to the Southwest direction.

But I think I need to be more careful here. Let me think about this differently.

Actually, it's best to define these directions using the centroids (center points) of the regions. Let's define the directions as follows:

- North: The centroid of x is directly above the centroid of y.
- South: The centroid of x is directly below the centroid of y.
- East: The centroid of x is directly to the right of the centroid of y.
- West: The centroid of x is directly to the left of the centroid of y.
- Northeast: The centroid of x is above and to the right of the centroid of y.
- Northwest: The centroid of x is above and to the left of the centroid of y.
- Southeast: The centroid of x is below and to the right of the centroid of y.
- Southwest: The centroid of x is below and to the left of the centroid of y.

Now, let's think through the problem:

- x is South of y: The centroid of x is directly below the centroid of y.
- y is Southwest of z: The centroid of y is below and to the left of the centroid of z.

If we place y at the origin (0, 0), then:
- x is at (0, -a) for some a > 0.
- z is at (b, c) for some b > 0 and c > 0.

Relative to z, x is at (-b, -a-c). Since -b < 0 and -a-c < 0, x is below and to the left of z, which corresponds to the Southwest direction.

But I think there's a subtlety I'm missing. The regions have areas, they're not just points. So, depending on the sizes and shapes of the regions, the cardinal relation could vary. For instance, if region x is very large, it might overlap with z in a way that makes it also South of z.

Actually, I need to step back. 

There's a standard framework for cardinal directions in qualitative spatial reasoning, known as the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC). In the CDC, the possible cardinal directions between two regions are determined by projecting the regions onto the x and y axes and then computing the relation between these projections.

But I'm getting too complex for this problem. Let's start with a simple approach: consider the cardinal direction between the centroids of the regions.

If:
- x is South of y (i.e., x's centroid is below y's centroid).
- y is Southwest of z (i.e., y's centroid is below and to the left of z's centroid).

Then we want to determine the relation between x and z.

Let's denote the coordinates of the centroids of x, y, and z as (x_x, x_y), (y_x, y_y), and (z_x, z_y), respectively.

If x is South of y, then:
- x_x = y_x (same horizontal position)
- x_y < y_y (x is below y)

If y is Southwest of z, then:
- y_x < z_x (y is to the left of z)
- y_y < z_y (y is below z)

Combining these:
- x_x = y_x < z_x (x is to the left of z)
- x_y < y_y < z_y (x is below z)

Since x is to the left of z and below z, the relation from x to z is Southwest.

But now I'm wondering if there are other possibilities. Let's rethink this from a more abstract, constraint-based perspective.

Let me represent the cardinal directions as constraints on the coordinates:

- North: y-coordinate is higher (y_b > y_a means b is North of a)
- South: y-coordinate is lower (y_b < y_a means b is South of a)
- East: x-coordinate is higher (x_b > x_a means b is East of a)
- West: x-coordinate is lower (x_b < x_a means b is West of a)
- Northeast: both x and y coordinates are higher (x_b > x_a and y_b > y_a means b is Northeast of a)
- Northwest: x-coordinate is lower, y-coordinate is higher (x_b < x_a and y_b > y_a means b is Northwest of a)
- Southeast: x-coordinate is higher, y-coordinate is lower (x_b > x_a and y_b < y_a means b is Southeast of a)
- Southwest: both x and y coordinates are lower (x_b < x_a and y_b < y_a means b is Southwest of a)

Now, if we say "x is South of y", we mean:
- x_x = y_x (same horizontal position)
- x_y < y_y (x is below y)

And if "y is Southwest of z", we mean:
- y_x < z_x (y is to the left of z)
- y_y < z_y (y is below z)

Combining:
- x_x = y_x < z_x (x is to the left of z)
- x_y < y_y < z_y (x is below z)

As I thought, this gives x as Southwest of z.

But let's think more general. What if I say "x is South of y" without the implicit assumption that they have the same x-coordinate? Then the constraint would be:
- x_y < y_y (x is below y)
- No constraint on x_x (they can have any horizontal relationship)

And for "y is Southwest of z", the constraints are:
- y_x < z_x (y is to the left of z)
- y_y < z_y (y is below z)

Combining:
- No direct constraint on the relationship between x_x and z_x. However, if we know that x_x = y_x, then x_x < z_x.
- x_y < y_y < z_y (x is below z)

This means x could be South, Southwest, or Southeast of z, depending on the relationship between x_x and z_x.

But I need to be more careful. The question refers to "cardinal direction relations", so we are using a formal system. I need to be precise. In most formalizations of cardinal directions:

1. The South relation means the y-coordinate is lower, without any constraint on the x-coordinate.
2. The Southwest relation means both the x and y coordinates are lower.

So, if "x is South of y", we only have the constraint x_y < y_y. And if "y is Southwest of z", we have the constraints y_x < z_x and y_y < z_y.

Let's try one more time, and look at the constraints:

- If x is South of y, then x_y < y_y. This means x is below y, but it can be to the left, directly below, or to the right of y.
- If y is Southwest of z, then y_x < z_x and y_y < z_y. This means y is to the left and below z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

We know that x_y < y_y < z_y, so x is definitely below z (i.e., x_y < z_y).

But we can't definitively say anything about the relationship between x_x and z_x. If x is directly South of y (i.e., x_x = y_x), then x_x < z_x, and x would be Southwest of z. But if x is Southeast of y (i.e., x_x > y_x), then the relationship between x_x and z_x depends on how much to the right x is compared to y. If x_x > z_x, then x would be Southeast of z. If x_x = z_x, then x would be South of z. And if x_x < z_x, then x would be Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Let me double-check with another approach. I'll draw a diagram to visualize the possible positions.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Then, y is Southwest of z, which means y is at a position (-a, -b) for some a, b > 0.

Now, x is South of y, which means x is at position (-a, -b-c) for some c > 0 if x is directly South of y. But more generally, x could be at position (-a+d, -b-c) for any d, where d represents how much to the right or left x is compared to y.

If d < 0, then x is to the left of y, and thus x is Southwest of z.
If d = 0, then x is directly below y, and thus x is also Southwest of z.
If d > 0, then x is to the right of y. If d < a, then x is still to the left of z, so x is Southwest of z. If d = a, then x is directly below z, so x is South of z. If d > a, then x is to the right of z, so x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: South, Southwest, and Southeast, which is consistent with my earlier analysis. This makes sense because if x is South of y, then x is definitely below y, but it can be to the left, directly below, or to the right of y. And since y is Southwest of z, the relation from x to z depends on the exact position of x relative to y.

Actually, just to double-check further, let me try a slightly different approach.

Let's place y at the origin (0, 0).

If x is South of y, then x is at position (0, -a) for some a > 0 if x is directly South of y. More generally, x is at position (b, -a) for any b, where b represents how much to the right or left x is compared to y.

If y is Southwest of z, then z is at position (c, d) for some c, d > 0.

So, the relative position of x compared to z is (b, -a) relative to (c, d), which is (b-c, -a-d).

Since -a-d < 0 (as both a and d are positive), x is below z.

The horizontal relationship depends on the value of b compared to c:
- If b < c, then x is to the left of z, so x is Southwest of z.
- If b = c, then x is directly below z, so x is South of z.
- If b > c, then x is to the right of z, so x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: South, Southwest, and Southeast, which is consistent with my earlier analyses.

So, my final answer is that the possible relations from x to z are: South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Actually, let me just double-check this, to be sure.

The question gives us that "x is South of y" and "y is Southwest of z".

Using the standard interpretation of cardinal direction relations:
- South means "directly below". This implies that x and y have the same x-coordinate.
- Southwest means "below and to the left". This implies that y has a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z.

So, if x is directly below y, and y is below and to the left of z, then x is below and to the left of z, which is Southwest.

But wait, I was just assuming the interpretation where "South" means "directly below". Let me check if there are other common interpretations.

Actually, in the formal study of cardinal direction relations, there are different frameworks. Two commonly used ones are:

1. Point-based model: This treats the regions as points, and the cardinal direction is based on the position of the point of the target region relative to the point of the reference region.

2. Region-based model: This takes into account the actual shapes and sizes of the regions. The most commonly used is the 9-intersection model, which divides the space around a region into 9 tiles: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the region itself.

In the point-based model, the cardinal directions are as I've been describing, based on the relation between the centroids of the regions.

In the region-based model, the relations are a bit more complex. For example, in the 9-intersection model, if we say "x is South of y", it means that the entire region x is in the South tile of y.

Given that the question doesn't specify which model to use, I should consider both. But the simpler point-based model is more intuitive, so I'll stick with that for now.

Using the point-based model, if we say "x is South of y", it means that the centroid of x is directly below the centroid of y. This implies that the x-coordinates of the centroids of x and y are the same.

And if "y is Southwest of z", it means that the centroid of y is below and to the left of the centroid of z. This implies that the centroid of y has a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than the centroid of z.

Combining these, the centroid of x is below and to the left of the centroid of z, which means x is Southwest of z.

However, if we're using a different interpretation of "South" (which I have been discussing), where it only constrains the y-coordinate (meaning x is below y, but not necessarily directly below), then the possible relations from x to z would be South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Let me check the definition of cardinal direction relations in the Point-based model:

In the Point-based model:
- South: y-coordinate is smaller, x-coordinate is the same. (x_a = x_b, y_a < y_b means a is South of b)
- Southwest: both x and y coordinates are smaller. (x_a < x_b, y_a < y_b means a is Southwest of b)

With these definitions, if x is South of y, and y is Southwest of z, then:
- x_x = y_x (since x is South of y)
- x_y < y_y (since x is South of y)
- y_x < z_x (since y is Southwest of z)
- y_y < z_y (since y is Southwest of z)

Combining these:
- x_x = y_x < z_x (since x_x = y_x and y_x < z_x)
- x_y < y_y < z_y (since x_y < y_y and y_y < z_y)

So, x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y, which means x is Southwest of z.

Let me see if there are other ways to view cardinal directions.

In the literature on cardinal direction relations, there are different ways to define "South" and other cardinal directions. One common approach is to define "South" as a binary relation that holds when the target region is entirely below the reference region. This doesn't necessarily mean they have the same x-coordinate; it just means there's no overlap when projecting onto the y-axis.

In this view, "x is South of y" would mean that the y-coordinate of every point in x is less than the y-coordinate of every point in y. And "y is Southwest of z" would mean that the x-coordinate of every point in y is less than the x-coordinate of every point in z, and the y-coordinate of every point in y is less than the y-coordinate of every point in z.

With these definitions, if x is South of y, then every point in x is below every point in y. And if y is Southwest of z, then every point in y is below and to the left of every point in z.

So, every point in x is below every point in y, and every point in y is below and to the left of every point in z. This means every point in x is below every point in z. The horizontal relationship depends on the relative positions of x and y, and y and z.

Actually, I think I need to just be direct, and not get too far in the weeds.

In the standard Cardinal Direction Calculus:
- South: The target is entirely below the reference.
- Southwest: The target is entirely below and to the left of the reference.

Given:
- x is South of y: This means x is entirely below y, but its horizontal position is not constrained.
- y is Southwest of z: This means y is entirely below and to the left of z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

We know that x is entirely below y, and y is entirely below z. So, x is entirely below z.

The horizontal position of x relative to z depends on the exact positions:

If x is directly below y (has the same x-coordinate), then x is entirely to the left of z (since y is entirely to the left of z). This gives a Southwest relation from x to z.

If x is to the left of y, then x is even more to the left of z. This also gives a Southwest relation from x to z.

If x is to the right of y, but still entirely to the left of z, then the relation from x to z is also Southwest.

If x is to the right of y and has some overlap with z horizontally, then the relation from x to z is South.

If x is to the right of y and is entirely to the right of z, then the relation from x to z is Southeast.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

I think the approach I was using above assumed a point-based model, where regions are represented by their centroids. But the question asks about "region x" and "region y", so I should be using a region-based model.

In the projection-based model (a common region-based model), the space is partitioned into 9 regions based on the projection of the reference region onto the x and y axes:

- Mnemonic: NW, N, NE
              W, 0, E
              SW, S, SE

If "x is South of y", then x is entirely in the South partition of y.
If "y is Southwest of z", then y is entirely in the Southwest partition of z.

Let's visualize this:

z is the reference for y, and y is entirely in the Southwest partition of z. This means y is entirely below and to the left of z.

y is the reference for x, and x is entirely in the South partition of y. This means x is entirely below y.

So, x is entirely below y, and y is entirely below and to the left of z. This means x is entirely below z.

The horizontal position of x relative to z depends on the exact positions, as I discussed earlier.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

I think the confusion is about what "South" and "Southwest" actually mean in this context, and I ended up thinking about it too much.

Actually, South means "every point in the target region is below some point in the reference region and every point in the reference region is above some point in the target region." It doesn't constrain the horizontal (East-West) relationship.

Southwest means "every point in the target region is below and to the left of some point in the reference region and every point in the reference region is above and to the right of some point in the target region."

So if:
- x is South of y: Every point in x is below some point in y, and every point in y is above some point in x.
- y is Southwest of z: Every point in y is below and to the left of some point in z, and every point in z is above and to the right of some point in y.

Given these, we can determine that:
- x is entirely below y.
- y is entirely below and to the left of z.

Therefore, x is entirely below z. The horizontal position of x relative to z depends on the exact positions, which can lead to different relations: Southwest, South, or Southeast.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Wait, actually I just realized. Given the constraint that "x is South of y", x could be to the left, directly below, or to the right of y, as I've discussed. And given the constraint that "y is Southwest of z", y is below and to the left of z.

If x is to the left of y, then x is even more to the left of z. This gives a Southwest relation from x to z.

If x is directly below y (has the same x-coordinate), then x is entirely to the left of z (since y is entirely to the left of z). This also gives a Southwest relation from x to z.

If x is to the right of y, but still entirely to the left of z, then the relation from x to z is also Southwest.

If x is to the right of y and has some overlap with z horizontally, then the relation from x to z is South.

If x is to the right of y and is entirely to the right of z, then the relation from x to z is Southeast.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually, let me think about this problem step by step again.

Let's define the cardinal directions precisely. I'll use the commonly accepted definitions from the region-based model. There are different models, but let's go with the projection-based model, where the space is partitioned into 9 regions based on the projection of the reference region onto the x and y axes:

- North (N): The target is entirely above the reference.
- Northeast (NE): The target is entirely above and to the right of the reference.
- East (E): The target is entirely to the right of the reference.
- Southeast (SE): The target is entirely below and to the right of the reference.
- South (S): The target is entirely below the reference.
- Southwest (SW): The target is entirely below and to the left of the reference.
- West (W): The target is entirely to the left of the reference.
- Northwest (NW): The target is entirely above and to the left of the reference.
- Bounding Box (O): The target overlaps with the reference.

Given:
- x is South of y: This means x is entirely below y.
- y is Southwest of z: This means y is entirely below and to the left of z.

From these, we know:
1. x is entirely below y.
2. y is entirely below z.
3. y is entirely to the left of z.

From 1 and 2, we can determine that x is entirely below z.

The horizontal relationship between x and z depends on the exact positions of x and y:
- If x is entirely to the left of z, then the relation from x to z is Southwest.
- If x and z have some horizontal overlap, then the relation from x to z is South.
- If x is entirely to the right of z, then the relation from x to z is Southeast.

But we need to determine when each of these scenarios can occur.

From 3, we know that y is entirely to the left of z. But the horizontal relationship between x and y is not constrained by "x is South of y".

If x is entirely to the left of y, then x is definitely entirely to the left of z. This gives a Southwest relation from x to z.

If x and y have some horizontal overlap, then the rightmost edge of x can be at most at the rightmost edge of y. Since y is entirely to the left of z, x is also entirely to the left of z. This again gives a Southwest relation from x to z.

If x is entirely to the right of y, then there are three possibilities for the horizontal relationship between x and z:
- If x is entirely to the left of z, the relation from x to z is Southwest.
- If x and z have some horizontal overlap, the relation from x to z is South.
- If x is entirely to the right of z, the relation from x to z is Southeast.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me think again from the constraints. It's not just about the relationship between x and y. 

Given:
- x is South of y: x is entirely below y.
- y is Southwest of z: y is entirely below and to the left of z.

From these, we can deduce:
1. x is entirely below y.
2. y is entirely below z.
3. y is entirely to the left of z.

From 1 and 2, we have x is entirely below z. And from 1 and 3, we know that the horizontal relationship between x and z is less constrained.

But actually, I need to think what the constraint "x is South of y" tells us about the horizontal relationship between x and y. It only tells us that x is entirely below y, but says nothing about the horizontal relationship.

So, x could be entirely to the left of y, have some horizontal overlap with y, or be entirely to the right of y. 

If x is entirely to the left of y, then given that y is entirely to the left of z, x is entirely to the left of z. This gives a Southwest relation from x to z.

If x has some horizontal overlap with y, then the rightmost edge of x is either within y's horizontal extent or to the right of y's rightmost edge. If it's within y's horizontal extent, then x is entirely to the left of z (since y is entirely to the left of z). This gives a Southwest relation from x to z. If the rightmost edge of x is to the right of y's rightmost edge, then we need to compare it with z's leftmost edge. If the rightmost edge of x is to the left of z's leftmost edge, then x is entirely to the left of z, giving a Southwest relation. If there's an overlap, the relation is South. If x is entirely to the right of z, the relation is Southeast.

If x is entirely to the right of y, then we again need to compare the rightmost edge of x with z's leftmost edge. The same logic applies.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually, I think I was overthinking this problem, and the reasoning above is correct. But I want to check if there's a more straightforward way to understand this. In this case, we're dealing with a composition of cardinal direction relations: South and Southwest.

Let's first see what "South" means. Intuitively, if x is South of y, then x is entirely below y.

This means the y-coordinate of the uppermost point of x is less than or equal to the y-coordinate of the lowermost point of y.

Mathematically, if the y-range of x is [x_min_y, x_max_y] and the y-range of y is [y_min_y, y_max_y], then x_max_y <= y_min_y.

Similarly, for "Southwest", if y is Southwest of z, then y is entirely below and to the left of z.

This means the y-coordinate of the uppermost point of y is less than or equal to the y-coordinate of the lowermost point of z, and the x-coordinate of the rightmost point of y is less than or equal to the x-coordinate of the leftmost point of z.

Mathematically, if the y-range of y is [y_min_y, y_max_y], the y-range of z is [z_min_y, z_max_y], the x-range of y is [y_min_x, y_max_x], and the x-range of z is [z_min_x, z_max_x], then y_max_y <= z_min_y and y_max_x <= z_min_x.

From the given constraints, we have:
- x_max_y <= y_min_y (since x is South of y)
- y_max_y <= z_min_y (since y is Southwest of z)
- y_max_x <= z_min_x (since y is Southwest of z)

We can conclude that x_max_y <= y_min_y <= z_min_y, which means x is entirely below z. So, the y-relationship is clear: x is below z.

However, the x-relationship is not fully constrained. We only know that y_max_x <= z_min_x.

For x to be Southwest of z, we need x_max_x <= z_min_x. This will be true if x_max_x <= y_max_x.

For x to be South of z, we need x_min_x <= z_min_x <= z_max_x <= x_max_x. This will be true if x_min_x <= z_min_x and z_max_x <= x_max_x.

For x to be Southeast of z, we need z_max_x <= x_min_x. This will be true if y_max_x <= z_max_x <= x_min_x.

Without more information, any of these scenarios is possible. So, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually, I should note that when we refer to "South", we typically mean "every point in the target region is below some point in the reference region and every point in the reference region is above some point in the target region."

This is more accurately described as "strict South", where the target is entirely below the reference. Similarly, "strict Southwest" means the target is entirely below and to the left of the reference.

Given the nature of the question, I believe we're referring to these strict relations. Let's verify my reasoning.

The constraint "x is South of y" means that x is entirely below y, but the horizontal position of x relative to y is not constrained.

The constraint "y is Southwest of z" means that y is entirely below and to the left of z.

Based on these constraints:
1. x is entirely below y.
2. y is entirely below z.
3. y is entirely to the left of z.

From 1 and 2, we know that x is entirely below z. This is a necessary condition for the relations Southwest, South, and Southeast from x to z.

From 3, we know that y is entirely to the left of z. However, the horizontal position of x relative to y is not constrained by "x is South of y".

For x to be Southwest of z, x needs to be entirely to the left of z. This is possible if x is entirely to the left of y or if x overlaps with y horizontally (since y is entirely to the left of z).

For x to be South of z, x needs to have some horizontal overlap with z. This is possible if x is to the right of y and overlaps with z horizontally.

For x to be Southeast of z, x needs to be entirely to the right of z. This is possible if x is to the right of y and is entirely to the right of z.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Yes, that's consistent with my reasoning above. So to be clear:

Let's see what we know:
- x is South of y, which means x is below y.
- y is Southwest of z, which means y is below and to the left of z.

From this, we can derive:
- x is below y.
- y is below z.
- Therefore, x is below z.

And:
- y is to the left of z.
- The horizontal relationship between x and y is not specified.

So, the possible horizontal relationships between x and z are:
- x is to the left of z. Combined with "x is below z", this gives the relation "Southwest".
- x overlaps with z horizontally. Combined with "x is below z", this gives the relation "South".
- x is to the right of z. Combined with "x is below z", this gives the relation "Southeast".

Therefore, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

OK, so we need to know the relation between x and z. I know:
- x is South of y
- y is Southwest of z

Immediately I know:
- y is below z
- y is to the left of z
- x is below y

Based on the transitive property of "below", we know that x is below z.

Now, for the horizontal relationship:
- y is to the left of z.
- x's horizontal relationship to y is not constrained by "x is South of y".

So, x could be to the left of z (giving a Southwest relation), horizontally overlapping with z (giving a South relation), or to the right of z (giving a Southeast relation).

Therefore, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually, there's something that I've been glossing over. When I say "x is below y", I'm ignoring the fact that x and y can overlap vertically, as long as no part of x is above y and no part of y is below x. But I think this level of nuance is unnecessary for this problem.

My reasoning is correct, and the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

I have a slight discomfort with this solution, but I think it's just due to the nature of my overthinking rather than a genuine issue with the solution. I'll double-check: the question asks for "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", which is exactly what I've been trying to answer.

Given the constraints "x is South of y" and "y is Southwest of z", the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast. These are the only possibilities, as I've argued above.

Actually wait, let me think about this one more time. Maybe I'm making things too complicated.

I have:
1. x is South of y
2. y is Southwest of z

From 1, we know x is entirely below y.
From 2, we know y is entirely below and to the left of z.

From these two facts, we know:
- x is entirely below y, which is entirely below z. So, x is entirely below z.
- y is entirely to the left of z.

The horizontal position of x is not constrained by "x is South of y". It could be entirely to the left of y, overlapping with y horizontally, or entirely to the right of y.

If x is entirely to the left of y or overlapping with y, then x is entirely to the left of z, giving a Southwest relation.

If x is entirely to the right of y, there are three possibilities for the horizontal relationship between x and z:
- x is entirely to the left of z, giving a Southwest relation.
- x overlaps with z horizontally, giving a South relation.
- x is entirely to the right of z, giving a Southeast relation.

So, the possible relations from x to z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

(I think the confusion stemmed from thinking that there's a stricter definition of "South" that constrains the horizontal position, but in the cardinal direction calculus, "South" only constrains the vertical position.)

So my final answer is: the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, South, and Southeast.

ANSWER:

The question asks for possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given that x is South of y and y is Southwest of z.

To determine this:

1) From "x is South of y": x is directly below y
2) From "y is Southwest of z": y is below and to the left of z

We know that x is below y, and y is below z, so x must be below z.

For the horizontal relationship:
- y is to the left of z
- The horizontal relationship between x and y is not specified by "South"

Therefore, x could be:
- Southwest of z (if x is to the left of z)
- South of z (if x is directly below z)
- Southeast of z (if x is to the right of z)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: South, Southwest, Southeast.
