PROMPT: Let  Southeast and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southeast of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relationships between region x and region z based on the given information.

Given:
- Region x is Southeast of region y
- Region y is North of region z

I'll work through this step by step using the properties of cardinal direction relations.

First, let me understand what each relation means in terms of relative positioning:
- Southeast: If x is Southeast of y, then x is both East and South of y
- North: If y is North of z, then z is South of y

Now, let's trace the relationship from x to z:
- x is Southeast of y → x is East and South of y
- y is North of z → y is directly above z (z is South of y)

To find the relationship between x and z, I need to combine these facts.

Let's visualize this with a coordinate system where:
- North means increasing y-coordinate
- East means increasing x-coordinate

If:
- y is North of z, then y has a higher y-coordinate than z
- x is Southeast of y, then x has a higher x-coordinate than y (East) and a lower y-coordinate than y (South)

So if:
- z is at position (xz, yz)
- y is at position (xy, yy) where xy = xz (same x-coordinate) and yy > yz (higher y-coordinate)
- x is at position (xx, yx) where xx > xy (higher x-coordinate) and yx < yy (lower y-coordinate)

The question is: what is the relationship between x and z based on their coordinates?

We know:
- xx > xy (x is East of y)
- yx < yy (x is South of y)
- xy = xz (assuming y is directly North of z)
- yy > yz (y is North of z)

Therefore:
- xx > xz (x is East of z)
- For the y-coordinate comparison between x and z:
  - We know yx < yy and yy > yz
  - But we don't know directly how yx compares to yz

There are three possibilities:
1. If yx > yz: x would be Northeast of z
2. If yx = yz: x would be East of z
3. If yx < yz: x would be Southeast of z

Wait, I think I made a mistake. I shouldn't assume xy = xz. Let me reconsider.

If y is North of z, it means y has the same x-coordinate as z and a higher y-coordinate.
If x is Southeast of y, it means x has a higher x-coordinate than y and a lower y-coordinate.

So:
- z is at position (xz, yz)
- y is at position (xz, yz+d) where d > 0 (y is directly North of z)
- x is at position (xz+e, yz+d-f) where e > 0 and f > 0 (x is Southeast of y)

Now, comparing x and z:
- x-coordinate: xz+e > xz (x is East of z)
- y-coordinate: (yz+d-f) compared to yz
  - This simplifies to: yz+d-f compared to yz
  - Or: d-f compared to 0

Three cases:
1. If d > f: Then yz+d-f > yz, meaning x is Northeast of z
2. If d = f: Then yz+d-f = yz, meaning x is East of z
3. If d < f: Then yz+d-f < yz, meaning x is Southeast of z

Actually, I've been too restrictive. Let me approach this differently.

Given:
- x is Southeast of y
- y is North of z

Let me use the standard definitions:
- "Southeast" means the region is in the southeast quadrant
- "North" means the region is in the northern half-plane

For y being North of z:
- y must be in the northern half-plane relative to z
- This means y can be anywhere in the northern half: Northwest, North, or Northeast of z

For x being Southeast of y:
- x must be in the southeast quadrant relative to y

Now, to find the possible relationships between x and z:

If y is directly North of z:
- x could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of z

If y is Northeast of z:
- x could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of z

If y is Northwest of z:
- x could be North, Northeast, East, Southeast, or South of z

I think I should make a more systematic analysis. Let me try a different approach.

Let's represent regions as points for simplicity.

If y is North of z:
- In terms of coordinates, if z is at (0,0), then y is at (y₁, y₂) where y₂ > 0 and y₁ can be any value

If x is Southeast of y:
- In terms of coordinates, x is at (x₁, x₂) where x₁ > y₁ and x₂ < y₂

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we need to compare (x₁, x₂) with (0,0):
- x₁ > y₁ (from x is Southeast of y)
- We don't know the relationship between y₁ and 0, so x₁ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0
- x₂ < y₂ (from x is Southeast of y)
- y₂ > 0 (from y is North of z)
- So we don't know if x₂ > 0, = 0, or < 0

Wait, I'm not being precise enough. Let me clarify the definitions:

- "y is North of z" means y is in the northern half-plane of z, so if z is at (0,0), then y is at (y₁, y₂) where y₂ > 0 and y₁ can be any value.
- "x is Southeast of y" means x is in the southeast quadrant of y, so x is at (x₁, x₂) where x₁ > y₁ and x₂ < y₂.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we need to compare (x₁, x₂) with (0,0):

For the x-coordinate:
- We know x₁ > y₁
- But we don't know if y₁ > 0, y₁ = 0, or y₁ < 0
- So x₁ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0

For the y-coordinate:
- We know x₂ < y₂ and y₂ > 0
- But this doesn't tell us if x₂ > 0, x₂ = 0, or x₂ < 0

Given these constraints, x could be in any of these positions relative to z:
- North (if x₁ = 0 and x₂ > 0)
- Northeast (if x₁ > 0 and x₂ > 0)
- East (if x₁ > 0 and x₂ = 0)
- Southeast (if x₁ > 0 and x₂ < 0)
- South (if x₁ = 0 and x₂ < 0)
- Southwest (if x₁ < 0 and x₂ < 0)
- West (if x₁ < 0 and x₂ = 0)
- Northwest (if x₁ < 0 and x₂ > 0)

Wait, I've missed something important. Let me be more precise about the constraints.

Given:
- y is North of z
- x is Southeast of y

We can set up a coordinate system where z is at the origin (0,0).

If y is North of z:
- y is at coordinates (y₁, y₂) where y₂ > 0 and y₁ can be any value

If x is Southeast of y:
- x is at coordinates (x₁, x₂) where x₁ > y₁ and x₂ < y₂

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we compare (x₁, x₂) with (0,0):

For the x-coordinate:
- We know x₁ > y₁
- If y₁ > 0, then x₁ > 0 (x is East of z)
- If y₁ = 0, then x₁ > 0 (x is East of z)
- If y₁ < 0, then x₁ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0 (x could be East, on the same meridian, or West of z)

For the y-coordinate:
- We know x₂ < y₂ and y₂ > 0
- This means x₂ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0 (x could be North, on the same parallel, or South of z)

Given these constraints, x could be in any of these positions relative to z:
- Northeast (if x₁ > 0 and x₂ > 0)
- East (if x₁ > 0 and x₂ = 0)
- Southeast (if x₁ > 0 and x₂ < 0)
- North (if x₁ = 0 and x₂ > 0) - but this requires y₁ < 0, which is possible
- South (if x₁ = 0 and x₂ < 0) - but this requires y₁ < 0, which is possible
- Northwest (if x₁ < 0 and x₂ > 0) - but this requires y₁ < 0, which is possible
- West (if x₁ < 0 and x₂ = 0) - but this requires y₁ < 0, which is possible
- Southwest (if x₁ < 0 and x₂ < 0) - but this requires y₁ < 0, which is possible

I think I might still be missing something. Let me reconsider one more time.

Given:
- y is North of z
- x is Southeast of y

Using a coordinate system with z at origin (0,0):

If y is North of z:
- y is at (y₁, y₂) where y₂ > 0

If x is Southeast of y:
- x is at (x₁, x₂) where x₁ > y₁ and x₂ < y₂

To find possible relationships between x and z, I need to determine possible values of x₁ and x₂ relative to 0.

For x₁:
- We know x₁ > y₁
- Since y is North of z, y₁ could be positive, zero, or negative
- If y₁ ≥ 0, then x₁ > 0 (x is East of z)
- If y₁ < 0, then x₁ could be positive, zero, or negative

For x₂:
- We know x₂ < y₂
- We also know y₂ > 0
- So x₂ could be positive, zero, or negative

Given all possible combinations of x₁ and x₂ relative to 0, x could be:
- Northeast of z (if x₁ > 0 and x₂ > 0)
- East of z (if x₁ > 0 and x₂ = 0)
- Southeast of z (if x₁ > 0 and x₂ < 0)
- North of z (if x₁ = 0 and x₂ > 0) - possible if y₁ < 0
- South of z (if x₁ = 0 and x₂ < 0) - possible if y₁ < 0
- Northwest of z (if x₁ < 0 and x₂ > 0) - possible if y₁ < 0
- West of z (if x₁ < 0 and x₂ = 0) - possible if y₁ < 0
- Southwest of z (if x₁ < 0 and x₂ < 0) - possible if y₁ < 0

I need to be careful about the "possible if y₁ < 0" cases. Let's analyze more carefully.

If y is North of z, it means y is anywhere in the northern half-plane of z. 
If x is Southeast of y, it means x is in the southeast quadrant relative to y.

Let me consider different cases for the position of y relative to z:

Case 1: y is directly North of z (y₁ = 0, y₂ > 0)
- x is Southeast of y, so x is at (x₁, x₂) where x₁ > 0 and x₂ < y₂
- Comparing with z at (0,0):
  - x₁ > 0, so x is East of z
  - x₂ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0
  - Therefore, x could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of z

Case 2: y is Northeast of z (y₁ > 0, y₂ > 0)
- x is Southeast of y, so x is at (x₁, x₂) where x₁ > y₁ > 0 and x₂ < y₂
- Comparing with z:
  - x₁ > 0, so x is East of z
  - x₂ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0
  - Therefore, x could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of z

Case 3: y is Northwest of z (y₁ < 0, y₂ > 0)
- x is Southeast of y, so x is at (x₁, x₂) where x₁ > y₁ and x₂ < y₂
- Since y₁ < 0, x₁ could be < 0, = 0, or > 0
- Comparing with z:
  - If x₁ < 0: x is West of z
  - If x₁ = 0: x is on the same meridian as z
  - If x₁ > 0: x is East of z
  - x₂ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0
  - Therefore, x could be Northwest, North, Northeast, West, East, Southwest, South, or Southeast of z

Summarizing all cases, x could be:
- Northeast of z
- East of z
- Southeast of z
- North of z (if y is sufficiently Northwest of z)
- Northwest of z (if y is Northwest of z)
- West of z (if y is Northwest of z)
- Southwest of z (if y is Northwest of z)
- South of z (if y is Northwest of z)

Actually, I realized that I need to be careful about "bounding box" relation too. Let me revise my analysis.

In qualitative spatial reasoning with cardinal directions, I should use the 9-intersection model:
- 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- The "bounding box" or "contains/inside" relation

Given:
- y is North of z
- x is Southeast of y

Let's place z at the origin (0,0) and analyze:

If y is North of z, then y is in the northern half-plane relative to z.
If x is Southeast of y, then x is in the southeast quadrant relative to y.

Case 1: y is directly North of z
- If x is Southeast of y, then x is to the right and below y
- Relative to z, x could be:
  - Northeast (if still above z)
  - East (if at the same latitude as z)
  - Southeast (if below z)

Case 2: y is Northeast of z
- If x is Southeast of y, then x is to the right and below y
- Relative to z, x could be:
  - Northeast (if still above z)
  - East (if at the same latitude as z)
  - Southeast (if below z)

Case 3: y is Northwest of z
- If x is Southeast of y, then x is to the right and below y
- Relative to z, x could be:
  - Northwest (if to the left of z and above it)
  - North (if directly above z)
  - Northeast (if to the right of z and above it)
  - West (if to the left of z at the same latitude)
  - East (if to the right of z at the same latitude)
  - Southwest (if to the left of z and below it)
  - South (if directly below z)
  - Southeast (if to the right of z and below it)

Considering all cases, x could be in any of these positions relative to z:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

But the "bounding box" relation is not possible because for that, x would need to contain z, which cannot happen given the constraints that x is Southeast of y and y is North of z.

Hmm, actually I need to be even more precise about the definitions.

In the standard cardinal direction calculus:
- "y is North of z" means y is in the northern half-plane of z
- "x is Southeast of y" means x is in the southeast quadrant of y

Let me analyze case by case, placing z at the origin (0,0):

Case 1: y is directly North of z (y₁ = 0, y₂ > 0)
- x is Southeast of y, so x₁ > 0 and x₂ < y₂
- Comparing with z at (0,0):
  - x₁ > 0, so x is East of the meridian passing through z
  - x₂ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0
  - So x could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of z

Case 2: y is in the Northeast quadrant of z (y₁ > 0, y₂ > 0)
- x is Southeast of y, so x₁ > y₁ > 0 and x₂ < y₂
- Comparing with z:
  - x₁ > 0, so x is East of the meridian passing through z
  - x₂ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0
  - So x could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of z

Case 3: y is in the Northwest quadrant of z (y₁ < 0, y₂ > 0)
- x is Southeast of y, so x₁ > y₁ and x₂ < y₂
- Comparing with z:
  - If y₁ < 0 and x₁ > y₁, then x₁ could be < 0, = 0, or > 0
  - x₂ < y₂, and y₂ > 0, so x₂ could be > 0, = 0, or < 0
  - So x could be in any of the 8 cardinal directions relative to z (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)

Considering all cases, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

The "bounding box" relation is not possible because x and z are points (or regions with non-zero area, but the cardinal relation refers to their relative positions, not containment).

Wait, I need to be careful about my use of the term "bounding box". In qualitative spatial reasoning, the "bounding box" relation is when one region contains another. Since we're dealing with regions (not points), it's theoretically possible for x to contain z.

Let me reconsider with regions:

If y is North of z:
- The reference point of y is in the northern half-plane of z
- The extent of y could overlap with z in some cardinal directions

If x is Southeast of y:
- The reference point of x is in the southeast quadrant of y
- The extent of x could overlap with y in some cardinal directions

Given these constraints, is it possible for x to contain z (bounding box relation)?

For x to contain z, x would need to extend far enough to completely surround z. However, since x is Southeast of y and y is North of z, it's unlikely that x would extend far enough to contain z completely.

But let me think more carefully. If y is only slightly North of z and x is Southeast of y but very large, it might be possible for x to contain z.

Actually, I think the "bounding box" relation is possible in some cases, but I need to be careful about the exact definitions and constraints.

Hmm, I realized that I need to clarify what exact model of cardinal directions we're using. There are several models:

1. Point-based model: Regions are reduced to their centroids
2. Projection-based model: Uses the minimum bounding rectangle
3. Cone-based model: Divides space into cones
4. Other variants

Since the question mentions "Bounding Box" as a possible answer, I'll assume we're using the projection-based model, specifically the Rectangle Algebra, where regions are represented by their minimum bounding rectangles.

In this model:
- "y is North of z" means the entire region y is in the northern half-plane of z
- "x is Southeast of y" means the entire region x is in the southeast quadrant of y

Given these definitions:

Case 1: y is North of z
- All of y is above z
- x is Southeast of y, so all of x is to the right and below y
- Relative to z, x could be:
  - East (if x is directly to the right of z)
  - Southeast (if x is to the right and below z)
  - South (if x is directly below z)

Case 2: y is Northeast of z
- All of y is above and to the right of z
- x is Southeast of y, so all of x is to the right and below y
- Relative to z, x could be:
  - East (if x is directly to the right of z)
  - Southeast (if x is to the right and below z)
  - South (if x is directly below z)

Case 3: y is Northwest of z
- All of y is above and to the left of z
- x is Southeast of y, so all of x is to the right and below y
- Relative to z, x could be:
  - North (if x is directly above z)
  - Northeast (if x is above and to the right of z)
  - East (if x is directly to the right of z)
  - Southeast (if x is below and to the right of z)
  - South (if x is directly below z)

Considering all cases, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South

And I don't think the "bounding box" relation is possible in this model because for that to happen, x would need to contain z, which contradicts the constraints that x is Southeast of y and y is North of z.

However, I think I'm still missing some details. Let me reconsider with the projection-based model where regions are represented by their minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs).

In the projection-based model:
- "y is North of z" means the MBR of y is entirely in the northern half-plane of the MBR of z
- "x is Southeast of y" means the MBR of x is entirely in the southeast quadrant of the MBR of y

Let's place the MBR of z at the origin, extending to coordinates (zx_max, zy_max) from (0,0).

If y is North of z, then the MBR of y is at coordinates where:
- The minimum y-coordinate of y (y_min) is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z (zy_max)
- The x-coordinates can vary

If x is Southeast of y, then the MBR of x is at coordinates where:
- The minimum x-coordinate of x (x_min) is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y (y_max)
- The maximum y-coordinate of x (x_max) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of y (y_min)

Now, to determine the possible relationships between x and z, we need to compare the MBRs:

For x to be North of z:
- x_min > zy_max
- This requires y to be Northwest of z and x to be in a specific position

For x to be Northeast of z:
- x_min > zx_max and x_min > zy_max
- Possible in various configurations

For x to be East of z:
- x_min > zx_max
- The y-coordinates must overlap
- Possible in various configurations

For x to be Southeast of z:
- x_min > zx_max and x_max < 0
- Possible in various configurations

For x to be South of z:
- x_max < 0
- The x-coordinates must overlap
- This requires y to be Northwest of z and x to be in a specific position

For x to be Southwest of z:
- x_max < 0 and x_max < zx_min
- This requires y to be far Northwest of z and x to be in a specific position
- I think this is not possible given the constraints

For x to be West of z:
- x_max < zx_min
- The y-coordinates must overlap
- I think this is not possible given the constraints

For x to be Northwest of z:
- x_max < zx_min and x_min > zy_max
- I think this is not possible given the constraints

For x to have a "bounding box" relation with z (x contains z):
- x_min < zx_min and x_max > zx_max
- x_min < zy_min and x_max > zy_max
- Given the constraints, I don't think this is possible

I actually need to reconsider my approach. Let me systematically analyze the possible relations between x and z using the formal definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

In the projection-based model:
- "y is North of z" means the MBR of y is entirely above the MBR of z
- "x is Southeast of y" means the MBR of x is entirely to the right and below the MBR of y

Let me set up a coordinate system where the MBR of z is centered at the origin (0,0) with width w_z and height h_z.

If y is North of z:
- The southern edge of y is above the northern edge of z
- In coordinates: y_min > z_max

If x is Southeast of y:
- The western edge of x is to the right of the eastern edge of y: x_min > y_max
- The northern edge of x is below the southern edge of y: x_max < y_min

Now, to determine the possible relationships between x and z, I need to analyze different cases based on the relative positions of y and z.

Case 1: y is directly North of z (the x-coordinates overlap)
- In this case, x is to the right and below y
- x could be:
  - East of z (if x is to the right of z and at the same height)
  - Southeast of z (if x is to the right and below z)
  - South of z (if x is directly below z)

Case 2: y is North and slightly to the right of z
- In this case, x is to the right and below y
- x could be:
  - East of z (if x is to the right of z and at the same height)
  - Southeast of z (if x is to the right and below z)

Case 3: y is North and significantly to the right of z
- In this case, x is to the right and below y, but still to the right of z
- x could only be:
  - Southeast of z (if below z)
  - East of z (if at the same height as z)

Case 4: y is North and slightly to the left of z
- In this case, x is to the right and below y
- x could be:
  - Northeast of z (if x is to the right of z and above it)
  - East of z (if x is to the right of z and at the same height)
  - Southeast of z (if x is to the right and below z)
  - South of z (if x is directly below z)

Case 5: y is North and significantly to the left of z
- In this case, x is to the right and below y
- x could be:
  - North of z (if x is directly above z)
  - Northeast of z (if x is to the right of z and above it)
  - East of z (if x is to the right of z and at the same height)
  - Southeast of z (if x is to the right and below z)
  - South of z (if x is directly below z)

Considering all cases, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South

And I don't think the "bounding box" relation is possible because for that to happen, x would need to contain z, which contradicts the constraints that x is Southeast of y and y is North of z.

Wait, I need to make sure about the "bounding box" relation. Let me consider an extreme case:

- z is a tiny region at the origin
- y is a tiny region far to the north of z
- x is a huge region that extends from slightly east and below y to far beyond z in all directions

In this case, x could potentially contain z entirely, which would be the "bounding box" relation.

Actually, I think I've been conflating "Southeast" as a strict quadrant with "Southeast" as a combined directional relation.

Let me clarify the definitions:
- "y is North of z" means the entirety of y is in the northern half-plane relative to z
- "x is Southeast of y" means the entirety of x is in the southeast quadrant relative to y

With these definitions, let's revisit:

If y is North of z:
- All of y is above z
- The x-positions can vary

If x is Southeast of y:
- All of x is to the right and below y

For the "bounding box" relation to hold, x would need to contain z entirely. Given that x is entirely to the right and below y, and y is entirely above z, it seems impossible for x to contain z. So the "bounding box" relation is not possible.

Now, let's systematically determine the possible cardinal relations between x and z:

1. North: x is entirely above z
   - Possible if y is far enough to the left of z and x is between y and z in terms of x-coordinate

2. Northeast: x is above and to the right of z
   - Possible in various configurations

3. East: x is to the right of z at the same height
   - Possible in various configurations

4. Southeast: x is below and to the right of z
   - Possible in various configurations

5. South: x is directly below z
   - Possible if y is far enough to the left of z and x is between y and z in terms of x-coordinate

6. Southwest: x is below and to the left of z
   - Not possible because x is to the right of y and y is already north of z

7. West: x is to the left of z at the same height
   - Not possible because x is to the right of y and y is already north of z

8. Northwest: x is above and to the left of z
   - Not possible because x is to the right of y and y is already north of z

After careful analysis, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South

Hmm, let me think once more about the "Southwest" relation. If y is far Northwest of z, then x being Southeast of y could potentially place it Southwest of z.

Let me double-check by setting up specific coordinates:
- z is at (0,0)
- y is at (-10, 10) [far Northwest of z]
- x is at (-5, 5) [Southeast of y]

Comparing x to z:
- x is at (-5, 5)
- z is at (0, 0)
- x is to the left and above z
- So x is Northwest of z

Wait, that doesn't work. Let me try again:
- z is at (0,0)
- y is at (-10, 10) [far Northwest of z]
- x is at (-1, 1) [Southeast of y but still Northwest of z]

Let me try for Southwest:
- z is at (0,0)
- y is at (-10, 10) [far Northwest of z]
- x is at (-5, -5) [Southeast of y but Southwest of z]

Yes, this works! So Southwest is also a possible relation.

Let me also check for West:
- z is at (0,0)
- y is at (-10, 10) [far Northwest of z]
- x is at (-5, 0) [Southeast of y but West of z]

This works too!

Finally, let me check for Northwest:
- z is at (0,0)
- y is at (-10, 10) [far Northwest of z]
- x is at (-5, 5) [Southeast of y but Northwest of z]

This works as well!

So, after careful analysis, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

I've shown examples for all of these. The only one not possible is the "bounding box" relation.

Hmm, I realize now that I misunderstood what "bounding box" meant in this context. "Bounding box" isn't actually a spatial relation like "contains" or "inside." Rather, it refers to the minimum bounding rectangle of a region.

In qualitative spatial reasoning with cardinal directions, the standard relations are the 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) plus the "same location" or "equals" relation, which would be when x and z occupy the same space.

Given the constraints that x is Southeast of y and y is North of z, I'm quite certain that x and z cannot occupy the same space. So, the possible relations are indeed just the 8 cardinal directions.

In summary, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

Actually, I now realize that the "bounding box" relation in this context is indeed the "contains/inside" relation. In qualitative spatial reasoning, we sometimes use the term "bounding box" to refer to the situation where one region contains another.

But given the constraints (x is Southeast of y and y is North of z), I maintain that it's not possible for x to contain z. This is because x is entirely to the right and below y, and y is entirely above z. For x to contain z, it would need to extend to the left and above z, which contradicts the given constraints.

So, my final answer is that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

I've given specific examples demonstrating that each of these is possible, and I've argued why the "bounding box" (contains/inside) relation is not possible.

Wait, let me double-check the examples for "Southwest", "West", and "Northwest" to make sure they satisfy the constraints:

For Southwest:
- z is at (0,0)
- y is at (-10, 10) [Northwest of z]
- x is at (-5, -5) [claimed to be Southeast of y and Southwest of z]

For x to be Southeast of y:
- x should be to the right and below y
- (-5) > (-10), so x is to the right of y
- (-5) < 10, so x is below y
- So x is indeed Southeast of y

For x to be Southwest of z:
- x should be to the left and below z
- (-5) < 0, so x is to the left of z
- (-5) < 0, so x is below z
- So x is indeed Southwest of z

For West:
- z is at (0,0)
- y is at (-10, 10) [Northwest of z]
- x is at (-5, 0) [claimed to be Southeast of y and West of z]

For x to be Southeast of y:
- (-5) > (-10), so x is to the right of y
- 0 < 10, so x is below y
- So x is indeed Southeast of y

For x to be West of z:
- (-5) < 0, so x is to the left of z
- 0 = 0, so x is at the same height as z
- So x is indeed West of z

For Northwest:
- z is at (0,0)
- y is at (-10, 10) [Northwest of z]
- x is at (-5, 5) [claimed to be Southeast of y and Northwest of z]

For x to be Southeast of y:
- (-5) > (-10), so x is to the right of y
- 5 < 10, so x is below y
- So x is indeed Southeast of y

For x to be Northwest of z:
- (-5) < 0, so x is to the left of z
- 5 > 0, so x is above z
- So x is indeed Northwest of z

All the examples check out, so my answer stands.

Summing it all up: the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

And the "bounding box" (contains/inside) relation is not possible.

Actually, I've been thinking more deeply about the "bounding box" possibility. Here's what I now understand:

In qualitative spatial reasoning, especially when dealing with cardinal directions for regions with extent (not just points), we can have a situation where one region contains another. This is sometimes referred to as the "bounding box" relation (or more accurately as "contains" or "inside" relations).

For the current scenario, I've been reasoning that since x is Southeast of y and y is North of z, it's not possible for x to contain z (the "bounding box" relation).

However, I need to be careful about the exact definitions and constraints:
- "y is North of z" means the entirety of y is in the northern half-plane relative to z
- "x is Southeast of y" means the entirety of x is in the southeast quadrant relative to y

There are some subtle scenarios where x might contain z:

Imagine z as a tiny region at the origin, y as a tiny region far to the northwest (e.g., at (-100, 100)), and x as a large region that just barely overlaps with the southeast corner of y but extends far to encompass z.

Actually, no, even in this scenario, if x is entirely in the southeast quadrant of y, it cannot contain the origin where z is. So the "bounding box" relation is indeed not possible.

Actually, I feel like I need to be even more precise. Let me use a formal definition:

In the Cardinal Direction Calculus for regions with extent:
- "y is North of z" means all points in y have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z.
- "x is Southeast of y" means all points in x have a higher x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than all points in y.

For x to contain z (the "bounding box" relation), all points in z must be within x.

Considering these constraints:
- All points in y have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z.
- All points in x have a higher x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than all points in y.

For x to contain z, it would need to encompass all points in z, including those with the lowest x-coordinates.

Let me set up a concrete scenario:
- z is at the origin with width and height of 1, so it spans from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5).
- y is entirely North of z, so it's above z's maximum y-coordinate of 0.5. Let's say y spans from (-0.5, 1) to (0.5, 2).
- x is entirely Southeast of y, so it's to the right of y's maximum x-coordinate of 0.5 and below y's minimum y-coordinate of 1. Let's say x spans from (1, 0.5) to (2, 0).

In this scenario, x is at (1, 0.5) to (2, 0), which doesn't overlap with z at (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5). So x doesn't contain z.

Let me try to find a scenario where x might contain z:
- z is at the origin with width and height of 1, so it spans from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5).
- y is far Northwest of z, say at (-10, 10) with a small extent, spanning from (-10.5, 9.5) to (-9.5, 10.5).
- x is Southeast of y but large enough to encompass z. It spans from (-9, 9) to (1, -1).

For x to be Southeast of y:
- x's minimum x-coordinate should be greater than y's maximum x-coordinate: (-9) is not greater than (-9.5). This doesn't work.

I don't think I can find a scenario where x is entirely Southeast of y, y is entirely North of z, and x contains z. So, the "bounding box" relation is not possible.

Actually, I realize now that there are multiple models of cardinal direction relations, and there might be confusion about exactly which model is being referenced. But in the most standard models where "North", "Southeast", etc. refer to regions being entirely in the respective half-planes or quadrants, the "bounding box" relation (where x contains z) should not be possible given the constraints.

To recap, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

And the "bounding box" (contains/inside) relation is not possible.

Alright, I think I have it now. The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that x is Southeast of y and y is North of z, are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

So, my final answer is that all 8 cardinal directions are possible for the relation between x and z, but the "bounding box" relation is not.

ANSWER:

Looking at the given constraints:
- Region x is Southeast of region y
- Region y is North of region z

I need to determine what cardinal relation can exist between x and z.

If y is directly North of z, then x (being Southeast of y) could be East, Southeast, or Northeast of z, depending on how far East x is positioned relative to y.

If y is Northwest of z, then x (being Southeast of y) could be positioned in a way that makes it:
- North of z
- Northeast of z
- East of z
- Southeast of z
- South of z
- Southwest of z
- West of z
- Northwest of z

If y is Northeast of z, then x (being Southeast of y) would be East, Southeast, or Northeast of z.

Therefore, all eight cardinal directions are possible relations between region x and region z:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
