PROMPT: Let  West and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Alright, we have two cardinal direction relations:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Northwest of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's think about the cardinal directions in terms of compass points.

- West means directly to the west, i.e., to the left on a map.
- Northwest means to the northwest, i.e., to the upper left on a map.

To visualize this, let's use a coordinate system where:
- East increases along the x-axis
- North increases along the y-axis

So, if we have:
- Region x is West of region y: This means x is to the left of y on a map. In other words, x.x < y.x and x.y = y.y (where x.x is the x-coordinate of region x, etc.).
- Region y is Northwest of region z: This means y is to the upper left of z on a map. In other words, y.x < z.x and y.y > z.y.

Given these two constraints, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

We know:
- x.x < y.x (x is West of y)
- x.y = y.y (x is West of y)
- y.x < z.x (y is Northwest of z)
- y.y > z.y (y is Northwest of z)

Using transitivity for the x-coordinate:
- x.x < y.x and y.x < z.x implies x.x < z.x.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- x.y = y.y (x is West of y)
- y.y > z.y (y is Northwest of z)

This implies x.y > z.y.

So, we have x.x < z.x and x.y > z.y. This places x to the west (left) and north (up) of z, which corresponds to the cardinal direction "Northwest".

Actually, I now realize I might have made a mistake. Let me rethink this.

"West" means x is directly to the west of y. In terms of coordinates, this means x.x < y.x and x.y = y.y.

"Northwest" means y is to the northwest of z. In terms of coordinates, this means y.x < z.x and y.y > z.y.

Now, considering the relation between x and z:
- x.x < y.x (from "x is West of y")
- y.x < z.x (from "y is Northwest of z")
So, x.x < z.x (transitivity).

- x.y = y.y (from "x is West of y")
- y.y > z.y (from "y is Northwest of z")
So, x.y > z.y (substitution).

So, x is to the left and above z, which corresponds to the cardinal direction "Northwest" again. It seems x is northwest of z.

Actually, I think I've been using a simplified model of cardinal directions here. Let me try to be more precise.

In the context of qualitative spatial reasoning with cardinal directions, I'll use the standard model where a region can be in one of 9 possible tiles relative to another region: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and same tile/bounding box (B).

If we have "x is West of y", then x is entirely to the left of y. If "y is Northwest of z", then y is entirely to the upper left of z.

I need to determine where x can be relative to z. 

Given:
- x is West of y: x is entirely to the left of y.
- y is Northwest of z: y is entirely to the upper left of z.

Therefore, x is definitely to the left of z (because x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z). The vertical relationship between x and z is less clear because we only know that y is above z, but we don't know the vertical relationship between x and y.

Actually, I think I made a mistake above. Let me reconsider. 

If "x is West of y", then the entirety of region x is to the left of region y. In other words, the maximum x-coordinate of region x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of region y. Also, there is some overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y.

If "y is Northwest of z", then the entirety of region y is to the upper left of region z. This means that the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z, and the minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z.

Horizontal relationship: x is definitely to the left of z (because x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z). So, in terms of cardinal directions, x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

Vertical relationship: We know y is above z. But we don't know the vertical relationship between x and y. All we know is that there's some overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y. 

Let's think about the possible vertical relationships between x and z:

1. If the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, then x is above z.
2. If the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z, then x is below z.
3. If there's some overlap in the y-coordinates of x and z, then x is neither strictly above nor strictly below z.

So, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are:
- Northwest (if x is above z)
- West (if x and z have some vertical overlap)
- Southwest (if x is below z)

Actually, I think I'm being confusing. Let me approach this differently. 

In qualitative spatial reasoning with cardinal directions, regions are represented using their minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs).

For the cardinal direction "West", region x is entirely to the left of region y. This means that the maximum x-coordinate of region x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of region y. There's also an implicit condition that the y-coordinates of x and y overlap to some extent.

For the cardinal direction "Northwest", region y is entirely to the upper left of region z. This means that the maximum x-coordinate of region y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of region z, and the minimum y-coordinate of region y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of region z.

Given these definitions, we want to determine the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z.

Horizontally, x is definitely to the left of z (because x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z). So, x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

Vertically, it's a bit more complex. The constraints tell us that the y-coordinates of x and y overlap, and y is entirely above z. Let's think about the possible cases:

1. If the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, then x is above z. This would make x Northwest of z.
2. If the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z, then x is below z. This would make x Southwest of z.
3. If the y-coordinates of x and z overlap, then x is neither strictly above nor strictly below z. This would make x West of z.

But wait, can x actually be below z? Let's check.

We know:
- The y-coordinates of x and y overlap, meaning there are parts of x and y that are at the same height.
- y is entirely above z.

This doesn't guarantee that x is above z, but it does make it impossible for x to be entirely below z. This is because if there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y, and y is entirely above z, then at least some parts of x must be above z.

So, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are only Northwest and West.

Actually, I think I'm still making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Let's use a simpler model of cardinal directions. In this model, the direction between two regions is determined by the direction from the center of one region to the center of the other.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y: The center of x is directly to the left of the center of y. In terms of coordinates, x.x < y.x and x.y = y.y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z: The center of y is to the upper left of the center of z. In terms of coordinates, y.x < z.x and y.y > z.y.

Let's determine the direction from the center of x to the center of z.

Horizontally, we have:
- x.x < y.x (from "x is West of y")
- y.x < z.x (from "y is Northwest of z")
Thus, x.x < z.x by transitivity.

Vertically, we have:
- x.y = y.y (from "x is West of y")
- y.y > z.y (from "y is Northwest of z")
Substituting, we get x.y > z.y.

So, the center of x is to the upper left of the center of z, which means x is Northwest of z.

I'm actually confused about the exact model to use. Let me start fresh.

In the standard cardinal direction model, the space is divided into 9 tiles using the bounding box of the reference region. These tiles are: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and the bounding box (B) itself.

But actually, let's try to reason from first principles. 

First, let's agree on the cardinal directions:
- North: Up on a map.
- Northeast: Up and to the right on a map.
- East: To the right on a map.
- Southeast: Down and to the right on a map.
- South: Down on a map.
- Southwest: Down and to the left on a map.
- West: To the left on a map.
- Northwest: Up and to the left on a map.

We know:
- x is West of y: This means x is directly to the left of y on a map.
- y is Northwest of z: This means y is to the upper left of z on a map.

Let's visualize this. If z is at the origin, then y is in the Northwest direction from z. If y is at the origin, then x is in the West direction from y.

Now, if we try to place all three regions on the same map, and if z is at the origin, then y would be in the Northwest direction from z. Then, x would be to the West of y. This puts x in a position that is even more to the left and perhaps a bit more to the north of z, compared to y. So, x would be in the Northwest direction from z.

But wait, I need to be more precise. The exact position of x relative to z depends on the exact positions of y relative to z and x relative to y.

For instance, if y is only slightly Northwest of z, and x is far West of y, then x could be more to the West of z than to the Northwest. Similarly, if y is far Northwest of z, and x is only slightly West of y, then x could be more to the Northwest of z than to the West.

Actually, let me try to reason more carefully using a grid.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Then, being Northwest of z, y might be at a position like (-1, 1). And, being West of y, x might be at a position like (-2, 1).

In this example, x would be at (-2, 1) relative to z, which is in the Northwest direction from z.

But if y was at (-1, 1) and x was at (-2, 0), then x would be at (-2, 0) relative to z, which is in the West direction from z.

So, based on the given constraints, x could be either Northwest or West of z.

Actually, I realize there's one more possibility. If y is at (-1, 1) and x is at (-2, 2), then x would be at (-2, 2) relative to z, which is still in the Northwest direction from z, but in a more northerly position. So, x could be Northwest of z in multiple ways.

Are there other possibilities? It seems like I'm not fully considering all arrangements.

Let's think geometrically. If z is at the origin, and y is in the Northwest quadrant relative to z, then y would be at some point in the space where both x and y coordinates are non-zero, with x < 0 and y > 0.

Now, x is West of y, which means x has the same y-coordinate as y but a smaller x-coordinate. So, if y is at (y_x, y_y) with y_x < 0 and y_y > 0, then x would be at (x_x, y_y) with x_x < y_x.

Relative to z, x would be at (x_x, y_y) with x_x < y_x < 0 and y_y > 0. This puts x in the Northwest quadrant relative to z, just like y. So, in this model, x would be Northwest of z.

Actually, now that I think about it more, the cardinal direction "West" doesn't necessarily mean "directly west" as in having the exact same y-coordinate. It could be that x is in the west-facing sectors, which includes the Northwest. Similarly, "Northwest" doesn't necessarily mean "exactly Northwest" as in having the same distance in the north and west directions. It could be more towards the north or more towards the west, as long as it's in the northwest sector.

Given these considerations, I now think that x could be Northwest or West of z, depending on the exact positions.

Actually, I should clarify my understanding of the cardinal direction relations. Let me use the 9-tile model for cardinal directions:

In the 9-tile model, the space around a region is divided into 9 tiles using the bounding box of the region. These tiles are: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and the bounding box (B) itself.

Now, when we say "x is West of y", it means x is entirely in the Western tile of y. Similarly, when we say "y is Northwest of z", it means y is entirely in the Northwest tile of z.

Given these definitions, and the constraints:
- x is West of y: The entirety of x is in the Western tile of y.
- y is Northwest of z: The entirety of y is in the Northwest tile of z.

Let's determine where x can be relative to z.

For the Western tile of y, the x-coordinates of any point in this tile are less than the minimum x-coordinate of y. The y-coordinates of points in this tile can range from the minimum to the maximum y-coordinate of y.

For the Northwest tile of z, the x-coordinates of any point in this tile are less than the minimum x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinates are greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

Now, given that y is in the Northwest tile of z, the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z, and the minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

And x is in the Western tile of y, so the maximum x-coordinate of x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of y, and the y-coordinates of x can range from the minimum to the maximum y-coordinate of y.

Given these constraints, x is definitely to the left of z (since x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z). The vertical relationship between x and z is a bit more complex. We know the y-coordinates of x can range from the minimum to the maximum y-coordinate of y, and the minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z. This means that the minimum y-coordinate of x can be greater than, equal to, or less than the maximum y-coordinate of z, depending on the exact position of x relative to y.

If the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, then x is entirely above z, which would place x in the Northern or Northwestern tile of z. Since we already established that x is to the left of z, x would be in the Northwestern tile of z.

If the minimum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of z, but the maximum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, then x overlaps with z in terms of y-coordinates, but extends above z. This could place x in a combination of the Northwestern and Western tiles of z.

If the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of z, but the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the minimum y-coordinate of z, then x is entirely within the height range of z. This would place x in the Western tile of z.

If the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z, then x is entirely below z, which would place x in the Southwestern tile of z.

So, based on the 9-tile model and the given constraints, x could be in the Northwestern, Western, a combination of Northwestern and Western, or Southwestern tile of z, depending on the exact positions.

Actually, no. I think I'm making things overly complicated and misunderstanding the model a bit. Let's go back to the basic definitions and constraints.

When we say "x is West of y", it means the entirety of x is to the left of the entirety of y. In terms of bounding boxes, the maximum x-coordinate of x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of y. This doesn't say anything about the y-coordinates; x and y can have any vertical relationship.

When we say "y is Northwest of z", it means the entirety of y is to the upper left of the entirety of z. In terms of bounding boxes, the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z, and the minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

Now, given that y is Northwest of z, and x is West of y, let's determine where x can be relative to z.

Horizontally, x is entirely to the left of y, and y is entirely to the left of z. By transitivity, x is entirely to the left of z. So, in terms of cardinal directions, x could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

Vertically, y is entirely above z. However, the vertical relationship between x and y is not constrained by the "West" relation. x could be entirely above, entirely below, or overlap with y vertically. So, the vertical relationship between x and z could be:
- If x is entirely above z, x would be North, Northeast, or Northwest of z. But we already established that x is to the left of z, so x would be Northwest of z.
- If x overlaps with z vertically, x would be West of z.
- If x is entirely below z, x would be South, Southeast, or Southwest of z. But we already established that x is to the left of z, so x would be Southwest of z.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, let me rethink the constraints. Can x be *entirely* below z, or *entirely* above z. 

We know:
- x is West of y: The entirety of x is to the left of the entirety of y.
- y is Northwest of z: The entirety of y is to the upper left of the entirety of z.

The "West" relation doesn't constrain the vertical relationship, so x could be above, below, or overlap with y vertically. Similarly, the "Northwest" relation only ensures that y is above z, but doesn't specify by how much.

If y is only slightly above z, and x is significantly below y, then x could be below z. Similarly, if y is significantly above z, and x is only slightly below y, then x could still be above z.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are indeed Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, I feel confused about the definition of "West." I had been assuming that "x is West of y" means the entirety of x is to the left of the entirety of y, with no constraints on the vertical relationship. But there are different ways to define cardinal directions in qualitative spatial reasoning, especially when dealing with regions rather than points.

Let me try one more time, carefully.

In the context of qualitative spatial reasoning, there are different ways to define cardinal directions between regions:

1. Projection-based cardinal directions: This approach projects one region onto the axes of the other, and the relation is determined by the relative positions of these projections.
2. Cone-based cardinal directions: This approach divides the space around a region into cone-shaped sectors, and the relation is determined by which sector the other region falls into.
3. MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) based cardinal directions: This approach uses the MBRs of the regions, and the relation is determined by the relative positions of these MBRs.

For this problem, let's use the MBR-based approach, which is commonly used in qualitative spatial reasoning.

In the MBR-based approach, the direction between two regions is determined by the relative positions of their MBRs. When we say "x is West of y", it means the MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of y. Similarly, when we say "y is Northwest of z", it means the MBR of y is entirely to the upper left of the MBR of z.

Now, given the constraints:
- x is West of y: The MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of y.
- y is Northwest of z: The MBR of y is entirely to the upper left of the MBR of z.

Let's determine where the MBR of x can be relative to the MBR of z.

Horizontally, the MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is entirely to the left of the MBR of z. By transitivity, the MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of z.

Vertically, the MBR of y is entirely above the MBR of z. The "West" relation doesn't constrain the vertical relationship between x and y. The MBR of x could be entirely above, entirely below, or overlap with the MBR of y vertically. Consequently, the MBR of x could be entirely above, entirely below, or overlap with the MBR of z vertically.

So, the possible cardinal directions of the MBR of x relative to the MBR of z are:
- Northwest (if the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of z)
- West (if the MBR of x overlaps with the MBR of z vertically)
- Southwest (if the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of z)

Ok. Let me clarify. In the problem statement, we're given that:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Northwest of region z

And we need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

I'll use the cardinal direction calculus, where the relation between two regions is determined by the relative position of their MBRs (Minimum Bounding Rectangles). In this calculus, the eight cardinal directions are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

When I say that "Region x is West of region y", it means the maximum x-coordinate of the MBR of x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of the MBR of y. The vertical relationship between x and y is not constrained.

When I say that "Region y is Northwest of region z", it means the maximum x-coordinate of the MBR of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of the MBR of z, and the minimum y-coordinate of the MBR of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of the MBR of z.

Now, given these constraints, I'll determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Horizontally, region x is entirely to the left of region y, and region y is entirely to the left of region z. By transitivity, region x is entirely to the left of region z. This constraint satisfies the "West", "Northwest", and "Southwest" cardinal directions.

Vertically, region y is entirely above region z. The "West" relation between regions x and y doesn't constrain their vertical relationship. Hence, region x could be entirely above, entirely below, or overlap with region y vertically. As a result, the vertical relationship between regions x and z could be:
- If x is entirely above z, x would be North, Northeast, or Northwest of z. But we've established that x is to the left of z, so x would be Northwest of z.
- If x overlaps with z vertically, x would be West of z.
- If x is entirely below z, x would be South, Southeast, or Southwest of z. But we've established that x is to the left of z, so x would be Southwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Acutally, let me reconsider the vertical relationship between x and z when x overlaps with z vertically.

If the MBR of x overlaps with the MBR of z vertically, it means there's some vertical range shared by both MBRs. In the cardinal direction calculus, if one region is entirely to the left of another and they share some vertical range, the relation is "West". Therefore, if the MBR of x overlaps with the MBR of z vertically, the relation between them is "West".

So, my previous conclusion holds: the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest. But let me draw a picture to make sure.

If I define a coordinate system with z at the origin:
- y is Northwest of z, so y would be in the second quadrant, with y_x < 0 and y_y > 0.
- x is West of y, so x would be further to the left of y, with x_x < y_x and no constraint on the y-coordinate.

So, relative to z, x is at a position with x_x < y_x < 0. The y-coordinate of x could be anything, which means x could be above, below, or at the same height as z.

If x is above z, the relation would be "Northwest".
If x is at the same height as z (or more precisely, if the MBRs of x and z share some vertical range), the relation would be "West".
If x is below z, the relation would be "Southwest".

Hence, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Ok, I'll make one more careful attempt. I think the confusion is that I wasn't checking to see if some of the vertical relationships are impossible.

Let's see if I can derive a constraint on the vertical relationship between region x and region z.

We know:
- Region x is West of region y: The MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z: The MBR of y is entirely to the upper left of the MBR of z, meaning the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z, and the minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

Let's denote the y-coordinates of the MBRs of regions x, y, and z as x_y, y_y, and z_y, respectively. We can use min and max subscripts to denote the minimum and maximum values. For instance, y_y_min denotes the minimum y-coordinate of the MBR of region y.

From the "Northwest" relation between y and z, we know:
y_y_min > z_y_max

But we don't have a direct constraint on the vertical relationship between x and y from the "West" relation. The MBR of x could be entirely above, entirely below, or overlap with the MBR of y vertically.

Let's consider the case where the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y:
x_y_max < y_y_min

Combining this with the constraint from the "Northwest" relation:
x_y_max < y_y_min > z_y_max

We can't derive a direct constraint between x_y_max and z_y_max from this. x_y_max could be greater than, equal to, or less than z_y_max, depending on the exact values.

Similarly, for the case where the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y, or where the MBRs of x and y overlap vertically, we can't derive a strict constraint on the vertical relationship between the MBRs of x and z.

Therefore, the vertical relationship between the MBRs of x and z could be any of the three: x entirely above z, x overlapping with z vertically, or x entirely below z.

Combined with the horizontal constraint (x entirely to the left of z), the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, let me convince myself:

When we say "x is West of y", it means the MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of y. This doesn't constrain the vertical relationship between x and y; the MBR of x could be entirely above, entirely below, or overlap with the MBR of y vertically.

When we say "y is Northwest of z", it means the MBR of y is entirely to the upper left of the MBR of z. This means the maximum x-coordinate of the MBR of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of the MBR of z, and the minimum y-coordinate of the MBR of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of the MBR of z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the vertical relationship between the MBRs of x and z?

If the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y, then:
x_y_min > y_y_max

Combining with the constraint from the "Northwest" relation (y_y_min > z_y_max), we get:
x_y_min > y_y_max > y_y_min > z_y_max

This implies x_y_min > z_y_max, meaning the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of z.

If the MBR of x overlaps with the MBR of y vertically, then:
x_y_min <= y_y_max and x_y_max >= y_y_min

Combining with the constraint from the "Northwest" relation (y_y_min > z_y_max), we get:
x_y_max >= y_y_min > z_y_max

This implies x_y_max > z_y_max, but we don't have a direct constraint on x_y_min relative to z_y_max. x_y_min could be greater than, equal to, or less than z_y_max, depending on the exact values. So, the MBR of x could be entirely above the MBR of z, or it could overlap with the MBR of z vertically.

If the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y, then:
x_y_max < y_y_min

Combining with the constraint from the "Northwest" relation (y_y_min > z_y_max), we get:
x_y_max < y_y_min > z_y_max

We can't derive a direct constraint between x_y_max and z_y_max from this. x_y_max could be greater than, equal to, or less than z_y_max, depending on the exact values. So, the MBR of x could be entirely above the MBR of z, overlap with the MBR of z vertically, or be entirely below the MBR of z.

It seems like the MBR of x could have any vertical relationship with the MBR of z, depending on the exact positions.

Actually, wait. If "y is Northwest of z", then the MBR of y is entirely to the upper left of the MBR of z. This means:
y_y_min > z_y_max

Now, if the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y, then:
x_y_max < y_y_min

Combining these, we get:
x_y_max < y_y_min > z_y_max

This doesn't give us a direct constraint between x_y_max and z_y_max.

But let's visualize this. If y is Northwest of z, it means y is in the upper left quadrant relative to z. Now, if x is West of y, it means x is directly to the left of y. Depending on the vertical position of x relative to y, x could be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

Let me draw a diagram to clarify:

Imagine z is at the origin (0, 0).
y is Northwest of z, so y might be at a position like (-1, 1).
Now, if x is West of y, it would be directly to the left of y, so x might be at a position like (-2, 1).

In this example, x would be at (-2, 1) relative to z, which is in the Northwest direction from z.

But if x is vertically below y, it might be at a position like (-2, 0) or (-2, -1). Relative to z, x would be at (-2, 0) or (-2, -1), which would be in the West or Southwest direction from z, respectively.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Ok, the regions are allowed to be points, in which case MBRs collapse to points. So let me actually draw on a grid. I'll use the positions of points as an example. 

Let's set up a grid with z at the origin (0, 0).

If y is Northwest of z, it means y is in the upper left quadrant relative to z. Let's place y at (-1, 1).

Now, if x is West of y, it means x is directly to the left of y. So, x would be at (-2, 1).

Relative to z, x would be at (-2, 1), which is in the Northwest direction from z.

But I can also place y at (-2, 3) and x at (-3, 3). In this case, relative to z, x would still be in the Northwest direction, just at a different position.

Or, I could place y at (-1, 1) and x at (-3, 1). Relative to z, x would be at (-3, 1), which is also in the Northwest direction from z.

Now, let's try to find a position for x that would make it West or Southwest of z.

If y is at (-1, 1) and x is at (-2, 0), then relative to z, x would be at (-2, 0), which is in the West direction from z.

And if y is at (-1, 1) and x is at (-2, -1), then relative to z, x would be at (-2, -1), which is in the Southwest direction from z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest. Actually now I'm confusing myself again. Let me try to be more methodical.

First, let me clearly represent the cardinal direction relations. I'll use a 9-tile representation, where the space around a region is divided into 9 tiles based on the MBR of the region. The tiles are: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and the bounding box itself (B).

Now, let's denote the MBRs of regions x, y, and z as MBR_x, MBR_y, and MBR_z, respectively. Each MBR is characterized by its minimum and maximum coordinates in the x and y directions. For instance, MBR_x would have coordinates (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax).

When we say "x is West of y", it means:
xmax < ymin

When we say "y is Northwest of z", it means:
ymax < zmin and ymin > zmax

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

First, it's clear that x is to the left of z. This is because x is to the left of y (xmax < ymin), and y is to the left of z (ymax < zmin). By transitivity, x is to the left of z (xmax < zmin).

Next, let's consider the vertical relationship. We don't have a direct constraint on the vertical relationship between x and y from the "West" relation. The MBR of x could be entirely above, entirely below, or overlap with the MBR of y vertically.

If the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y, then:
xmin > ymax

Combining with the constraint from the "Northwest" relation (ymin > zmax), we get:
xmin > ymax > ymin > zmax

This implies xmin > zmax, meaning the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of z, which corresponds to the cardinal direction "Northwest".

If the MBR of x overlaps with the MBR of y vertically, then:
xmin <= ymax and xmax >= ymin

Combining with the constraint from the "Northwest" relation (ymin > zmax), we get:
xmax >= ymin > zmax

This implies xmax > zmax, but we don't have a direct constraint on xmin relative to zmax. The MBR of x could be entirely above the MBR of z (xmin > zmax), or it could overlap with the MBR of z vertically (xmin <= zmax). These correspond to the cardinal directions "Northwest" and "West", respectively.

If the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y, then:
xmax < ymin

Combining with the constraint from the "Northwest" relation (ymin > zmax), we get:
xmax < ymin > zmax

This doesn't give us a direct constraint between xmax and zmax. The MBR of x could be entirely above the MBR of z (xmin > zmax), overlap with the MBR of z vertically (xmin <= zmax and xmax >= zmin), or be entirely below the MBR of z (xmax < zmin). These correspond to the cardinal directions "Northwest", "West", and "Southwest", respectively.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, there's a mistake. I had inconsistent notation in my reasoning. Let me correct it.

Let's denote the MBRs of regions x, y, and z as MBR_x, MBR_y, and MBR_z, respectively. Each MBR is characterized by its minimum and maximum coordinates in the x and y directions. For instance, MBR_x would have coordinates (x_xmin, x_ymin, x_xmax, x_ymax).

When we say "x is West of y", it means:
x_xmax < y_xmin

When we say "y is Northwest of z", it means:
y_xmax < z_xmin and y_ymin > z_ymax

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

First, it's clear that x is to the left of z. This is because x is to the left of y (x_xmax < y_xmin), and y is to the left of z (y_xmax < z_xmin). By transitivity, x is to the left of z (x_xmax < z_xmin).

Next, let's consider the vertical relationship. We don't have a direct constraint on the vertical relationship between x and y from the "West" relation. The MBR of x could be entirely above, entirely below, or overlap with the MBR of y vertically.

If the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y, then:
x_ymin > y_ymax

Combining with the constraint from the "Northwest" relation (y_ymin > z_ymax), we get:
x_ymin > y_ymax > y_ymin > z_ymax

This is a contradiction, because y_ymax cannot be greater than y_ymin. So, the MBR of x cannot be entirely above the MBR of y.

Wait, no, this isn't right. For any 2D region, the maximum y-coordinate is always greater than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate (y_ymax >= y_ymin). So, if x_ymin > y_ymax, then x_ymin > y_ymin. It's not a contradiction. Let me try this again.

If the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y, then:
x_ymin > y_ymax

Combining with the constraint from the "Northwest" relation (y_ymin > z_ymax), we get:
x_ymin > y_ymax >= y_ymin > z_ymax

This implies x_ymin > z_ymax, meaning the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of z, which corresponds to the cardinal direction "Northwest".

Actually, I don't think I'm defining "entirely above" correctly, let me fix this.

For MBR_x to be entirely above MBR_y, we need:
x_ymin > y_ymax

which means the lowest point of MBR_x is higher than the highest point of MBR_y.

For MBR_y to be entirely above MBR_z, we have (from the "Northwest" relation):
y_ymin > z_ymax

which means the lowest point of MBR_y is higher than the highest point of MBR_z.

Now, if MBR_x is entirely above MBR_y and MBR_y is entirely above MBR_z, then by transitivity, MBR_x is entirely above MBR_z:
x_ymin > y_ymax (from "MBR_x is entirely above MBR_y")
y_ymin > z_ymax (from "y is Northwest of z")

Since y_ymin is the lowest point of MBR_y, and y_ymax is the highest point of MBR_y, we always have y_ymin <= y_ymax. 

From the given constraints, we have:
x_ymin > y_ymax >= y_ymin > z_ymax

This gives us x_ymin > z_ymax, meaning MBR_x is entirely above MBR_z, which corresponds to the cardinal direction "Northwest".

Wait, this doesn't seem right either.

Ok, let me start again. When I say "x is West of y", it means the MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of y. This means the rightmost point of MBR_x is to the left of the leftmost point of MBR_y:
x_xmax < y_xmin

When I say "y is Northwest of z", it means the MBR of y is entirely to the upper left of the MBR of z. This means:
1. The rightmost point of MBR_y is to the left of the leftmost point of MBR_z: y_xmax < z_xmin
2. The bottommost point of MBR_y is above the topmost point of MBR_z: y_ymin > z_ymax

Ok, I think I know where I'm getting confused. Let me now be more straightforward and avoid excessive formalism.

Actually, now let me try to approach this differently. We're looking for the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z. We know that x is West of y, and y is Northwest of z.

Let's visualize this. If z is at the origin, then y is to the Northwest of z, which means y is in the upper-left quadrant relative to z. Now, x is to the West of y, which means x is directly to the left of y.

Depending on the exact positions, x could be at various locations, but it's always to the left of z. The vertical relationship between x and z depends on the exact positions. Here are some specific examples:

Example 1:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 1)
- x is at (-2, 1)
Relative to z, x is at (-2, 1), which is in the Northwest direction.

Example 2:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 1)
- x is at (-2, 0)
Relative to z, x is at (-2, 0), which is in the West direction.

Example 3:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 1)
- x is at (-2, -1)
Relative to z, x is at (-2, -1), which is in the Southwest direction.

All of these examples satisfy the given constraints: x is West of y, and y is Northwest of z. And in each example, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is different: Northwest, West, or Southwest, respectively.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

I'll double-check. I said:

Example 1:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 1)
- x is at (-2, 1)
Relative to z, x is at (-2, 1), which is in the Northwest direction.

So, is x West of y? Yes, because x is directly to the left of y.
Is y Northwest of z? Yes, because y is to the upper left of z.

Example 2:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 1)
- x is at (-2, 0)
Relative to z, x is at (-2, 0), which is in the West direction.

Is x West of y? Yes, because x is directly to the left of y.
Is y Northwest of z? Yes, because y is to the upper left of z.

Example 3:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 1)
- x is at (-2, -1)
Relative to z, x is at (-2, -1), which is in the Southwest direction.

Is x West of y? Yes, because x is directly to the left of y.
Is y Northwest of z? Yes, because y is to the upper left of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, let's make sure I'm being consistent with the cardinal direction definitions. The cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) partition the plane around a reference point (or region) into 8 sectors. The boundaries of these sectors are typically the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines passing through the reference point.

If I have a reference point at the origin, the sectors would be:
- North: {(x, y) | x = 0, y > 0}
- Northeast: {(x, y) | x > 0, y > 0}
- East: {(x, y) | x > 0, y = 0}
- Southeast: {(x, y) | x > 0, y < 0}
- South: {(x, y) | x = 0, y < 0}
- Southwest: {(x, y) | x < 0, y < 0}
- West: {(x, y) | x < 0, y = 0}
- Northwest: {(x, y) | x < 0, y > 0}

Using these definitions, let's re-evaluate our examples.

Actually, I think I'm being inconsistent in how I'm defining the cardinal directions. Because I defined the West direction as strictly {(x, y) | x < 0, y = 0}, which is a line, not a sector. So, I don't think I can say "x is directly to the left of y" to mean "x is West of y".

Let me redo the explanation with a more standard definition of cardinal directions.

In the context of qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal directions are often defined based on the MBRs (Minimum Bounding Rectangles) of regions. The 9-tile model partitions the space around a reference region into 9 tiles based on the MBR of the reference region. The 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) correspond to 8 of these tiles, with the 9th tile being the MBR itself.

Let me define how MBRs are related through cardinal directions:

For "Region x is West of region y":
- The MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of y.
- Mathematically, x_xmax < y_xmin.
- Vertical position is not constrained.

For "Region y is Northwest of region z":
- The MBR of y is entirely to the upper left of the MBR of z.
- Mathematically, y_xmax < z_xmin and y_ymin > z_ymax.

Now, given that region x is West of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Horizontally, we know:
- x_xmax < y_xmin (from "x is West of y")
- y_xmax < z_xmin (from "y is Northwest of z")
By transitivity, x_xmax < z_xmin, which means region x is to the left of region z.

Vertically, we have:
- y_ymin > z_ymax (from "y is Northwest of z")
- We don't have a constraint on the vertical relationship between regions x and y from the "West" relation.

The vertical relationship between regions x and z depends on the vertical relationship between regions x and y. Depending on the exact positions, region x could be entirely above, entirely below, or overlap with region z vertically. Consequently, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest (if region x is entirely above region z)
- West (if region x overlaps with region z vertically)
- Southwest (if region x is entirely below region z)

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

To double-check my reasoning, let me provide specific examples to illustrate each possible relation.

For region x to be Northwest of region z:
- z has MBR (0, 0, 1, 1)
- y has MBR (-2, 2, -1, 3) (this satisfies "y is Northwest of z")
- x has MBR (-4, 2, -3, 3) (this satisfies "x is West of y")
Relative to z, x has MBR (-4, 2, -3, 3), which is to the upper left of z, so x is Northwest of z.

For region x to be West of region z:
- z has MBR (0, 0, 1, 1)
- y has MBR (-2, 2, -1, 3) (this satisfies "y is Northwest of z")
- x has MBR (-4, 0, -3, 1) (this satisfies "x is West of y")
Relative to z, x has MBR (-4, 0, -3, 1), which is directly to the left of z, so x is West of z.

For region x to be Southwest of region z:
- z has MBR (0, 0, 1, 1)
- y has MBR (-2, 2, -1, 3) (this satisfies "y is Northwest of z")
- x has MBR (-4, -2, -3, -1) (this satisfies "x is West of y")
Relative to z, x has MBR (-4, -2, -3, -1), which is to the lower left of z, so x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Hmm, let me double-check my examples. I'm not sure if "x is West of y" necessarily means that the x-coordinates of x and y don't overlap. Let me check.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction "West" is often defined to mean that the target region is entirely to the left of the reference region. In other words, "x is West of y" means that the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y.

So, it seems my definition is correct. Let me re-examine my examples:

For "x is West of y":
- y has MBR (-2, 2, -1, 3)
- x has MBR (-4, 2, -3, 3)

We have x_xmax (-3) < y_xmin (-2), so x is indeed to the left of y. The y-coordinates of x and y match, but that doesn't contradict the "West" relation, which only constrains the x-coordinates.

Similarly for the other examples, the relations hold as I described.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, I see another issue. Let me make sure my understanding of "x is West of y" is correct. In qualitative spatial reasoning, especially with the 9-tile model, "x is West of y" means that the entirety of x falls within the Western tile of y. The Western tile of y is the region to the left of the MBR of y.

Let me clarify the constraints once more.

For "x is West of y":
- The entirety of region x is in the Western tile of region y.
- Mathematically, x_xmax < y_xmin.
- Vertical position is not constrained.

For "y is Northwest of z":
- The entirety of region y is in the Northwestern tile of region z.
- Mathematically, y_xmax < z_xmin and y_ymin > z_ymax.

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Horizontally, we know:
- x_xmax < y_xmin (from "x is West of y")
- y_xmax < z_xmin (from "y is Northwest of z")
By transitivity, x_xmax < z_xmin, which means the entirety of region x is to the left of region z.

Vertically, we have:
- y_ymin > z_ymax (from "y is Northwest of z")
- We don't have a constraint on the vertical relationship between regions x and y from the "West" relation.

Depending on the vertical relationship between regions x and y, the vertical relationship between regions x and z could be:
- If region x is entirely above region z (x_ymin > z_ymax), then x is in the Northwestern tile of z.
- If region x vertically overlaps with region z (x_ymin <= z_ymax and x_ymax >= z_ymin), then x is in the Western tile of z.
- If region x is entirely below region z (x_ymax < z_ymin), then x is in the Southwestern tile of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

To illustrate, let me provide specific examples.

Example 1 (x is Northwest of z):
- z has MBR (0, 0, 1, 1)
- y has MBR (-2, 2, -1, 3) (this satisfies "y is Northwest of z" because y_xmax (-1) < z_xmin (0) and y_ymin (2) > z_ymax (1))
- x has MBR (-4, 2, -3, 3) (this satisfies "x is West of y" because x_xmax (-3) < y_xmin (-2))
Relative to z, x has MBR (-4, 2, -3, 3), which satisfies x_xmax (-3) < z_xmin (0) and x_ymin (2) > z_ymax (1), so x is Northwest of z.

Example 2 (x is West of z):
- z has MBR (0, 0, 1, 1)
- y has MBR (-2, 2, -1, 3) (this satisfies "y is Northwest of z" because y_xmax (-1) < z_xmin (0) and y_ymin (2) > z_ymax (1))
- x has MBR (-4, 0, -3, 1) (this satisfies "x is West of y" because x_xmax (-3) < y_xmin (-2))
Relative to z, x has MBR (-4, 0, -3, 1), which satisfies x_xmax (-3) < z_xmin (0) and the y-coordinates of x and z overlap, so x is West of z.

Example 3 (x is Southwest of z):
- z has MBR (0, 0, 1, 1)
- y has MBR (-2, 2, -1, 3) (this satisfies "y is Northwest of z" because y_xmax (-1) < z_xmin (0) and y_ymin (2) > z_ymax (1))
- x has MBR (-4, -2, -3, -1) (this satisfies "x is West of y" because x_xmax (-3) < y_xmin (-2))
Relative to z, x has MBR (-4, -2, -3, -1), which satisfies x_xmax (-3) < z_xmin (0) and x_ymax (-1) < z_ymin (0), so x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z, given the two constraints.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Northwest of region z

When region x is West of region y, it means x is entirely to the left of y (horizontally), but their vertical relationship is not constrained.

When region y is Northwest of region z, it means y is entirely to the upper-left of z (both horizontally to the left and vertically above).

Let me analyze what this means for the possible relationship between x and z:

1. Horizontal relationship: Since x is West of y, and y is to the left of z, then by transitivity, x must be to the left of z.

2. Vertical relationship: The vertical position of x relative to z depends on the vertical position of x relative to y:
   - If x is above z, then x is Northwest of z
   - If x vertically overlaps with z, then x is West of z
   - If x is below z, then x is Southwest of z

All three vertical relationships are possible while maintaining the given constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.
