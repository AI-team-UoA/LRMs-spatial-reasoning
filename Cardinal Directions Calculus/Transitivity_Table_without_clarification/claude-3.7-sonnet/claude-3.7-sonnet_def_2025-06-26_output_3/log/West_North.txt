PROMPT: Let  West and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

In this problem, we have:

- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is North of region z

And we need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

To analyze this, let's think about the spatial arrangement:

1. West means x is to the left of y on a map (with the conventional orientation where North is up)
2. North means y is above z on a map

So if x is to the left of y, and y is above z, where could x be in relation to z?

Let's use a coordinate system where:
- North means increasing y-coordinate (moving up)
- South means decreasing y-coordinate (moving down)
- East means increasing x-coordinate (moving right)
- West means decreasing x-coordinate (moving left)

If region x is West of region y, then x has a smaller x-coordinate than y.
If region y is North of region z, then y has a larger y-coordinate than z.

But we don't know the y-coordinate relationship between x and y, or the x-coordinate relationship between y and z.

Let's visualize some possibilities:

Case 1: If x and y have the same y-coordinate, and y and z have the same x-coordinate:
```
    y
    |
x - + - z
```
Here, x would be Northwest of z.

Case 2: If x is north of y, and y and z have the same x-coordinate:
```
x
|
y
|
z
```
Here, x would be North of z.

Case 3: If x is south of y, and y and z have the same x-coordinate:
```
    y
    |
    z
    |
    x
```
Here, x would be West of z.

Case 4: If x is south of y, and y is west of z:
```
    y - z
    |
    x
```
Here, x would be Southwest of z.

Wait, I think I made an error. Let me be more precise. 

If x is West of y, then x is strictly to the left of y (smaller x-coordinate).
If y is North of z, then y is strictly above z (larger y-coordinate).

Let me redraw:

Case 1: If x and y have the same y-coordinate, and y and z have the same x-coordinate:
```
    y
    |
x   z
```
Here, x would be Northwest of z.

Actually, this isn't quite right. Let me be more careful.

Let's establish a coordinate system where the origin is at the bottom left. Each region can be represented by its center point (x_coord, y_coord).

If region x is West of region y, then the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y: x_x < x_y
If region y is North of region z, then the y-coordinate of y is greater than the y-coordinate of z: y_y > y_z

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

We know:
- x_x < x_y (x is to the left of y)
- y_y > y_z (y is above z)

But we don't know:
- The relationship between y_x and y_y (is x above, below, or at the same level as y?)
- The relationship between x_y and x_z (is y to the left, right, or at the same position as z horizontally?)

Let's explore all possibilities:

1. If y_x > y_z (x is above z) and x_x < x_z (x is to the left of z), then x is Northwest of z.
2. If y_x = y_z (x is at the same level as z) and x_x < x_z (x is to the left of z), then x is West of z.
3. If y_x < y_z (x is below z) and x_x < x_z (x is to the left of z), then x is Southwest of z.
4. If y_x > y_z (x is above z) and x_x = x_z (x is at the same horizontal position as z), then x is North of z.
5. If y_x < y_z (x is below z) and x_x = x_z (x is at the same horizontal position as z), then x is South of z.
6. If y_x > y_z (x is above z) and x_x > x_z (x is to the right of z), then x is Northeast of z.
7. If y_x = y_z (x is at the same level as z) and x_x > x_z (x is to the right of z), then x is East of z.
8. If y_x < y_z (x is below z) and x_x > x_z (x is to the right of z), then x is Southeast of z.

Hmm, but we need to be more careful. We know that x is West of y, which means x_x < x_y. We also know that y is North of z, which means y_y > y_z. But we don't know the relationship between x_y and x_z, or between y_x and y_y.

Actually, let's be a bit more precise. In general, cardinal directions like "North" and "West" are often defined in terms of bounding boxes of regions, not just center points.

For simplicity, let's assume regions are represented by their bounding boxes:
- If region A is North of region B, it means the bottom edge of A's bounding box is above the top edge of B's bounding box.
- If region A is West of region B, it means the right edge of A's bounding box is to the left of the left edge of B's bounding box.

And the combined directions (like Northwest) can be defined as combinations of these.

Given the constraints:
- Region x is West of region y (the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of y)
- Region y is North of region z (the bottom edge of y is above the top edge of z)

We can infer the following:
- Region x is to the left of region y
- Region y is above region z

But we don't know the vertical relationship between x and y, or the horizontal relationship between y and z.

For instance, x could be above, at the same level, or below y. Similarly, y could be to the left, at the same horizontal position, or to the right of z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is above z and to the left of z)
- West (if x is at the same level as z and to the left of z)
- Southwest (if x is below z and to the left of z)
- North (if x is above z and at the same horizontal position as z)

Hmm, I feel like I might be overthinking this. Let's step back and think intuitively. 

If region x is West of region y, and region y is North of region z, then one thing we know for sure is that region x and region z are diagonally opposite to each other in some sense.

OK, let's think about it differently. 

Imagine we have regions represented as rectangles on a map. If region A is West of region B, it means the entirety of region A is to the left of region B (no horizontal overlap). If region C is North of region D, it means the entirety of region C is above region D (no vertical overlap).

Let's use coordinates where the origin is at the bottom left, and a region is represented by (left, bottom, right, top).

If region x is West of region y, then x_right < y_left.
If region y is North of region z, then y_bottom > z_top.

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?

We know:
- x_right < y_left (x is entirely to the left of y)
- y_bottom > z_top (y is entirely above z)

But we don't have any direct constraints on the vertical relationship between x and z, or the horizontal relationship between y and z.

Let's consider some scenarios:

1. x is below y, y is to the left of z:
```
   y
   |
x  z
```
Here, x could be Southwest of z.

2. x is at the same level as y, y is to the left of z:
```
x y z
```
Here, x could be West of z.

3. x is above y, y is to the left of z:
```
x
|
y z
```
Here, x could be Northwest of z.

4. x is below y, y is at the same horizontal position as z:
```
  y
  |
  z
 /
x
```
Here, x could be Southwest of z.

5. x is at the same level as y, y is at the same horizontal position as z:
```
x y
  |
  z
```
Here, x could be West of z.

I'm trying to enumerate all possible scenarios to find all possible relationships, but I think I'm complicating things. Let's take a different approach.

The only constraint we have is that x is to the left of y, and y is above z. There's no direct constraint on the relationship between x and z. 

So, x could be:
- Northwest of z (if x is above z and to the left of z)
- North of z (if x is above z and at the same horizontal position as z)
- Northeast of z (if x is above z and to the right of z)
- West of z (if x is at the same level as z and to the left of z)
- East of z (if x is at the same level as z and to the right of z)
- Southwest of z (if x is below z and to the left of z)
- South of z (if x is below z and at the same horizontal position as z)
- Southeast of z (if x is below z and to the right of z)

Wait, that's all possible relations. That doesn't seem right. Let me think more carefully...

Ah, I see the issue. I need to use the constraints more carefully. 

If x is West of y, then the entirety of x is to the left of y.
If y is North of z, then the entirety of y is above z.

This means:
- x_right < y_left (the rightmost part of x is to the left of the leftmost part of y)
- y_bottom > z_top (the bottom of y is above the top of z)

Given these constraints, there are configurations where x could be Northeast of z (for example, if x is above z and to the right of z). But this would require x to be to the right of z, which would mean x_left > z_right. However, we don't have any constraint that forces this.

Actually, wait, this is incorrect. If x is West of y and y is North of z, then x being to the right of z (i.e., x_left > z_right) doesn't necessarily follow.

Let me rethink...

Given:
- x is West of y (x_right < y_left)
- y is North of z (y_bottom > z_top)

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Here's a more systematic approach. Let's consider all possible combinations of x's vertical position relative to z and x's horizontal position relative to z, and check which ones are consistent with our constraints.

Vertical positions:
1. x is above z (x_bottom > z_top)
2. x is at the same level as z (x and z have vertical overlap)
3. x is below z (x_top < z_bottom)

Horizontal positions:
1. x is to the left of z (x_right < z_left)
2. x is at the same horizontal position as z (x and z have horizontal overlap)
3. x is to the right of z (x_left > z_right)

For each combination, we'll check if it's consistent with our constraints.

Vertical position 1 (x is above z) and Horizontal position 1 (x is to the left of z):
- This corresponds to x being Northwest of z.
- Given our constraints, this is possible.

Vertical position 1 (x is above z) and Horizontal position 2 (x is at the same horizontal position as z):
- This corresponds to x being North of z.
- Given our constraints, this is possible.

Vertical position 1 (x is above z) and Horizontal position 3 (x is to the right of z):
- This corresponds to x being Northeast of z.
- Given our constraints, is this possible?
  - We know x_right < y_left (x is West of y)
  - We know y_bottom > z_top (y is North of z)
  - But we don't have a direct constraint on the horizontal relationship between y and z.
  - If y is to the right of z (y_left > z_right), then x_right < y_left and y_left > z_right, which means x_right < z_right. This contradicts x being to the right of z (x_left > z_right).
  - But if y and z have horizontal overlap or if y is to the left of z, then there's no contradiction.
  - So, x being Northeast of z is possible only if y is not to the right of z.

Hmm, actually, I realize there's still a problem. I'm trying to determine if x can be to the right of z given our constraints. Let's be clear on the Northeast direction: it means x is both to the right of z and above z.

From our constraints:
- x is West of y (x_right < y_left)
- y is North of z (y_bottom > z_top)

For x to be to the right of z, we need x_left > z_right. But from the first constraint, we have x_right < y_left, which implies x_left < y_left (since x_left is to the left of x_right). So, for x to be to the right of z, we need y_left > z_right.

But we don't have any constraint on the horizontal relationship between y and z. If y is to the right of z (y_left > z_right), then we can't determine if x is to the right of z. It could be to the right or to the left of z.

This actually got quite tricky. Let's approach it in a slightly different way. 

Let's use a coordinate system and reasoning using the center points of the regions for clarity. Let's say:
- x has center (x_x, y_x)
- y has center (x_y, y_y)
- z has center (x_z, y_z)

From our constraints:
- x is West of y means x_x < x_y
- y is North of z means y_y > y_z

Now, let's figure out the possible relationships between x and z:

1. Northwest: This means x_x < x_z and y_x > y_z. Is this possible?
   - From our constraints, we know x_x < x_y and y_y > y_z.
   - We need to check if x_x < x_z and y_x > y_z can be satisfied.
   - We don't have direct constraints on x_z or y_x, so this is possible.

2. North: This means x_x = x_z and y_x > y_z. Is this possible?
   - From our constraints, we know x_x < x_y and y_y > y_z.
   - We need to check if x_x = x_z and y_x > y_z can be satisfied.
   - We don't have direct constraints on x_z or y_x, so this is possible.

3. Northeast: This means x_x > x_z and y_x > y_z. Is this possible?
   - From our constraints, we know x_x < x_y and y_y > y_z.
   - We need to check if x_x > x_z and y_x > y_z can be satisfied.
   - We don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between x_z and x_y, or between y_x and y_y.
   - If x_z < x_y, then it's possible that x_x > x_z even though x_x < x_y.
   - So, this is possible.

4. West: This means x_x < x_z and y_x = y_z. Is this possible?
   - From our constraints, we know x_x < x_y and y_y > y_z.
   - We need to check if x_x < x_z and y_x = y_z can be satisfied.
   - We don't have direct constraints on x_z or y_x, so this is possible.

5. East: This means x_x > x_z and y_x = y_z. Is this possible?
   - From our constraints, we know x_x < x_y and y_y > y_z.
   - We need to check if x_x > x_z and y_x = y_z can be satisfied.
   - Similar to the Northeast case, if x_z < x_y, then it's possible that x_x > x_z even though x_x < x_y.
   - So, this is possible.

6. Southwest: This means x_x < x_z and y_x < y_z. Is this possible?
   - From our constraints, we know x_x < x_y and y_y > y_z.
   - We need to check if x_x < x_z and y_x < y_z can be satisfied.
   - We don't have direct constraints on x_z or y_x, so this is possible.

7. South: This means x_x = x_z and y_x < y_z. Is this possible?
   - From our constraints, we know x_x < x_y and y_y > y_z.
   - We need to check if x_x = x_z and y_x < y_z can be satisfied.
   - We don't have direct constraints on x_z or y_x, so this is possible.

8. Southeast: This means x_x > x_z and y_x < y_z. Is this possible?
   - From our constraints, we know x_x < x_y and y_y > y_z.
   - We need to check if x_x > x_z and y_x < y_z can be satisfied.
   - Similar to the Northeast case, if x_z < x_y, then it's possible that x_x > x_z even though x_x < x_y.
   - So, this is possible.

Based on this analysis, all eight cardinal directions are possible for the relationship between x and z, given the constraints. But this doesn't seem right, so let me revisit the problem.

Actually, let's be more careful about the definitions of cardinal direction relations. The problem states:

"Let West and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is West of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

These are cardinal direction relations, which means "West" implies a strict "to the left" relation, and "North" implies a strict "above" relation.

Given that:
- x is West of y: This means x is strictly to the left of y, with no horizontal overlap.
- y is North of z: This means y is strictly above z, with no vertical overlap.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

I think I was overcomplicating things. Let's take a step back and think intuitively about what "West" and "North" mean in terms of coordinates:

- If x is West of y, then x is to the left of y (x_x < x_y).
- If y is North of z, then y is above z (y_y > y_z).

Now, what's the relationship between x and z? We know:
- x_x < x_y (x is to the left of y)
- y_y > y_z (y is above z)

But we don't know:
- The relationship between x_y and x_z (i.e., where y is horizontally compared to z)
- The relationship between y_x and y_y (i.e., where x is vertically compared to y)
- The relationship between y_x and y_z (i.e., where x is vertically compared to z)

Without these, we can't definitively determine the relationship between x and z. Let's try to enumerate all possible scenarios and see what relationships emerge.

Scenario 1: x_y < x_z (y is to the left of z) and y_x > y_y (x is above y)
In this case, x is to the left of y, which is to the left of z. Also, x is above y, which is above z. So, x is to the left of and above z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Scenario 2: x_y = x_z (y and z are horizontally aligned) and y_x > y_y (x is above y)
In this case, x is to the left of y, which is horizontally aligned with z. Also, x is above y, which is above z. So, x is to the left of and above z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Scenario 3: x_y > x_z (y is to the right of z) and y_x > y_y (x is above y)
In this case, x is to the left of y, but y is to the right of z. We know x is to the left of y, but we don't know the relationship between x and z horizontally. Also, x is above y, which is above z. So, x is above z, but its horizontal relationship with z is undetermined. Depending on their exact positions, x could be Northwest, North, or Northeast of z.

Actually, let's do it slightly differently. If region x is to the west of region y, I have to enforce that the entirety of region x is to the left of the entirety of region y. Similarly, if region y is to the north of region z, the entirety of region y is above the entirety of region z.

Let's try again, with rectangles.

If region x is West of region y, then the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y. Let's denote this as: right(x) < left(y).

If region y is North of region z, then the bottommost point of y is above the topmost point of z. Let's denote this as: bottom(y) > top(z).

Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

To be Northwest of z, x must be both to the left and above z. This means: right(x) < left(z) and bottom(x) > top(z).
- We know right(x) < left(y) (x is West of y), but we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between left(y) and left(z). If left(y) <= left(z), then right(x) < left(z) is satisfied, and x is to the left of z.
- We know bottom(y) > top(z) (y is North of z), but we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between bottom(x) and bottom(y). If bottom(x) >= bottom(y), then bottom(x) > top(z) is satisfied, and x is above z.
So, x can be Northwest of z if left(y) <= left(z) and bottom(x) >= bottom(y).

To be North of z, x must be directly above z with horizontal overlap. This means: left(x) <= right(z) and right(x) >= left(z) and bottom(x) > top(z).
- We know right(x) < left(y) (x is West of y), but for x to horizontally overlap with z, we need right(x) >= left(z). This means left(z) <= right(x) < left(y), which suggests z is to the left of y horizontally.
- We know bottom(y) > top(z) (y is North of z), but we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between bottom(x) and bottom(y). If bottom(x) >= bottom(y), then bottom(x) > top(z) is satisfied, and x is above z.
So, x can be North of z if left(z) <= right(x) < left(y) and bottom(x) >= bottom(y).

OK, this gets tricky fast, because the detailed relationship between regions y and z plays a major role. Let's go back to a simpler, intuitive approach.

If x is West of y and y is North of z, what does this mean for the relationship between x and z?

From "x is West of y", we know x is to the left of y.
From "y is North of z", we know y is above z.

So, x is to the left of y, which is above z. From this, we can say that x is diagonally up and to the left of z, or in other words, x is in the general Northwest direction from z.

However, the exact cardinal direction relation between x and z can vary based on the specific positioning of these regions. For instance, if x is directly to the left of z (with no vertical offset), then x is West of z. If x is directly above z (with no horizontal offset), then x is North of z.

Given the constraints, I think the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is both to the left and above z)
- North (if x is directly above z)
- West (if x is directly to the left of z)

Hmm, there's actually no constraint in the problem saying y has to be North of x. So x can actually be below y. Let's think again, with more care.

Given:
- x is West of y (x is to the left of y)
- y is North of z (y is above z)

What are the possible relations between x and z?

To think about this more systematically, let's define regions as rectangles in a Cartesian coordinate system.

If region A is West of region B, it means the rightmost point of A is to the left of the leftmost point of B.
If region A is North of region B, it means the bottommost point of A is above the topmost point of B.

Let's denote the coordinates of a region A as (left(A), bottom(A), right(A), top(A)).

Given:
- Region x is West of region y: right(x) < left(y)
- Region y is North of region z: bottom(y) > top(z)

Now, let's consider the different possible relations between x and z:

1. x is Northwest of z:
   - This means right(x) < left(z) and bottom(x) > top(z).
   - From our constraints, we know right(x) < left(y) and bottom(y) > top(z).
   - If left(y) <= left(z), then right(x) < left(z) is satisfied.
   - If bottom(x) >= bottom(y), then bottom(x) > top(z) is satisfied.
   - So, x can be Northwest of z if these conditions are met.

2. x is North of z:
   - This means there's horizontal overlap between x and z, and x is above z. In terms of coordinates: left(x) < right(z) and right(x) > left(z) and bottom(x) > top(z).
   - From our constraints, we know right(x) < left(y) and bottom(y) > top(z).
   - For x to have horizontal overlap with z, we need left(x) < right(z) and right(x) > left(z). Since right(x) < left(y), we can say right(x) > left(z) only if left(z) < left(y).
   - If bottom(x) >= bottom(y), then bottom(x) > top(z) is satisfied.
   - So, x can be North of z if these conditions are met.

3. x is Northeast of z:
   - This means left(x) > right(z) and bottom(x) > top(z).
   - From our constraints, we know right(x) < left(y) and bottom(y) > top(z).
   - For x to be to the right of z, we need left(x) > right(z). Since right(x) < left(y), we can say left(x) > right(z) only if right(z) < left(y).
   - If bottom(x) >= bottom(y), then bottom(x) > top(z) is satisfied.
   - So, x can be Northeast of z if these conditions are met.

4. x is West of z:
   - This means right(x) < left(z) and there's vertical overlap between x and z. In terms of coordinates: right(x) < left(z) and bottom(x) < top(z) and top(x) > bottom(z).
   - From our constraints, we know right(x) < left(y) and bottom(y) > top(z).
   - If left(y) <= left(z), then right(x) < left(z) is satisfied.
   - For x to have vertical overlap with z, we need bottom(x) < top(z) and top(x) > bottom(z).
   - So, x can be West of z if these conditions are met.

5. x is East of z:
   - This means left(x) > right(z) and there's vertical overlap between x and z. In terms of coordinates: left(x) > right(z) and bottom(x) < top(z) and top(x) > bottom(z).
   - From our constraints, we know right(x) < left(y) and bottom(y) > top(z).
   - For x to be to the right of z, we need left(x) > right(z). Since right(x) < left(y), we can say left(x) > right(z) only if right(z) < left(y).
   - For x to have vertical overlap with z, we need bottom(x) < top(z) and top(x) > bottom(z).
   - So, x can be East of z if these conditions are met.

6. x is Southwest of z:
   - This means right(x) < left(z) and top(x) < bottom(z).
   - From our constraints, we know right(x) < left(y) and bottom(y) > top(z).
   - If left(y) <= left(z), then right(x) < left(z) is satisfied.
   - For x to be below z, we need top(x) < bottom(z).
   - So, x can be Southwest of z if these conditions are met.

7. x is South of z:
   - This means there's horizontal overlap between x and z, and x is below z. In terms of coordinates: left(x) < right(z) and right(x) > left(z) and top(x) < bottom(z).
   - From our constraints, we know right(x) < left(y) and bottom(y) > top(z).
   - For x to have horizontal overlap with z, we need left(x) < right(z) and right(x) > left(z). Since right(x) < left(y), we can say right(x) > left(z) only if left(z) < left(y).
   - For x to be below z, we need top(x) < bottom(z).
   - So, x can be South of z if these conditions are met.

8. x is Southeast of z:
   - This means left(x) > right(z) and top(x) < bottom(z).
   - From our constraints, we know right(x) < left(y) and bottom(y) > top(z).
   - For x to be to the right of z, we need left(x) > right(z). Since right(x) < left(y), we can say left(x) > right(z) only if right(z) < left(y).
   - For x to be below z, we need top(x) < bottom(z).
   - So, x can be Southeast of z if these conditions are met.

Now, let's determine which of these relations are always possible regardless of the specific configurations, and which ones are only possible under certain conditions.

I'm not sure if I am overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

Let's use a simple example to visualize this: Imagine a grid with coordinates, where x, y, and z are single points for simplicity (though in reality, they're regions).

Given:
- x is West of y (x is to the left of y)
- y is North of z (y is above z)

Let's set y at the origin (0, 0).
Since x is West of y, x is at (-a, b) for some a > 0 and any b.
Since y is North of z, z is at (c, -d) for some d > 0 and any c.

Now, the coordinates of x are (-a, b) and the coordinates of z are (c, -d).

The relation between x and z is determined by the relationship between -a and c (horizontal) and b and -d (vertical).

Horizontally:
- If -a < c, then x is to the left of z.
- If -a = c, then x and z are horizontally aligned.
- If -a > c, then x is to the right of z.

Vertically:
- If b > -d, then x is above z.
- If b = -d, then x and z are vertically aligned.
- If b < -d, then x is below z.

Combining these, we get all possible relations between x and z:
- If -a < c and b > -d, then x is Northwest of z.
- If -a = c and b > -d, then x is North of z.
- If -a > c and b > -d, then x is Northeast of z.
- If -a < c and b = -d, then x is West of z.
- If -a = c and b = -d, then x and z are at the same location (which doesn't make sense in the context of distinct regions, so we'll ignore this).
- If -a > c and b = -d, then x is East of z.
- If -a < c and b < -d, then x is Southwest of z.
- If -a = c and b < -d, then x is South of z.
- If -a > c and b < -d, then x is Southeast of z.

Wait, there's actually one more constraint I can use. If y is at (0, 0), x is at (-a, b), and z is at (c, -d), then I have the constraint that a > 0 and d > 0. But if I treat these as points, there's no further constraint I can use to determine the relation between (-a, b) and (c, -d).

Actually, I realize the fundamental issue with my approach: we're talking about regions, not points. The fact that x is West of y means that the entirety of region x is to the left of the entirety of region y (with no horizontal overlap). Similarly, y being North of z means that the entirety of region y is above the entirety of region z (with no vertical overlap).

Hmm, I've been overcomplicating this. Let's go back to a coordinate-based reasoning.

If we define the relations based on bounding boxes:
- A is West of B if right(A) < left(B)
- A is North of B if bottom(A) > top(B)
- A is Northwest of B if right(A) < left(B) and bottom(A) > top(B)
- ... and so on for other cardinal directions.

Given:
- x is West of y: right(x) < left(y)
- y is North of z: bottom(y) > top(z)

What does this tell us about the relation between x and z?

From right(x) < left(y) and bottom(y) > top(z), we can't directly derive any constraint on the relation between x and z. This is because the positions of x and z relative to each other are not fully determined by their positions relative to y.

For instance, x can be to the left, at the same horizontal position, or to the right of z, depending on the specific configurations. Similarly, x can be above, at the same vertical position, or below z.

Hmm, actually let me try this. Let's define the Bounding Box relation as well. The bounding box relation between two regions means that one region is entirely contained within the bounding box of the other region.

From our constraints:
- x is West of y: right(x) < left(y)
- y is North of z: bottom(y) > top(z)

From these, we can't derive a direct constraint on the relationship between x and z.

For x to be in the bounding box of z, we'd need:
left(z) <= left(x) <= right(x) <= right(z) and bottom(z) <= bottom(x) <= top(x) <= top(z)

But our constraints don't give us any direct relationship between x and z in terms of their bounding boxes.

Similarly, for z to be in the bounding box of x, we'd need:
left(x) <= left(z) <= right(z) <= right(x) and bottom(x) <= bottom(z) <= top(z) <= top(x)

Again, our constraints don't give us a direct relationship.

Therefore, it doesn't seem like the bounding box relation is necessarily applicable in this context, based solely on the given constraints.

In fact, all 8 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z, depending on the specific configurations of the regions. We can't eliminate any possibility based on the given constraints.

Actually, let's try to be a bit more careful. We know that x is entirely to the left of y (West relation) and y is entirely above z (North relation). We shouldn't be able to get to the East half-plane.

Let's think through each of the 8 possible relations and see if they're compatible with our constraints:

1. x is Northwest of z: This means x is to the left and above z.
   - Since y is to the right of x and above z, this is compatible with our constraints.

2. x is North of z: This means x is directly above z.
   - Since y is to the right of x and above z, this is compatible with our constraints.

3. x is Northeast of z: This means x is to the right and above z.
   - For this to be true, x must be to the right of z. However, y is to the right of x and above z.
   - There's no direct constraint on the horizontal relationship between z and y.
   - If z is to the left of y, and x is between z and y horizontally, then x can be to the right of z.
   - So, this is compatible with our constraints.

4. x is West of z: This means x is to the left of z.
   - Since y is to the right of x and above z, this is compatible with our constraints.

5. x is East of z: This means x is to the right of z.
   - As discussed in point 3, if z is to the left of y, and x is between z and y horizontally, then x can be to the right of z.
   - So, this is compatible with our constraints.

6. x is Southwest of z: This means x is to the left and below z.
   - For this to be true, x must be below z. However, y is above z and to the right of x.
   - There's no direct constraint on the vertical relationship between x and y.
   - If x is below y, and z is between x and y vertically, then x can be below z.
   - So, this is compatible with our constraints.

7. x is South of z: This means x is directly below z.
   - Similarly to point 6, if x is below y and z is between x and y vertically, then x can be below z.
   - So, this is compatible with our constraints.

8. x is Southeast of z: This means x is to the right and below z.
   - Combining the conditions from points 3 and 6, if z is to the left of y and x is between z and y horizontally, and if x is below y and z is between x and y vertically, then x can be to the right and below z.
   - So, this is compatible with our constraints.

OK, so looking at this, it does seem like all 8 cardinal direction relations are possible.

But wait, let's think again. I think I've been making a mistake. If x is West of y, it means the entirety of region x is to the left of the entirety of region y. Similarly, if y is North of z, it means the entirety of region y is above the entirety of region z.

Let's think about this in terms of coordinates:
- x is West of y: right(x) < left(y)
- y is North of z: bottom(y) > top(z)

Now, for x to be Southeast of z, it means left(x) > right(z) and top(x) < bottom(z).

From our constraints, we know right(x) < left(y). We also know bottom(y) > top(z).

For x to be to the right of z (East or Southeast), we need left(x) > right(z). Since right(x) < left(y), this gives us right(z) < left(x) < right(x) < left(y).

This means right(z) < left(y), which means that z cannot horizontally overlap or be to the right of y (i.e., z is to the left of y or overlaps with y on the left side). Hmm, this does not restrict the possibility of x being Southeast of z, as long as z is to the left of y.

I'm going to try a different approach. Let's think of this in terms of half-planes.

If x is West of y, it means x is in the West half-plane of y (to the left of y).
If y is North of z, it means y is in the North half-plane of z (above z).

But what can we say about x in relation to z?

From the fact that x is in the West half-plane of y, we get right(x) < left(y).
From the fact that y is in the North half-plane of z, we get bottom(y) > top(z).

But to determine the relation between x and z, we'd need to compare coordinates of x with those of z directly, like right(x) vs. left(z) or bottom(x) vs. top(z).

From our constraints, we don't have direct comparisons between coordinates of x and z. Therefore, all 8 cardinal direction relations are possible for x in relation to z, depending on the specific configurations.

Hmm, alright. I think we've established that all 8 cardinal direction relations are possible for x in relation to z. So the answer would be: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Actually, let's double-check this with the "bounding box" relation. I think "bounding box" means one region is entirely contained within the bounding box of the other. Let's think through the conditions for x to be in the bounding box of z, or vice versa.

For x to be in the bounding box of z, we'd need:
left(z) <= left(x) <= right(x) <= right(z) and bottom(z) <= bottom(x) <= top(x) <= top(z)

Given our constraints, let's see if this is possible.

From x is West of y, we know right(x) < left(y).
From y is North of z, we know bottom(y) > top(z).

The constraints don't directly relate left(x) to left(z), right(x) to right(z), bottom(x) to bottom(z), or top(x) to top(z), so it's hard to determine if x can be contained in the bounding box of z based solely on these constraints.

Similarly, for z to be in the bounding box of x, we'd need:
left(x) <= left(z) <= right(z) <= right(x) and bottom(x) <= bottom(z) <= top(z) <= top(x)

But again, the constraints don't directly relate the coordinates of x and z.

Therefore, without additional constraints, it's hard to determine if the bounding box relation between x and z is possible.

Let's summarize:

Given:
- x is West of y (right(x) < left(y))
- y is North of z (bottom(y) > top(z))

Possible relations between x and z:
- North (x is directly above z)
- Northeast (x is to the right and above z)
- East (x is to the right of z)
- Southeast (x is to the right and below z)
- South (x is directly below z)
- Southwest (x is to the left and below z)
- West (x is to the left of z)
- Northwest (x is to the left and above z)

The bounding box relation between x and z is also possible, depending on the specific configurations.

So the answer is: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and possibly Bounding Box.

Hmm actually, I'm not quite sure I'm getting the definition of "bounding box" relation correctly here.

Let's define the Bounding Box relation: Region A has a Bounding Box relation with region B if A is entirely contained within the axis-aligned bounding box of B. That is, if the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that contains B also entirely contains A.

Now, for x to have a Bounding Box relation with z, x would need to be entirely contained within the axis-aligned bounding box of z. In other words:
left(z) <= left(x) and right(x) <= right(z) and bottom(z) <= bottom(x) and top(x) <= top(z)

Given our constraints:
- x is West of y (right(x) < left(y))
- y is North of z (bottom(y) > top(z))

We don't have direct constraints on the coordinates of x relative to the coordinates of z. So, depending on the specific configurations, it is possible for x to be entirely contained within the bounding box of z, or not.

Similarly, for z to have a Bounding Box relation with x, z would need to be entirely contained within the axis-aligned bounding box of x. In other words:
left(x) <= left(z) and right(z) <= right(x) and bottom(x) <= bottom(z) and top(z) <= top(x)

Again, our given constraints don't provide direct relations between the coordinates of x and z, so this is also possible depending on the specific configurations.

So, based on the given constraints, the Bounding Box relation can exist between x and z (in either direction), but it's not guaranteed.

Actually, I think the Bounding Box relation is one of the possible relations, but I think I'm mixing up multiple different things here.

From the context of the problem, it seems like we're being asked to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, where the options include North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

Given:
- x is West of y (x is entirely to the left of y)
- y is North of z (y is entirely above z)

Based on our earlier analysis, all 8 cardinal direction relations (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) are possible for x in relation to z, depending on the specific configurations.

Furthermore, the Bounding Box relation, where one region is entirely contained within the axis-aligned bounding box of the other, is also possible (again, depending on the specific configurations).

So, the answer is: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

Wait, on second thought, let me think about this again. The bounding box relation, as I'm understanding it here, would be a separate category from the cardinal direction relations, and there's no clear indication that it's mutually exclusive with the cardinal direction relations. So, I'm not sure if it's correct to include it as a distinct option in the way I've been approaching this.

Actually, let's define Cardinal Direction Relations:

These are a set of relations that describe the relative position of two regions based on the division of 2D space into 9 regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

In the Bounding Box relation, one region is contained within the other.
The other 8 relations indicate the position of one region relative to the other in terms of cardinal directions.

If we're adopting this framework, then the possible relations between x and z given the constraints are indeed: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

Now, let's verify this with the actual definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

From [RCC8 theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_connection_calculus):

Let's consider the axis-aligned bounding box of a region, call it the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle). The MBR of a region divides 2D space into 9 tiles: the MBR itself and 8 surrounding regions corresponding to the 8 cardinal directions.

A region A is to the North of region B if A falls entirely in the North tile of B's MBR.
A region A is to the Northeast of region B if A falls entirely in the Northeast tile of B's MBR.
... and so on for the other cardinal directions.
A region A is in the Bounding Box relation with region B if A falls entirely within B's MBR.

Using this definition, let's reason about the possible relations between x and z given our constraints:
- x is West of y (x falls entirely in the West tile of y's MBR)
- y is North of z (y falls entirely in the North tile of z's MBR)

Can x fall entirely in the North tile of z's MBR?
- The North tile of z's MBR extends upwards from the top of z.
- y is entirely in the North tile of z.
- x is entirely to the left of y.
- There's no constraint on the vertical position of x relative to z.
- So, if x is at the same vertical level as or above z, then x can be in the North tile of z's MBR.
- Therefore, it's possible for x to be to the North of z.

Wait, I realize I'm getting confused by the definition. Let me be a bit more precise. Cardinal direction relations are defined based on the MBR of a region. Let's define this properly.

Consider a region A. Its MBR divides 2D space into 9 tiles: the MBR itself and 8 surrounding regions corresponding to the 8 cardinal directions. For another region B:
- B is North of A if B is entirely contained in the North tile of A's MBR.
- B is Northeast of A if B is entirely contained in the Northeast tile of A's MBR.
- ... and so on for the other cardinal directions.
- B is in the Bounding Box relation with A if B is entirely contained within A's MBR.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z given the constraints:
- x is West of y (x is entirely contained in the West tile of y's MBR)
- y is North of z (y is entirely contained in the North tile of z's MBR)

Can x be entirely contained in the North tile of z's MBR?
- The North tile of z's MBR extends upwards from the top of z.
- y is entirely contained in the North tile of z.
- x is entirely contained in the West tile of y.
- Depending on the specific configuration, x can be vertically aligned with, above, or below z.
- If x is above the top of z, it can be entirely contained in the North tile of z's MBR.
- Therefore, it's possible for x to be North of z.

Alright, I think I'm going to be very precise one more time.

We know that x is West of y and y is North of z, and we need to find the possible relations between x and z.

For reference, here's the full set of cardinal direction relations:
1. North (N): One region is directly above another, with some horizontal overlap.
2. Northeast (NE): One region is diagonally above and to the right of another.
3. East (E): One region is directly to the right of another, with some vertical overlap.
4. Southeast (SE): One region is diagonally below and to the right of another.
5. South (S): One region is directly below another, with some horizontal overlap.
6. Southwest (SW): One region is diagonally below and to the left of another.
7. West (W): One region is directly to the left of another, with some vertical overlap.
8. Northwest (NW): One region is diagonally above and to the left of another.
9. Bounding Box (BB): One region is entirely contained within the axis-aligned bounding box of another.

OK, but this is not precise enough. Let's use the formal definition. The space is divided into 9 regions by the Minimum Bounding Rectangle of a region. These 9 regions correspond to the 9 possible relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and BB.

Given our constraints, let's see which of these 9 relations are possible for x in relation to z.

x is West of y:
- This means the entirety of x is to the left of the left edge of y's MBR. In other words, right(x) < left(y).

y is North of z:
- This means the entirety of y is above the top edge of z's MBR. In other words, bottom(y) > top(z).

For x to be North of z, the entirety of x must be above the top edge of z's MBR, and x must overlap horizontally with z's MBR.
- We know bottom(y) > top(z).
- If bottom(x) >= bottom(y), then bottom(x) > top(z), which means x is above the top edge of z's MBR.
- For horizontal overlap, we need left(x) < right(z) and right(x) > left(z).
- Given right(x) < left(y), if left(z) <= left(y), then x might not overlap horizontally with z.
- However, if left(z) < right(x), then x can overlap horizontally with z.
- So, x can be North of z under certain conditions.

I think I'm getting into the weeds here too much, and the constraints actually can't determine anything of substance about the relationship between x and z, other than some positioning of y constrains the ranges of locations of x and z.

But let's continue. Intuitively, I have x to the left of y and y above z. This can be diagrammed as:

```
   x
      y
         z
```

Where, for instance, x is to the Northwest of z.

But also I can have:

```
      y
   x
         z
```

Where, for instance, x is to the West of z. 

I can keep going with these. In general, x can assume any of the 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) in relation to z. It can also potentially be in the Bounding Box relation if x is contained entirely within z's MBR or vice versa.

OK, so let's just check whether any of the 9 relations can be definitively ruled out based on our constraints. In particular, can x be to the East of z? If x is to the East of z, then the entirety of x is to the right of the right edge of z's MBR. In other words, left(x) > right(z). We know that x is to the left of y, so right(x) < left(y). For x to be to the right of z, we need left(x) > right(z). Combining these, we get right(z) < left(x) < right(x) < left(y), which means right(z) < left(y). This just means that z cannot be to the right of y, but there's no direct conflict with our constraints.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused by thinking too hard. Let's take a step back and try a different tack. I've been using "the entirety of x is to the left of the left edge of y's MBR" and "x is to the left of y" interchangably, but I'm not sure if that's correct. I'd think cardinal directions are relative directions, and saying "x is west of y" doesn't necessarily mean the entirety of x is to the left of y. It more directly means in the compass direction sense that (the center of) x is to the west of (the center of) y. That means that x could horizontally overlap with y and still be considered to the west, as long as the center of x is to the west of the center of y.

Hmm, no, that can't be right. Cardinal direction relations are indeed defined in terms of the MBR, not just the centers of regions.

Let me try to be very precise:

If region A is in the cardinal direction relation X (where X is one of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or BB) with region B, it means the entirety of region A is within the tile X of region B's MBR.

For example, if region A is North of region B, the entirety of region A is above the top edge of region B's MBR.

Given our constraints:
- x is West of y: The entirety of region x is to the left of the left edge of y's MBR.
- y is North of z: The entirety of region y is above the top edge of z's MBR.

I'm going to try each of the 9 cardinal direction relations between x and z, and see if any can be ruled out based on these constraints.

1. x is North of z: This means the entirety of x is above the top edge of z's MBR.
   - We know y is entirely above the top edge of z's MBR.
   - We know x is entirely to the left of the left edge of y's MBR.
   - There's no constraint on the vertical position of x relative to z.
   - So, x can be North of z (if x is also above the top edge of z's MBR).

2. x is Northeast of z: This means the entirety of x is above the top edge and to the right of the right edge of z's MBR.
   - Similar to the North case, there's no constraint on the vertical position of x relative to z.
   - Also, there's no constraint on the horizontal position of x relative to z.
   - So, x can be Northeast of z (if x is above the top edge and to the right of the right edge of z's MBR).

3. x is East of z: This means the entirety of x is to the right of the right edge of z's MBR.
   - We know x is entirely to the left of the left edge of y's MBR.
   - There's no constraint on the horizontal position of z relative to y.
   - If z is sufficiently to the left of y, then x can be to the right of z and still to the left of y.
   - So, x can be East of z under certain conditions.

I'm getting the feeling again that I'm not correctly interpreting Cardinal Direction Relations. Let me just reason about the spatial relationships directly.

Let me see if I can come up with specific counterexamples for each of the 9 cardinal direction relations. I'll define regions in terms of their MBRs, and I'll check if there's any configuration that respects the constraints (x is West of y and y is North of z) but still places x in a particular relation with z.

Let's define MBRs using (left, bottom, right, top) coordinates:

1. x is North of z:
   - Let's define z = (0, 0, 1, 1), y = (3, 3, 4, 4), and x = (0, 2, 1, 3).
   - With these coordinates, x is to the left of y (right(x) = 1 < left(y) = 3), and y is above z (bottom(y) = 3 > top(z) = 1).
   - And x is directly above z, making x North of z.

2. x is Northeast of z:
   - Let's define z = (0, 0, 1, 1), y = (3, 3, 4, 4), and x = (2, 2, 3, 3).
   - With these coordinates, x is to the left of y (right(x) = 3 < left(y) = 3), and y is above z (bottom(y) = 3 > top(z) = 1).
   - And x is to the right and above z, making x Northeast of z.

3. x is East of z:
   - Let's define z = (0, 0, 1, 1), y = (3, 3, 4, 4), and x = (2, 0, 3, 1).
   - With these coordinates, x is to the left of y (right(x) = 3 < left(y) = 3), and y is above z (bottom(y) = 3 > top(z) = 1).
   - And x is directly to the right of z, making x East of z.

4. x is Southeast of z:
   - Let's define z = (2, 2, 3, 3), y = (5, 5, 6, 6), and x = (4, 0, 5, 1).
   - With these coordinates, x is to the left of y (right(x) = 5 < left(y) = 5), and y is above z (bottom(y) = 5 > top(z) = 3).
   - And x is to the right and below z, making x Southeast of z.

5. x is South of z:
   - Let's define z = (2, 2, 3, 3), y = (5, 5, 6, 6), and x = (2, 0, 3, 1).
   - With these coordinates, x is to the left of y (right(x) = 3 < left(y) = 5), and y is above z (bottom(y) = 5 > top(z) = 3).
   - And x is directly below z, making x South of z.

6. x is Southwest of z:
   - Let's define z = (2, 2, 3, 3), y = (5, 5, 6, 6), and x = (0, 0, 1, 1).
   - With these coordinates, x is to the left of y (right(x) = 1 < left(y) = 5), and y is above z (bottom(y) = 5 > top(z) = 3).
   - And x is to the left and below z, making x Southwest of z.

7. x is West of z:
   - Let's define z = (2, 2, 3, 3), y = (5, 5, 6, 6), and x = (0, 2, 1, 3).
   - With these coordinates, x is to the left of y (right(x) = 1 < left(y) = 5), and y is above z (bottom(y) = 5 > top(z) = 3).
   - And x is directly to the left of z, making x West of z.

8. x is Northwest of z:
   - Let's define z = (2, 0, 3, 1), y = (5, 5, 6, 6), and x = (0, 2, 1, 3).
   - With these coordinates, x is to the left of y (right(x) = 1 < left(y) = 5), and y is above z (bottom(y) = 5 > top(z) = 1).
   - And x is to the left and above z, making x Northwest of z.

9. x is in the Bounding Box relation with z:
   - Let's define z = (0, 0, 4, 4), y = (5, 5, 6, 6), and x = (1, 1, 2, 2).
   - With these coordinates, x is to the left of y (right(x) = 2 < left(y) = 5), and y is above z (bottom(y) = 5 > top(z) = 4).
   - And x is entirely contained within z's MBR, making x in the Bounding Box relation with z.

Hmm, on reflection, I think we really want to think of this in terms of the TILE ALGEBRA interpretation.

The tiling of the 2D plane around a region A gives 9 zones (tles): A's MBR and 8 surrounding tiles (corresponding to the 8 cardinal directions).

Using this interpretation, a region B is said to be in the cardinal direction relation X with region A if B is entirely contained within the tile X of the tiling around A.

Given our constraints:
- x is West of y: The entirety of region x is within the West tile of the tiling around y.
- y is North of z: The entirety of region y is within the North tile of the tiling around z.

Hmm, I'd already done this, and I found that all 9 cardinal direction relations were possible. Let me wrap up.

Given our constraints:
- x is West of y
- y is North of z

We've found that x can be in any of the 9 cardinal direction relations with z, depending on the specific configurations:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
- Bounding Box

So, the answer is: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

Actually, one last thought. With the tile algebra interpretation, does "Bounding Box" mean that one region is inside the MBR of another, or does it mean that there's a bounding box containment relationship between the two regions?

I think "Bounding Box" in the context of cardinal direction relations means that one region is entirely contained within the MBR of another.

Given our constraints, we showed earlier that it's possible for x to be entirely contained within the MBR of z (or vice versa), depending on the specific configurations.

OK, so the the answer is that x can be in any of these relations to z:
North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given, I need to determine all possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is North of region z

In cardinal direction terms:
- West means x is entirely to
