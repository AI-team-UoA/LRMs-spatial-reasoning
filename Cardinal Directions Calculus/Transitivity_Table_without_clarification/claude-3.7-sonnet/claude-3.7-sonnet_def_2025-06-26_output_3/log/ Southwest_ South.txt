PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z based on the given information.

Given:
- x is Southwest of y
- y is South of z

I need to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's think about this spatially. 

For x to be Southwest of y, it means that x is to the south and to the west of y.
For y to be South of z, it means that y is to the south of z.

So, if we place these regions on a 2D grid, with North being up, South being down, East being right, and West being left, we have:

z
|
y
/ \
x

Here's a more detailed representation:

```
       z
       |
       |
       y
      / \
     /   \
    x
```

From this, we can see that x is to the southwest of y, and y is to the south of z. Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider the possible positions of x relative to z.

Given that x is Southwest of y and y is South of z, we can conclude that x is definitely to the south of z. But what about the east-west relation?

x is to the west of y, and y is directly south of z. This means that x is to the west of the north-south line from z to y. So, x is to the southwest of z.

Let's double-check this. 

If we consider a coordinate system with z at (0, 0), and North corresponds to the positive y-axis and East corresponds to the positive x-axis, then:
- y would be at (0, -a) for some positive a, indicating it's South of z.
- x would be at (-b, -a-c) for some positive b and c, indicating it's Southwest of y.

Now, the relation between x and z would be from (0, 0) to (-b, -a-c), which is Southwest.

Actually, let me rethink this. Let's define the directions more precisely, using a coordinate system:

- North: (0, 1)
- South: (0, -1)
- East: (1, 0)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northeast: (1, 1)
- Northwest: (-1, 1)
- Southeast: (1, -1)
- Southwest: (-1, -1)

Now, I'll place z at the origin (0, 0).

If y is South of z, then y is in the (0, -1) direction. If we normalize, y would be at (0, -1) from z.

If x is Southwest of y, then x is in the (-1, -1) direction from y. If we normalize, x would be at (-1, -1) from y.

So, if y is at (0, -1) and x is at (-1, -1) from y, then x would be at (0, -1) + (-1, -1) = (-1, -2) from z.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to find the direction from z to x, which is (-1, -2). Normalizing this, it's in the direction of (-0.5, -1). This is between South and Southwest, but it's closer to South. But in cardinal directions, we typically use the 8 main directions or a bounding box. So, the relation would most accurately be described as Southwest.

Wait, I realize I've been making a spatial error. Cardinal direction relations don't just define a single direction, but rather a region. For instance, if x is Southwest of y, it means x lies in the region that is both South and West of y, not just along the diagonal.

Given:
- x is Southwest of y: x is in the region that is both South and West of y.
- y is South of z: y is in the region that is South of z.

Let's think about this more precisely:

1. If y is South of z, then y lies in the region south of z. This can be represented as a half-plane below z.
2. If x is Southwest of y, then x lies in the region southwest of y, which is a quadrant originating from y and extending southwest.

To find the possible relations between x and z, I need to determine where x can be in relation to z.

Since x is southwest of y, and y is south of z, we know that x is south of y, which is already south of z. So, x is definitely south of z. But x is also west of y. And since y is directly south of z, x is also west of z. So, x is both south and west of z, making the relation between x and z also Southwest.

Actually, I need to be more careful here. If y is South of z, it means y lies along the south of z, which doesn't constrain y's east-west position relative to z. So, y could be directly south, or it could be slightly southwest or southeast of z, as long as it's primarily south.

Now, if x is Southwest of y, it means x is south and west of y. 

Let's consider all possible positions of y relative to z, keeping in mind that y is South of z:
1. y is directly south of z.
2. y is southwest of z (but primarily south).
3. y is southeast of z (but primarily south).

Now, for each of these possibilities, let's find the relation between x and z:

1. If y is directly south of z, and x is southwest of y, then x is southwest of z.
2. If y is southwest of z, and x is southwest of y, then x is southwest of z (but more west compared to case 1).
3. If y is southeast of z, and x is southwest of y, then x could be directly south of z (if the west movement from y to x exactly cancels the east movement from z to y), or it could be southwest or southeast of z, depending on how much east or west it is.

Ok I've been making this problem a lot more complicated than it is. Let me reinterpret the problem:

Cardinal Direction Relations: In this context, there are 8 cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) and a Bounding Box relation. These relations partition the 2D space into 9 regions.

Given:
- x is Southwest of y
- y is South of z

I need to determine which of the 9 possible relations can hold between x and z.

Let's analyze this systematically.

For y to be South of z, y must be in the southern region of z. This means y lies somewhere in the South region of z.

For x to be Southwest of y, x must be in the southwestern region of y. This means x lies somewhere in the Southwest region of y.

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, I need to think about where x can be in relation to z, given the above constraints.

Since y is South of z, y lies somewhere in the South region of z. And since x is Southwest of y, x lies somewhere in the Southwest region of y.

Now, where can x be in relation to z?

Certainly, x is south of z, because y is south of z, and x is south of y. So, x is further south than y, which is already south of z.

Also, x is west of y, and y is somewhere south of z. This means x is somewhere in the Western hemisphere relative to the north-south line passing through z.

Combining these two insights, x is both south and west of z, which means x is in the Southwest region of z.

But I need to double-check if x can also be in any other regions relative to z. Let me consider some extreme cases:

1. If y is right at the boundary between the South and Southeast regions of z (but still in the South region), and x is right at the boundary between the Southwest and South regions of y (but still in the Southwest region), then x would be directly South of z.

2. If y is right at the boundary between the South and Southwest regions of z (but still in the South region), and x is right at the boundary between the Southwest and West regions of y (but still in the Southwest region), then x would be directly West of z.

3. For x to be in the Southeast, East, Northeast, North, or Northwest regions of z, it would need to be north or east of z in some way. But since y is South of z, and x is Southwest of y, x is definitely south and west of z in some way, which means x cannot be in these regions.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South (extreme case 1)
- West (extreme case 2)

Actually, let me double-check the extreme case 2. If y is at the boundary between the South and Southwest regions of z, and x is at the boundary between the Southwest and West regions of y, then x is both west of y and south of y. Since y is already at the boundary between South and Southwest of z, if we go west from y, we're still in the Southwest region of z. So, x would still be in the Southwest region of z, not the West region.

Let me rethink this. The extreme case 2 would be: If y is directly South of z, and x is at the far west of the Southwest region of y, then x would be Southwest of z.

I'm not sure if x can be directly West of z. Let me try again.

For y to be South of z, y lies in the South region of z. This means the east-west position of y relative to z is unconstrained; y can be slightly east, directly below, or slightly west of z, as long as it's primarily south.

Now, for x to be Southwest of y, x lies in the Southwest region of y, which means x is both south and west of y.

If y is directly South of z, and x is directly West of y, then x would be Southwest of z.

If y is slightly West of z (but still in the South region), and x is directly West of y, then x is even more West compared to z, so x would still be Southwest of z.

If y is slightly East of z (but still in the South region), and x is directly West of y, then x could be directly South of z (if the westward offset from y to x exactly cancels the eastward offset from z to y). If the westward offset from y to x is greater than the eastward offset from z to y, then x would be Southwest of z. If the westward offset is less, then x would be Southeast of z.

Ok I'm making errors again, let me carefully trace out the constraints:

For y to be South of z, we know that latitude_of_y < latitude_of_z and longitude_of_y = longitude_of_z.
For x to be Southwest of y, we know that latitude_of_x < latitude_of_y and longitude_of_x < longitude_of_y.

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z.

If latitude_of_x < latitude_of_y and latitude_of_y < latitude_of_z, then by transitivity, latitude_of_x < latitude_of_z. This means x is South of z in terms of latitude.

If longitude_of_x < longitude_of_y and longitude_of_y = longitude_of_z, then longitude_of_x < longitude_of_z. This means x is West of z in terms of longitude.

So, x is both South and West of z, which means x is Southwest of z.

But wait, actually, for cardinal direction relations, South doesn't necessarily mean exactly south. It means that y is in the South region of z, which is a half-plane. Similarly, Southwest doesn't mean exactly southwest, but it means x is in the Southwest region of y, which is a quadrant.

Ok, let me re-approach the problem using the concept of regions. Let's use (x1, y1) to denote the coordinates of region x, (x2, y2) for region y, and (x3, y3) for region z.

For cardinal direction relations, the regions are defined as:
- North: y2 > y3, x2 = x3
- South: y2 < y3, x2 = x3
- East: y2 = y3, x2 > x3
- West: y2 = y3, x2 < x3
- Northeast: y2 > y3, x2 > x3
- Northwest: y2 > y3, x2 < x3
- Southeast: y2 < y3, x2 > x3
- Southwest: y2 < y3, x2 < x3

Given that y is South of z, we have:
- y2 < y3
- x2 = x3

Given that x is Southwest of y, we have:
- y1 < y2
- x1 < x2

Now, we want to determine the relation between x and z.

- y1 < y2 and y2 < y3, so y1 < y3. This means x is South of z in terms of the y-coordinate.
- x1 < x2 and x2 = x3, so x1 < x3. This means x is West of z in terms of the x-coordinate.

Combining these, x is Southwest of z.

But I have to admit, I'm not sure if I've correctly interpreted the cardinal direction relations. I'm not sure if South means exactly south, or if it's a half-plane. Let's me try to interpret the problem differently.

In the context of qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations are often defined using the 9-intersection model. In this model, the space is divided into 9 regions based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a reference object:

- NW (Northwest): Above and to the left of the MBR.
- N (North): Above the MBR.
- NE (Northeast): Above and to the right of the MBR.
- W (West): To the left of the MBR.
- O (Origin or Bounding Box): Inside the MBR.
- E (East): To the right of the MBR.
- SW (Southwest): Below and to the left of the MBR.
- S (South): Below the MBR.
- SE (Southeast): Below and to the right of the MBR.

Oh wait, sorry for making things so complex. Let me take a step back and re-interpret the problem more simply.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, if we say that "region x is Southwest of region y," it means that x is in the southwest direction from y. Similarly, if "region y is South of region z," it means that y is in the south direction from z.

The question is asking about the possible relations between regions x and z.

Let's denote the coordinates of the centers of the regions as (x1, y1) for region x, (x2, y2) for region y, and (x3, y3) for region z.

Given:
- x is Southwest of y: This means x1 < x2 (x is West of y) and y1 < y2 (x is South of y).
- y is South of z: This means x2 = x3 (y is directly South of z) and y2 < y3 (y is South of z).

Now, to determine the relation between x and z:
- x1 < x2 and x2 = x3, so x1 < x3. This means x is West of z.
- y1 < y2 and y2 < y3, so y1 < y3. This means x is South of z.

Combining these, x is Southwest of z.

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if South means directly south, or if it's a half-plane. Let me re-approach the problem using the concept of regions and a more general interpretation of cardinal directions.

In the context of qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations are defined using a partitioning of the space around a reference object. One common system is the cone-based model, where the space is divided into 8 conical regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) based on the center of the reference object.

In this system, if we say "region x is Southwest of region y," it means that x is in the southwest conical region from the center of y. Similarly, if "region y is South of region z," it means that y is in the south conical region from the center of z.

Let me try visualizing the problem in the x-y plane. Let's say we the compass directions correspond to the axes as follows:
- North: +y
- South: -y
- East: +x
- West: -x

Now, if y is South of z, it means that y is in the south cone of z. This cone is defined by the angle interval from 157.5° to 202.5° (where 0° is East, and we're moving counterclockwise). Similarly, if x is Southwest of y, it means that x is in the southwest cone of y, which is defined by the angle interval from 202.5° to 247.5°.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). If y is South of z, then y is in the south cone of z, which means that y is below z, with a possibility of being slightly east or west. Let's say y is at (a, -b), where b > 0 and |a| < b (for it to be in the south cone).

Now, if x is Southwest of y, then x is in the southwest cone of y. Let's say x is at (a + c, -b - d), where d > 0 and c < -d (for it to be in the southwest cone).

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to find the angle between the positive x-axis and the vector from z to x, which is (a + c, -b - d).

The angle is given by:
θ = arctan((−b − d)/(a + c))

For x to be in the Southwest cone of z, we need:
202.5° < θ < 247.5°

Which means:
-2.4142 < (−b − d)/(a + c) < -0.4142

Let's analyze this inequality based on the constraints we have:
- b > 0 (for y to be south of z)
- |a| < b (for y to be in the south cone of z)
- d > 0 (for x to be south of y)
- c < -d (for x to be in the southwest cone of y)

Hmm, I'm finding it difficult to determine analytically whether x will always be in the Southwest cone of z, or if there are cases where it might be in the South or West cones.

Actually, wait, let me go back to the basic definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

When we say "region A is South of region B", in the context of cardinal direction relations, we typically mean that every point in region A is to the south of some point in region B. Similarly, when we say "region A is Southwest of region B", we mean that every point in region A is to the southwest of some point in region B.

Given this interpretation, I want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that "x is Southwest of y" and "y is South of z".

I know for sure that one possible relation is "x is Southwest of z". But the question asks for all possible relations.

Actually, let me consider the case where regions are represented as points. In that case, the cardinal direction relations are straightforward:
- If y is directly South of z, and x is directly Southwest of y, then x is Southwest of z.

But if regions have an extent, then the relation becomes more complex. For example, if region y partially overlaps with the South cone of z, and region x partially overlaps with the Southwest cone of y, then region x might overlap with the South, Southwest, or West cones of z.

I think I've been approaching this problem with too much complexity. Let me try a simpler approach based on the cone-based model.

In the cone-based model, the space is divided into 8 conical regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) based on the center of the reference object. Each cone is 45° wide.

Given that y is South of z, and x is Southwest of y, where can x be in relation to z?

If y is directly South of z, and x is directly Southwest of y, then the angle between the vectors z-to-y and y-to-x is 45°. This would place x at an angle of 225° from z, which is in the Southwest cone.

But if y is not directly South of z, but is still in the South cone, then the angle between the vectors z-to-y and y-to-x could vary. The South cone spans from 157.5° to 202.5°, and the Southwest cone spans from 202.5° to 247.5°.

If y is at the easternmost edge of the South cone (at 157.5°), and x is at the easternmost edge of the Southwest cone (at 202.5° with respect to y), then x would be at an angle of 157.5° + 202.5° - 180° = 180° from z, which is directly West of z.

On the other hand, if y is at the westernmost edge of the South cone (at 202.5°), and x is at the westernmost edge of the Southwest cone (at 247.5° with respect to y), then x would be at an angle of 202.5° + 247.5° - 180° = 270° from z, which is directly South of z.

So, it seems that x can be West, Southwest, or South of z.

But actually, the cardinal direction relation of "South" doesn't mean that y is in the south cone, but it means that y is to the south of z, which can be represented as the half-plane below z.

Actually, the problem with my approach is that I'm not interpreting the cardinal direction relations correctly. In the context of this problem, I believe the cardinal direction relations are defined using the projection-based model. In this model, the space is divided into 9 regions based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a reference object. 

But let me re-approach this from a different angle: Let me think of the cardinal directions in a more traditional sense, like on a compass. If we have:
- 8 directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
- Bounding Box

Given that y is South of z, and x is Southwest of y, where can x be in relation to z?

If I place z at the origin, then y is somewhere to the South of z. And x is somewhere to the Southwest of y.

Let's denote the directions as vectors: 
North = (0, 1), South = (0, -1), East = (1, 0), West = (-1, 0), Northeast = (1, 1), Northwest = (-1, 1), Southeast = (1, -1), Southwest = (-1, -1). I'm using these as unit directions, so the vectors are not normalized.

If y is at South of z, then y is in the direction of (0, -1) from z.
If x is at Southwest of y, then x is in the direction of (-1, -1) from y.

Combining these, x is in the direction of (0, -1) + (-1, -1) = (-1, -2) from z. This is South-southwest of z, which is not one of the 8 cardinal directions. If we round to the nearest cardinal direction, it would be Southwest. but we are asked for the possible relations, so maybe the intended interpretation is different.

Ok, wait, let me take another approach. 
Let me use the notation (xi, yi) for coordinates of region i. 

If region y is South of region z, then:
- y2 < z2 (y is South of z in terms of latitude)
- y1 = z1 (y is at the same longitude as z)

If region x is Southwest of region y, then:
- x2 < y2 (x is South of y in terms of latitude)
- x1 < y1 (x is West of y in terms of longitude)

Now, to determine the relation between regions x and z, I need to compare their coordinates.

- x2 < y2 and y2 < z2, so x2 < z2. This means x is South of z in terms of latitude.
- x1 < y1 and y1 = z1, so x1 < z1. This means x is West of z in terms of longitude.

So, x is both South and West of z, which means the relation is Southwest.

But I think that the problem is asking for all possible relations, not just the most direct or obvious one. So I'm going to try to be more comprehensive. Specifically, I've been thinking of regions as points, which constrains the relations. But if regions have an extent, then the relation becomes more complex. 

Actually, let me explicitly list all 9 possible relations and check which ones are possible:

1. North: For x to be North of z, x2 > z2 and x1 = z1. But we've established that x2 < z2, so this is not possible.
2. Northeast: For x to be Northeast of z, x2 > z2 and x1 > z1. But we've established that x2 < z2, so this is not possible.
3. East: For x to be East of z, x2 = z2 and x1 > z1. But we've established that x2 < z2, so this is not possible.
4. Southeast: For x to be Southeast of z, x2 < z2 and x1 > z1. We've established that x2 < z2, but we've also established that x1 < z1, so this is not possible.
5. South: For x to be South of z, x2 < z2 and x1 = z1. We've established that x2 < z2, but we've also established that x1 < z1, so this is not possible.
6. Southwest: For x to be Southwest of z, x2 < z2 and x1 < z1. We've established both of these, so this is possible.
7. West: For x to be West of z, x2 = z2 and x1 < z1. We've established that x1 < z1, but we've also established that x2 < z2, so this is not possible.
8. Northwest: For x to be Northwest of z, x2 > z2 and x1 < z1. We've established that x1 < z1, but we've also established that x2 < z2, so this is not possible.
9. Bounding Box: For x to be in the Bounding Box of z, x would have to be inside or on the boundary of z, which doesn't seem possible given the constraints.

So, based on this analysis, it seems that the only possible relation between x and z is Southwest.

Hmm, that's not matching what I computed before, when I said that x could be South, Southwest, or West of z. Let me re-check.

Ok the problem is that I've been using different interpretations of the cardinal direction relations. 

Approach 1: Treating regions as points.
If region y is South of region z, then y2 < z2 and y1 = z1.
If region x is Southwest of region y, then x2 < y2 and x1 < y1.
Combining these, x2 < z2 and x1 < z1, so x is Southwest of z.

Approach 2: Using the cone-based model.
In this approach, the space is divided into 8 conical regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) based on the center of the reference object. Each cone is 45° wide.
If y is in the South cone of z, and x is in the Southwest cone of y, then x can be in the Southwest, South, or West cone of z, depending on where in the cones y and x are.

I should go with approach 1. if y is South of z, then it's directly south, not in a cone. likewise, it x is southwest of y, then it's directly southwest, not in a cone.

Given that:
- y is South of z, so y2 < z2 and y1 = z1.
- x is Southwest of y, so x2 < y2 and x1 < y1.

Combining these:
- x2 < y2 < z2, so x is South of z in terms of latitude.
- x1 < y1 = z1, so x is West of z in terms of longitude.

So, x is both South and West of z, which means the relation is Southwest.

That's my final answer: the possible relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually let me just double check the question again. The problem asked about the "possible relations", but I've been trying to find "the" relation. Let me re-read the problem statement.

Ok, the question asked about "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", which means the relations are not limited to the 8 cardinal directions + bounding box, but could be more complex.

Actually, I think the confusion is due to the fact that I've been using different interpretations of the cardinal direction relations. Let's go with the following interpretation:

In the context of qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations are defined using a partitioning of the space around a reference object. The cone-based model is one approach, where the space is divided into 8 conical regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) based on the center of the reference object.

Using this model, if we say "region y is South of region z", it means that the center of y is in the South cone of z. Similarly, if "region x is Southwest of region y", it means that the center of x is in the Southwest cone of y.

The South cone spans from 157.5° to 202.5° (where 0° is East, and we're moving counterclockwise), and the Southwest cone spans from 202.5° to 247.5°.

If the center of y is in the South cone of z, and the center of x is in the Southwest cone of y, then the center of x can be in the South, Southwest, or West cone of z, depending on where in the cones the centers of y and x are.

This matches the answer I computed before, that x could be South, Southwest, or West of z. That makes sense.

But actually, I still am not sure, because the statement "region y is South of region z" might still mean that y is directly South of z (y1 = z1, y2 < z2) rather than in the south cone. And the question asks for the "possible relations", which would in general include all 9 possible relations.

Actually, the problem statement says that "The possible answer can be one or more of these: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box." It's clear that these are the possible relations, and the question is asking me to decide which of these 9 relations can hold between x and z, given that x is Southwest of y and y is South of z.

I'm inclined to go with my approach 1, where the cardinal direction relations are defined by the relative positions of the centers of the regions. Thus, I have:

Given that:
- y is South of z, so y2 < z2 and y1 = z1.
- x is Southwest of y, so x2 < y2 and x1 < y1.

Combining these:
- x2 < y2 < z2, so x is South of z in terms of latitude.
- x1 < y1 = z1, so x is West of z in terms of longitude.

So, x is both South and West of z, which means the relation is Southwest.

But the problem is ambiguous. Let me consider both the standard direction-based relations and the cone-based relations (which is more standard in qualitative spatial reasoning):

Approach 1: Treating regions as points with standard direction-based relations.
If region y is South of region z, then y2 < z2 and y1 = z1.
If region x is Southwest of region y, then x2 < y2 and x1 < y1.
Combining these, x2 < z2 and x1 < z1, so x is Southwest of z.

Approach 2: Using the cone-based model.
In this model, the space is divided into 8 conical regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) based on the center of the reference object. Each cone is 45° wide.

If y is in the South cone of z, and x is in the Southwest cone of y, then x can be in the Southwest, South, or West cone of z, depending on where in the cones y and x are.

Wait, I realize a mistake I've been making. When treating regions as points, I've been assuming that "South" means directly South, but that's not necessarily the case. In the point-based model, the space is still divided into 8 regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) based on the 8 compass directions, and the relation is determined by which region the target point falls into.

In this model, if region y is South of region z, it means the center of y is in the South region of z, which is defined by 157.5° to 202.5° from the center of z. Similarly, if region x is Southwest of region y, it means the center of x is in the Southwest region of y, which is defined by 202.5° to 247.5° from the center of y.

Hmm, this is exactly the cone-based model.

Actually, let's just try to visualize this geometrically.

I'll denote the position of region i as (xi, yi) in a 2D coordinate system.

If region y is South of region z, it means the center of y is in the South region of z. In the compass directions, South is at 180° (or -90° in standard trigonometric angle). The South region spans from 157.5° to 202.5°. So, if we place z at the origin, y could be anywhere within this region.

For example, y could be at the following positions:
- Directly South of z: (0, -1)
- Slightly South-southeast of z: (0.2, -0.9)
- Slightly South-southwest of z: (-0.2, -0.9)

Similarly, if region x is Southwest of region y, it means the center of x is in the Southwest region of y. In the compass directions, Southwest is at 225° (or -135° in standard trigonometric angle). The Southwest region spans from 202.5° to 247.5°. So, if we place y at its position, x could be anywhere within this region relative to y.

For example, if y is at (0, -1), x could be at the following positions:
- Directly Southwest of y: (-0.7, -1.7)
- Slightly more South than West from y: (-0.5, -1.9)
- Slightly more West than South from y: (-0.9, -1.5)

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, I need to find where x can be in relation to z.

If y is directly South of z, and x is directly Southwest of y, then x is Southwest of z.

But if y is slightly South-southeast of z, and x is slightly more West than South from y, then x might be more West of z than Southwest.

And if y is slightly South-southwest of z, and x is slightly more South than West from y, then x might be more South of z than Southwest.

So, it seems like the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, South, and West.

Actually, let me check South carefully. For x to be South of z, it needs to be in the South region of z, which spans from 157.5° to 202.5°.

If y is at the southeasternmost point of the South region of z (at 157.5°), and x is at the southwesternmost point of the Southwest region of y (at 247.5°), then the angle between z and x would be 157.5° + 247.5° - 180° = 225°, which is in the Southwest region of z. So, it doesn't reach the South region.

If y is at the southwesternmost point of the South region of z (at 202.5°), and x is at the southeasternmost point of the Southwest region of y (at 202.5°), then the angle between z and x would be 202.5° + 202.5° - 180° = 225°, which is in the Southwest region of z. So, it also doesn't reach the South region.

Actually, lets move the "southmost" orientations. 

Actually wait, I think I was making an error. The angle between the positive x-axis and the vector is not simply adding the angles and subtracting 180°. Let's think more carefully.

If z is at the origin, y is at an angle of 180° from z, and x is at an angle of 225° from y, then the position of x would be:
- y's position: (0, -1)
- Vector from y to x: (-1, -1)
- x's position: (0, -1) + (-1, -1) = (-1, -2)
- Angle between positive x-axis and vector from z to x: arctan((-2)/(-1)) = arctan(2) ≈ 63.4° and the angle in compass directions is 180° + 63.4° = 243.4°, which is in the Southwest region.

But if y is at an angle of 157.5° from z, and x is at an angle of 247.5° from y, then the position of x would be:
- y's position: (0.5, -0.9)
- Vector from y to x: (-0.9, -0.5)
- x's position: (0.5, -0.9) + (-0.9, -0.5) = (-0.4, -1.4)
- Angle between positive x-axis and vector from z to x: arctan((-1.4)/(-0.4)) = arctan(3.5) ≈ 74.1° and the angle in compass directions is 180° + 74.1° = 254.1°, which is in the West region.

And if y is at an angle of 202.5° from z, and x is at an angle of 202.5° from y, then the position of x would be:
- y's position: (-0.5, -0.9)
- Vector from y to x: (-0.5, -0.9)
- x's position: (-0.5, -0.9) + (-0.5, -0.9) = (-1.0, -1.8)
- Angle between positive x-axis and vector from z to x: arctan((-1.8)/(-1.0)) = arctan(1.8) ≈ 61.0° and the angle in compass directions is 180° + 61.0° = 241.0°, which is in the Southwest region.

So far, it seems like the possible relations between x and z are Southwest and West.

Let me check if South is possible as well. For x to be South of z, it needs to be in the South region of z, which spans from 157.5° to 202.5°.

If y is at an angle of 202.5° from z, and x is at an angle of 247.5° from y, then the position of x would be:
- y's position: (-0.5, -0.9)
- Vector from y to x: (-0.9, -0.5)
- x's position: (-0.5, -0.9) + (-0.9, -0.5) = (-1.4, -1.4)
- Angle between positive x-axis and vector from z to x: arctan((-1.4)/(-1.4)) = arctan(1.0) = 45.0° and the angle in compass directions is 180° + 45.0° = 225.0°, which is in the Southwest region.

Hmm, I'm still not finding a case where x is South of z.

Let me try a different approach. I'll use Cartesian coordinates.

If z is at the origin (0, 0), then the South region spans from 157.5° to 202.5°. Using trigonometry, the boundary points at a unit distance from the origin would be (cos(157.5°), sin(157.5°)) and (cos(202.5°), sin(202.5°)), which are approximately (0.38, -0.92) and (-0.38, -0.92). 

The line y = -2.4x defines the boundary between the South and Southeast regions (at 157.5°). The line y = 2.4x - 0 defines the boundary between the South and Southwest regions (at 202.5°). So, the South region is defined by y < -0.92 and -2.4x < y < 2.4x.

Similarly, the Southwest region spans from 202.5° to 247.5°. The line y = 2.4x defines the boundary between the Southwest and South regions (at 202.5°). The line y = -0.4x defines the boundary between the Southwest and West regions (at 247.5°). So, the Southwest region is defined by x < -0.38 and 2.4x < y < -0.4x.

And the West region spans from 247.5° to 292.5°. The line y = -0.4x defines the boundary between the West and Southwest regions (at 247.5°). The line y = 0.4x defines the boundary between the West and Northwest regions (at 292.5°). So, the West region is defined by x < -0.92 and -0.4x < y < 0.4x.

Now, let's find where y and x can be.

If y is in the South region of z, it means -2.4x < y < 2.4x and y < -0.92.

If x is in the Southwest region of y, it means 2.4(x - y_x) < (y - y_y) < -0.4(x - y_x) and (x - y_x) < -0.38, where (y_x, y_y) is the position of y.

So, x would be at position (y_x + dx, y_y + dy), where 2.4dx < dy < -0.4dx and dx < -0.38.

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, I need to find where x can be in relation to z.

If x is in the South region of z, it means -2.4(y_x + dx) < (y_y + dy) < 2.4(y_x + dx) and (y_y + dy) < -0.92.

If x is in the Southwest region of z, it means 2.4(y_x + dx) < (y_y + dy) < -0.4(y_x + dx) and (y_x + dx) < -0.38.

If x is in the West region of z, it means -0.4(y_x + dx) < (y_y + dy) < 0.4(y_x + dx) and (y_x + dx) < -0.92.

Oh man, this is just getting increasingly complicated. I'll go back to the simpeler approach. I think I had the right answer before: based on the compass model, the possible relations between x and z are Southwest and West.

Actually, let me re-check South.

If y is at (0, -1) (directly South of z), and x is at (-0.7, -1.7) (directly Southwest of y), then x is at (-0.7, -2.7) in relation to z. The angle between the positive x-axis and the vector from z to x is arctan((-2.7)/(-0.7)) = arctan(3.9) ≈ 75.5° in standard trigonometric angle, which is 180° + 75.5° = 255.5° in compass direction. This is in the West region.

Ok, I think I've been making a mistake. It's easier to just check the regions directly.

The South region spans from 157.5° to 202.5° in compass direction. 
The Southwest region spans from 202.5° to 247.5° in compass direction.
The West region spans from 247.5° to 292.5° in compass direction.

Let's use complex numbers to make the calculation easier. I'll denote the vector from z to y as v_zy, and the vector from y to x as v_yx. The compass direction of a vector v = a + bi is arctan(b/a) (adjusted based on the quadrant).

Let's try a few cases:

Case 1: 
v_zy = e^{i * 180°} = -1 + 0i (directly South of z)
v_yx = e^{i * 225°} = -1/√2 - 1/√2 * i (directly Southwest of y)
v_zx = v_zy + v_yx = -1 + 0i + (-1/√2 - 1/√2 * i) = -1 - 1/√2 - 1/√2 * i
Compass direction of v_zx = arctan((-1/√2)/(-1 - 1/√2)) ≈ 17.0° from the negative x-axis, which is 197.0° in compass direction. This is in the South region.

Ok I was wrong before. South is a possible relation.

Let me just try to see if I can get West as well:
Case 2:
v_zy = e^{i * 157.5°} = -0.38 - 0.92i (South-southeast of z)
v_yx = e^{i * 247.5°} = -0.92 - 0.38i (Southwest-west of y)
v_zx = v_zy + v_yx = -0.38 - 0.92i + (-0.92 - 0.38i) = -1.3 - 1.3i
Compass direction of v_zx = arctan((-1.3)/(-1.3)) = 45.0° from the negative x-axis, which is 225.0° in compass direction. This is in the Southwest region.

Let me try another case to see if I can get West:
Case 3:
v_zy = e^{i * 202.5°} = -0.92 - 0.38i (South-southwest of z)
v_yx = e^{i * 202.5°} = -0.92 - 0.38i (South-southwest of y)
v_zx = v_zy + v_yx = -0.92 - 0.38i + (-0.92 - 0.38i) = -1.84 - 0.76i
Compass direction of v_zx = arctan((-0.76)/(-1.84)) ≈ 22.5° from the negative x-axis, which is 202.5° in compass direction. This is the boundary between South and Southwest.

Let me try another case to see if I can get West:
Case 4:
v_zy = e^{i * 157.5°} = -0.38 - 0.92i (South-southeast of z)
v_yx = e^{i * 202.5°} = -0.92 - 0.38i (South-southwest of y)
v_zx = v_zy + v_yx = -0.38 - 0.92i + (-0.92 - 0.38i) = -1.3 - 1.3i
Compass direction of v_zx = arctan((-1.3)/(-1.3)) = 45.0° from the negative x-axis, which is 225.0° in compass direction. This is in the Southwest region.

Actually, let me try one more case:
Case 5:
v_zy = e^{i * 202.5°} = -0.92 - 0.38i (South-southwest of z)
v_yx = e^{i * 247.5°} = -0.92 - 0.38i (Southwest-west of y)
v_zx = v_zy + v_yx = -0.92 - 0.38i + (-0.92 - 0.38i) = -1.84 - 0.76i
Compass direction of v_zx = arctan((-0.76)/(-1.84)) ≈ 22.5° from the negative x-axis, which is 202.5° in compass direction. This is the boundary between South and Southwest.

Hmm, I'm having a hard time getting West as a possible relation. Wait, let me re-check my math. For Case 2, I made a small mistake. The correct calculation is:

Case 2:
v_zy = e^{i * 157.5°} = -0.92 + 0.38i (South-southeast of z)
v_yx = e^{i * 247.5°} = -0.38 - 0.92i (Southwest-west of y)
v_zx = v_zy + v_yx = -0.92 + 0.38i + (-0.38 - 0.92i) = -1.3 - 0.54i
Compass direction of v_zx = arctan((-0.54)/(-1.3)) ≈ 22.5° from the negative x-axis, which is 202.5° in compass direction. This is the boundary between South and Southwest.

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake in the computation of the vectors. Let me re-check the compass direction to complex number conversion.

0° (East): 1 + 0i
90° (North): 0 + 1i
180° (West): -1 + 0i
270° (South): 0 - 1i

So, 157.5° is between East and South, which is 1/√2 - 1/√2 * i.

Wait, this is wrong. 157.5° is between North and West, which is -0.38 + 0.92i. But South-southeast of z would be between South and East, which is at 157.5° + 180° = 337.5°, and the vector is 0.38 - 0.92i.

I'll just restart the whole thing:

The South region spans from 247.5° to 292.5° in a standard trigonometric angle. 
The Southwest region spans from 292.5° to 337.5° in a standard trigonometric angle.
The West region spans from 337.5° to 22.5° in a standard trigonometric angle.

Wait that doesn't seem right. Correcting:

The South region is at 270°, which spans from 247.5° to 292.5° in a standard trigonometric angle. 
The Southwest region is at 315°, which spans from 292.5° to 337.5° in a standard trigonometric angle.
The West region is at 0°, which spans from 337.5° to 22.5° in a standard trigonometric angle.

Case 1: 
v_zy = e^{i * 270°} = 0 - 1i (directly South of z)
v_yx = e^{i * 315°} = 1/√2 - 1/√2 * i (directly Southwest of y)
v_zx = v_zy + v_yx = 0 - 1i + (1/√2 - 1/√2 * i) = 1/√2 - (1 + 1/√2) * i
Compass direction of v_zx = arctan((-(1 + 1/√2))/(1/√2)) ≈ -108.4° from the positive x-axis, which is about 251.6° in a standard trigonometric angle. This is in the South region.

Ugh, I keep getting confused by all the angle conventions. Let me simplify.

I'll specify the compass direction in terms of the standard cardinal directions: North (N), East (E), South (S), West (W), and their combinations. The standard trigonometric angle corresponds as follows:
- 0° (E): East
- 90° (N): North
- 180° (W): West
- 270° (S): South

And the boundaries of the regions are:
- South region: between ESE and WSW, or between 112.5° and 247.5° in the standard trigonometric angle.
- Southwest region: between WSW and WNW, or between 247.5° and 292.5° in the standard trigonometric angle.
- West region: between WNW and NNW, or between 292.5° and 337.5° in the standard trigonometric angle.

OK actually this is super complicated. Let me try to put it differently.

I think the original statement of the problem is as follows:
- Region y is South of region z.
- Region x is Southwest of region y.

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's denote the position of region i as (x_i, y_i) in a 2D coordinate system, where the positive y-axis is North, and the positive x-axis is East.

If region y is South of region z, we know that y_y < y_z (y is South of z).
If region x is Southwest of region y, we know that x_x < x_y (x is West of y) and y_x < y_y (x is South of y).

Combining these:
- y_x < y_y < y_z (x is South of z).
- x_x < x_y (x is West of y).

But we don't know the relation between x_y and x_z. Let's consider all possibilities:
- If x_y < x_z, then x_x < x_y < x_z, so x is West of z.
- If x_y = x_z, then x_x < x_y = x_z, so x is West of z.
- If x_y > x_z, then we have two possibilities:
  - If x_x < x_z, then x is West of z.
  - If x_x = x_z, then x is South of z.
  - If x_x > x_z, then x is Southeast of z.

Hold on, I think I've been interpreting the cardinal direction relations incorrectly. The relation "region y is South of region z" doesn't mean that y_y < y_z and x_y = x_z. It means that y is in the South region of z, which is a cone in the compass direction model.

Actually, after thinking about it more, let me first try to understand the problem statement better. The problem says "Let Southwest and South be cardinal direction relations."

I think the problem is asking about the Cardinal Direction Relations, where the space is divided into 9 tiles.

Actually, I realize I've been mistaking the problem by ignoring the fact that South can be SE or SW or directly South. In compass directions, South spans the region from ESE to WSW, which is a cone. Similarly, Southwest spans the region from WSW to WNW, which is another cone.

Let's go back to the problem. We have:
- y is South of z, which means y is in the South cone of z.
- x is Southwest of y, which means x is in the Southwest cone of y.

Using compass directions, the South cone spans from 112.5° to 247.5°, and the Southwest cone spans from 202.5° to 247.5°.

If y is at the easternmost edge of the South cone of z (at 112.5°), and x is at the westernmost edge of the Southwest cone of y (at 247.5°), then the composite angle would be 112.5° + 247.5° - 180° = 180°, which is West.

If y is at the westernmost edge of the South cone of z (at 247.5°), and x is at the easternmost edge of the Southwest cone of y (at 202.5°), then the composite angle would be 247.5° + 202.5° - 180° = 270°, which is South.

And anywhere in between would be Southwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z are South, Southwest, and West.

Actually, I want to try a particular case for West to double-check.

Let's say z is at the origin (0, 0), y is at (-1, -1) (Southwest edge of the South cone of z), and x is at (-2, -1) (West edge of the Southwest cone of y).

The vector from z to x is (-2, -2). The angle of this vector in a standard trigonometric angle is arctan((-2)/(-2)) = 45° from the negative x-axis, which is 180° + 45° = 225° in compass direction. This is Southwest, not West.

Let me try a different case:

Let's say z is at the origin (0, 0), y is at (1, -1) (Southeast edge of the South cone of z), and x is at (0, -2) (South edge of the Southwest cone of y).

The vector from z to x is (1, -3). The angle of this vector in a standard trigonometric angle is arctan((-3)/(1)) = -71.57° from the positive x-axis, which is 360° - 71.57° = 288.43° in compass direction. This is still in the Southwest region, not West.

Actually, I think I was wrong earlier. Let me re-check if West is a possible relation.

For y to be in the South cone of z, the compass direction of the vector from z to y is between 112.5° and 247.5°. For x to be in the Southwest cone of y, the compass direction of the vector from y to x is between 202.5° and 247.5°.

If y is at the easternmost edge of the South cone of z (at 112.5°), and x is at the westernmost edge of the Southwest cone of y (at 247.5°), then the positions (using unit vectors) would be:
- y's position: (cos(112.5°), sin(112.5°)) = (-0.38, -0.92)
- Vector from y to x: (cos(247.5°), sin(247.5°)) = (-0.38, -0.92)
- x's position: (-0.38, -0.92) + (-0.38, -0.92) = (-0.76, -1.84)
- Compass direction of the vector from z to x: arctan((-1.84)/(-0.76)) = 67.5° from the negative x-axis, which is 180° + 67.5° = 247.5° in compass direction. This is at the boundary between the South and Southwest regions.

So, it seems like West is not a possible relation, only South and Southwest are.

Actually, let me just try the limiting cases.

Case 1: Checking if West is possible:
If y is at the easternmost edge of the South cone of z (at 112.5°), and x is at the westernmost edge of the Southwest cone of y (at 247.5°), then the positions would be:
- y's position: (cos(112.5°), sin(112.5°)) = (-0.38, -0.92)
- Vector from y to x: (cos(247.5°), sin(247.5°)) = (-0.38, -0.92)
- x's position: (-0.38, -0.92) + (-0.38, -0.92) = (-0.76, -1.84)
- Compass direction of the vector from z to x: arctan((-1.84)/(-0.76)) ≈ 67.5° from the negative x-axis, which is 180° + 67.5° ≈ 247.5° in compass direction. This is at the boundary between the South and Southwest regions.

Case 2: Checking if South is possible:
If y is at the westernmost edge of the South cone of z (at 247.5°), and x is at the easternmost edge of the Southwest cone of y (at 202.5°), then the positions would be:
- y's position: (cos(247.5°), sin(247.5°)) = (-0.38, -0.92)
- Vector from y to x: (cos(202.5°), sin(202.5°)) = (-0.92, -0.38)
- x's position: (-0.38, -0.92) + (-0.92, -0.38) = (-1.3, -1.3)
- Compass direction of the vector from z to x: arctan((-1.3)/(-1.3)) = 45° from the negative x-axis, which is 180° + 45° = 225° in compass direction. This is in the Southwest region.

Case 3: Another check for South:
If y is directly South of z (at 180°), and x is directly Southwest of y (at 225°), then the positions would be:
- y's position: (cos(180°), sin(180°)) = (-1, 0)
- Vector from y to x: (cos(225°), sin(225°)) = (-1/√2, -1/√2)
- x's position: (-1, 0) + (-1/√2, -1/√2) = (-1 - 1/√2, -1/√2)
- Compass direction of the vector from z to x: arctan((-1/√2)/(-1 - 1/√2)) ≈ 26.57° from the negative x-axis, which is 180° + 26.57° ≈ 206.57° in compass direction. This is in the South region.

So, the possible relations between x and z are South and Southwest, but not West.

Ok I'm gonna go with South and Southwest as the possible relations.

Wait, a double check. I think I had a bug in my code. For Case 2, correcting the calculation:

Angle of 247.5° corresponds to compass direction WSW, which is (-0.92, -0.38) in terms of unit vector, not (-0.38, -0.92).
Angle of 202.5° corresponds to compass direction SSW, which is (-0.38, -0.92) in terms of unit vector, not (-0.92, -0.38).

So, the corrected calculation for Case 2 is:
- y's position: (cos(247.5°), sin(247.5°)) = (-0.92, -0.38)
- Vector from y to x: (cos(202.5°), sin(202.5°)) = (-0.38, -0.92)
- x's position: (-0.92, -0.38) + (-0.38, -0.92) = (-1.3, -1.3)
- Compass direction of the vector from z to x: arctan((-1.3)/(-1.3)) = 45° from the negative x-axis, which is 180° + 45° = 225° in compass direction. This is in the Southwest region.

Actually, I think the problem is in the angle-to-vector conversion. Let me correct the conversion:

0° (East): (1, 0)
90° (North): (0, 1)
180° (West): (-1, 0)
270° (South): (0, -1)

So:
112.5° (ESE): (cos(112.5°), sin(112.5°)) = (-0.38, 0.92)
202.5° (SSW): (cos(202.5°), sin(202.5°)) = (-0.38, -0.92)
247.5° (WSW): (cos(247.5°), sin(247.5°)) = (-0.92, -0.38)

Nope, that's wrong. 

Wait, let me be super explicit about the angles. The angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (East). So:
0° (East): (1, 0)
90° (North): (0, 1)
180° (West): (-1, 0)
270° (South): (0, -1)

And the regions are defined as:
- South region: from 247.5° to 292.5°
- Southwest region: from 202.5° to 247.5°
- West region: from 157.5° to 202.5°

OK, revisiting the limiting cases:

Case 1: Checking if West is possible:
If y is at the boundary between the South and Southwest regions of z (at 247.5°), and x is at the boundary between the Southwest and West regions of y (at 202.5°), then the positions would be:
- y's position: (cos(247.5°), sin(247.5°)) = (-0.92, -0.38)
- Vector from y to x: (cos(202.5°), sin(202.5°)) = (-0.92, -0.38)
- x's position: (-0.92, -0.38) + (-0.92, -0.38) = (-1.84, -0.76)
- Compass direction of the vector from z to x: arctan((-0.76)/(-1.84)) = 22.5° from the negative x-axis, which is 180° + 22.5° = 202.5° in compass direction. This is at the boundary between the West and Southwest regions.

Case 2: Checking if South is possible:
If y is at the boundary between the South and Southeast regions of z (at 292.5°), and x is at the boundary between the Southwest and South regions of y (at 247.5°), then the positions would be:
- y's position: (cos(292.5°), sin(292.5°)) = (-0.38, -0.92)
- Vector from y to x: (cos(247.5°), sin(247.5°)) = (-0.92, -0.38)
- x's position: (-0.38, -0.92) + (-0.92, -0.38) = (-1.3, -1.3)
- Compass direction of the vector from z to x: arctan((-1.3)/(-1
