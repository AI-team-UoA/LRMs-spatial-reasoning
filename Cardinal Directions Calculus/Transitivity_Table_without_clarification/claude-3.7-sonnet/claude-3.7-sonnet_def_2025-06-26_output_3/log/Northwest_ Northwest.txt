PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

We need to find the possible relations between x and z given that:
1. x is Northwest of y
2. y is Northwest of z

Let's think about cardinal directions. 
- Northwest means that a region is both north and west of another region.
- North means a region is directly above another region.
- West means a region is directly to the left of another region.
- Other directions include Northeast (north and east), Southeast (south and east), Southwest (south and west).

Let's analyze the situation:
- If x is Northwest of y, then x is north of y and x is west of y.
- If y is Northwest of z, then y is north of z and y is west of z.

So, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?
- x is Northwest of y, which is Northwest of z.
- This means x is north of y, which is north of z. So x is definitely north of z.
- Also, x is west of y, which is west of z. So x is definitely west of z.

If x is both north of z and west of z, then x is Northwest of z.

Actually, let me be more careful. Cardinal directions describe the relative position of one region with respect to another. When we say "x is Northwest of y", we're saying that x lies in the northwestern direction from y. This doesn't necessarily mean that x and y share a boundary; x could be far away from y but still in the northwestern direction.

Let's try to visualize this on a coordinate system. If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then y would be somewhere in the Northwest quadrant, so it has positive y-coordinate (it's north) and negative x-coordinate (it's west). For example, y could be at (-1, 1).

Now, x is Northwest of y. If y is at (-1, 1), then x would be somewhere in the Northwest quadrant relative to y. For example, x could be at (-2, 2).

So, in our example, we have:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (-1, 1)
- x at (-2, 2)

Now, what's the relationship between x and z? x is at (-2, 2) and z is at (0, 0). This means x is both west of z (it has a smaller x-coordinate) and north of z (it has a larger y-coordinate). So, x is Northwest of z.

But wait, I think I'm missing something. Cardinal direction relations can be more complex when dealing with regions instead of points, because regions have extent. For instance, if x is a large region, it could overlap with multiple directions relative to z.

Actually, let me go back to the basics. The cardinal direction relations (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) partition the plane into 8 regions. Given a reference region z, any other region can be in one of these 8 directions relative to z, or it could overlap with z.

If x is Northwest of y and y is Northwest of z, then x is in the Northwest quadrant relative to y, and y is in the Northwest quadrant relative to z. This doesn't uniquely determine the position of x relative to z, but it constrains it.

Let's approach this differently. We'll use the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) model for cardinal direction relations. In this model, we extend the edges of the MBR of the reference region to divide the plane into 9 tiles: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the Bounding Box itself.

If y is Northwest of z, then y lies entirely in the Northwest tile of z. Similarly, if x is Northwest of y, then x lies entirely in the Northwest tile of y.

Hm, actually, I think I'm still missing the point here. Let me approach it even more differently.

When we say "region x is Northwest of region y", we're saying that every point in x is northwest of every point in y. That is, if we draw a line from any point in y to any point in x, that line will always go in the northwest direction.

Similarly, if y is Northwest of z, then every point in y is northwest of every point in z.

Now, if every point in x is northwest of every point in y, and every point in y is northwest of every point in z, then every point in x is "more northwest" of every point in z, if that makes sense. Another way to put it is, if we draw a line from any point in z to any point in x, that line will always go in the northwest direction. So, x is Northwest of z.

Actually, I'm still not confident in my answer. Let me think about it differently.

Let's use a coordinate system and consider the case where all regions are points, for simplicity:
- If z is at (0, 0), and y is Northwest of z, then y could be at (-1, 1).
- If x is Northwest of y, then x could be at (-2, 2).

Clearly, x is also Northwest of z in this case. But that's a specific example.

More generally, if y is Northwest of z, then y is in the upper-left quadrant relative to z. And if x is Northwest of y, then x is in the upper-left quadrant relative to y.

Now, the question is: if y is in the upper-left quadrant relative to z, and x is in the upper-left quadrant relative to y, then where is x relative to z?

Let's represent this algebraically. If z is at (0, 0), then y is at (y_x, y_y) where y_x < 0 (west) and y_y > 0 (north). And x is at (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x (more west) and x_y > y_y (more north).

Combining these, we get x_x < y_x < 0 and x_y > y_y > 0. So, x is also in the upper-left quadrant relative to z, which means x is Northwest of z.

I think the answer is:
x is Northwest of z.

But actually, let me be even more careful. It's possible that regions could have more complex shapes, and the cardinal direction might not be so clear-cut. For instance, a region could span multiple quadrants.

Actually, let me reinterpret the problem in terms of the 9-intersection model, which is commonly used for spatial reasoning.

In the 9-intersection model, the space is divided into 9 regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the Bounding Box (or Same) for the reference region itself.

Given that y is Northwest of z, y lies entirely in the Northwest region of z. And given that x is Northwest of y, x lies entirely in the Northwest region of y.

Now, the Northwest region of y is itself northwest of the Northwest region of z. This means that x, which is entirely within the Northwest region of y, is also northwest of z. Therefore, x is Northwest of z.

I believe the answer is that x is Northwest of z.

Let me check this in a different way by considering a more concrete example. Imagine we're looking at a map:
- z is at the origin (0, 0).
- y is Northwest of z, so it's in the upper-left quadrant relative to z. Let's say y is at (-3, 4).
- x is Northwest of y, so it's in the upper-left quadrant relative to y. Let's say x is at (-7, 8).

Relative to z, x is at (-7, 8). This is in the upper-left quadrant relative to z, which means x is Northwest of z.

But actually, let me consider if there are any other possible directions. What if y is "far" to the west compared to how north it is, and x is "far" to the north compared to how west it is?

For example:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is Northwest of z, but it's primarily west and only slightly north. Let's say y is at (-10, 1).
- x is Northwest of y, but it's primarily north and only slightly west. Let's say x is at (-11, 10).

Relative to z, x is at (-11, 10). This is still in the upper-left quadrant relative to z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Let's try another example:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is Northwest of z, but it's primarily north and only slightly west. Let's say y is at (-1, 10).
- x is Northwest of y, but it's primarily west and only slightly north. Let's say x is at (-10, 11).

Relative to z, x is at (-10, 11). This is still in the upper-left quadrant relative to z, which means x is Northwest of z.

It seems like, no matter how we position the regions (as long as y is Northwest of z and x is Northwest of y), x will always be Northwest of z. The reason is that "Northwest" means both north and west, and if x is both north and west of y, and y is both north and west of z, then x is both north and west of z.

To be exhaustive, let's consider the case where the regions are not just points but have extent. But even in this case, if every point in y is northwest of every point in z, and every point in x is northwest of every point in y, then every point in x is northwest of every point in z. So, x is Northwest of z.

Ok, I'm confident that the answer is: x is Northwest of z.

Actually, on second thought, the question is asking for the *possible* relations between region x and region z, not the definite relation. So, I think I should consider if there are any other possible relations.

Actually, I think I've been approaching this wrong. I've been treating "Northwest" as meaning "strictly northwest", but in the context of cardinal direction relations, it might refer to a specific tile in the 9-intersection model.

Alright, let me use the 9-intersection model explicitly. In this model, the space is divided into 9 tiles based on the reference region: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the Bounding Box (or Same) for the reference region itself.

If y is Northwest of z, then y lies entirely in the Northwest tile of z. If x is Northwest of y, then x lies entirely in the Northwest tile of y.

Given the position of y relative to z, we can establish a new 9-intersection grid centered at y. The Northwest tile of y is entirely contained within the Northwest tile of z. Therefore, x, which is entirely within the Northwest tile of y, is also entirely within the Northwest tile of z. This means x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually, I'm just double-checking, I think I'm overlooking something, so let's do this yet again.

The cardinal direction relations are typically defined using the 9-intersection model, which divides the space into 9 tiles relative to a reference region: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the Bounding Box (or Same) for the reference region itself.

When we say "y is Northwest of z", we mean that y lies entirely in the Northwest tile of z. Similarly, "x is Northwest of y" means that x lies entirely in the Northwest tile of y.

Now, the question is: given these two statements, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

The Northwest tile of y is a region that is both north and west of y. Similarly, the Northwest tile of z is a region that is both north and west of z.

Given that y is Northwest of z, y is both north and west of z. And given that x is Northwest of y, x is both north and west of y.

If x is north of y and y is north of z, then x is north of z. Similarly, if x is west of y and y is west of z, then x is west of z.

So, x is both north and west of z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

OK I'm convinced. The answer is simply:
Northwest.

Oh wait, I think I forgot to consider something. When I say "Northwest" I'm implicitly using a direction calculus with 8 directions (North, Northeast, East, etc.). But there are variations of direction calculi with different granularities. For example, some might have only 4 directions (North, East, South, West), and others might have more. 

But even if we're using a different granularity, if x is Northwest of y and y is Northwest of z, then x should still be Northwest of z because "Northwest" implies both "north" and "west".

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually, hang on. Let me be very clear about the definitions of cardinal direction relations.

In the context of qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations are typically defined using the 9-intersection model, which divides the space into 9 tiles relative to a reference region: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the reference region itself (Often called "Bounding Box" or "Same").

Given these definitions, if we say "y is Northwest of z", we mean that y lies entirely in the Northwest tile of z. Similarly, "x is Northwest of y" means that x lies entirely in the Northwest tile of y.

Now, let's think about the tiling. If z is our reference region, we extend the edges of its minimum bounding rectangle to divide the plane into 9 tiles. The Northwest tile is the area that is both north and west of z's bounding box.

Similarly, if y is our reference region, the Northwest tile is the area that is both north and west of y's bounding box.

Given that y is entirely in the Northwest tile of z, and x is entirely in the Northwest tile of y, we need to determine where x lies relative to z.

Let me use a concrete example to visualize this:
- z is a region centered at (0, 0) with bounds from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
- The Northwest tile of z is the area where both x-coordinate < -1 and y-coordinate > 1.
- y is a region entirely in this Northwest tile, let's say with bounds from (-3, 2) to (-2, 3).
- The Northwest tile of y is the area where both x-coordinate < -3 and y-coordinate > 3.
- x is a region entirely in this Northwest tile, let's say with bounds from (-5, 4) to (-4, 5).

Now, relative to z, x has bounds from (-5, 4) to (-4, 5). This is in the Northwest tile of z, which is the area where both x-coordinate < -1 and y-coordinate > 1.

So, in this concrete example, x is Northwest of z. And I believe this holds true for any such configuration where y is Northwest of z and x is Northwest of y.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually I'm pretty sure of my answer. The possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

But wait, before I commit, let me make sure that my understanding of cardinal directions is not confused.

In the cardinal direction calculus, we have the following 8 direction relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

When we say "y is Northwest of z", we mean that y is both north and west of z. Similarly, "x is Northwest of y" means that x is both north and west of y.

If y is north of z and x is north of y, then x is north of z. Similarly, if y is west of z and x is west of y, then x is west of z.

So, x is both north and west of z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually, I realize that if I use the minimal bounding rectangle approach, the calculus allows for many configurations where the tile occupied by y might not influence the tile occupied by x. So let me go back to thinking of these relations in terms of the relative position.

Given that y is Northwest of z, y is both north and west of z. And given that x is Northwest of y, x is both north and west of y.

If x is north of y and y is north of z, then x is north of z.
If x is west of y and y is west of z, then x is west of z.

So, x is both north and west of z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Alright, let's make a final check using the standard 9-intersection model for cardinal direction relations:

1. z is our reference region. We extend the edges of its minimum bounding rectangle to divide the plane into 9 tiles.
2. y is in the Northwest tile of z, meaning y is both north and west of z.
3. x is in the Northwest tile of y, meaning x is both north and west of y.
4. Since y is north of z and x is north of y, x is north of z.
5. Since y is west of z and x is west of y, x is west of z.
6. Therefore, x is both north and west of z, which places it in the Northwest tile of z.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually there's a mismatch in what I've been saying. I've been using the 9-intersection model (where the space is divided into 9 tiles: the 8 cardinal directions plus the reference region itself), but then I've been talking about directions in a more general sense.

Let me be more explicit: the 9-intersection model divides the space based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the reference region. If z is our reference region, its MBR divides the space into 9 tiles. If a region y is entirely within the Northwest tile of z, we say "y is Northwest of z".

Similarly, the MBR of y divides the space into 9 tiles. If a region x is entirely within the Northwest tile of y, we say "x is Northwest of y".

Given that y is Northwest of z, and x is Northwest of y, where is x relative to z?

The Northwest tile of z is the area that is both north and west of z's MBR. Since y is entirely in this tile, y is both north and west of z.

Similarly, the Northwest tile of y is the area that is both north and west of y's MBR. Since x is entirely in this tile, x is both north and west of y.

If x is north of y and y is north of z, then x is north of z. And if x is west of y and y is west of z, then x is west of z.

So, x is both north and west of z, which places it in the Northwest tile of z. This means "x is Northwest of z".

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually I'm getting confused again. Let me refresh my understanding of cardinal directions using the MBR approach.

In the MBR approach, we have the 9-intersection model, which divides the space into 9 tiles based on the MBR of the reference region. These tiles are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the reference region itself (which is often referred to as the "Bounding Box" or "Same").

When we say "y is Northwest of z", it means y lies entirely in the Northwest tile of z. Similarly, "x is Northwest of y" means x lies entirely in the Northwest tile of y.

Now, the Northwest tile of z is the area that is both north and west of z's MBR. And the Northwest tile of y is the area that is both north and west of y's MBR.

Given that y is entirely in the Northwest tile of z, y is both north and west of z's MBR. And given that x is entirely in the Northwest tile of y, x is both north and west of y's MBR.

If y is north of z's MBR and x is north of y's MBR, then x is north of z's MBR. Similarly, if y is west of z's MBR and x is west of y's MBR, then x is west of z's MBR.

So, x is both north and west of z's MBR, which places it in the Northwest tile of z. This means "x is Northwest of z".

Wait, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this by jumping between different formalisms. Let me use the simplest approach. 

If x is Northwest of y, and y is Northwest of z, then x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

I think all of my convoluted reasoning is still arriving at the same conclusion. So the answer is: Northwest.

Actually, let's just try another concrete example. I think this is the most reliable approach:

- z is a region centered at (0, 0) with an MBR from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
- The Northwest tile of z is the area where both x-coordinate < -1 and y-coordinate > 1.
- y is a region entirely in this Northwest tile, with an MBR from (-3, 2) to (-2, 3).
- The Northwest tile of y is the area where both x-coordinate < -3 and y-coordinate > 3.
- x is a region entirely in this Northwest tile, with an MBR from (-5, 4) to (-4, 5).

Relative to z, x has an MBR from (-5, 4) to (-4, 5). This is in the Northwest tile of z, which is the area where both x-coordinate < -1 and y-coordinate > 1.

So, x is Northwest of z.

Let's try another example:
- z is a region centered at (0, 0) with an MBR from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
- y is Northwest of z, with an MBR from (-4, 2) to (-2, 4).
- x is Northwest of y, with an MBR from (-7, 5) to (-5, 7).

Relative to z, x has an MBR from (-7, 5) to (-5, 7). This is in the Northwest tile of z, which is the area where both x-coordinate < -1 and y-coordinate > 1.

So, x is also Northwest of z in this example.

I'm going to assert that the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually, let me remember that the question asks for "possible" relations. This might indicate that there could be multiple relations, not just one. But in my analysis, I've shown that if y is Northwest of z and x is Northwest of y, then x is Northwest of z. There doesn't seem to be any other possible relation.

But let me think more carefully. Are there any edge cases or scenarios where x could have a different relation to z, given the constraints?

Actually I'm wondering whether the "possible" in the question refers to the fact that we're dealing with composition, i.e. with uncertainty. For example, if we compose "x is North of y" and "y is East of z", the possible relations between x and z could include North, Northeast, or East (and perhaps others).

But in the case of "x is Northwest of y" and "y is Northwest of z", I've shown that the relation between x and z is uniquely determined to be Northwest.

So the list of possible relations between region x and region z only includes: Northwest.

Actually, perhaps the "possible" is allowing for the possibility of there being uncertainty in the calculus. Let's say we're using the model where direction is determined by the center point of a region. Then "A Northwest of B" means the center of A is in the Northwest quadrant relative to the center of B.

In this model, if the center of y is Northwest of the center of z, and the center of x is Northwest of the center of y, then the center of x is Northwest of the center of z. This is because the Northwest direction is preserved under composition.

But what if our model is based on the entire region, not just the center? In the MBR approach, "A Northwest of B" means A is entirely within the Northwest tile of B.

In this model, if y is entirely in the Northwest tile of z, and x is entirely in the Northwest tile of y, then x is also entirely in the Northwest tile of z, as I've shown with concrete examples.

So, regardless of the model we use, the relation between x and z is uniquely determined to be Northwest.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually, I wonder if there's a spatial calculus where we can reach a different conclusion. Let's say we're using a direction model where the space is divided into more than just the 8 cardinal directions. Maybe there's a calculus with, say, 16 directions, where "Northwest" could be further subdivided.

Even in such a calculus, if y is in the Northwestern direction from z, and x is in the Northwestern direction from y, then x would still be in the Northwestern direction from z.

Actually, I think I'm just overthinking this. The question is about cardinal direction relations, which typically refer to the 8 main compass directions. Given that y is Northwest of z and x is Northwest of y, the relation between x and z is uniquely determined to be Northwest.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually I think the answer is just Northwest. Let me think of one more example in 2D to be sure.

Imagine a 2D space where:
- z is a region centered at (0, 0).
- y is a region centered at (-10, 10), which is Northwest of z.
- x is a region centered at (-20, 20), which is Northwest of y.

Clearly, x is also Northwest of z.

The key here is that the Northwest direction is consistent: it's always pointing towards the upper-left quadrant. If we move from z to y in the Northwest direction, and then from y to x in the Northwest direction, we're effectively moving from z to x in the Northwest direction.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Ok actually I think the cardinal direction calculus I'm thinking of is sometimes called the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) where we have the usual 8 directions plus Bounding Box (which as I mentioned is when one region is inside the minimal bounding rectangle of the other).

In CDC, if y is Northwest of z, and x is Northwest of y, then x is Northwest of z. So the possible relation between x and z is Northwest.

I think we're quite confident in this answer, and I was right to discount other options. The only "possible" relation is "Northwest".

Actually, hold on, I think I'm neglecting alternative spatial calculi like the Cardinal Direction Interval (CDI) calculus. In CDI, a direction relation is not a single symbol like "Northwest," but rather an interval or set of basic directions. For example, a relation might be [North, Northwest, West], indicating that the region spans these directions.

But even in CDI, if y is northwest of z (meaning y is in the [Northwest] direction from z), and x is northwest of y, then x is northwest of z.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z, regardless of the calculus we use, is: Northwest.

Actually, there's another calculus called "Rectangle Algebra" where directions are described using a pair of interval relations. But even in this calculus, the composition of "Northwest" with "Northwest" gives "Northwest."

Ok, I'm quite confident now. The possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

One more point: what we're trying to compute here is the spatial composition of two relations: we compose (x, Northwest, y) with (y, Northwest, z) to get (x, ?, z). And I think we've shown that the composition yields (x, Northwest, z).

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Ok, let's reason systematically about this. Let's say in the 2D space:
- z is at the origin (0, 0).
- y is at (-a, b) for some positive a and b, which makes it Northwest of z.
- x is at (-a-c, b+d) for some positive c and d, which makes it Northwest of y.

Relative to z, x is at (-a-c, b+d). Since a, b, c, and d are all positive, x is in the Northwest quadrant relative to z. This means x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Alright, I think I've approached this problem from many angles, and the answer is consistent: if y is Northwest of z and x is Northwest of y, then x is Northwest of z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: Northwest.

Actually, I realize that the cardinal direction relations used in the problem might be part of a specific calculus or algebra that I'm not considering. But the general principle should hold: if we're in a 2D space and using cardinal directions, then moving Northwest and then Northwest should result in a Northwest movement.

Actually, let's try a counter-example. Let's say we have the following setup:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (-1, 10), which is Northwest of z (it's both north and west of z).
- x is at (-2, 11), which is Northwest of y (it's both north and west of y).

Relative to z, x is at (-2, 11). This is in the Northwest quadrant relative to z (it's both north and west of z). So, x is Northwest of z.

Ok, I think this is the answer: Northwest.

The answer to this question is just:
Northwest.

Alright, to restate: The possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

ANSWER:

The relation between region x and region z is:

Northwest
