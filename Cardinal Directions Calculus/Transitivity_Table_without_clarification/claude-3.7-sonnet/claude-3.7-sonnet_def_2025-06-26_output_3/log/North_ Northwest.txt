PROMPT: Let North and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's visualize the relative positions. We have:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

Let's establish a relative coordinate system.

Suppose region z is at position (0, 0).

If region y is Northwest of z, that means y is at some position like (−a, a), where a > 0.

Now, region x is North of y. That means x is at some position like (−a, a + b), where b > 0.

So, compared to z, region x is at (−a, a + b).

Now, let's see what cardinal direction that would represent for region x relative to region z:
- If it's exactly at (−a, a + b), it would be in the Northwest direction.
- If it's at (0, a + b), it would be North.
- If it's at (a, a + b), it would be Northeast.

Actually, let me redo this more carefully.

Let's introduce a clearer notation for the positions of the regions:
- Region z is at position $(x_z, y_z)$.
- Region y is at position $(x_y, y_y)$.
- Region x is at position $(x_x, y_x)$.

Given:
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means $x_y < x_z$ and $y_y > y_z$.
- Region x is North of region y. This means $x_x = x_y$ and $y_x > y_y$.

From these, we can deduce:
- $x_x = x_y < x_z$, which means $x_x < x_z$.
- $y_x > y_y > y_z$, which means $y_x > y_z$.

So, region x is to the West and North of region z. This puts x in the Northwest cardinal direction from z.

Hmm, but I don't think I did this correctly. Let me reconsider.

When we say a region is in a certain cardinal direction relative to another, we're typically referring to a broad swath of the plane, not just a specific line. For instance, if region A is North of region B, it means A is somewhere in the entire half-plane above B.

Let me revise my approach.

If region z is at the origin (0, 0), then the cardinal directions from z would be:
- North: (0, y) where y > 0.
- Northeast: (x, y) where x > 0 and y > 0.
- East: (x, 0) where x > 0.
- Southeast: (x, y) where x > 0 and y < 0.
- South: (0, y) where y < 0.
- Southwest: (x, y) where x < 0 and y < 0.
- West: (x, 0) where x < 0.
- Northwest: (x, y) where x < 0 and y > 0.

Given that region y is Northwest of region z, y is in the quadrant where x < 0 and y > 0 relative to z.

Now, region x is North of region y. This means x is in the half-plane above y, i.e., it has a higher y-coordinate than y. But the x-coordinate of x can be anything relative to y.

Hmm but let me redo this again. I don't think cardinal directions are ambiguous, so let me use the more precise definitions. In cardinal directions, we classify a position as follows:

- North: The region directly above.
- Northeast: The region above and to the right.
- East: The region directly to the right.
- Southeast: The region below and to the right.
- South: The region directly below.
- Southwest: The region below and to the left.
- West: The region directly to the left.
- Northwest: The region above and to the left.

Given these definitions, if region y is Northwest of region z, then y is above and to the left of z.

And if region x is North of region y, then x is directly above y.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to see where x lies relative to z. We know that x is above y, and y is above z, so x is definitely above z.

In terms of the horizontal (x-coordinate) position, we know that y is to the left of z. If x is directly above y, then x is also to the left of z.

So, region x is above and to the left of region z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Wait, I think I messed up again on the cardinal directions. Let me try something different.

Let's establish a coordinate system and define cardinal directions relative to a given point.

If we have a point P, then the cardinal directions from P are:
- North: Any point with the same x-coordinate as P but a larger y-coordinate.
- Northeast: Any point with a larger x-coordinate and a larger y-coordinate than P.
- East: Any point with a larger x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate as P.
- Southeast: Any point with a larger x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than P.
- South: Any point with the same x-coordinate as P but a smaller y-coordinate.
- Southwest: Any point with a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than P.
- West: Any point with a smaller x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate as P.
- Northwest: Any point with a smaller x-coordinate and a larger y-coordinate than P.

Now, let's consider the problem:
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means y has a smaller x-coordinate and a larger y-coordinate compared to z.
- Region x is North of region y. This means x has the same x-coordinate as y but a larger y-coordinate.

From these, we can deduce:
- x has the same x-coordinate as y, which is smaller than z's x-coordinate. So, x is to the left of z.
- x has a larger y-coordinate than y, which in turn has a larger y-coordinate than z. So, x is above z.

Given that x is to the left of z and above z, x is in the Northwest direction from z.

So, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Actually, wait a minute. I keep making a mistake in interpreting what it means for a region to be in a cardinal direction from another. Let me try a slightly different tack. 

Let's say we have regions as rectangular bounding boxes. Let me define cardinal directions as follows. If region A is North of region B, then the southernmost point of A is above the northernmost point of B. Similarly for the other directions.

Let's say the bounds of region z are defined by z_min_x, z_max_x, z_min_y, and z_max_y. Similarly for regions x and y.

Given:
- Region y is Northwest of region z: This means y_max_x < z_min_x and y_min_y > z_max_y.
- Region x is North of region y: This means x_min_y > y_max_y.

From these, we know:
- x_min_y > y_max_y > z_max_y, so x is North of z.
- We don't have any constraints on x_min_x or x_max_x relative to z, so x could be East, West, or directly above z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Hm, I think I messed up the definition of Northwest. Let's revisit.

Cardinal directions:
- North: The center of region A is directly above the center of region B.
- Northeast: The center of region A is above and to the right of the center of region B.
- East: The center of region A is directly to the right of the center of region B.
- Southeast: The center of region A is below and to the right of the center of region B.
- South: The center of region A is directly below the center of region B.
- Southwest: The center of region A is below and to the left of the center of region B.
- West: The center of region A is directly to the left of the center of region B.
- Northwest: The center of region A is above and to the left of the center of region B.

Hmm, I think I should be more precise about the cardinal directions, and the notions of "above," "below," "left," and "right" in this context.

Let's establish a 2D coordinate system and define the cardinal directions based on the relative position of the centers of the regions.

If the center of region A is at (xA, yA) and the center of region B is at (xB, yB), then:
- A is North of B if xA = xB and yA > yB.
- A is Northeast of B if xA > xB and yA > yB.
- A is East of B if xA > xB and yA = yB.
- A is Southeast of B if xA > xB and yA < yB.
- A is South of B if xA = xB and yA < yB.
- A is Southwest of B if xA < xB and yA < yB.
- A is West of B if xA < xB and yA = yB.
- A is Northwest of B if xA < xB and yA > yB.

Given:
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means xy < xz and yy > yz.
- Region x is North of region y. This means xx = xy and yx > yy.

From these, we can deduce:
- xx = xy < xz, which means xx < xz.
- yx > yy > yz, which means yx > yz.

So, region x is to the left of z (xx < xz) and above z (yx > yz). This places x in the Northwest direction from z.

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Actually, I think there's a logical error in my reasoning. The center-based definition might be too restrictive. For instance, it implies that if region A is North of region B, then A can only be directly above B, which might not capture the full range of spatial relationships.

Let's reconsider and stick with a more intuitive understanding. I can consider North to mean generally above, Northwest to mean generally above and to the left, etc.

Given:
- Region y is Northwest of region z: This means y is generally above and to the left of z.
- Region x is North of region y: This means x is generally above y.

From these, we can infer that x is above y, which is above and to the left of z. This means x is also above z.

However, the lateral position of x relative to z depends on how far to the left y is from z and how far to the left or right x is from y.

If x is directly above y, then x is also to the left of z, which would make x Northwest of z.
If x is above and to the right of y, but still to the left of z, then x is Northwest of z.
If x is above and to the right of y, and also to the right of z, then x is Northeast of z.
If x is above y and directly aligned with z, then x is North of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Hmm, let me reapproach this problem more carefully and systematically.

Let's define cardinal directions more precisely. We'll use a qualitative spatial reasoning approach, where North, South, East, and West are primary directions, and Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest are combinations of these primary directions.

If region A is North of region B, it means that every point in A is above some point in B, and there's no horizontal displacement (East or West) between A and B. Similarly for the other directions.

If region A is Northwest of region B, it means that every point in A is to the left of and above some point in B. Similarly for the other compound directions.

Given:
- Region y is Northwest of region z: Every point in y is to the left of and above some point in z.
- Region x is North of region y: Every point in x is above some point in y, and there's no horizontal displacement between x and y.

From these, we can deduce:
- Every point in x is above some point in y, which is above some point in z. Thus, every point in x is above some point in z.
- Every point in y is to the left of some point in z. Since there's no horizontal displacement between x and y, every point in x is to the left of some point in z.

Therefore, every point in x is above and to the left of some point in z, which means x is Northwest of z.

So, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

I realize I keep bouncing around in my definitions.

Let me establish the cardinal directions clearly. In a qualitative spatial reasoning context, cardinal directions are often defined based on the relative positions of the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of regions.

For simplicity, let's say:
- Region A is North of region B if the southern boundary of A is above or coincides with the northern boundary of B.
- Region A is Northeast of region B if the western boundary of A is to the east of or coincides with the eastern boundary of B, and the southern boundary of A is above or coincides with the northern boundary of B.
- ... and so on for the other directions.

Alright, let's redefined the cardinal directions as follows:

1. North: The southern boundary of region A is above the northern boundary of region B.
2. Northeast: The southwestern corner of region A is above and to the right of the northeastern corner of region B.
3. East: The western boundary of region A is to the right of the eastern boundary of region B.
4. Southeast: The northwestern corner of region A is below and to the right of the southeastern corner of region B.
5. South: The northern boundary of region A is below the southern boundary of region B.
6. Southwest: The northeastern corner of region A is below and to the left of the southwestern corner of region B.
7. West: The eastern boundary of region A is to the left of the western boundary of region B.
8. Northwest: The southeastern corner of region A is above and to the left of the northwestern corner of region B.

OK, actually, let me simplify again. Let's use a more standard definition in qualitative spatial reasoning.

Given two rectangular regions A and B, the cardinal direction from B to A is determined by dividing the space around B into 9 tiles (the 9-intersection model): the 8 cardinal directions plus a middle tile that corresponds to B itself. The direction from B to A is determined by which tile A falls into.

For example, if A falls into the tile that's directly above B, then A is North of B. If A falls into the tile that's above and to the right of B, then A is Northeast of B, and so on.

Now, given:
- Region y is Northwest of region z: y is in the tile that's above and to the left of z.
- Region x is North of region y: x is in the tile that's directly above y.

To determine the relation between x and z, I need to find out which tile of z that x falls into.

Actually I'm not sure that I'm describing the 9-intersection model correctly. Let me  redo this.

Let me define things a bit more rigorously:

1. Cardinal directions in a 2D plane can be defined based on the relative positions of regions.

2. Let's use the notation CDC(A, B) to denote the Cardinal Direction Calculus, which gives the direction of region A relative to region B.

3. Here are the possible relations in CDC:
   - N: A is North of B.
   - NE: A is Northeast of B.
   - E: A is East of B.
   - SE: A is Southeast of B.
   - S: A is South of B.
   - SW: A is Southwest of B.
   - W: A is West of B.
   - NW: A is Northwest of B.
   - EQ: A is the same as B.
   - O: A overlaps with B.

4. Given two regions A and B, the cardinal direction is determined by comparing their bounding boxes. The bounding box of a region is the smallest rectangle that encloses the region and has sides aligned with the cardinal directions.

5. Let MBR(A) denote the Minimum Bounding Rectangle of region A. We can represent MBR(A) as (A.min_x, A.min_y, A.max_x, A.max_y), where these are the coordinates of the corners of the bounding box.

6. CDC(A, B) can be determined by comparing the MBRs of A and B.

OK but I'm running into trouble using this framework because I keep getting confused about what the definitions actually are. Let me go back to basics and just use a logical, real-world understanding of cardinal directions.

In the problem:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

Intuitively, if y is Northwest of z, then y is both above z and to the left of z.
If x is North of y, then x is above y. However, the east-west relationship between x and y is not specified. x could be aligned with y, to the right of y, or to the left of y.

Given that y is to the left of z, and x's east-west relation to y is not fixed, x could be to the left of z, aligned with z, or to the right of z.

But we know for sure that x is above y, and y is above z, so x is definitely above z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is to the left of z)
- North (if x is aligned with z)
- Northeast (if x is to the right of z)

Let me see if I can reason through this in a different way, and perhaps more systematically.

I'll use a 2D coordinate system to represent the centers of the regions. Let's place the center of z at the origin (0, 0) for convenience.

Given:
- Region y is Northwest of region z: This means that the center of y is at (a, b) for some a < 0 and b > 0.
- Region x is North of region y: This means that the center of x is at (a, c) for some c > b (given that the x-coordinate remains the same).

From these, we can determine that the center of x is at (a, c) where a < 0 and c > b > 0.

Relative to z (which is at the origin), x is at (a, c) with a < 0 and c > 0. This places x in the Northwest quadrant of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

But I think I'm being too restrictive here. The cardinal direction "North" doesn't necessarily mean the regions are perfectly aligned in terms of longitude (or x-coordinate in our case). Similarly, "Northwest" doesn't have to mean exactly at a 45-degree angle.

Let me redefine the cardinal directions more intuitively. We'll say:

- A is North of B if the center of A is above the center of B, but not significantly to the left or right (meaning if the center of A is within a reasonable horizontal range of the center of B).
- A is Northeast of B if the center of A is significantly above and to the right of the center of B.
- ... and so on for the other directions.

I realize I've been going back and forth on the definitions. I think I need to simplify the direction and think more about logic.

Let's place the regions in a grid:
- Let (0, 0) be the center of z.
- If y is Northwest of z, then the center of y is in the Northwest quadrant from z. So, it's at (u, v) where u < 0 and v > 0.
- If x is North of y, then the center of x is in the North direction from y. This can be represented as (u, w) where w > v.

With respect to z, x is at (u, w) where u < 0 and w > v > 0. In terms of cardinal directions, this places x in the Northwest quadrant of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Hmm but I think there's still a problem. North doesn't have to mean the regions are perfectly aligned. 

Actually, I think I've been overthinking the problem. Let's step back and consider a broader definition of "North".

When we say region A is North of region B, we are typically referring to the general direction. It doesn't mean they are exactly aligned along a north-south axis. Similarly, when we say A is Northwest of B, it's a general direction, not an exact 45-degree angle.

In the problem:
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This gives a general direction of the northwesterly direction, meaning y is somewhere above and to the left of z.
- Region x is North of region y. This gives a general direction of the northerly direction, meaning x is somewhere above y.

Taking these together, we know that x is above y, which is above and to the left of z. So, x is above z for sure. In terms of east-west, x's position relative to z is not uniquely determined because the term "North" doesn't constrain the east-west positioning.

So, x could be in the Northwest, North, or Northeast direction from z.

But I think I'm still getting wrapped up in the vagueness of the cardinal directions. Let me try to reason with more precision.

If we're using the standard geographic cardinal directions, then:
- North (N): 0 degrees
- Northeast (NE): 45 degrees
- East (E): 90 degrees
- Southeast (SE): 135 degrees
- South (S): 180 degrees
- Southwest (SW): 225 degrees
- West (W): 270 degrees
- Northwest (NW): 315 degrees

Using these precise directions, if region y is at 315 degrees (NW) from region z, and region x is at 0 degrees (N) from region y, then region x is at approximately 337.5 degrees from region z, which is somewhere between North and Northwest, leaning more towards North.

But I don't think that's the right approach for this problem, because we're likely not dealing with such precise angles.

Let's instead try using a grid-based approach. Imagine dividing the space around a region into 9 tiles: one for each of the 8 cardinal directions and one for the region itself.

Given:
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means y is in the tile that's to the northwest of z.
- Region x is North of region y. This means x is in the tile that's to the north of y.

The problem is that when we place these tiles in relation to each other, it's not immediately clear which tile of z that x falls into, because the tiles aren't anchored in a global grid. They're defined relative to the regions they surround.

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating things. Let's simplify.

I'm reasoning about qualitative spatial relations, where the directions are not precise angles, but rather dividing the space around a region into sectors.

Using the standard 8 direction sectors:
- If y is Northwest of z, then y is in the sector that's approximately 315 degrees from z.
- If x is North of y, then x is in the sector that's approximately 0 degrees from y.

To determine the relation between x and z, I need to compound these directions. If I'm at y, and I look towards x, I'm looking North. If I'm at z and look towards y, I'm looking Northwest. So, if I'm at z and want to look at x, I'd be looking in a direction that's a bit North of Northwest.

OK actually I think I'm making things too complicated. Let me try a different approach using a reference system where 'North' is straight ahead of me, 'East' is to my right, 'West' is to my left, and 'South' is behind me.

So, if y is Northwest of z, I'm standing at z facing North, and y is ahead and to my left. If x is North of y, I'm standing at y facing North, and x is straight ahead of me.

Now, to determine where x is relative to z, I need to combine these two perspectives. From z, if I go Northwest to y, and then from y I go North to x, where do I end up relative to z?

Going Northwest from z, I move forward and to the left. From there, if I go North, I move forward but not left or right. So, from z, to get to x, I've moved forward twice and to the left once, which is in the Northwest direction.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Wait, I'm still not satisfied with my reasoning. Let me try a more systematic approach.

I'll use a 2D grid with z at the origin (0, 0). The cardinal directions in this grid can be defined as:
- North: (0, 1)
- Northeast: (1, 1)
- East: (1, 0)
- Southeast: (1, -1)
- South: (0, -1)
- Southwest: (-1, -1)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northwest: (-1, 1)

If y is Northwest of z, then y is at a position (-a, b) for some a, b > 0. Let's say y is at (-1, 1) for simplicity.

If x is North of y, then x is at a position (-1, 1+c) for some c > 0. Let's say x is at (-1, 2) for simplicity.

From z (which is at the origin), x is at (-1, 2). This is in the Northwest direction.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

OK, let me generalize to make sure I get the right answer.

Using the 2D grid with z at the origin (0, 0):
- If y is Northwest of z, then y is at (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.
- If x is North of y, then x is at (-a, b+c) for some c > 0.

From z, x is at (-a, b+c) where a, b, c > 0. This is always in the Northwest direction.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Actually, I think I had the definition of North slightly wrong. Let's redo this carefully.

If y is Northwest of z, it means y is at position (-a, b) for some a, b > 0 relative to z. This places y in the Northwest quadrant of z.

If x is North of y, it means x is at position (0, c) for some c > 0 relative to y. This places x directly North of y.

Now, to find the position of x relative to z, I need to combine these two offsets:
x's position relative to z = y's position relative to z + x's position relative to y
= (-a, b) + (0, c)
= (-a, b+c)

With a, b, c > 0, this places x in the Northwest quadrant of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

OK but I don't think North of y means 0 horizontal offset. Let me redo with a broader definition. 

If y is Northwest of z, it means y is at position (-a, b) for some a, b > 0 relative to z. This places y in the Northwest quadrant of z.

If x is North of y, it means x is at position (d, c) for some c > 0 relative to y, where d can be any real number. This places x generally North of y but doesn't restrict the east-west positioning.

Now, to find the position of x relative to z, I need to combine these two offsets:
x's position relative to z = y's position relative to z + x's position relative to y
= (-a, b) + (d, c)
= (-a+d, b+c)

With a, b, c > 0, and d being any real number, the y-coordinate of x is definitely greater than the y-coordinate of z. However, the x-coordinate of x can be greater than, equal to, or less than the x-coordinate of z, depending on the values of a and d.

If d < a, then -a+d < 0, placing x in the Northwest quadrant of z.
If d = a, then -a+d = 0, placing x directly North of z.
If d > a, then -a+d > 0, placing x in the Northeast quadrant of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z can be Northwest, North, or Northeast.

So the three possibilities are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Actually, let me check if I can even make the x-coordinate from y to x non-zero. I believe I can, because while the cardinal direction "North" is often idealized as directly upward, in reality, we often say something is "to the North" even if it's not perfectly aligned. In other words "North" describes a general direction, but doesn't imply a perfect alignment. So a region can be "North" of another even if there's a slight east-west difference.

So I believe that my solution that "the relation between x and z can be Northwest, North, or Northeast" is correct.

Actually, I'm getting confused again. OK, I'm going to redo things from scratch.

In a 2D space, cardinal directions can be defined as follows:
- North: 0 degrees (or 360 degrees)
- Northeast: 45 degrees
- East: 90 degrees
- Southeast: 135 degrees
- South: 180 degrees
- Southwest: 225 degrees
- West: 270 degrees
- Northwest: 315 degrees

However, in qualitative spatial reasoning, these directions are usually not interpreted as strict angles, but rather as sectors. For example, "North" might refer to any direction between, say, 337.5 degrees and 22.5 degrees. These sectors can be pictured as a partition of the plane into 8 wedges, each corresponding to one of the cardinal directions.

Now, the problem states:
- Region x is North of region y: This means that if I'm at the center of y looking at the center of x, my gaze is within the "North" sector (e.g., between 337.5 and 22.5 degrees).
- Region y is Northwest of region z: This means that if I'm at the center of z looking at the center of y, my gaze is within the "Northwest" sector (e.g., between 292.5 and 337.5 degrees).

But I'm not sure that's right, because these sectors aren't mutually exclusive. I think I want to define North as a ray directly along the positive y axis.

Let me define the cardinal directions as specific rays from the center of a region. So, from a region Z, the eight cardinal directions are as follows:
- North: (0, 1)
- Northeast: (1, 1)
- East: (1, 0)
- Southeast: (1, -1)
- South: (0, -1)
- Southwest: (-1, -1)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northwest: (-1, 1)

These rays can be normalized to have a magnitude of 1, but the direction is what's important. So for the purpose of calculation, we have:
- North: (0, 1)
- Northeast: (√2/2, √2/2)
- East: (1, 0)
- Southeast: (√2/2, -√2/2)
- South: (0, -1)
- Southwest: (-√2/2, -√2/2)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northwest: (-√2/2, √2/2)

Given the conditions:
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means the ray from z to y is in the Northwest direction: (-√2/2, √2/2).
- Region x is North of region y. This means the ray from y to x is in the North direction: (0, 1).

To find the relationship between x and z, I need to find the ray from z to x.

Let's say:
- z is at position (0, 0).
- y is at position (-a, a) for some a > 0. This places y in the Northwest direction from z.
- x is at position (-a, a+b) for some b > 0. This places x in the North direction from y.

The ray from z to x is a vector from (0, 0) to (-a, a+b), which is (-a, a+b). Normalizing this vector:
(-a, a+b) / √((-a)^2 + (a+b)^2) = (-a, a+b) / √(a^2 + (a+b)^2)

For this to be directly North, the x-component should be 0, which means a should be 0. But we know a > 0 because y is Northwest of z.

For this to be Northeast, the x-component should be positive, which means -a should be positive, but we know a > 0.

For this to be Northwest, the x-component should be negative and the y-component should be positive. Given that a > 0 and b > 0, -a is negative and a+b is positive. So, the ray from z to x is indeed in the Northwest direction.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

OK, I've gone in circles a bit with the definitions. Let me step back and think about the problem. 

The problem is asking about the possible relative positions of regions x and z, given that x is North of y and y is Northwest of z.

First, let's agree that if y is Northwest of z, then y is in a position that is North and West of z. Similarly, if x is North of y, then x is in a position that is North of y, but not necessarily West or East of y.

So, y is above and to the left of z. And x is above y, but it could be to the left, right, or directly above y.

So where is x in relation to z? Let's consider different possibilities.

If x is directly above y, then x is above and to the left of z, which would be Northwest of z.

If x is above and to the right of y (but still North of y overall), it depends on how far to the right. If x is far enough to the right to be directly above z, then x is North of z. If x is even further to the right, then x is to the right of z, which would make it Northeast of z.

So the possible positions of x in relation to z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Actually, let me re-explore this systematically. 

In a 2D space, I can define the cardinal directions as regions in the plane. If I'm at a point O, the cardinal directions are:
- North: The half-plane above O.
- East: The half-plane to the right of O.
- South: The half-plane below O.
- West: The half-plane to the left of O.

And the composite directions are the intersections of these half-planes:
- Northeast: The region that is both North and East of O.
- Southeast: The region that is both South and East of O.
- Southwest: The region that is both South and West of O.
- Northwest: The region that is both North and West of O.

Given these definitions, if region y is Northwest of region z, then y is both North and West of z. And if region x is North of region y, then x is above y.

From these, we can deduce:
- y is above and to the left of z.
- x is above y.

From the transitivity of the "above" relation, we know that x is also above z. So, x is definitely in the North half-plane of z.

In terms of East-West, y is in the West half-plane of z. But the position of x relative to y can be either West, aligned, or East. Therefore, x can be in the West, aligned, or East half-plane of z.

Combining the North-South and East-West positions, x can be:
- Both North and West of z, which is Northwest.
- Just North of z, which is North.
- Both North and East of z, which is Northeast.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Let me check the relations using a numerical example:

Let's establish a coordinate system where the positive y-axis is North and the positive x-axis is East.
- Let z be at the origin (0, 0).
- If y is Northwest of z, let's say y is at (-1, 1).
- If x is North of y, let's say x is at (-1, 2).

From z (which is at the origin), x is at (-1, 2). This places x in the Northwest quadrant of z, because x is both North (positive y-coordinate) and West (negative x-coordinate) of z.

But if I choose different values for x and y, can the relationship between x and z change?

- Let z be at the origin (0, 0).
- If y is Northwest of z, it must have a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate. Let's say y is at (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.
- If x is North of y, it must have a greater y-coordinate than y. But the x-coordinate of x relative to y can vary.

1. If x has the same x-coordinate as y, then x is at (-a, b+c) for some c > 0. From z, this places x in the Northwest quadrant.
2. If x has a greater x-coordinate than y, it's at (-a+d, b+c) for some c, d > 0. If d > a, then x is in the Northeast quadrant of z. If d = a, then x is directly North of z. If d < a, then x is in the Northwest quadrant of z.
3. If x has a smaller x-coordinate than y, it's at (-a-d, b+c) for some c, d > 0. This places x further West of z, which is still in the Northwest quadrant.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

To check my answer, let me think about this in a slightly different way. 

I have:
- Region y is Northwest of region z.
- Region x is North of region y.

By the first statement, the position of y relative to z is in the Northwest direction. By the second statement, the position of x relative to y is in the North direction.

Now, the question asks about the possible relations between region x and region z. To answer this, I need to combine the directions from z to y and from y to x.

In a simplified model of cardinal directions, let's represent the directions as vectors. We would have:
- North: (0, 1)
- Northeast: (1, 1)
- East: (1, 0)
- Southeast: (1, -1)
- South: (0, -1)
- Southwest: (-1, -1)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northwest: (-1, 1)

Given this model:
- The vector from z to y is Northwest: (-1, 1).
- The vector from y to x is North: (0, 1).

Combining these vectors, the vector from z to x is (-1, 1) + (0, 1) = (-1, 2). Normalizing this gives (-1/√5, 2/√5), which is in the Northwest direction (it's a vector with a negative x-component and a positive y-component).

So, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

But wait, I think the model I just used is too rigid. The problem is that when I say "North" in the context of cardinal directions, I don't necessarily mean exactly North. It could be slightly to the East or West, but still predominately North.

Let's use a more flexible interpretation. If region x is North of region y, it means that x is generally in the Northern direction of y, which is the half-plane above y. This doesn't constrain the East-West positioning of x relative to y.

Given this interpretation, x is in the Northern half-plane of y, and y is in the Northwestern quadrant of z. From this, we can deduce that x is definitely in the Northern half-plane of z. But depending on the East-West positioning of x relative to y, x can be in the Western, neutral, or Eastern half-plane of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

I'm finding myself with competing models. I think the disconnect is in the interpretation of "North." In some of my approaches, I've taken "North" to mean exactly North, which is a unique direction. In others, I've taken it to mean generally North, which can encompass a range of directions. I think I need to stick with a single, consistent interpretation.

For the purpose of this problem, I'll use the following interpretation:

The cardinal direction "North" refers to the region in a 2D plane that is directly above but not significantly to the left or right. Similar interpretations apply to the other cardinal directions.

However, the cardinal direction "Northwest" refers to the region that is both North and West. The North component means it's above, and the West component means it's to the left. Similarly for the other composite directions.

Given these interpretations, if region y is Northwest of region z, then y is above and to the left of z.

If region x is North of region y, then x is directly above y, but not significantly to the left or right.

From these, we can deduce that x is above and to the left of z, which is Northwest of z.

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Actually, my interpretation of "North" earlier was leading to some confusion. I think it's cleaner to state "North" as exactly North, which is a unique direction. So, I will use the eight cardinal directions as strict directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest).

Given this:
- If region y is Northwest of region z, then y is in the Northwest direction from z, which is a 315-degree angle from the East axis.
- If region x is North of region y, then x is in the North direction from y, which is a 90-degree angle from the East axis.

To find the direction of x from z, I need to compose these two directions, which isn't as straightforward as vector addition. In qualitative spatial reasoning, the composition of cardinal directions can result in a set of possible directions rather than a unique direction.

However, for the specific case of North and Northwest, we can reason intuitively. If I'm at z, and I go Northwest to reach y, and then from y, I go North to reach x, I'd have moved in a general Northwest direction from z to x, albeit not exactly at a 315-degree angle.

But maybe I'm overthinking here. The natural way to see things is: y is Northwest of z, so the bearing from z to y is 315 degrees. And x is North of y, so the bearing from y to x is 0 degrees. The resultant bearing from z to x would be some angle between 315 and 0 degrees, i.e., between Northwest and North. This would place x in the Northwest direction from z, but closer to the North direction than y is.

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

OK but I'm not sure this accounts for the "flexibility" of the cardinal directions. "North" may be generally North, but there's still a possibility for the region to have an East-West component. The directions we've been using are GENERAL DIRECTIONS, not specific 0-width rays. Rather, they describe general relationships and have some tolerant.

Actually, let me just get a bit more concrete to resolve things.

Let's define a coordinate system where z is at the origin (0, 0). If y is Northwest of z, we can represent it as y being at some position (-a, b) for a, b > 0. That's in the Northwest quadrant of z. 

If x is North of y, then in a strict sense, it would be at position (-a, b+c) for some c > 0, which means it's directly above y. This would place x in the Northwest quadrant of z.

However, if we allow for a broader interpretation of "North", then x could be at position (-a+d, b+c) for some c > 0 and any d, meaning it's generally above y but could be to the left or right of y. If d < 0, then x is further West of y, still placing it in the Northwest quadrant of z. If d = 0, x is directly above y, also placing it in the Northwest quadrant of z. If 0 < d < a, then x is to the right of y but still to the left of z, placing it in the Northwest quadrant of z. If d = a, then x is to the right of y and directly above z, placing it in the North direction from z. If d > a, then x is to the right of both y and z, placing it in the Northeast quadrant of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

This seems right to me, so the answer is "Northwest, North, and Northeast."

Now I think about it more, when we say "x is North of y", we typically mean that x is in the Northern half-plane of y, i.e., above y, without any constraints on its East-West positioning. 

When we say "y is Northwest of z", we mean that y is in the Northwestern quadrant of z, i.e., both above and to the left of z.

So where is x relative to z? 

From our given conditions:
- We know that y is above and to the left of z.
- We know that x is above y.

From the transitivity of the "above" relation, x is also above z. 

For the East-West relation:
- If x is to the left of y, then it's also to the left of z, placing it in the Northwest quadrant of z.
- If x is vertically aligned with y, it's to the left of z, also placing it in the Northwest quadrant of z.
- If x is to the right of y but still to the left of z, it's also in the Northwest quadrant of z.
- If x is vertically aligned with z, it's in the North direction from z.
- If x is to the right of z, it's in the Northeast quadrant of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Let me just double-check this answer by looking a bit deeper at the problem: "If region x is North of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Given the flexible definition of "North" that I've been using (meaning "above", without constraining the East-West positioning), here are the detailed possibilities for the relation between x and z:

1. Region y is Northwest of region z. This means y is both North (above) and West (left) of z.
2. Region x is North of region y. This means x is above y, but doesn't constrain the East-West positioning of x relative to y.

From these, we can deduce:
- x is above y, which is above z. By transitivity, x is above z. So, x is in the Northern half-plane of z.
- y is to the left of z. Depending on the East-West positioning of x relative to y, x can be to the left, aligned with, or to the right of z.

If x is to the left of z, then x is both North and West of z, which is Northwest.
If x is aligned with z in the East-West direction, then x is directly North of z.
If x is to the right of z, then x is both North and East of z, which is Northeast.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Actually wait. I realized that I'm using a somewhat mushy and overly flexible definition of "North". Let me use something more definite. Say, for three simple regions a, b, and c, a is North of b if and only if a.miny > b.maxy, and a.maxx >= b.minx, and a.minx <= b.maxx. Basically a is North of b iff the MBRs of the regions do not have East-West overlap, and a has a higher y than b.

Hmm, that still doesn't seem right. Let's use an even more precise definition. I'll use the direction relation matrix (DRM) to represent the cardinal direction relationships. For each pair of regions (a, b), the DRM provides a 3x3 matrix where each cell corresponds to one of the nine spatial tiles: NW, N, NE, W, O, E, SW, S, SE (where O is the origin, which here is region b).

The DRM for "a is North of b" would have a non-zero value in the N tile, meaning a region a is North of region b if and only if a is within the N tile of b. Similarly, "a is Northwest of b" would have a non-zero value in the NW tile, meaning a is within the NW tile of b.

Given this definition, if region y is within the NW tile of region z, and region x is within the N tile of region y, where is region x relative to region z?

It's hard to say without making assumptions about the shapes and sizes of the regions.

The tiles, as I've been imagining them, are centered at the center of the region. So, the N tile of a region is a semi-infinite rectangular area directly above the region, the NW tile is a quadrant above and to the left of the region, etc.

Hmm, let's back up and re-interpret the problem again.

OK, let's say a region a is North of region b iff a.miny > b.maxy.
And a region a is West of region b iff a.maxx < b.minx.
And a region a is Northwest of region b iff a is both North and West of b.

Clearly, under these definitions, if y is Northwest of z, then y.miny > z.maxy and y.maxx < z.minx. If x is North of y, then x.miny > y.maxy. 

So we have:
y.miny > z.maxy (1)
y.maxx < z.minx (2)
x.miny > y.maxy (3)

From (1) and (3), we get: x.miny > y.maxy > z.maxy. So x is North of z.

But that doesn't fully determine the East-West relationship between x and z. We don't have any constraints on x.maxx or x.minx in terms of z.minx or z.maxx.

So, x could be West of z, aligned with z, or East of z.

If x is West of z, then x is Northwest of z.
If x is aligned with z, then x is North of z.
If x is East of z, then x is Northeast of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

OK this feels correct, but I'm just making sure I didn't miss anything. But I'm also getting a bit bored of the problem, so let me wrap up now.

So the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Actually let me triple check through a slightly different definition.

In cardinal direction calculus, the 9-intersection model divides the space around a region into 9 tiles. For a region B, the tiles are: NW, N, NE, W, O, E, SW, S, SE, where O is the tile corresponding to B itself. If region A is within the N tile of B, we say "A is North of B."

Using this model, if region y is within the NW tile of region z, and region x is within the N tile of region y, where is region x relative to region z?

Let's think through this visually. If z is at the center, the NW tile is above and to the left of z. If y is in this NW tile, then the N tile of y would be directly above y, which is further above and to the left of z. This would place x in the NW tile of z.

Hmm, but that doesn't account for the flexibility of the cardinal directions. Let's approach this differently.

I'm struggling with this because the problem's formulation seems to demand a rigorous model for cardinal directions, but the terms themselves can be a bit ambiguous.

OK, I think the final list of possible relations is: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Let me go through these one by one:

1. Northwest: If x is North of y, and y is Northwest of z, then x can be Northwest of z if the West component of y's position relative to z is strong enough to offset any potential East component of x's position relative to y.

2. North: If x is North of y, and y is Northwest of z, then x can be North of z if any West component of y's position relative to z is exactly offset by an East component of x's position relative to y.

3. Northeast: If x is North of y, and y is Northwest of z, then x can be Northeast of z if any East component of x's position relative to y is strong enough to overcome the West component of y's position relative to z.

Let me do one last spot check: y is NW of z, so let's say z is at (0, 0), so y is at the NW of z, like at (-5, 5). x is North of y, so let's place x at (-5, 10). But wait, what if x is North of y but with a slight E component. Then it'd be like (-3, 10), which is still definitely NW of z. OK, what if x is a lot East of y, like (10, 10), then we definitely have x is NE of z. And we can adjust the position of x to be exactly N of z. So we do have all 3 as possibilities.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is Northwest of region z

Let me analyze this systematically:

When y is Northwest of z, it means y is both above and to the left of z.
When x is North of y, it means x is above y (but could be directly above, slightly to the left, or slightly to the right of y).

So where could x be in relation to z?

Since y is above z, and x is above y, we know that x must be above z. This means x has a definite North component relative to z.

For the East-West positioning:
- If x is to the left of z, x would be Northwest of z
- If x is aligned with z, x would be North of z
- If x is to the right of z, x would be Northeast of z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, and Northeast.
