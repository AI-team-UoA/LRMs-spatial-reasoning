PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's denote the relations as follows:
- N = North
- NE = Northeast
- E = East
- SE = Southeast
- S = South
- SW = Southwest
- W = West
- NW = Northwest
- BB = Bounding Box

We're given that:
- region x is NW of region y
- region y is W of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let me think about cardinal directions. The cardinal directions define the relative positions of regions in 2D space.

When region x is NW of region y, it means x is both north and west of y. Similarly, when region y is W of region z, it means y is west of z.

Now, let's think about the possible positions of region x relative to region z.

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, we know that:
- x is north and west of y
- y is west of z

Therefore, x is west of y, which is west of z. So, x is definitely west of z (W).

Additionally, x is north of y. But the relationship between the north-south position of y and z is not specified. It only says y is west of z, which only constrains the east-west relationship.

Given these constraints, region x could be:
- NW of region z (if x is north of z)
- W of region z (if x is at the same north-south level as z)
- SW of region z (if x is south of z)

But wait, I need to think more carefully. If x is NW of y, and y is W of z, then y is west of z but at the same north-south level as z. And x is north and west of y. So, x is north of y, which is at the same north-south level as z. Therefore, x is north of z.

Also, x is west of y, which is west of z. So, x is west of z.

Combining these, region x is both north and west of region z, which means x is NW of region z.

Wait, actually, let me be more careful. The cardinal direction relations like "W" and "NW" partition the 2D space into regions. If y is W of z, it means y is anywhere in the region that is directly west of z. Similarly, if x is NW of y, it means x is anywhere in the region that is northwest of y.

Given these constraints, x could be in various positions relative to z. Let's see:

If y is far to the west of z and x is slightly to the northwest of y, then x might still be W of z (if the north component is small enough).

If y is slightly to the west of z and x is far to the northwest of y, then x might be NW of z.

If the north component of x relative to y is sufficient to make x north of z, and x is still west of z, then x would be NW of z.

So, the possible relations are:
- NW of z
- W of z

Let me double check by drawing it out mentally.

We have region z, and region y is to the west of z. And region x is to the northwest of y.

```
  x
    \
     \
      y --- z
```

From this diagram, it seems like x is to the northwest of z. But what if the north component of x relative to y is small?

```
    x
     \
      \
       y --- z
```

In this case, x might still be to the west of z, especially if the distance from y to z is large compared to the north component of x relative to y.

What if the north component of x relative to y is large?

```
x
 \
  \
   \
    \
     y --- z
```

In this case, x is definitely to the northwest of z.

So, the possible relations are:
- NW of z
- W of z

But actually, I realize that there's a third possibility. If x is far to the northwest of y, and y is slightly to the west of z, then x might be N of z (if the west component of x relative to z is negligible).

```
x
 \
  \
   \
    \
     y - z
```

In this case, x might be N of z.

So, the possible relations are:
- N of z
- NW of z
- W of z

Wait, I've been thinking of these relationships in terms of points, not regions. Let me reconsider with regions in mind.

If region x is NW of region y, it means every point in region x is northwest of every point in region y. Similarly, if region y is W of region z, every point in region y is west of every point in region z.

Given these constraints, and the fact that "northwest" means both north and west, every point in region x is west of every point in region y, which is west of every point in region z. Therefore, every point in region x is west of every point in region z.

Similarly, every point in region x is north of every point in region y. But the north-south relationship between region y and region z is not specified. Region y could be north, south, or at the same north-south level as region z.

If region y is north of region z, then region x is north of region y, which is north of region z. Thus, region x is north of region z. In this case, region x is both north and west of region z, making it NW of region z.

If region y is at the same north-south level as region z, then region x is north of region y, which is at the same north-south level as region z. Thus, region x is north of region z. Again, region x is both north and west of region z, making it NW of region z.

If region y is south of region z, then the north-south relationship between region x and region z is uncertain. Region x is north of region y, but if region y is sufficiently south of region z, then region x might be south of region z, at the same north-south level as region z, or north of region z.

Hmm, but this can get a bit complex, especially when dealing with regions and not points. Let me try another approach: using the properties of the composition of cardinal direction relations.

When we compose two cardinal direction relations, we get a set of possible resulting relations. The composition of NW and W would give us the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's think about it systematically:

- If region x is NW of region y, it means x is in the northwest quadrant of y.
- If region y is W of region z, it means y is directly west of z.

When we combine these, region x could be in various positions relative to region z. It could be:
- N of z (if x is sufficiently north and only slightly west of z)
- NW of z (if x is both significantly north and west of z)
- W of z (if x is only slightly north but significantly west of z)

OK let's try to be even more concrete. 

Let's say we have a Cartesian coordinate system, and we place region z at the origin (0, 0).

Since region y is W of region z, region y is somewhere on the negative x-axis. Let's say region y is at (-a, 0) for some positive value a.

Now, region x is NW of region y. This means region x is somewhere in the quadrant to the northwest of region y. Let's say region x is at (-a-b, c) for some positive values b and c.

So, we have:
- region z at (0, 0)
- region y at (-a, 0)
- region x at (-a-b, c)

Now, let's determine the relation between region x and region z. The position of region x relative to region z is (-a-b, c). Since both -a-b is negative and c is positive, region x is both west and north of region z. Thus, region x is NW of region z.

However, this is a simplification, as I'm treating regions as points. In reality, regions have spatial extents. But the reasoning should be similar: if every point in region x is northwest of every point in region y, and every point in region y is west of every point in region z, then every point in region x is northwest of every point in region z.

Actually, let me double check with another diagram. Let's put region z at the origin, and use cardinal directions:

```
       N
       |
       |
W ---- + ---- E
       |
       |
       S
```

Now, region y is W of region z, so it's somewhere along the negative x-axis:

```
       N
       |
       |
   y   z
W ---- + ---- E
       |
       |
       S
```

And region x is NW of region y, so it's in the northwest quadrant of y:

```
       N
       |
    x  |
       |
   y   z
W ---- + ---- E
       |
       |
       S
```

From this diagram, it seems like region x is also NW of region z. But let's check other possibilities.

What if region y is very far to the west of region z, and region x is just slightly to the northwest of region y?

```
       N
       |
  xy   |
       |
       z
W ---- + ---- E
       |
       |
       S
```

In this case, region x is still W of region z, but it might be more west than northwest, depending on the exact positions. But it still falls within the NW quadrant of z.

Let me try one more. What if region y is slightly to the west of region z, and region x is very far to the northwest of region y?

```
       N
       |
    x  |
       |
       |
       |
      yz
W ---- + ---- E
       |
       |
       S
```

In this case, region x is closer to being N of region z, but it's still in the NW quadrant of z.

Let me try a more extreme case. What if region y is slightly to the west of region z, and region x is almost directly north of region y, with just a tiny westward displacement?

```
       N
       |
       x
       |
       |
       |
      yz
W ---- + ---- E
       |
       |
       S
```

Even in this case, region x is still in the NW quadrant of region z. However, it's so close to being directly north that one might say it's N of region z for practical purposes, though technically it's still NW.

But let me also think again more concretely using reasoning from the composition of the cardinal directions. We have:
- region x is NW of region y
- region y is W of region z

In the composition of cardinal directions, the composition of NW and W would give us the possible relations between region x and region z.

Actually, let me double check by being precise about directions. Let's say we have a grid that looks like this

```
NW  N  NE
 W  O   E
SW  S  SE
```

Or to phrase it another way:

```
 NW | N | NE
-----------
 W  | O | E 
-----------
 SW | S | SE
```

where O is the origin, and each direction represents a region. So for example, NW is the region that is both north and west of the origin.

So we're told that:
- region x is NW of region y
- region y is W of region z

So if we place region z at the origin, then region y is in the W region of z. And region x is in the NW region of y.

We have something like:

```
 ? | ? | ?
-----------
 x | y | z 
-----------
 ? | ? | ?
```

If region y is in the W region of z, and region x is in the NW region of y, then region x is in the NW region of z. So the relation is NW.

Actually, I just realized that I've been drawing diagrams that don't accurately represent the cardinal direction relations. In the context of spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations are typically defined using the minimal bounding rectangle (MBR) of a region. This can lead to a different interpretation.

Let's be more precise. When we say region y is W of region z, it means the entirety of region y is to the west of the westernmost part of region z. Similarly, when we say region x is NW of region y, it means the entirety of region x is to the northwest of the northwesternmost part of region y.

So, if we place region z at the origin, and region y is W of region z, then region y is somewhere on the negative x-axis, with a certain width.

If region x is NW of region y, then region x is in the northwest quadrant of region y, which is already in the W region of region z.

Given these constraints, region x is definitely west of region z (because it's west of region y, which is west of region z). And region x is also north of region y, which is at the same north-south level as region z (because y is W of z), so region x is north of region z. Therefore, region x is both north and west of region z, making it NW of region z.

So, my final answer is: The possible relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

OK let's actually be really careful here using the spatial calculation. We have
- region x is NW of region y
- region y is W of region z

Let's think of the cardinal directions as being given by a 3x3 grid:

```
NW | N | NE
-----------
 W | O | E 
-----------
SW | S | SE
```

where O is the origin (the reference region), and each of the 8 surrounding cells represents a cardinal direction relation relative to the origin.

Now, if region y is W of region z, it means y is in the W cell when z is at the origin:

```
   |   |   
-----------
 y | z |   
-----------
   |   |   
```

Similarly, if region x is NW of region y, it means x is in the NW cell when y is at the origin:

```
 x |   |   
-----------
   | y |   
-----------
   |   |   
```

Now, to find the relation between region x and region z, we need to determine where x is located when z is at the origin.

Given that y is W of z, and x is NW of y, we can infer that x is to the west and north of z:

```
 x |   |   
-----------
 y | z |   
-----------
   |   |   
```

From this diagram, it's clear that x is NW of z.

But let's be even more precise by using the properties of cardinal direction composition.

When we compose two cardinal direction relations, we get a set of possible resulting relations. The composition of NW and W would give us the possible relations between region x and region z.

Using the grid-based representation, we can determine the result of the composition by tracing through the grid. Starting from z as the origin, we move to y (which is W of z), and then move from y to x (which is NW of y). This gives us the relation between x and z.

From z, moving to the W cell gives us y. From y, moving to the NW cell gives us x. This places x in the NW cell relative to z.

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

In fact, let me try to formalize how I'm setting up this problem. Let's say we're using the RCC-8 with the cardinal direction calculus.

Specifically, Let's say we're using the Rectangular Cardinal Direction Calculus (RCDC) to determine the relationship between two regions. In RCDC, we divide the space around a reference region into 9 tiles (8 cardinal directions plus the reference tile) using the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the reference region.

Now, let's apply this to our problem.

1. We're told that region x is NW of region y. This means that when we set up the RCDC around region y, region x falls entirely within the NW tile.

2. We're also told that region y is W of region z. This means that when we set up the RCDC around region z, region y falls entirely within the W tile.

Now, we want to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's set up a coordinate system where the MBR of region z is at the origin, with its northwest corner at (0, 0) and its southeast corner at (1, -1).

If region y is W of region z, then the entirety of region y is to the west of the westernmost part of region z. In our coordinate system, this means that the easternmost point of region y has an x-coordinate less than 0. Let's say the MBR of region y has its northwest corner at (-b, 0) and its southeast corner at (-a, -1), where 0 < a < b.

Now, if region x is NW of region y, then the entirety of region x is to the northwest of the northwesternmost part of region y. In our coordinate system, this means that the southeasternmost point of region x has x and y coordinates less than the x and y coordinates of the northwesternmost point of region y. So, the southeasternmost point of region x has coordinates (c, d) where c < -b and d > 0.

Given these constraints, where does region x fall in the RCDC of region z?

It's to the west of the westernmost part of region z (since c < -b < 0), and it's to the north of the northernmost part of region z (since d > 0). Therefore, region x is NW of region z in the RCDC.

So, the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

OK let me give this one more try and assume I have regions (denoted A, B, C, etc.) on a 2D map with cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

We have:
- region x is NW of region y
- region y is W of region z

To determine the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z, I'll use the composition of cardinal directions.

Let's say we have a 3x3 grid with cardinal directions:

```
NW | N | NE
-----------
 W | O | E 
-----------
SW | S | SE
```

Where O is the center (origin).

If region y is W of region z, then y is in the W cell when z is at the center:

```
   |   |   
-----------
 y | z |   
-----------
   |   |   
```

And if region x is NW of region y, then x is in the NW cell when y is at the center:

```
 x |   |   
-----------
   | y |   
-----------
   |   |   
```

To find the relation between x and z, I need to determine where x is located when z is at the center. Given the above, x is in the NW cell when z is at the center:

```
 x |   |   
-----------
 y | z |   
-----------
   |   |   
```

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

So, based on the given constraints, region x is Northwest of region z.

Hmm, wait, let me be careful, there might be multiple options. I've been reasoning with a very specific setup, where we're thinking of y as being "directly" west of z, which is a big simplification. Since cardinal directions partition the 2D space around a reference point into discrete regions, there are many possible configurations of x, y, and z that satisfy the given constraints, potentially leading to multiple valid relations between x and z.

Let's reconsider: I have 3 regions x, y, and z, and I know that region x is NW of region y, and region y is W of region z. Let's explore various configurations.

Let's use a Cartesian coordinate system, with the reference region at the origin. Cardinal direction relations can be defined as follows:
- N: (0, y) where y > 0
- NE: (x, y) where x > 0 and y > 0
- E: (x, 0) where x > 0
- SE: (x, y) where x > 0 and y < 0
- S: (0, y) where y < 0
- SW: (x, y) where x < 0 and y < 0
- W: (x, 0) where x < 0
- NW: (x, y) where x < 0 and y > 0

Given that region y is W of region z, we can place region z at the origin (0, 0) and region y at (-a, 0) for some positive value a. 

Since region x is NW of region y, region x is at (-a-b, c) for some positive values b and c. That is x is at (-a-b, c) relative to z.

So x is to the west (since -a-b < 0) and north (since c > 0) of z. Therefore, x is NW of z.

But let's think of other possible configurations. What if, instead of treating the regions as points, we consider them as having spatial extents?

Let's say we define the cardinal direction relations using the minimal bounding rectangle (MBR) of each region. The cardinal direction of one region relative to another is determined by the position of the first region's MBR with respect to the second region's MBR.

Given this definition, let's reconsider. If region y is W of region z, it means the entirety of region y is to the west of the westernmost part of region z. And if region x is NW of region y, it means the entirety of region x is to the northwest of the northwesternmost part of region y.

Under these conditions, region x is definitely to the west of region z (since it's to the west of region y, which is to the west of region z). And region x is to the north of region y. Since region y is directly west of region z, it's at the same north-south level as region z. So, region x is to the north of region z.

Therefore, region x is both to the north and to the west of region z, making it NW of region z. So, the relation is NW.

Let me reason more broadly and consider that the cardinal directions might form a relation algebra. In relation algebras, we can compose relations, resulting in a set of possible relations.

OK, so in summary, region x is Northwest of region z.

Actually, let me double check using a grid-based reasoning approach again.

I'm using the Single-Tile Cardinal Direction model (ST for short), where the space around a reference region is divided into 9 tiles (8 cardinal directions plus the reference tile).

Let me describe ST model in terms of a 3x3 grid:

```
NW | N | NE
-----------
 W | O | E 
-----------
SW | S | SE
```

Where O is the center, occupied by the reference region.

In this model, if region x is NW of region y, then the entirety of region x falls in the NW tile when we set up the ST model with region y as the reference. Similarly, if region y is W of region z, the entirety of region y falls in the W tile when we set up the ST model with region z as the reference.

Now, let's see where region x falls when we set up the ST model with region z as the reference. Given the above constraints:

1. Region y is entirely in the W tile of region z.
2. Region x is entirely in the NW tile of region y.

From the perspective of region z, region y is in the W tile. And from the perspective of region y, region x is in the NW tile. So, when we look from the perspective of region z, region x is in the NW tile of region y, which is in the W tile of region z.

To visualize this: If we place region z at the center of the 3x3 grid, then region y is in the W tile. And if we were to zoom in on the W tile and place region y at its center, then region x would be in the NW tile of that zoomed-in grid.

Given these constraints, region x is definitely to the west of region z (since it's to the west of region y, which is to the west of region z). And region x is to the north of region y. Since region y is directly west of region z, it's at the same north-south level as region z. So, region x is to the north of region z.

Therefore, region x is both to the north and to the west of region z, making it NW of region z. So, the relation is NW.

OK, so the relation is NW. Let me give a final check. Could it also be some of the other options?

Could x be North of z?
For x to be directly North of z, it would have to be directly above z with no westward displacement. But we know that x is northwest of y, which is west of z. So, x has a westward displacement, meaning it can't be directly North of z. So, x cannot be N of z.

Could x be Northeast of z?
For x to be Northeast of z, it would have to be both to the north and to the east of z. We know that x is to the north of y, which could be to the north of z. But x is also to the west of y, which is to the west of z. So, x is to the west of z, not to the east. Therefore, x cannot be NE of z.

Could x be East of z?
Similar to the previous reasoning, x is to the west of z, not to the east. So, x cannot be E of z.

Could x be Southeast of z?
For x to be Southeast of z, it would have to be both to the south and to the east of z. But as we've established, x is to the north of y, which is at the same north-south level as z. So, x is to the north of z, not to the south. Also, x is to the west of z, not to the east. Therefore, x cannot be SE of z.

Could x be South of z?
For x to be directly South of z, it would have to be directly below z with no westward or eastward displacement. But we know that x is to the north of y, which is at the same north-south level as z. So, x is to the north of z, not to the south. Therefore, x cannot be S of z.

Could x be Southwest of z?
For x to be Southwest of z, it would have to be both to the south and to the west of z. We know that x is to the west of y, which is to the west of z. So, x is to the west of z. But x is also to the north of y, which is at the same north-south level as z. So, x is to the north of z, not to the south. Therefore, x cannot be SW of z.

Could x be West of z?
For x to be directly West of z, it would have to be directly to the left of z with no northward or southward displacement. We know that x is to the west of y, which is to the west of z. So, x is indeed to the west of z. But x is also to the north of y, which is at the same north-south level as z. So, x is to the north of z, not at the same north-south level. Therefore, x cannot be W of z.

Actually, let me be more careful about this. If x is NW of y, then x is in the quadrant that is both north and west of y. However, the exact position of x within this quadrant can vary.

If x is just slightly to the north of y, but significantly to the west, then when viewed from z, x might be more westward than northward. 

Let me try to visualize it better. Suppose we use a Cartesian coordinate system, with region z at the origin (0, 0).

Given that region y is W of region z, region y is somewhere on the negative x-axis. Let's say region y is at (-a, 0) for some positive value a.

Since region x is NW of region y, region x is somewhere in the quadrant to the northwest of region y. This means region x is at (-a-b, c) for some positive values b and c.

From the perspective of region z, the position of region x is (-a-b, c). For region x to be directly W of region z, the north-south displacement c would need to be zero, which contradicts the fact that region x is NW of region y (implying c > 0). So, region x cannot be W of region z.

OK, I've carefully checked, and the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

Actually, hold on. Let me think about one subtlety. Cardinal directions in the context of points are somewhat straightforward, but when it comes to regions, there are different ways to define cardinal directions.

Here, I've been referring to the Single-Tile Cardinal Direction model, which doesn't allow for topological relations like "overlap" or "contain". However, if we were to use other models, the result might be different.

For example, in the Direction-Relation Matrix (DRM) method, relations are more nuanced, allowing for regions to be in multiple directions relative to the reference region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_relation_matrix).

In the DRM method, if a region spans multiple cardinal direction tiles, it's said to have a bounding box relation with the reference region. But since we're using the single-tile model, and our regions are defined such that they fully fall within a single tile, the relation between region x and region z is NW.

Actually, let me be extra careful: what if we're using the projection-based cardinal direction model rather than the tile-based model?

In the projection-based model, cardinal directions are defined by projecting the reference region onto the x and y axes. This forms a + sign, dividing the plane into 9 regions. The projection-based model (sometimes called the MBR model) is more nuanced than the tile-based one, especially for regions with spatial extents.

However, even in the projection-based model, given the constraints that region x is entirely to the northwest of region y and region y is entirely to the west of region z, we can still deduce that region x is in the NW region of region z.

In the projection-based model, for region y to be entirely W of region z, the easternmost point of region y must be to the west of the westernmost point of region z. Similarly, for region x to be entirely NW of region y, the southeasternmost point of region x must be to the northwest of the northwesternmost point of region y.

Given these constraints, region x is definitely to the west of region z (since its easternmost point is west of the westernmost point of region y, which is west of the westernmost point of region z). And region x is definitely to the north of region z (since its southernmost point is north of the northernmost point of region y, which is at the same north-south level as region z).

Therefore, in the projection-based model as well, region x is NW of region z.

(side note: I'm not sure if I'm using this term exactly right, but I think I'm referring to this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_spatial_relationship)

To summarize, in both the tile-based and projection-based cardinal direction models, given the constraints that region x is entirely to the northwest of region y and region y is entirely to the west of region z, we can deduce that region x is entirely to the northwest of region z. So, the relation is NW.

Could x be in a Bounding Box relation with z?
Bounding Box relations typically occur when a region spans multiple cardinal direction tiles relative to the reference region. However, given the constraints, region x is entirely to the northwest of region y, which is entirely to the west of region z. So, region x is confined to the NW tile relative to region z. Therefore, x cannot be in a Bounding Box relation with z.

So, the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

Actually, I've been interpreting the cardinal directions in a very specific way, where a region is entirely in one of the 8 cardinal direction regions around a reference region. But there's a subtlety: when we say a region is "Northwest" of another, are we saying the entirety of the first region is in the Northwest quadrant of the second, or are we saying the first region spans the Northwest quadrant of the second?

Let's be explicit about this. Let's say the cardinal direction "NW" means that the entirety of region x is in the NW tile relative to region y.

OK, actually, I realize I've been misled by thinking too hard. Let's assume a simple interpretation: we have the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC), which provides 9 basic relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and EQ (Equal).

In this system, when we say region x is NW of region y, it means the entirety of region x falls in the NW quadrant when region y is the reference. Similarly, when we say region y is W of region z, it means the entirety of region y falls in the W quadrant when region z is the reference.

Given these constraints, and following the principles of the CDC, the relation between region x and region z is NW.

So, the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

OK, so the answer is NW.

Actually, I should be more careful. There are multiple models of cardinal direction relations, as described in Cohn and Renz's "Qualitative Spatial Representation and Reasoning". It's not clear which model the problem refers to.

In some models, the relation "region x is NW of region y" might mean that the entirety of region x is in the NW quadrant relative to region y. In other models, it might mean that the center of mass of region x is in the NW quadrant relative to region y.

Let me re-solve this problem under the assumption that the cardinal direction relation refers to the entirely of the region being in a single tile.

OK, to be clear, let's say the relation "region x is NW of region y" means the entirety of region x is in the NW quadrant when region y is the reference. Similarly, "region y is W of region z" means the entirety of region y is in the W quadrant when region z is the reference.

Given these definitions, the question asks: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, what is the relation between region x and region z?

Let's set up a coordinate system with region z at the origin. Given that region y is W of region z, region y is entirely in the W quadrant relative to region z. And given that region x is NW of region y, region x is entirely in the NW quadrant relative to region y.

From the perspective of region z, region y is in the W quadrant. And from the perspective of region y, region x is in the NW quadrant. So, when we look from the perspective of region z, region x is in the NW quadrant of region y, which is in the W quadrant of region z.

Given these constraints, region x is definitely to the west of region z (since it's to the west of region y, which is to the west of region z). And region x is to the north of region y. Since region y is directly west of region z, it's at the same north-south level as region z. So, region x is to the north of region z.

Therefore, region x is both to the north and to the west of region z, making it NW of region z. So, the relation is NW.

OK, so the relation is NW (Northwest).

Actually, let me take a different approach to be sure. Let's consider the composition of cardinal direction relations.

First, let's define the composition of two relations A and B, denoted as A◦B, as the set of possible relations between two regions x and z, given that there exists a region y such that xAy and yBz.

So, for our problem, we're looking for the composition of NW and W, i.e., NW◦W. This should give us the possible relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z.

Using properties of cardinal direction calculus, the composition of NW and W is NW.

Let me double check this geometrically. In our model, "region x is NW of region y" means the entirety of region x is in the NW quadrant when region y is the reference. Similarly, "region y is W of region z" means the entirety of region y is in the W quadrant when region z is the reference.

Given that region y is in the W quadrant of region z, the entirety of region y is to the west of region z. And given that region x is in the NW quadrant of region y, the entirety of region x is to the northwest of region y. This means region x is both to the north and to the west of region y.

Since region y is entirely to the west of region z, region x (which is entirely to the west of region y) is also entirely to the west of region z. And since region x is entirely to the north of region y, which is at the same north-south level as region z, region x is entirely to the north of region z.

Therefore, region x is both entirely to the north and entirely to the west of region z, making it NW of region z. So, the relation is NW.

OK, so the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

Actually, let me just do one more check with a diagram using a relation composition table to be sure:

```
 NW | N | NE
-----------
 W  | O | E 
-----------
 SW | S | SE
```

If region y is W of region z, then placing region z at O, region y is in the W position. And if region x is NW of region y, then placing region y at O, region x is in the NW position. So, from the perspective of region z, region y is in the W position. And from the perspective of region y, region x is in the NW position.

Looking at the composition table, the composition of W (from the perspective of region z to region y) and NW (from the perspective of region y to region x) gives us NW (from the perspective of region z to region x).

Actually, here is a diagram:

If we place z at the center, and y is to the west, the centers roughly look like:

```
 |  |  
-----
y | z 
-----
 |  |  
```

Now, if we place y at the center, and x is to the northwest, the centers roughly look like:

```
x |  
-----
 | y 
-----
 |  
```

Combining these, we get a picture where the centers of the regions look roughly like:

```
x |  |  
------
y | z |  
------
 |  |  
```

From this diagram, it's clear that from the perspective of region z, region x is in the NW position.

But be careful: this view considers the centers of the regions, which isn't always accurate, especially for regions with significant spatial extents. However, given the constraints that region x is entirely in the NW quadrant relative to region y, and region y is entirely in the W quadrant relative to region z, the relation between region x and region z is NW.

OK, so in all of these models, the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

So to answer the original question: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

Actually, wait, I've been very fixated on a single answer. Let me re-read the question. The question asks which could the possible relations between region x and region z be, not what is the relation.

OK, here's the question: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

Given what I've been working out, one possible relation is NW. Let me think of other possibilities by relaxing some of the constraints in my modeling. The key point to note is that I just showed that if you constrain both x to be entirely in the NW quadrant of y and y to be entirely in the W quadrant of z, then x is in the NW quadrant of z.

Let's relax this constraint and consider that when we say "region x is NW of region y," we mean that the center of mass of region x is in the NW quadrant relative to the center of mass of region y. Similarly, "region y is W of region z" means the center of mass of region y is in the W quadrant relative to the center of mass of region z.

Under this interpretation, region x could have a significant spatial extent, potentially spanning multiple cardinal direction tiles relative to region z. Huh, but even with this relaxation, the center of mass of region x would still be in the NW quadrant relative to the center of mass of region z. So, even with this relaxation, the relation is NW.

OK I think I've narrowed it down to NW. But let me also see what it could be if our cardinal model were using the projection-based model.

In the projection-based model, the space is partitioned into 9 regions based on the projections of the reference region onto the x and y axes. If "region x is NW of region y" means region x falls entirely in the NW region of the projection-based model relative to region y, and "region y is W of region z" means region y falls entirely in the W region of the projection-based model relative to region z, then following similar reasoning as before, region x would still be NW of region z.

I'm running out of ways to model this, and all my modelling is resulting in NW as the relation between region x and region z.

OK so my answer is that the relation between x and z is that x is Northwest of z.

Wait, I just realized I have to check whether Bounding Box (BB) is a valid option. In some models, if a region spans multiple cardinal direction tiles relative to the reference region, it's said to have a Bounding Box relation with the reference region. In our problem, if I allow for regions to have significant spatial extents, it's possible that region x spans multiple cardinal direction tiles relative to region z.

However, given the constraints that region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, I've shown earlier that region x is entirely to the northwest of region z. So, region x doesn't span multiple cardinal direction tiles relative to region z, and thus, it doesn't have a Bounding Box relation with region z.

So, the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

Just to be sure I haven't missed anything, let me just state my assumptions explicitly:

1. I'm using a cardinal direction model where the space around a reference region is divided into 9 tiles (8 cardinal directions plus the reference tile).
2. When we say "region x is NW of region y," we mean the entirety of region x falls in the NW tile when region y is the reference. Similarly, "region y is W of region z" means the entirety of region y falls in the W tile when region z is the reference.
3. I've explored various interpretations of the cardinal direction relation, including viewing the regions as points (centers of mass) and considering the spatial extents of the regions.

Under these assumptions, and given the constraints that region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, the relation between region x and region z is consistently NW (Northwest).

So, my final answer is: The relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

Actually, OK I've been thinking too hard. Let me just look at the wording of the question again. It asks "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Given the constraints, region x is NW of region z. Could it be anything else? Given the specifics of the constraints (the entirety of region x is in the NW quadrant relative to region y, and the entirety of region y is in the W quadrant relative to region z), and under the standard cardinal direction model, no, region x cannot be in any other relation with region z.

So, the relation between region x and region z is only NW (Northwest).

I've convinced myself through thorough analysis that if region x is NW of region y, and region y is W of region z, then the relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

So, my final answer is: The possible relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

To summarize, I've considered various interpretations and models of cardinal direction relations, and under all of them, given the constraints that region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, the relation between region x and region z is consistently NW (Northwest).

So, my final answer is: The possible relation between region x and region z is NW (Northwest).

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

If region x is Northwest of region y, then x is both north and west of y.
If region y is West of region z, then y is directly west of z (at the same north-south level as z).

Given these constraints:
- x is west of y, which is west of z, so x is west of z
- x is north of y, which is at the same north-south level as z, so x is north of z

Since region x is both north and west of region z, the relation between them is Northwest.
