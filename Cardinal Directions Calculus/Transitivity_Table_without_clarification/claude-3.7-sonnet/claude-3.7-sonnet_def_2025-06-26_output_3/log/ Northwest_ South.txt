PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step, using the cardinal direction relations.

We have:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

To reason about this, I need to understand the standard interpretations of cardinal direction relations. In qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations are typically understood as follows:

- If a region is North of another, it's positioned above it.
- If a region is South of another, it's positioned below it.
- If a region is East of another, it's positioned to the right of it.
- If a region is West of another, it's positioned to the left of it.
- Northwest combines North and West: positioned above and to the left.
- Northeast combines North and East: positioned above and to the right.
- Southwest combines South and West: positioned below and to the left.
- Southeast combines South and East: positioned below and to the right.

Now, let's analyze the given relations:
1. x is Northwest of y: This means x is above and to the left of y.
2. y is South of z: This means y is below z, or equivalently, z is above y.

Combining these:
- x is above and to the left of y.
- z is above y.

To determine the possible relation between x and z, I need to consider the possible positions of z relative to x:

If z is directly above y, and x is to the left and above y, then x would be to the left of z, but could be at the same level as z or below it or above it. So, x could be:
- West of z (if x is at the same vertical level as z)
- Southwest of z (if x is below z)
- Northwest of z (if x is above z)

But let's be more careful and precise by using a coordinate system. Let's place y at the origin (0, 0), and then:
- If x is Northwest of y, then x is at some position (-a, b) where a and b are positive numbers.
- If y is South of z, then z is at some position (c, d) where d is positive and c could be any number (positive, negative, or zero).

So now we have:
- x is at (-a, b) where a, b > 0.
- z is at (c, d) where d > 0 and c could be any value.

The relation between x and z depends on the relative values of a, b, c, and d:
- If -a < c, then x is West of z.
- If -a > c, then x is East of z.
- If -a = c, then x is directly North or South of z.
- If b < d, then x is South of z.
- If b > d, then x is North of z.
- If b = d, then x is directly East or West of z.

Hmm, but actually there's a problem with my approach, because I shouldn't be thinking of these regions as points. Let's correct my approach:

When we say "region x is Northwest of region y," we typically mean that all points in x are to the northwest of all points in y. Similarly, "region y is South of region z" means all points in y are to the south of all points in z.

Given:
- All points in x are to the Northwest of all points in y.
- All points in y are to the South of all points in z.

This means:
- All points in x are above and to the left of all points in y.
- All points in y are below all points in z.

Actually, let's rethink this again. Cardinal directions typically divide the space around a reference region into directional cones or sectors.

If region x is Northwest of region y, this means that region x is in the Northwest sector with y as the reference point. Similarly, if region y is South of region z, this means that region y is in the South sector with z as the reference point.

Hmm, I'm not sure if I'm overcomplicating this. Let's simplify and think of the regions as points for a moment:

- If point x is Northwest of point y, then x is above and to the left of y.
- If point y is South of point z, then y is below z.

Visually, this would be:
```
    z
    |
    |
    y
   /
  /
 x
```

From this, we can see that x is to the left of z and can be above, at the same level, or below z depending on the relative distances. So, x could be:
- West of z (if x is at the same vertical level as z)
- Southwest of z (if x is below z)
- Northwest of z (if x is above z)

But this is a simplification. In reality, regions have spatial extent, and the relation between two regions can be more complex.

Let's go back to my coordinate-based approach, which I think provides a more accurate representation:

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y: All points in x are at positions (a, b) relative to a reference point in y, where a < 0 (to the west) and b > 0 (to the north).
- Region y is South of region z: All points in y are at positions (c, d) relative to a reference point in z, where d < 0 (to the south) and c can be any value.

When we combine these, we can say:
- All points in x are at positions (a + c, b + d) relative to a reference point in z, where a < 0, b > 0, d < 0, and c can be any value.

Now, the possible values of (a + c, b + d) determine the possible relations between x and z:
- a + c < 0: x is to the West of z.
- a + c > 0: x is to the East of z.
- b + d > 0: x is to the North of z.
- b + d < 0: x is to the South of z.

Hmm, but there's a problem. If a < 0 (x is West of y) and c can be any value, then a + c can be positive or negative, so x could be either East or West of z. But given the context, it makes more sense that x is to the West of z.

Let me reconsider. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem or the cardinal direction relations. 

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the standard interpretation of cardinal direction relations in qualitative spatial reasoning:

- If region A is North of region B, it's positioned above B.
- If region A is South of region B, it's positioned below B.
- If region A is East of region B, it's positioned to the right of B.
- If region A is West of region B, it's positioned to the left of B.

And the compound directions:
- Northwest: Above and to the left.
- Northeast: Above and to the right.
- Southwest: Below and to the left.
- Southeast: Below and to the right.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y: This means x is positioned above and to the left of y.
- Region y is South of region z: This means y is positioned below z, or equivalently, z is positioned above y.

Visually:
```
    z
    |
    |
    y
   /
  /
 x
```

From this visualization, it seems clear that x is to the left of z, but the vertical relationship is ambiguous. X could be below, at the same level, or above z, depending on the relative distances. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (if x is at the same vertical level as z)
- Southwest (if x is below z)
- Northwest (if x is above z)

These are the three possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given the constraints.

Wait, I think I've been conflating the binary relation between two regions with the absolute position. Let me correct myself.

In cardinal direction relations, the nine basic relations are:
- North (N)
- Northeast (NE)
- East (E)
- Southeast (SE)
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- West (W)
- Northwest (NW)
- Bounding Box (B) - when one region is inside the minimum bounding box of the other.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

When we compose these relations, we're asking: If x is in the relation NW to y, and y is in the relation S to z, what's the relation between x and z?

The composition of cardinal direction relations is a well-studied topic in qualitative spatial reasoning. I should use the composition table for cardinal direction relations.

From the composition of NW and S, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (W)
- Southwest (SW)
- Northwest (NW)

This is consistent with my earlier spatial reasoning. If you draw out the possible positions, you'll see that x can be to the left and above z (NW), to the left and below z (SW), or to the left and at the same vertical level as z (W).

So, the answer is: West, Southwest, Northwest.

OK actually now let me draw a more careful picture to be sure:

We know x is to the Northwest of y, so x is up and to the left of y.
We know y is to the South of z, so y is below z.

Let me pick some concrete example positions:
x: (-1, 1)
y: (0, 0)
z: (0, 1)

In this case, x is to the left (West) of z and at the same height, so x is West of z.

Another example:
x: (-1, 1)
y: (0, 0)
z: (0, 2)

In this case, x is to the left (West) of z and below it, so x is Southwest of z.

Another example:
x: (-1, 2)
y: (0, 0)
z: (0, 1)

In this case, x is to the left (West) of z and above it, so x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (W)
- Southwest (SW)
- Northwest (NW)

Let me double-check. Actually I think there is a problem with the third example. If z is at (0, 1) and y is at (0, 0), then y is to the South of z, which is correct. But if x is at (-1, 2), then x is actually to the North of z, not to the Northwest of z.

Let me reconsider. If y is at (0, 0) and z is at (0, 1), then to be Northwest of z, x would need to be at a position like (-1, 2), which would make it Northwest of z.

Actually, maybe the problem is that I'm thinking of Northwest as strictly "up and to the left", but it's actually a cone or sector in standard cardinal direction models. Let me use a more standard interpretation:

- North (N): The entire region is strictly above the reference region.
- South (S): The entire region is strictly below the reference region.
- East (E): The entire region is strictly to the right of the reference region.
- West (W): The entire region is strictly to the left of the reference region.
- Northeast (NE): The entire region is strictly above and to the right of the reference region.
- Northwest (NW): The entire region is strictly above and to the left of the reference region.
- Southeast (SE): The entire region is strictly below and to the right of the reference region.
- Southwest (SW): The entire region is strictly below and to the left of the reference region.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y: x is strictly above and to the left of y.
- Region y is South of region z: y is strictly below z.

Let me try once more with a different approach. Instead of thinking of specific points, let's consider the regions and their boundaries.

If region x is Northwest of region y, then any point in x is to the northwest of any point in y. Similarly, if region y is South of region z, then any point in y is to the south of any point in z.

Now, let's consider the following: For a point Px in region x and a point Pz in region z, we know that Px is Northwest of some point Py in region y, and Py is South of Pz.

Given this chain of relations, the possible relations between Px and Pz would be:
- If Px is directly to the left of Pz and at the same vertical level, then Px is West of Pz.
- If Px is to the left of Pz and below it, then Px is Southwest of Pz.
- If Px is to the left of Pz and above it, then Px is Northwest of Pz.

Since every point in x can have any of these three relations with any point in z, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- West (W)
- Southwest (SW)
- Northwest (NW)

Hmm let's try again. I think I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

I'll start with a clear definition: In the cone-based model, the space is divided into 9 tiles based on a reference region. These tiles are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box (which is the reference region itself).

Now, given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

We need to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's define positions for regions y and z:
- y is at (0, 0).
- z is at (0, 1), which means z is North of y (or equivalently, y is South of z).

Now, for x to be Northwest of y, x must be at a position like (-a, b) where a and b are positive. Let's say x is at (-1, 1).

With these positions:
- x is at (-1, 1).
- y is at (0, 0).
- z is at (0, 1).

The relation between x and z would be:
- x is to the left of z: The x-coordinate of x (-1) is less than the x-coordinate of z (0).
- x is at the same vertical level as z: The y-coordinate of x (1) is the same as the y-coordinate of z (1).

Given these, x is West of z.

But this is just one possibility. Let's try different positions for x:
- If x is at (-1, 0.5), then x is Southwest of z.
- If x is at (-1, 1.5), then x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (if x is at the same vertical level as z)
- Southwest (if x is below z)
- Northwest (if x is above z)

I believe this is the correct answer based on the given constraints.

Actually, just to really be sure, let me try a slightly different calculation. Let's say:
- Region y is at (0, 0)
- Since region x is Northwest of region y, it's at position (-a, b) where a and b are positive.
- Since region y is South of region z, region z is at position (c, d) where d is positive and c can be any value.

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
- The x-coordinate of x relative to z is -a - c. For this to be West, -a - c < 0, which is satisfied since a is positive (regardless of the value of c).
- The y-coordinate of x relative to z is b - d.
  - If b > d, x is North of z.
  - If b < d, x is South of z.
  - If b = d, x is at the same vertical level as z.

Given these, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (if b = d)
- Northwest (if b > d)
- Southwest (if b < d)

But wait that isn't quite right. I think I'm confusing myself with coordinate arithmetic. Let me try yet again. 

Actually I got confused with that calculation, because I positioned z relative to y, but then tried to compute the position of x relative to z directly. Let me be more careful.

- Region y is at (0, 0).
- Region x is Northwest of region y, so x is at (-a, b) where a and b are positive.
- Region y is South of region z, so z is at (0, d) where d is positive (we assume z is directly above y).

Now, the relation between x and z:
- x is at (-a, b) and z is at (0, d).
- The relative position of x with respect to z is (-a, b - d).
  - Since -a < 0, x is West of z.
  - If b > d, x is North of z, making x Northwest of z.
  - If b < d, x is South of z, making x Southwest of z.
  - If b = d, x is at the same vertical level as z, making x West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (if b = d)
- Northwest (if b > d)
- Southwest (if b < d)

Wait, let me be even more careful. 

Alright, let me think of this more carefully. In a cardinal direction framework, the space around a reference point (or region) is typically divided into sectors: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and potentially a ninth relation for when one region contains the other.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

Let's think about the transitive property of these relations. If x is in the Northwest sector with respect to y, and y is in the South sector with respect to z, where is x with respect to z?

If y is South of z, then z is North of y. This means that z is above y.

If x is Northwest of y, then x is above and to the left of y.

Given these positions:
- z is above y.
- x is above and to the left of y.

The position of x with respect to z depends on how far above y each of them is:
- If z is further above y than x is, then x is below z and to the left, making x Southwest of z.
- If x is further above y than z is, then x is above z and to the left, making x Northwest of z.
- If x and z are at the same height above y, then x is to the left of z, making x West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (if x and z are at the same height above y)
- Northwest (if x is higher above y than z)
- Southwest (if z is higher above y than x)

I believe this is the correct reasoning and conclusion.

Alright, let me just check this one more time to be sure.

Given that region x is Northwest of region y and region y is South of region z, I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

For this, I'll use a coordinate system to visualize and analyze:

1. Let's place region y at the origin (0, 0).
2. Since region x is Northwest of region y, x is at a position (-a, b) where a and b are positive numbers.
3. Since region y is South of region z, z is at a position (c, d) where d is positive (z is North of y) and c can be any value (the East-West relation between y and z is not specified).

The relative position of x with respect to z is (-a - c, b - d).

The relation between x and z depends on this relative position:

- East-West Relation:
  - If -a - c < 0, x is West of z.
  - If -a - c > 0, x is East of z.
  - If -a - c = 0, x is directly North or South of z.

  Since a is positive (x is West of y), and c can be any value, the relationship could be either West or East.
  Actually, no, that's wrong. If a is positive, and c is any value, then the relation can be West, East, or directly North/South.

  Actually, let me think again. The East-West relation between y and z isn't specified, so c can be any value. But the question is asking for the possible relations, not the definite relation. So, if we consider all possible values of c, the East-West relation between x and z could be:
  - If c is negative and |c| > a, then -a - c > 0, making x East of z.
  - If c is positive or if c is negative but |c| < a, then -a - c < 0, making x West of z.
  - If c is negative and |c| = a, then -a - c = 0, making x directly North or South of z.

- North-South Relation:
  - If b - d > 0, x is North of z.
  - If b - d < 0, x is South of z.
  - If b - d = 0, x is directly East or West of z.

  Since b and d are both positive, the relation can be North, South, or directly East/West.

Combining these:
- x could be Northeast of z (if -a - c > 0 and b - d > 0).
- x could be East of z (if -a - c > 0 and b - d = 0).
- x could be Southeast of z (if -a - c > 0 and b - d < 0).
- x could be North of z (if -a - c = 0 and b - d > 0).
- x could be South of z (if -a - c = 0 and b - d < 0).
- x could be Northwest of z (if -a - c < 0 and b - d > 0).
- x could be West of z (if -a - c < 0 and b - d = 0).
- x could be Southwest of z (if -a - c < 0 and b - d < 0).

But this doesn't seem right. It would imply that x can have any cardinal direction relation with z given the constraints, which doesn't sound intuitive.

Let me reconsider. When we say "region y is South of region z," it's typically understood that y is strictly below z, without any East or West component. If that's the case, then c would be 0, and z would be directly above y.

With this interpretation:
- x is at (-a, b) relative to y.
- z is at (0, d) relative to y.
- The relative position of x with respect to z is (-a, b - d).

Given that a is positive, x is always West of z. The North-South relation depends on the values of b and d:
- If b > d, x is Northwest of z.
- If b < d, x is Southwest of z.
- If b = d, x is West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (if b = d)
- Northwest (if b > d)
- Southwest (if b < d)

I believe this is the correct interpretation and answer.

But wait, actually I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let's go back to the basic cardinal direction relations. In the standard 9-tile model:

- North (N): The region is strictly above the reference region.
- South (S): The region is strictly below the reference region.
- East (E): The region is strictly to the right of the reference region.
- West (W): The region is strictly to the left of the reference region.
- Northeast (NE): The region is strictly above and to the right of the reference region.
- Northwest (NW): The region is strictly above and to the left of the reference region.
- Southeast (SE): The region is strictly below and to the right of the reference region.
- Southwest (SW): The region is strictly below and to the left of the reference region.
- Bounding Box (B): One region contains the other.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

The Northwest relation means that x is above and to the left of y. The South relation means that y is below z. Transitively, this means:
- x is to the left of z (from the West component of Northwest).
- The vertical relation between x and z depends on how far above y each of them is:
  - If x is further above y than z is above y, then x is above z, making the relation Northwest.
  - If x is less above y than z is above y, then x is below z, making the relation Southwest.
  - If x is exactly as far above y as z is above y, then x is at the same vertical level as z, making the relation West.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (if x and z are at the same vertical level)
- Northwest (if x is above z)
- Southwest (if x is below z)

This is the answer I arrived at previously, and I'm now confident that it's correct.

The answer is West, Northwest, Southwest.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest
