PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

We have two regions with known cardinal relations:
- Region x is Southwest of region y.
- Region y is West of region z.

And we need to determine what the possible relations between region x and region z might be.

Let's think about this in terms of coordinates. Suppose z is at the origin (0, 0).
- If y is West of z, then y is at some point (-a, 0) where a > 0.
- If x is Southwest of y, then x is at some point (-a - b, -c) where b, c > 0.

So x is at (-a - b, -c) and z is at (0, 0).

To determine the cardinal relation between x and z, I need to find the direction from z to x. That's equivalent to the direction from (0, 0) to (-a - b, -c).

The vector from z to x is (-a - b, -c). This points to the West (due to the negative x-component) and South (due to the negative y-component). Specifically, it points Southwest, since both components are negative.

But wait, I need to be careful here. Let me reconsider this problem more carefully.

If region y is West of region z, then y is directly to the west of z (on the same latitude). And if region x is Southwest of region y, then x is to the southwest of y.

Let me use a coordinate system where:
- East corresponds to increasing x-coordinate
- North corresponds to increasing y-coordinate

Let's set z at origin (0, 0) for convenience.
Since y is West of z, y is at some point (-a, 0) where a > 0.
Since x is Southwest of y, x is at some point (-a - b, -c) where b, c > 0.

So x is at (-a - b, -c) and z is at (0, 0).

The vector from z to x is (-a - b, -c), which points West and South. So x is Southwest of z.

Hmm, but I feel like I might be making an assumption here. Let me try again with a different approach.

When we say "y is West of z", we mean that y is directly to the west of z, i.e., on the same latitude. Similarly, when we say "x is Southwest of y", we mean that x is to the southwest of y.

Using our coordinate system:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-a, 0) for some a > 0
- x is at (-a - b, -c) for some b, c > 0

The vector from z to x is (-a - b, -c), which has a negative x-component and a negative y-component. This corresponds to the southwest direction.

So, the relation between x and z is: x is Southwest of z.

Hang on, I think I'm approaching this incorrectly. The problem is asking for the relation between x and z, not the other way around. Let me reconsider.

When we say "region x is Southwest of region y", we mean that y is to the northeast of x. Similarly, when we say "region y is West of region z", we mean that z is to the east of y.

Using our coordinate system:
- x is at (0, 0)
- y is at (a, a) for some a > 0 (since y is to the northeast of x)
- z is at (a + b, a) for some b > 0 (since z is to the east of y)

The vector from x to z is (a + b, a), which has a positive x-component and a positive y-component. This corresponds to the northeast direction.

So, the relation between x and z is: z is Northeast of x, or equivalently, x is Southwest of z.

I think I made some more errors here. Let me draw a clearer diagram:

If we consider x at the origin (0, 0), and y is to the northeast of x, then y might be at (1, 1) for example.
If z is to the east of y, then z might be at (2, 1) for example.

In this case, the vector from x to z is (2, 1), which is in the northeast direction. So x is Southwest of z, or equivalently, z is Northeast of x.

Hmm, let me try one more time, being very careful.

The problem statement says:
- Region x is Southwest of region y.
- Region y is West of region z.

We need to find the relation between x and z.

To be very clear, "x is Southwest of y" means that x is to the southwest of y, or equivalently, y is to the northeast of x.

"y is West of z" means that y is to the west of z, or equivalently, z is to the east of y.

Let's visualize this using cardinal direction markings:

```
    N
    |
W -- -- E
    |
    S
```

Using this diagram, if y is to the northeast of x, then y is somewhere in the NE direction. If z is to the east of y, then z is somewhere to the E direction of y.

Let's visualize where these regions are in a 2D plane:

```
     ^ N
     |
     |
     |  z
     |  
     |   y
     |   /
     |  /
     | /
     |/
 W---x------> E
     |
     |
     | S
```

In this diagram, x is at the origin, y is to the northeast of x, and z is to the east of y.

From this, it seems like z is to the northeast of x, which means x is to the southwest of z.

But I'm still not entirely sure about this, because we're dealing with regions, not just points. Let me try to visualize this with regions.

```
     ^ N
     |
     |
     |  +---+
     |  | z |
     |  +---+
     |   +---+
     |   | y |
     |   +---+
     |       +---+
     |       | x |
 W---+-------+---+-----> E
     |
     |
     | S
```

In this diagram, region x is to the southwest of region y, and region y is to the west of region z. From this, it appears that region x is to the southwest of region z, which means region z is to the northeast of region x.

However, we need to be careful with regions because they have area, and this means that their cardinal relation might not be as straightforward as with points.

Let's consider a different arrangement where x is still to the southwest of y, and y is still to the west of z, but see if there's any other possible relation between x and z.

Actually wait a second, I've been drawing a diagram where y is to the northeast of x. But the problem says that x is to the southwest of y. So I've actually been drawing it correctly.

Let me now reconsider this more carefully, and try a different diagram to see if there's another possible relation between x and z.

Let's say z is still at the origin (0, 0) for convenience.
If y is to the west of z, then y is at some point (-a, 0) where a > 0.

Now, if x is to the southwest of y, it means that x is at some point (-a - b, -c) where b, c > 0.

The vector from z to x is (-a - b, -c), which is in the southwest direction. So, x is Southwest of z.

I think I was overthinking this. Given the constraints, x is indeed to the southwest of z.

Actually wait. I just realized I'm interpreting the problem correctly but making a mistake in the analysis. The question is asking "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" So I need to consider all possible configurations where x is southwest of y and y is west of z, and then find all the possible relations between x and z.

Let's be more systematic. Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) for convenience.

Since y is west of z, y must be at some point (-a, b) where a > 0 and b can vary (b can be positive, negative, or zero).

Since x is southwest of y, x must be at some point (-a - c, b - d) where c, d > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to find the direction from z to x, which is the vector (-a - c, b - d).

For this vector, the x-component is always negative (since a and c are both positive). This means that x is always to the west of z.

The y-component can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the values of b and d.
- If b - d > 0, then the vector points northwest, meaning x is Northwest of z.
- If b - d = 0, then the vector points directly west, meaning x is West of z.
- If b - d < 0, then the vector points southwest, meaning x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Let me double-check this with a few concrete examples.

Example 1:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 1) (west of z, but slightly north)
- x is at (-2, 0) (southwest of y)
In this case, the vector from z to x is (-2, 0), which is directly west. So, x is West of z.

Example 2:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 2) (west of z, but more north)
- x is at (-2, 1) (southwest of y)
In this case, the vector from z to x is (-2, 1), which is northwest. So, x is Northwest of z.

Example 3:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 0) (directly west of z)
- x is at (-2, -1) (southwest of y)
In this case, the vector from z to x is (-2, -1), which is southwest. So, x is Southwest of z.

Hmm, wait. I made a mistake again. If y is west of z, then y has the same y-coordinate as z, but a smaller x-coordinate. So, y should be at (-a, 0), not (-a, b).

Let's redo this analysis.

Place z at the origin (0, 0) for convenience.

Since y is west of z, y must be at some point (-a, 0) where a > 0.

Since x is southwest of y, x must be at some point (-a - c, -d) where c, d > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to find the direction from z to x, which is the vector (-a - c, -d).

For this vector, the x-component is always negative (since a and c are both positive), and the y-component is always negative (since d is positive).

This means that x is always to the southwest of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is Southwest.

Let me double-check with a concrete example:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 0) (directly west of z)
- x is at (-2, -1) (southwest of y)
In this case, the vector from z to x is (-2, -1), which is southwest. So, x is Southwest of z.

Hmm, let me think. I get the impression that I've been thinking about this problem in a way that's too narrow. Let's approach this from a different angle, thinking about regions rather than points.

Cardinal directions in the context of regions can be a bit more complex, especially when the regions have area and aren't just points.

Ok, I think I'm still overthinking this. When I think about it in a qualitative space, the Southwestness and Westness have a clear meaning. Southwest means a region is both to the south and to the west of another region. West means a region is directly to the west of another region (without any significant northness or southness).

Given this:
- Region x is Southwest of region y.
- Region y is West of region z.

This means:
- x is both to the south and to the west of y.
- y is to the west of z (without any significant northness or southness).

Transitivity holds for the "westness" part, so x is definitely to the west of z.

As for the "southness" part, since x is to the south of y, and y is at approximately the same "northness" as z, then x is to the south of z.

So, x is both to the south and to the west of z, which means x is Southwest of z.

Hmm, I'm still unsure. I've been thinking about this from a "qualitative" perspective, but maybe I need to think more concretely.

OK let's take a "region-based" approach. We can define cardinal direction relations in terms of the 9-intersection model, which breaks space into 9 regions around a reference region.

Here, we have that x is in the Southwest region of y, and y is in the West region of z. 

OK I still think I'm overthinking this, let's just do a reasonably and go back to the coordinates. Let's represent regions in terms of their centroids.

I'll place z at the origin (0, 0).
Since y is west of z, the centroid of y is at (-a, 0) for some a > 0.
Since x is southwest of y, the centroid of x is at (-a - b, -c) for some b, c > 0.

The vector from z to x is (-a - b, -c), which means that x is to the southwest of z.

Actually, let me think about the 9-intersection model a bit more, since the region x could be in a different region with respect to z, depending on the sizes and shapes of the regions.

In the 9-intersection model, space is divided into 9 regions around a reference region:
- NW (Northwest), N (North), NE (Northeast)
- W (West), O (Origin/Same), E (East)
- SW (Southwest), S (South), SE (Southeast)

Given that x is in the SW region with respect to y, and y is in the W region with respect to z, we need to determine which region x is in with respect to z.

Actually, ok let's just use a concrete example. Since y is west of z, let's put y somewhere to the west of z, like this:

```
     ^ N
     |
     |
     |  +---+
     |  | z |
     |  +---+
     |    
     |   +---+
     |   | y |
     |   +---+
     |       
 W---+-------------> E
     |
     |
     | S
```

Now, since x is southwest of y, x is somewhere to the southwest of y:

```
     ^ N
     |
     |
     |  +---+
     |  | z |
     |  +---+
     |    
     |   +---+
     |   | y |
     |   +---+
     |       
 W---+-------------> E
     |
     |      +---+
     | S    | x |
     |      +---+
```

From this diagram, it's visually clear that x is to the southwest of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

OK I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let's just do a simple, visually-intuitive approach.

Actually, I think my last approach was correct. If x is Southwest of y, and y is West of z, then x is Southwest of z.

But wait, what if region x extends far enough to be in a different cardinal direction with respect to z? Let's visualize this with a diagram.

```
     ^ N
     |
     |  +---+
     |  | z |
     |  +---+
     |    
     |   +---+
     |   | y |
     |   +---+
     |       
 W---+-------------> E
     |
     |      +-------+
     | S    |   x   |
     |      +-------+
```

In this diagram, region x is to the southwest of region y, and region y is to the west of region z. From this, region x is to the southwest of region z.

But what if region x is very large? Could it extend to be in a different cardinal direction with respect to z?

```
     ^ N
     |
     |  +---+
     |  | z |
     |  +---+
     |    
     |   +---+
     |   | y |
     |   +---+
     |       
 W---+-------------> E
     |
     |  +---------------+
     | S|      x        |
     |  +---------------+
```

Here, region x is still to the southwest of region y, and region y is still to the west of region z. But region x is so large that it's both to the west and to the southwest of region z.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be West and Southwest.

Actually, I think I've been unnecessarily complicating this problem. The standard interpretation of cardinal direction relations in qualitative spatial reasoning doesn't assume that regions have to be completely contained within a directional cone. It's usually based on the relative position of the centroids or some other reference point of the regions.

In this interpretation, if the centroid of x is to the southwest of the centroid of y, and the centroid of y is to the west of the centroid of z, then the centroid of x is to the southwest of the centroid of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, I think I keep going in circles. Let me think about this more rigorously using the 9-intersection model or some other formalism for cardinal directions between regions.

In some spatial reasoning systems, cardinal directions between regions are defined in terms of the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given two regions A and B, the cardinal direction from A to B is determined by the position of the MBR of B relative to the MBR of A.

Using this approach, if the MBR of y is to the west of the MBR of z, and the MBR of x is to the southwest of the MBR of y, then the MBR of x is to the southwest of the MBR of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

I think I'm repeatedly arriving at the same conclusion, so let's stick with it: the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, I'm making things too complicated again. Let me illustrate a counter-example to my original conclusion.

Imagine regions x, y, and z laid out as follows:

```
     ^ N
     |
     |       +---+
     |       | z |
     |       +---+
     |    
     |   +---+
     |   | y |
     |   +---+
     |       
 W---+-------------> E
     |
     |   +----+
     | S | x  |
     |   +----+
```

Here, region x is to the southwest of region y, and region y is to the west of region z. However, region x is directly to the west of region z, not to the southwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be West or Southwest, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this because of the use of "regions" in the question. Let me simplify this by thinking of points (centroids of the regions) for clarity:

- If point x is southwest of point y, it means x is both to the south and to the west of y.
- If point y is west of point z, it means y is to the west of z, with no significant northness or southness.

Now, where is point x relative to point z?

- From x to y, move northeast.
- From y to z, move east.

Combining these: to go from x to z, you need to move northeast and then east. This is a combination of moving north, east, and then more east. Overall, you're moving northwards and eastwards, which means that z is to the northeast of x, or equivalently, x is to the southwest of z.

OK, I'm confused again. Let me try another way.

OK, Suppose z is at (0,0). If y is west of z, then y is at some (-a, 0) for a > 0. 
If x is southwest of y, then x is at some (-a - b, -c) for b,c > 0.

So x is at (-a - b, -c) and z is at (0, 0).

The direction from x to z is given by the vector (a + b, c), which is in the northeast direction. Thus, z is northeast of x, or equivalently, x is southwest of z.

Actually, I think the cleaner approach to solve this problem would be:

1. For cardinal directions, "Southwest" is the opposite of "Northeast", and "West" is the opposite of "East".

2. If x is Southwest of y, then y is Northeast of x.
   If y is West of z, then z is East of y.

3. Now, let's determine the path from x to z:
   x -> y (Northeast) -> z (East)

4. When you go Northeast and then East, where do you end up relative to where you started? Let's think about this on a compass:
   - From x, go Northeast (to y).
   - From y, go East (to z).
   - Overall, you've moved North and East from x to z, which means z is to the Northeast of x, or equivalently, x is to the Southwest of z.

Ah, I think I've been overthinking again. Let me try this:

Place z at the origin (0, 0) for convenience.
If y is to the west of z, then y is at (-a, 0) for some a > 0.
If x is to the southwest of y, then x is at (-a - b, -c) for some b, c > 0.

The vector from z to x is (-(a + b), -c), which is in the southwest direction. So, x is to the southwest of z.

So I'm back to my original answer! I don't see how x can be in a different cardinal direction with respect to z...unless I go back to the bigger region argument.

Let's revisit the big region idea with the minimum bounding rectangles. 

Region x, being to the southwest of region y, means that the MBR of x is positioned below and to the left of the MBR of y. Similarly, region y, being to the west of region z, means that the MBR of y is positioned to the left of the MBR of z.

But what if the MBR of x is very large? Could it encompass a region that would put it in a different cardinal direction with respect to z?

Consider the following diagram:

```
     ^ N
     |
     |               +---+
     |               | z |
     |               +---+
     |    
     |   +---+
     |   | y |
     |   +---+
     |       
 W---+-------------> E
     |
     |   +---------------+
     | S |       x       |
     |   +---------------+
```

In this diagram, the MBR of x is to the southwest of the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is to the west of the MBR of z. But the MBR of x is so large that it's directly to the west of the MBR of z, not to the southwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be West or Southwest, depending on the sizes and positions of the regions.

I'm struggling to find a definitive answer because the cardinal direction relations between regions can be defined in different ways, depending on the specific framework or system you're using.

Let me approach this from the perspective of the cardinal direction calculus, which is a widely used formalism for spatial reasoning with cardinal directions.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the space around a reference region is partitioned into nine tiles (or regions): N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B (which stands for "bounded by" and refers to the reference region itself).

Given two regions, the cardinal direction from one to the other is determined by which tiles the target region occupies.

Using this approach, if region x is to the southwest of region y, it means x occupies the SW tile of y. If region y is to the west of region z, it means y occupies the W tile of z.

Now, what tile does region x occupy with respect to region z?

Wait! OK, I think I was overthinking. Let's place z at the origin and use the definitions of the tiles:

```
     NW | N | NE
    ----|---|----
      W | B | E
    ----|---|----
     SW | S | SE
```

If y is in the W tile of z, and x is in the SW tile of y, then where is x with respect to z?

In the cardinal direction calculus, the W tile of z is everything to the west of z (with the same northness as z). The SW tile of y is everything to the southwest of y.

If x is in the SW tile of y, and y is in the W tile of z, then x is to the west and south of y, which is itself to the west of z. This means x is to the west and south of z, which places it in the SW tile of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

But wait, I think I'm still not considering the full complexity of regions. What if region x is not a point but an area?

Let's revisit the big region idea, but with a slight change. Instead of thinking of the MBR of the regions, let's just consider the regions directly.

I think I've been making this too complicated. Let's simplify this by thinking of the regions directly.

OK I think I'm overthinking this again. Let me go back to my earlier approach: Let's place z at the origin, y is west of z, and x is southwest of y. So y is at (-a, 0) for a > 0, and x is at (-a - b, -c) for b, c > 0. The vector from z to x is (-(a + b), -c), which is in the southwest direction. So, x is to the southwest of z.

Unless there's a specific formalism or definition I'm missing, I think the straightforward answer is that the relation between x and z is Southwest.

But wait, I remembered a case where x might be in a different relation to z.

OK I'm remembering what I think is going on here. Suppose again that z is at the origin and y is west of z at position (−a, 0). Let's consider a few cases, and find what they tell us about the position of x relative to z.

1. If y is at (−a, 0) and x is at (−a − b, −c) for positive a, b, c, then x is at the "usual" southwest position from z, as I've been arguing above. This is because the vector from z to x is (−(a + b), −c), which is in the southwest direction.

2. If y is at (−a, 0) and x is at (−a − b, 0) for positive a, b, then x is west of z. This is because the vector from z to x is (−(a + b), 0), which is in the west direction.

3. If y is at (−a, 0) and x is at (−a − b, c) for positive a, b, c, then x is northwest of z. This is because the vector from z to x is (−(a + b), c), which is in the northwest direction.

Hmm, but how can x be, for example, at (−a − b, c) if it is supposed to be southwest of y? The x would be to the northwest of y. That can't be right...

Oh I see. I made a mistake in my reasoning. If x is southwest of y, then the vector from y to x should be in the southwest direction, not the vector from a fixed origin to x.

Let's start again, without fixing any positions.

Suppose y is at position (p, q) and z is at position (r, s).

If y is west of z, then p < r and q = s.

If x is southwest of y, then the vector from y to x is in the southwest direction. This means that if x is at position (t, u), then t < p and u < q.

Now, we want to determine the relation between x and z, which depends on the vector from z to x.

The vector from z to x is (t - r, u - s).

We know that t < p < r, so t - r < 0. And u < q = s, so u - s < 0.

This means the vector from z to x has both negative x and y components, placing it in the southwest direction. So, x is southwest of z.

OK, I'm back to where I was originally. But let me double-check that I'm not making a mistake.

If y is west of z, then y is directly to the west of z (same latitude, lower longitude). If x is southwest of y, then x is to the southwest of y (lower latitude, lower longitude).

So, if z is at (r, s), then y is at (p, s) where p < r. And if y is at (p, s), then x is at (t, u) where t < p and u < s.

The vector from z to x is (t - r, u - s). Since t < p < r, we have t - r < 0. And since u < s, we have u - s < 0. This means the vector from z to x has negative components in both the x and y directions, placing it in the southwest direction.

So, x is to the southwest of z.

Now, I'm not sure if I missed anything in my reasoning or if there's some particular formalism for cardinal directions I'm unaware of. But based on the standard understanding, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

OK I think I'm overthinking this question.

We have:

- region x is Southwest of region y.
- region y is West of region z.

We want to find the relation between x and z. 

Suppose z is at the origin (0, 0).
If y is West of z, then y is directly to the west of z (same northness), so y's position is (-a, 0) where a > 0.
If x is Southwest of y, then x is to the southwest of y (both more southerly and more westerly), so x's position is (-a - b, -c) where b, c > 0.

The vector from z to x is (-a - b, -c), which is in the Southwest direction.

So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

The argument above assumes that x, y, and z are points, or at least that the cardinal directions between them are defined in terms of their centroids or some other reference point. But is there any reason why the answer would be different if we considered full regions?

I think the notion of "Southwest" is defined by the direction vectors. If region x is Southwest of region y, then the direction vector from y to x is in the southwest direction. Similarly, if region y is West of region z, then the direction vector from z to y is in the west direction.

Combining these, the direction vector from z to x is the vector sum of the direction vector from z to y and the direction vector from y to x. 

The direction vector from z to y is in the west direction.
The direction vector from y to x is in the southwest direction.

The vector sum of a west vector and a southwest vector is a southwest vector.

Therefore, the direction from z to x is Southwest, or equivalently, x is to the Southwest of z.

OK so I'm quite convinced that the answer is Southwest. But let me double check if there's any other possibilities, keeping in mind the original problem statement that regions x, y, and z are not necessarily points.

Actually, I think there is a subtlety here. If regions can have non-zero areas, then the cardinal direction between two regions might not be a single unique direction.

Here's a way to see this. Consider the case where regions y and z have bounding boxes that don't overlap. We know that y is to the west of z, which means that every point in y is to the west of every point in z.

Now, region x is to the southwest of region y. If x is a point, then x is directly to the southwest of y. But if x is a larger region, it could potentially be in multiple cardinal directions with respect to z.

Consider the following diagram:

```
     ^ N
     |
     |  +---+
     |  | z |
     |  +---+
     |    
     |   +---+
     |   | y |
     |   +---+
     |       
 W---+-------------> E
     |
     |   +---------------+
     | S |       x       |
     |   +---------------+
```

If regions x, y, and z are arranged as shown above, then x is to the southwest of y, and y is to the west of z. But from the diagram, x is both to the west and to the southwest of z.

So the relation between x and z could be either West or Southwest.

Actually, I think there are three possible cases.

1. Region x is entirely to the southwest of region z, in which case the relation is "Southwest".
2. Region x is partly to the southwest and partly to the west of region z, in which case the relation is "West" and "Southwest".
3. Region x is entirely to the west of region z, in which case the relation is "West".

Now, the question asks "what could the relation between x and z be?" which suggests we're looking for all possible relations, not just one.

So, the possible relations between x and z are West and Southwest.

Let me draw another diagram to illustrate the third case:

```
     ^ N
     |
     |  +---+
     |  | z |
     |  +---+
     |    
     |   +---+
     |   | y |
     |   +---+
     |       
 W---+-------------> E
     |  +----+
     |  |  x |
     | S+----+
     |   
```

In this diagram, region x is to the southwest of region y, and region y is to the west of region z. But region x is directly to the west of region z, not to the southwest.

OK, I think there might be a third possible relation. If region x is sufficiently large or positioned just right, it could overlap with region z in such a way that x is partly to the northwest of z.

Consider the following diagram:

```
     ^ N
     |
     |       +---+
     |  +----| z |
     |  | x  +---+
     |  |    
     |  |  +---+
     |  +--| y |
     |     +---+
     |       
 W---+-------------> E
     |
     | S
```

In this diagram, region x is to the southwest of region y, and region y is to the west of region z. But region x is positioned such that it's partly to the northwest of region z.

So, the relation between x and z could be Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is a valid arrangement. Let me think...

If region x is to the southwest of region y, it means that x is both to the south and to the west of y. If y is to the west of region z, it means that y is to the west of z (without any significant northness or southness).

Given these constraints, can region x be to the northwest of region z? If x is to the south of y, and y is at approximately the same "northness" as z, then x should be to the south of z as well. This contradicts the notion of x being to the northwest of z.

So, I think the possible relations between x and z are limited to West and Southwest.

Actually no, I'm wrong. Let me construct an example with point representations (centroids) for simplicity.

Suppose y is at (0, 0), z is at (3, 0), and x is at (-1, -1). In this setup, x is southwest of y, and y is west of z. But x is at (-1, -1) and z is at (3, 0). The vector from x to z is (4, 1), which is in the northeast direction. Thus, z is northeast of x, or equivalently, x is southwest of z.

Now let's try to construct an example where x is west of z, despite being southwest of y.

Suppose y is at (0, 0), z is at (3, 0), and x is at (-1, 0). In this setup, x is west of y (but not southwest, which contradicts our premise), and y is west of z. The vector from x to z is (4, 0), which is in the east direction. This doesn't match the cardinal direction we're looking for.

So I can't construct a valid example where x is just west of z if x is southwest of y and y is west of z.

Hmm, but now I think of the bounding box argument. What if regions x, y, and z have significant areas? Could the relationship between x and z be different?

Let's consider the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

In the context of the cardinal direction calculus, the cardinal direction from region A to region B is determined by the position of the MBR of B relative to the MBR of A.

If the MBR of region y is to the west of the MBR of region z, and the MBR of region x is to the southwest of the MBR of region y, then where is the MBR of region x relative to the MBR of region z?

This is where the transitivity of cardinal directions comes into play. If A is to the west of B, and B is to the west of C, then A is to the west of C. Similarly, if A is to the south of B, and B is to the south of C, then A is to the south of C.

By these properties, if x is to the west of y, and y is to the west of z, then x is to the west of z. And if x is to the south of y, and y is (at the same northness as) z, then x is to the south of z.

So, if x is to the southwest of y, and y is to the west of z, then x is both to the west and to the south of z, which means x is to the southwest of z.

I'm going back and forth, but I'm more convinced that the relation between x and z is solely Southwest, not West.

Oh, I just remembered a subtlety in the cardinal direction calculus. The cardinal direction from region A to region B is not just a single direction, but a set of directions corresponding to the tiles of A that B occupies.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the space around region A is partitioned into nine tiles (or regions): N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B (where B stands for "bounded by" and refers to region A itself).

OK I'm overthinking this. Let's just provide a clear answer.

1. Region x is Southwest of region y.
2. Region y is West of region z.

In this context, southwest means more southerly and more westerly and west means more westerly (with the same northness).

If x is more southerly than y, and y has the same northness as z, then x is more southerly than z.
If x is more westerly than y, and y is more westerly than z, then x is more westerly than z.

So, x is both more southerly and more westerly than z, which means x is Southwest of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let me go back to the basics. We need to consider the possible relations between x and z based on the given constraints.

So what if region x is in the southwest region of y, and y is in the west region of z. Is there a scenario where x and z have a relation different from "Southwest"?

Let's try a concrete example where the regions have bounding boxes:

- Region z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- Region y has a bounding box from (-3, 0) to (-1, 2).
- Region x has a bounding box from (-4, -2) to (-2, -1).

With these bounding boxes, region x is to the southwest of region y, and region y is to the west of region z. And region x is to the southwest of region z.

Let's try to find a counterexample where region x is not to the southwest of region z:

- Region z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- Region y has a bounding box from (-3, 0) to (-1, 2).
- Region x has a bounding box from (-4, -1) to (-2, 1).

With these bounding boxes, region x is still to the southwest of region y (because the center of x is southwest of the center of y), and region y is to the west of region z. But now, region x is directly to the west of region z.

So, the relation between x and z could be West or Southwest, depending on the exact shapes and positions of the regions.

OK so far I've been using a region-based approach. But are there other definitions of cardinal directions when regions are involved?

In some spatial reasoning systems, cardinal directions between regions are defined using the direction relation matrix, which is a 3x3 matrix representing the intersection of the regions with the nine cardinal directions.

OK I think I'm overthinking again. I've shown that Southwest is definitely a possible relation, and so is West in some scenarios.

Can x and z have a Northwest relation?

Suppose z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (2, 2), y has a bounding box from (-3, 0) to (-1, 2), and x has a bounding box from (-4, 1) to (-2, 3).

With these bounding boxes, x is to the northwest of y (because the center of x is northwest of the center of y), which contradicts our premise that x is to the southwest of y.

Hmm, but what if x is a larger region? Let's try a different example:

- Region z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- Region y has a bounding box from (-3, 0) to (-1, 2).
- Region x has a bounding box from (-5, -2) to (0, 3).

With these bounding boxes, x intersects with y, so I'm not sure if we can still say x is to the southwest of y. But if we define the cardinal direction based on the center points, then the center of x is to the southwest of the center of y. The center of y is to the west of the center of z. And the center of x is to the southwest of the center of z.

I think I'm overthinking this problem. Let's consider a simple interpretation based on the centroids of the regions.

If the centroid of x is to the southwest of the centroid of y, and the centroid of y is to the west of the centroid of z, then the centroid of x is to the southwest of the centroid of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

OK OK I was overthinking!

Let me look up the cardinal direction calculus for regions and see if there's a standard.

OK the Cardinal Direction Calculus defines the position of region B with respect to region A by relating the direction of the bounding box of B, denoted by MBB(B), to the bounding box of A, denoted by MBB(A). The bounding box of a region is the smallest rectangle (with sides parallel to the coordinate axes) that completely contains the region.

Given two regions A and B, the direction of B with respect to A is described by a subset of the nine cardinal direction relations.

So, the relation between regions is not just a single cardinal direction, but potentially a set of directions.

Given this formalism, let's reconsider our problem:

- Region x is Southwest of region y.
- Region y is West of region z.

Using the Cardinal Direction Calculus, if x is to the southwest of y, it means the bounding box of x is to the southwest of the bounding box of y. If y is to the west of z, it means the bounding box of y is to the west of the bounding box of z.

Now, where is the bounding box of x with respect to the bounding box of z?

Well if the bounding box of x is to the southwest of the bounding box of y, and the bounding box of y is to the west of the bounding box of z, then the bounding box of x is to the southwest of the bounding box of z.

so in the context of the Cardinal Direction Calculus, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Now, what about other formalisms? One alternative is the Rectangle Algebra, which represents each region by its minimum bounding rectangle and describes the relation between two rectangles in terms of Allen's interval relations. But this doesn't alter our conclusion.

Given the constraints, the relation between x and z is most likely Southwest.

Hold on, I was overcomplicating this. The CDC that I mentioned above, when applied to two regions as A and B, gives us a single relation, which is one of the 9 atomic relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B). This is straightforward and doesn't allow for multiple relations.

So, based on the constraints, the relation between x and z in the context of the Cardinal Direction Calculus is Southwest.

OK, so so far I've said the relation is definitely Southwest, and possibly West as well. Let me try again to construct a concrete example where the relation is West:

- Region z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- Region y has a bounding box from (-3, 0) to (-1, 2).
- Region x has a bounding box from (-4, 0) to (-2, 2).

With these bounding boxes, the center of x is to the west of the center of y, not to the southwest. This contradicts our premise that x is to the southwest of y.

Now what if x is a larger region? Let's try a different example:

- Region z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- Region y has a bounding box from (-3, 0) to (-1, 2).
- Region x has a bounding box from (-5, -2) to (-2, 1).

With these bounding boxes, the center of x is to the southwest of the center of y, and the center of y is to the west of the center of z. The center of x is also to the southwest of the center of z.

OK, I can't seem to find a counterexample where the relation is West. Maybe it's only Southwest after all.

OK, I'm going to just convince myself that the answer is Southwest, using yet another approach.

I'm going to use vectors. Let's represent the position of a region by the coordinates of its centroid.

Let's place region z at the origin (0, 0) for convenience.
If region y is west of region z, then the centroid of y is at some point (-a, 0) where a > 0.
If region x is southwest of region y, then the centroid of x is at some point (-a - b, -c) where b, c > 0.

The vector from the centroid of z to the centroid of x is (-a - b, -c), which is in the southwest direction. So, region x is southwest of region z.

Thus, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

I feel like I've been overthinking the question. The standard interpretation of cardinal direction relations in qualitative spatial reasoning suggests that the relation between x and z is Southwest.

But for completeness, let me just do one more check to see if there's another possible relation. I'm aware that in the Cardinal Direction Calculus, the space around a reference region is divided into 9 tiles (or sectors), and a target region can potentially occupy multiple tiles.

In our case:
- If y occupies the W tile of z, and x occupies the SW tile of y, then where can x be with respect to z?

I believe x most likely occupies the SW tile of z, but I wonder if x can also occupy the W tile of z or even the NW tile of z. 

Let's think about this in terms of coordinates. If z is at the origin, then the W tile of z is everything to the west of z and at the same "northness" as z. The SW tile of y is everything to the southwest of y.

If y is in the W tile of z, then y is to the west of z and at the same "northness". If x is in the SW tile of y, then x is to the southwest of y, which means x is both more westerly and more southerly than y.

If x is more westerly than y, and y is more westerly than z, then by transitivity, x is more westerly than z. If x is more southerly than y, and y has the same "northness" as z, then x is more southerly than z.

So, x is both more westerly and more southerly than z, which places it in the SW tile of z.

I believe the relation between x and z is Southwest.

I feel like the the question is asking for the possible relations between x and z, and not just one specific relation. And I've been overthinking it! Haha, let me make a final statement here.

Given the constraints:
- Region x is Southwest of region y.
- Region y is West of region z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest.

In some spatial reasoning systems, the cardinal direction from one region to another can be a set of directions rather than a single direction. But even in those systems, given the constraints, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

I'm pretty confident in this answer, though I've been thinking so hard about this problem that it's possible I've missed something, let's see. Actually I should probably just go for simplicity. In the standard cardinal direction calculus, we are just considering the centroids of the regions. This is a pretty natural interpretation. And going with this interpretation, the answer is easy:

Place z at the origin (0, 0).
If y is west of z, then y is at (-a, 0) for some a > 0.
If x is southwest of y, then x is at (-a - b, -c) for some b, c > 0.
The vector from z to x is (-a - b, -c), which is in the southwest direction.
So, x is southwest of z.

And thus, the answer is: Southwest.

I am just overthinking the problem! Let me just look at this one more time.

Given:
- Region x is Southwest of region y.
- Region y is West of region z.

Asking for possible relations between region x and region z, from the options: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

I'm going to ditch the overthinking. Southwest is definitely true. And ok, if the regions are substantial in size, it's possible that the bounding box of x might overlap with the bounding box of z, or parts of region x might be to the west of region z. So "West" could also be a correct answer, as could "Bounding Box".

Let me double check with a couple of configurations whether "West" is actually possible:

Configuration 1:
- z is at the origin (0, 0)
- y is at (-a, 0) for some a > 0
- x is at (-a - b, -c) for some b, c > 0

Here, the vector from z to x is (-a - b, -c), which is in the southwest direction. So, x is southwest of z.

Configuration 2:
- z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (2, 2)
- y has a bounding box from (-3, 0) to (-1, 2)
- x has a bounding box from (-4, -2) to (-2, 0)

With these bounding boxes, the center of x is to the southwest of the center of y, and the center of y is to the west of the center of z. The center of x is also to the southwest of the center of z.

OK here West isn't working, but let me try another approach, using MBR (minimum bounding rectangle):

Configuration 3:
- z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (2, 2)
- y has a bounding box from (-3, 0) to (-1, 2)
- x has a bounding box from (-4, -0.5) to (-2, 1.5)

In this configuration, the center of x is still to the southwest of the center of y, and the center of y is to the west of the center of z. But region x now has the same "northness" as region z, so the direction from z to x is West, not Southwest.

Wait, that's not right. If the center of x is to the southwest of the center of y, and the center of y is to the west of the center of z, then the center of x is to the southwest of the center of z. So the direction from z to x is still Southwest.

OK OK I'm pretty much convinced that Southwest is the only possible relation. My earlier example works out to be southwest, not west.

Since we're being so precise, one plausible reading of the question is that we're working in one of the well-defined cardinal direction calculi for regions, such as the rectangular cardinal direction relations by Goyal and Egenhofer. In this calculus, a direction between regions is described by listing all the tiles of one region that are occupied by the other region. 

The tiles of a region z are typically labeled as:

```
     NW | N | NE
    ----|---|----
      W | O | E
    ----|---|----
     SW | S | SE
```

where O represents the tile occupied by region z itself.

Given this calculus:
- If region y is West of region z, it means y occupies the W tile of z.
- If region x is Southwest of region y, it means x occupies the SW tile of y.

Then, what tiles of region z does region x occupy?

If y is in the W tile of z, and x is in the SW tile of y, then x is both more westerly and more southerly than y, which is itself more westerly than z and at the same "northness" as z. This places x in the SW tile of z.

So, the relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:
- Region x is Southwest of region y
- Region y is West of region z

When region y is West of region z, it means y is directly to the west of z (with the same northness).
When region x is Southwest of y, it means x is both more westerly and more southerly than y.

By combining these relations:
- Since x is more westerly than y, and y is more westerly than z, then x is more westerly than z.
- Since x is more southerly than y, and y has the same northness as z, then x is more southerly than z.

Therefore, region x is both more westerly and more southerly than region z, which means x is Southwest of z.

The answer is: Southwest
