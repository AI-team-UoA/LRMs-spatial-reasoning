PROMPT: Let  Northwest and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

We have:
- region x is Northwest of region y
- region y is North of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's define what these cardinal direction relations mean in terms of coordinates. If we place a region at the origin, then:
- North means the region is above (higher y-coordinate)
- Northwest means the region is above and to the left (higher y-coordinate, lower x-coordinate)

So, if region x is Northwest of region y, that means x is above and to the left of y.
If region y is North of region z, that means y is above z.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

We know:
- x is above and to the left of y
- y is above z

From these, we can deduce that x is definitely above z (because x is above y, and y is above z). But what about the east-west relationship?

We know x is to the left of y, but we don't know anything about the east-west relationship between y and z. 

Let's consider different cases:

Case 1: If z is directly below y (i.e., y and z have the same x-coordinate), then x would be to the left of z (since x is to the left of y). In this case, x would be Northwest of z (above and to the left).

Case 2: If z is to the right of y, then x would be even more to the left of z. In this case, x would also be Northwest of z.

Case 3: If z is to the left of y, then we need to compare how much to the left z is compared to x. If z is less to the left than x, then x would still be to the left of z, making x Northwest of z. But if z is more to the left than x, then x would be to the right of z, making x Northeast of z.

Actually, let's use a different approach to be more systematic. 

Let's establish a coordinate system where region z is at the origin (0, 0).

Given that region y is North of region z, we can say y is at a position like (0, a) where a > 0.

Given that region x is Northwest of region y, x is at a position (b, c) where b < 0 and c > a.

Now, the relation between x and z (the origin) is determined by the sign of b and c:
- c > 0, which means x is North of z.
- b < 0, which means x is West of z.

The combination of North and West gives us Northwest. So, x is Northwest of z.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let me reconsider.

If region z is at the origin (0, 0), and region y is North of z, then y is at a position like (0, a) where a > 0.

If region x is Northwest of region y, then x is at a position (b, c) where b < 0 relative to y, and c > 0 relative to y.

So, in the absolute coordinate system, x is at (0 + b, a + c) = (b, a + c) where b < 0 and a + c > a (which means c > 0).

Now, the relation between x and z (the origin) is determined by the values of b and a + c:
- a + c > 0, which means x is North of z. This is always true because a > 0 and c > 0.
- b < 0, which means x is West of z.

So, the combination of North and West gives us Northwest. x is Northwest of z.

However, wait. I am thinking that this doesn't fully cover all the possible positions of x, y, and z. Instead of using an absolute coordinate system, let's use a more general representation.

Hmm, the problem is there is a degree of freedom when working with cardinal directions because each region can occupy a range of positions. Let me try to analyze this more carefully.

Let me simplify and think of each region as a point for now.

If region y is North of region z, then y is above z. In terms of coordinates, if z is at (x_z, y_z), then y is at (x_y, y_y) where x_y can be anything, but y_y > y_z.

If region x is Northwest of region y, then x is above and to the left of y. In terms of coordinates, x is at (x_x, y_x) where x_x < x_y and y_x > y_y.

From these, we can determine that:
1. y_x > y_y > y_z, which means x is definitely above z, so x is definitely North of z in that sense.
2. x_x < x_y, but we don't know the relationship between x_y and x_z. There are three cases:
   a. If x_y < x_z, then x_x < x_y < x_z, which means x is to the left of z. In this case, x is Northwest of z.
   b. If x_y = x_z, then x_x < x_y = x_z, which means x is to the left of z. In this case, x is Northwest of z.
   c. If x_y > x_z, then we don't know for sure if x_x is less than or greater than x_z. If x_x < x_z, then x is to the left of z, making x Northwest of z. If x_x > x_z, then x is to the right of z, making x Northeast of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest and Northeast.

Wait, I think I'm still thinking about this wrong. If I'm trying to determine the possible cardinal direction relations, I need to consider the full range of possible positions for the regions, not just specific points.

Actually, let's think about this conceptually. 

If region y is North of region z, that means y is somewhere in the northern half of the plane centered at z.

If region x is Northwest of region y, that means x is somewhere in the northwestern quadrant centered at y.

Now, the question is: Where can x be in relation to z?

Let's imagine region z at the origin, and region y is somewhere along the positive y-axis (since y is North of z). This means y is at a position (0, a) where a > 0.

Given that x is Northwest of y, x is somewhere in the northwestern quadrant from y. The northwestern quadrant from y extends infinitely to the left and up from y.

Now, consider all the possible positions of x given that it is Northwest of y. The worst case for the west component is that x is just slightly to the left of y. In this case, if y is directly North of z, then x could be either Northwest or North of z.

Hmm wait, let me reconsider again. I think I might be overcomplicating things.

If y is North of z, then y is at (x_z, y_z + a) for some a > 0.

If x is Northwest of y, then x is at (x_y - b, y_y + c) for some b, c > 0.

Combining these, x is at (x_z - b, y_z + a + c) for some a, b, c > 0.

Comparing x and z:
- x is to the left of z (since x_x = x_z - b and b > 0).
- x is above z (since y_x = y_z + a + c and a, c > 0).

This gives us that x is Northwest of z.

Actually, let me do yet another visualization to be 100% sure. 

Imagine a 2D coordinate system where the origin is at the bottom left.

1. Place region z at, say, (5, 5).
2. Since y is North of z, y could be at (5, 8) or (5, 10) or any other position with the same x-coordinate but a higher y-coordinate.
3. Since x is Northwest of y, x could be at (3, 10) or (2, 12) or any other position with a lower x-coordinate and higher y-coordinate compared to y.

Let's say y is at (5, 8) and x is at (3, 10). Then, comparing x and z, x is at (3, 10) and z is at (5, 5). This means x is to the left and above z, so x is Northwest of z.

Let's try another example:
1. z at (5, 5).
2. y at (5, 8).
3. x at (4, 9).

Comparing x and z, x is at (4, 9) and z is at (5, 5). This means x is to the left and above z, so x is Northwest of z.

One more example:
1. z at (5, 5).
2. y at (5, 8).
3. x at (2, 9).

Comparing x and z, x is at (2, 9) and z is at (5, 5). This means x is to the left and above z, so x is Northwest of z.

I think I'm convincing myself that the relation between x and z is always Northwest. Let's just double-check with another set of examples where y is not directly North of z.

1. z at (5, 5).
2. y at (7, 8) (y is Northeast of z).
3. x at (5, 10) (x is Northwest of y).

Comparing x and z, x is at (5, 10) and z is at (5, 5). This means x is directly above z, so x is North of z.

This contradicts my earlier conclusion. It seems like the relation between x and z can be either Northwest or North.

Let's try one more:
1. z at (5, 5).
2. y at (3, 8) (y is Northwest of z).
3. x at (1, 10) (x is Northwest of y).

Comparing x and z, x is at (1, 10) and z is at (5, 5). This means x is to the left and above z, so x is Northwest of z.

OK, I think part of my confusion was that I didn't always place y directly North of z. Let me make sure I'm understanding the problem correctly:

- region y is North of region z: This means y is directly above z, not to the northeast or northwest.
- region x is Northwest of region y: This means x is above and to the left of y.

Based on these, let me determine where x can be in relation to z:

If z is at (a, b), then y is at (a, b + c) for some c > 0. This is because y is directly North of z.

If y is at (a, b + c), then x is at (a - d, b + c + e) for some d, e > 0. This is because x is Northwest of y.

Combining these, x is at (a - d, b + c + e) and z is at (a, b). Comparing them:
- x is to the left of z (since a - d < a for d > 0).
- x is above z (since b + c + e > b for c, e > 0).

So, x is Northwest of z. This should be the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints.

Let me double-check this once more.

Actually, I wonder if the regions themselves can introduce some complexity. Cardinal directions are often defined for "simple" regions, like rectangles or circles. If the regions are irregular, then the definitions might not be as straightforward.

However, even with irregular regions, the cardinal direction relations like "North" or "Northwest" should still have a clear meaning based on the centers or bounding boxes of the regions.

So, I'm going to stick with my conclusion: If region x is Northwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Actually hold on, let me reconsider again. I think I have been thinking about this too narrowly.

When we say "region y is North of region z", we don't necessarily mean that y is directly above z. It means y is in the northern half-plane of z.

Similarly, when we say "region x is Northwest of region y", we mean x is in the northwestern quadrant of y.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider:

If y is anywhere in the northern half-plane of z, and x is in the northwestern quadrant of y, then where can x be in relation to z?

This is a bit more complex than I first thought. Let me break it down:

1. The northern half-plane of z extends infinitely to the east and west, but only to the north from z.
2. For each possible position of y in this half-plane, the northwestern quadrant of y is a subset of the plane.
3. The question is: For all possible positions of y and x (given the constraints), what cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z?

Let's think about this geometrically:

- If y is directly North of z, then the northwestern quadrant of y will be to the northwest of z. In this case, x would be Northwest of z.
- If y is to the northeast of z (but still in the northern half-plane), then the northwestern quadrant of y could overlap with the northern or northeastern regions of z. In this case, x could be North or Northeast of z.
- If y is to the northwest of z (but still in the northern half-plane), then the northwestern quadrant of y will be to the northwest of z. In this case, x would be Northwest of z.

I'm starting to think that the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Let me double-check this with a more systematic approach.

Wait, I'm still confusing myself on the definition of "North of". Let me ensure I understand these directions correctly:

- "y is North of z" means that every point in region y has a greater y-coordinate than every point in region z. It does not mean y is directly above z; it just means y is somewhere in the northern half-plane of z.
- "x is Northwest of y" means that every point in region x has a lesser x-coordinate and a greater y-coordinate than every point in region y. It means x is somewhere in the northwestern quadrant of y.

Now, the challenge is to determine, given the above constraints, all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

I think a systematic way to approach this is to consider extreme cases:

1. If y is just slightly to the east of being directly North of z, and x is just slightly to the west of being directly North of y, then x could be almost directly North of z.
2. If y is very far to the east (but still in the northern half-plane of z), and x is just slightly to the west of being directly North of y, then x could be to the northeast of z.
3. If y is just slightly to the west of being directly North of z, and x is very far to the west (but still in the northwestern quadrant of y), then x would be to the northwest of z.

Based on these extreme cases, it seems like the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

But let's double-check this conclusion with a few concrete examples.

Actually, I think I've been conflating two different interpretations of cardinal directions. Let me clarify:

1. **Cone-shaped cardinal directions**: In this interpretation, "North" is a cone-shaped region extending from the reference point, covering a specific range of angles (usually 45 degrees to the left and right of due north). This is often used in informal settings. (Though sometimes the cone angle is 45 degrees in total)
2. **Half-plane cardinal directions**: In this interpretation, "North" is a half-plane, covering everything that is above the horizontal line passing through the reference point. This is more commonly used in GIS and formal reasoning.

Given that the problem involves regions and not just points, I'm inclined to think we're working with the half-plane interpretation. But let me actually check what this would look like in the formalism of the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) with cardinal directions.

Ok, so in the cardinal direction calculus, we have the basic relations: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), and Northwest (NW).

Let's define these formally (using the half-plane interpretation):
- y is North of z if the y-coordinate of every point in y is greater than the y-coordinate of every point in z.
- y is Northeast of z if y is both North of z and East of z.
- y is East of z if the x-coordinate of every point in y is greater than the x-coordinate of every point in z.
... and so on.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z given that x is Northwest of y and y is North of z.

Since y is North of z, every point in y has a greater y-coordinate than every point in z.

Since x is Northwest of y, every point in x has a lesser x-coordinate and a greater y-coordinate than every point in y.

Combining these:
1. Every point in x has a greater y-coordinate than every point in y, which has a greater y-coordinate than every point in z. Therefore, every point in x has a greater y-coordinate than every point in z, which means x is North of z in the y-coordinate sense.
2. Every point in x has a lesser x-coordinate than every point in y. But we don't know the relationship between the x-coordinates of y and z. This means:
   a. If every point in y has a lesser x-coordinate than every point in z, then every point in x has a lesser x-coordinate than every point in z. In this case, x is Northwest of z.
   b. If every point in y has a greater x-coordinate than every point in z, then we can't say for sure whether the x-coordinates of x are greater or lesser than the x-coordinates of z. x could be Northwest, North, or Northeast of z.
   c. If some points in y have lesser x-coordinates than some points in z, and some points in y have greater x-coordinates than some points in z, then we again can't say for sure. x could be Northwest, North, or Northeast of z.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Actually, hmm, I now realize I might be conflating proper "North" for the case when each point in region y has a higher y-coordinate than each point in region z, vs what a bounding box approach might give. Let's revisit the problem and understand exactly what is meant by "North" and "Northwest".

Let's think of these regions as bounding boxes. For two bounding boxes, we might say one is "North" of the other if the bottom edge of the first is above the top edge of the second. Similarly, one is "Northwest" of the other if it's both to the left and above the other.

However, it might also be the case that we're not considering bounding boxes, but rather the whole plane. In this case, "North" could mean the region is in the northern half-plane, and "Northwest" could mean the region is in the northwestern quadrant.

Let's assume we're working with bounding boxes for clarity:

If y is North of z, the bottom edge of y is above the top edge of z.
If x is Northwest of y, the bottom edge of x is above the top edge of y, and the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of y.

From these, we can deduce that the bottom edge of x is definitely above the top edge of z, which means x is above z. But the east-west relationship is less clear. The right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of y, but we don't know the east-west relationship between y and z.

If y is to the west of z, then x is also to the west of z, making x Northwest of z. But if y is to the east of z, then we can't say for sure where x is in relation to z in the east-west direction. x could be Northwest, North, or Northeast of z.

So, again, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Hmm, I think I keep arriving at the same conclusion from multiple approaches, so I'm pretty confident in it. Let's just verify that these cardinal direction relations satisfy the required properties like transitivity.

Actually, wait. I need to clarify whether the cardinal direction relations we are using in this problem follow a conical or a projective model.

In a conical model, the plane is divided into eight cone-shaped regions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) based on the directions from the reference point.

In a projective model, the plane is divided based on the projection of the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of the reference region. This gives us nine basic relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box (which means the target region is inside the MBR of the reference region).

Since the question mentions regions and cardinal directions, I think we're using the projective model. Let's see if this helps clarify.

In the projective model:
- y is North of z if the MBR of y is entirely in the northern projection of the MBR of z.
- x is Northwest of y if the MBR of x is entirely in the northwestern projection of the MBR of y.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

If y is North of z, then the MBR of y is above the MBR of z. The northwestern projection of the MBR of y includes the North and Northwest projections of the MBR of z.

Given that x is Northwest of y, the MBR of x is to the northwest of the MBR of y. This means the MBR of x could be in the North, Northwest, or Northeast projections of the MBR of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Although I think I now keep going back and forth on this, let me make one more attempt at clarity. Let's use a system where we split the plane into 9 tiles around a region: the 8 cardinal directions, plus the Bounding Box (which is the region itself).

Given that y is North of z, y is in the North tile of z.
Given that x is Northwest of y, x is in the Northwest tile of y.

Now, if we superimpose these tiles, we need to determine where the Northwest tile of y overlaps with the tiles of z.

If y is in the North tile of z, then the Northwest tile of y overlaps with the North, Northwest, and (potentially) Northeast tiles of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Actually, wait, I think I'm getting too caught up in the formalisms and losing sight of the basic geometric intuition. Let me go back to a simple example to see if I can gain clarity.

Let's imagine a 2D coordinate system where the origin is at the bottom left.

1. Place region z at, say, (5, 5) with a width and height of 1. So, z occupies the square from (5, 5) to (6, 6).
2. Since y is North of z, y could be at (5, 7) with a width and height of 1. So, y occupies the square from (5, 7) to (6, 8).
3. Since x is Northwest of y, x could be at (3, 9) with a width and height of 1. So, x occupies the square from (3, 9) to (4, 10).

Let's determine the relation between x and z. If we draw a line from z to x, it goes in the northwestern direction. So, x is Northwest of z.

Let's try another example:
1. z at (5, 5) with a width and height of 1.
2. y at (7, 7) with a width and height of 1. Note that y is not directly North of z, but is Northeast of z.
3. x at (5, 9) with a width and height of 1. Note that x is Northwest of y.

Now, if we draw a line from z to x, it goes in the northern direction. So, x is North of z.

Let's try one more:
1. z at (5, 5) with a width and height of 1.
2. y at (9, 7) with a width and height of 1. Note that y is quite far to the East of z, but is still North of z.
3. x at (7, 9) with a width and height of 1. Note that x is Northwest of y.

Now, if we draw a line from z to x, it goes in the northeastern direction. So, x is Northeast of z.

Based on these examples, it seems like the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Actually, maybe part of the issue is I keep focusing on where the regions are centered, not the actual constraints on the regions themselves.  If we're using cardinal directions with rectangular regions, the most common approach is to use the 9-intersection model, where the plane is divided into 9 tiles around a region: the 8 cardinal directions, plus the Bounding Box (which is the region itself).

Using this model:
- y is North of z if y is entirely in the northern tile of z.
- x is Northwest of y if x is entirely in the northwestern tile of y.

The northern tile of z extends infinitely to the north, and is bounded to the east and west by the extent of z. The northwestern tile of y extends infinitely to the north and west, and is bounded to the south and east by the extent of y.

Let's try to understand where the northwestern tile of y overlaps with the tiles of z.

Given that y is North of z, the northwestern tile of y must overlap with the northern tile of z, and the northwestern tile of z. Depending on the precise placement of y within the northern tile of z, the northwestern tile of y may also overlap with the northeastern tile of z.

This means that x, which is in the northwestern tile of y, could potentially be in the North, Northwest, or Northeast tiles of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Actually, I need to take a step back and look at the most basic facts about cardinal directions. I think I've been overthinking this, which is causing me to be overly cautious.

In a 2D Cartesian space:
- North corresponds to the positive y-axis.
- East corresponds to the positive x-axis.
- South corresponds to the negative y-axis.
- West corresponds to the negative x-axis.
- Northwest corresponds to the direction between North and West, which is diagonally to the top-left.
- And so on for the other intercardinal directions.

Let's now reason about the problem more systematically.

If y is North of z, then y is somewhere in the northern half-plane of z. This means the y-coordinate of (the center of) y is greater than the y-coordinate of (the center of) z. Let's say y_y > y_z.

If x is Northwest of y, then x is in the northwestern quadrant of y. This means the x-coordinate of (the center of) x is less than the x-coordinate of (the center of) y, and the y-coordinate of (the center of) x is greater than the y-coordinate of (the center of) y. Let's say x_x < x_y and y_x > y_y.

Combining these:
- y_x > y_y > y_z, which means y_x > y_z. This implies that x is in the northern half-plane of z. So, x is either North, Northwest, or Northeast of z.
- x_x < x_y, but we don't know the relation between x_y and x_z. There are three possibilities:
  1. x_y < x_z, which means x_x < x_y < x_z. This implies that x is in the western half-plane of z. So, x could be Northwest of z.
  2. x_y = x_z, which means x_x < x_y = x_z. This also implies that x is in the western half-plane of z. So, x could be Northwest of z.
  3. x_y > x_z, which means we don't know for sure if x_x is less than or greater than x_z. If x_x < x_z, then x is in the western half-plane of z, making x Northwest of z. If x_x = x_z, then x is directly North of z. If x_x > x_z, then x is in the eastern half-plane of z, making x Northeast of z.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Alright, I think I've been consistent in my conclusion from multiple approaches. Let's summarize:

If region x is Northwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Let's double-check this one more time with a simple diagram:

```
   x       
    \      
     \     
      y    
       \   
        \  
         z 
```

In this diagram, y is North of z, and x is Northwest of y. If we draw a line from z to x, it goes in the northwestern direction. So, x is Northwest of z.

```
      x    
      |    
      |    
      y    
       \   
        \  
         z 
```

In this diagram, y is North of z, and x is North of y. If we draw a line from z to x, it goes in the northern direction. So, x is North of z.

```
         x 
        /  
       /   
      y    
       \   
        \  
         z 
```

In this diagram, y is North of z, and x is Northeast of y. If we draw a line from z to x, it goes in the northern direction. So, x is North of z.

But I think I made a mistake in my third diagram. Let me redraw:

```
         x 
        /  
       /   
      y    
       \   
        \  
         z 
```

In this diagram, y is North of z, and x is Northeast of y. If we draw a line from z to x, it doesn't necessarily go in the northeastern direction. It depends on the exact position of x relative to z. x could be Northwest, North, or Northeast of z.

Let me make it clear with another diagram where x is Northeast of z:

```
             x 
            /  
           /   
          y    
         /    
        /     
       z      
```

In this diagram, y is North of z, and x is Northeast of y. If we draw a line from z to x, it goes in the northeastern direction. So, x is Northeast of z.

I think these diagrams help illustrate that the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Let's restate this one last time:

Given that:
- region x is Northwest of region y
- region y is North of region z

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast
