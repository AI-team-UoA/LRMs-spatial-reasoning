PROMPT: Let  South and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's denote the cardinal direction relations as S (South), W (West), N (North), E (East), NE (Northeast), NW (Northwest), SE (Southeast), SW (Southwest), and BB (Bounding Box).

We are given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is W of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's think about the positions in a 2D space. 

If y is W of z, then y is to the left of z on a map.
If x is S of y, then x is below y on a map.

So, x is below y, and y is to the left of z. 

Let's visualize this:
```
    z
    |
    |
y---
|
|
x
```

In this visualization, if we draw a straight line from x to z, it would go diagonally up and to the right from x. This is the direction of Northeast (NE) from x to z. So one possible relation is that x is SW of z, or equivalently, z is NE of x.

However, this is not the only possibility. Depending on the exact positions and shapes of the regions, the relationship could be different.

For example, if the regions are configured as follows:
```
      z
      |
      |
y-----
|
|
x
```

Then x might be considered S of z, and z would be N of x.

Or, if the regions are configured as follows:
```
        z
        |
        |
y-------
|
|
x
```

Then x might be considered SW of z, and z would be NE of x.

Or, if the regions are configured as follows:
```
z
|
|
y---
|
|
x
```

Then x might be considered SE of z, and z would be NW of x.

Let me think more carefully about the constraints and the possible relative positions.

If x is S of y, then x must be directly below y, or at least have some part directly below y.
If y is W of z, then y must be directly to the left of z, or at least have some part directly to the left of z.

Given these constraints, x cannot be N of z, because x is S of y, and y is not S of z.
Similarly, x cannot be E of z, because y is W of z, and x is not E of y.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be S, SE, SW, BB. Let me verify each:

S: If y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, then x could be S of z.
SE: If y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, then x could be SE of z.
SW: If y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, then x could be SW of z.
BB: If y is W of z, and x is S of y, then x could be BB (Bounding Box) of z.

Let's check if there are any other possibilities:

NE: This is not possible because x would need to be N and E of z, but x is S of y, and y is W of z.
NW: This is not possible because x would need to be N and W of z, but x is S of y, and y is W of z.
W: This is possible. If y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, then x could be W of z.

Actually, let me visualize the possible configurations again to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Scenario 1: y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y.
```
   z
   |
   |
y--
|
|
x
```
In this case, x is SW of z.

Scenario 2: y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, but x extends eastward so that it's directly S of z.
```
   z
   |
   |
y--
|
|
x--
```
In this case, x is S of z.

Scenario 3: y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, but x is also W of y.
```
   z
   |
   |
y--
|
|
x
|
--
```
In this case, x is SW of z.

Scenario 4: y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, but both x and z extend westward.
```
z--
|
|
y--
|
|
x--
```
In this case, x is S of z.

Scenario 5: y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, but x extends eastward beyond z.
```
   z
   |
   |
y--
|
|
x----
```
In this case, x is SE of z.

Based on these scenarios, it seems like the possible relations between x and z can be S, SE, SW.

Actually, let me reconsider the meaning of the cardinal direction relations. In the context of regions, these relations are defined based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of each region. Let's see how this affects our analysis.

The cardinal direction relations are defined as follows:

N: The northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y, and the projections of x and y onto the East-West axis overlap.
S: The southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y, and the projections of x and y onto the East-West axis overlap.
E: The easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y, and the projections of x and y onto the North-South axis overlap.
W: The westernmost point of x is east of the easternmost point of y, and the projections of x and y onto the North-South axis overlap.
NE: The northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y, and the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y.
NW: The northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y, and the westernmost point of x is east of the easternmost point of y.
SE: The southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y, and the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y.
SW: The southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y, and the westernmost point of x is east of the easternmost point of y.
BB: The bounding box of x contains the bounding box of y.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake in my previous definitions. Let me redefine the cardinal direction relations based on the relative positions of the MBRs:

N: The MBR of x is entirely north of the MBR of y, i.e., the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y.
S: The MBR of x is entirely south of the MBR of y, i.e., the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y.
E: The MBR of x is entirely east of the MBR of y, i.e., the westernmost point of x is east of the easternmost point of y.
W: The MBR of x is entirely west of the MBR of y, i.e., the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y.
NE: The MBR of x is both north and east of the MBR of y.
NW: The MBR of x is both north and west of the MBR of y.
SE: The MBR of x is both south and east of the MBR of y.
SW: The MBR of x is both south and west of the MBR of y.
BB: None of the above, i.e., the MBRs of x and y overlap.

No, this isn't quite right either. Let me try to be clearer. These definitions are about projection. If we project the regions onto the North-South axis and the East-West axis, we get constraints on the relative positions.

Here's a clearer definition:

N: The projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely north of the projection of y, and the projections of x and y onto the East-West axis overlap.
S: The projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely south of the projection of y, and the projections of x and y onto the East-West axis overlap.
E: The projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely east of the projection of y, and the projections of x and y onto the North-South axis overlap.
W: The projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of y, and the projections of x and y onto the North-South axis overlap.
NE: The projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely north of the projection of y, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely east of the projection of y.
NW: The projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely north of the projection of y, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of y.
SE: The projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely south of the projection of y, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely east of the projection of y.
SW: The projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely south of the projection of y, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of y.
BB: None of the above, i.e., the projections of x and y overlap on both axes.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. In the context of the problem, I think the definitions are simpler.

Let's go back to the problem:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is W of region z

According to the problem statement, x is S of y, which means x is directly south of y in the cardinal direction sense. Similarly, y is W of z, which means y is directly west of z.

Given these constraints, let's see what are the possible relationships between x and z.

If x is directly S of y, and y is directly W of z, then x is in the SW direction from z, or equivalently, z is in the NE direction from x. 

However, this assumes that regions x, y, and z are perfect points, which they might not be. They could be regions with some area. So let's consider the more general case.

If x is S of y, it means the entire region x is south of the entire region y. Similarly, if y is W of z, it means the entire region y is west of the entire region z.

Given these, x could be S of z, SW of z, or SE of z, or possibly BB, depending on the exact shapes and positions of the regions. Actually, x can't really be SE of z because x is S of y and y is W of z, so x is south and west of z. So the only possibilities are S, SW, or BB.

Actually, BB (Bounding Box) relation means the regions overlap or one contains the other. Given that x is S of y and y is W of z, it's not possible for x and z to overlap or for one to contain the other. So BB is not a possibility.

Actually, let me look at the South (S) relation more carefully. For x to be S of z, the projection of x onto the East-West axis must overlap with the projection of z. But since y is W of z, and x is S of y, the projections of x and z onto the East-West axis might not overlap. It depends on the exact shapes and positions.

Let me consider some specific cases:

Case 1: If y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, and all regions are points, then x is SW of z.

Case 2: If y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, but x is wide enough that it extends eastward to be directly S of z, then x is S of z.

Case 3: If y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, but x is not wide enough to be directly S of z, then x is SW of z.

Case 4: If y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, but x extends eastward beyond z, then x is partly S of z and partly SE of z. In this case, we would say that x is SE of z.

Case 5: If y is directly W of z, and x is directly S of y, but z extends westward to be directly N of x, then x is S of z.

Wait, I think there's a mistake in my analysis. S of and W of are basic cardinal directions, not direction relations between regions. The direction relation between regions is a more complex concept.

In the case of cardinal direction relations between regions, we consider the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of each region. The MBR is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given two regions, we extend the sides of the MBR of one region to divide the plane into nine parts: the central part (which is the MBR itself), and eight parts corresponding to the eight cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

A region is said to be in a particular cardinal direction of another region if it lies entirely in the corresponding part of the partition.

So, if region x is S of region y, it means that x lies entirely in the S part of the partition of the plane by the MBR of y. Similarly, if region y is W of region z, it means that y lies entirely in the W part of the partition of the plane by the MBR of z.

Given these, let's see what are the possible relationships between x and z.

If x is entirely in the S part of the partition by the MBR of y, and y is entirely in the W part of the partition by the MBR of z, then x could be in the S, SW, or SE part of the partition by the MBR of z, depending on the exact positions.

Let me visualize this:

```
   +---+
   | z |
   +---+
+---+
| y |
+---+
   +---+
   | x |
   +---+
```

In this case, x is SW of z.

```
   +---+
   | z |
   +---+
+---+
| y |
+---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this case, x is SW of z.

```
   +---+
   | z |
   +---+
+-------+
|   y   |
+-------+
   +---+
   | x |
   +---+
```

In this case, x is S of z.

```
   +---+
   | z |
   +---+
+---+
| y |
+---+
      +---+
      | x |
      +---+
```

In this case, x is SE of z.

```
   +-------+
   |   z   |
   +-------+
+---+
| y |
+---+
   +---+
   | x |
   +---+
```

In this case, x is S of z.

So, based on these examples, it seems like the possible relations between x and z can be S, SE, SW.

Actually, let me consider one more case:

```
       +---+
       | z |
       +---+
+---+
| y |
+---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this case, x is SW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S, SE, SW.

Wait, I think there might be one more case to consider:

```
+-------+
|   z   |
+-------+
+---+
| y |
+---+
      +---+
      | x |
      +---+
```

In this case, x is actually not in any of the cardinal directions from z. If we extend the sides of the MBR of z, x doesn't fall entirely in any of the eight parts of the partition. This would be the "Bounding Box" (BB) case, which means the MBRs of x and z overlap, or one contains the other. But this doesn't seem possible given the constraints of the problem.

Given that x is S of y, and y is W of z, it doesn't seem possible for x to be in a BB relation with z.

The possible relations between x and z are S, SE, SW.

Actually, let me re-check the possibility of W:

```
+---+
| z |
+---+
+---+
| y |
+---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this case, x is SW of z, not W of z. For x to be W of z, it would need to be entirely in the W part of the partition by the MBR of z, which means it would need to be at the same "height" as z, not below it. But since x is S of y, and y is already W of z, x can't be W of z.

Similarly, let me check the possibility of BB:

```
+---+
| z |
+---+
   +---+
   | y |
   +---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this case, x is BB with z because their projections onto both the North-South and East-West axes overlap. But this doesn't satisfy the constraint that y is W of z, because y is SE of z in this diagram.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S, SE, SW.

Wait a minute. I just realized that I've been thinking about this wrong. The problem is asking about the relationship from x to z, not from y to z.

For cardinal direction relations, if region x is S of region y, it means the entire region x is south of the entire region y. Similarly, if region y is W of region z, it means the entire region y is west of the entire region z.

Given that x is S of y, and y is W of z, the possible relationships between x and z can be:

1. SW: This is possible if x is directly SW of z.
2. S: This is possible if x is directly S of z.
3. SE: This is possible if x is directly SE of z.
4. W: This is possible if x is directly W of z.
5. BB: This is possible if x and z overlap or one contains the other.

Actually, let me be more careful about this. I'll analyze the possibilities based on the projections onto the North-South and East-West axes.

If x is S of y, it means the projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely south of the projection of y. Similarly, if y is W of z, it means the projection of y onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of z.

Now, for the relationship between x and z:

1. For x to be N of z, the projection of x onto the North-South axis must be entirely north of the projection of z. But since x is S of y, and y is not necessarily N of z, this might not be true. So, x cannot be N of z.

2. For x to be S of z, the projection of x onto the North-South axis must be entirely south of the projection of z. Since x is S of y, and y is not necessarily S of z, this is possible. So, x can be S of z.

3. For x to be E of z, the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely east of the projection of z. Since y is W of z, and x is not necessarily E of y, this is possible. So, x can be E of z.

4. For x to be W of z, the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely west of the projection of z. Since y is W of z, and x is not necessarily W of y, this might not be true. But, if x is W of y, or if the projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of y, then x can be W of z. So, x can be W of z.

5. For x to be NE of z, the projection of x onto the North-South axis must be entirely north of the projection of z, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely east of the projection of z. As discussed, x cannot be N of z, so x cannot be NE of z.

6. For x to be NW of z, the projection of x onto the North-South axis must be entirely north of the projection of z, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely west of the projection of z. As discussed, x cannot be N of z, so x cannot be NW of z.

7. For x to be SE of z, the projection of x onto the North-South axis must be entirely south of the projection of z, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely east of the projection of z. As discussed, x can be S of z and x can be E of z, so x can be SE of z.

8. For x to be SW of z, the projection of x onto the North-South axis must be entirely south of the projection of z, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely west of the projection of z. As discussed, x can be S of z and x can be W of z, so x can be SW of z.

9. For x to be BB with z, the projections of x and z must overlap on both the North-South and East-West axes. This means neither x is entirely north or south of z, nor is x entirely east or west of z. This doesn't seem consistent with the constraints that x is S of y and y is W of z. So, x cannot be BB with z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S, W, SE, SW.

Actually, let me double-check the possibility of the bounding box (BB) relation.

For x to be BB with z, the projections of x and z must overlap on both the North-South and East-West axes. Given that x is S of y, the projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely south of the projection of y. And given that y is W of z, the projection of y onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of z.

Now, for the projections of x and z to overlap on the North-South axis, x cannot be entirely south of z, which means z must extend southward beyond y. But given that y is W of z, and x is S of y, it seems unlikely that the projections of x and z could overlap on the North-South axis. So, it's probably safe to say that x cannot be BB with z.

Actually, wait a minute. What I just said isn't rigorous enough. Let me try to be more precise.

The projection of x onto the East-West axis can overlap with the projection of z, which makes the "South" direction possible.

Let me try to reason through the South direction again. For x to be South of z, the entire region x must be south of the entire region z, and the projections of x and z onto the East-West axis must overlap.

Given that x is S of y, the entire region x is south of the entire region y.
Given that y is W of z, the entire region y is west of the entire region z.

So, the region x is south and potentially west (or partially west) of the region z. If the projections of x and z onto the East-West axis overlap, then x is S of z. If the projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of z, then x is SW of z. If the projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely east of the projection of z, then x is SE of z.

However, because y is W of z and x is S of y, it doesn't seem possible for the projection of x onto the East-West axis to be entirely east of the projection of z, because y isn't east of z. So, x cannot be SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S and SW.

Hmm, I just realized that I assumed that y is directly W of z, which might not be the case. It's possible that y is NW or SW of z, which would mean y is both W of z and either N or S of z.

Let me re-analyze the problem without making this assumption.

Given that x is S of y, and y is W of z, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

For x to be S of z, the projection of x onto the North-South axis must be entirely south of the projection of z, and the projections of x and z onto the East-West axis must overlap. Since x is S of y, the projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely south of the projection of y. Whether the projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely south of the projection of z depends on the relationship between y and z in the North-South direction, which we don't know. So, x might be S of z.

For x to be W of z, the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely west of the projection of z, and the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis must overlap. Since y is W of z, the projection of y onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of z. Whether the projection of x onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of z depends on the relationship between x and y in the East-West direction, which we don't know. So, x might be W of z.

For x to be SW of z, the projection of x onto the North-South axis must be entirely south of the projection of z, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely west of the projection of z. As discussed, whether these conditions are met depends on the relationships between x, y, and z in the North-South and East-West directions, which we don't know. So, x might be SW of z.

For x to be SE of z, the projection of x onto the North-South axis must be entirely south of the projection of z, and the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely east of the projection of z. Since y is W of z, the projection of y onto the East-West axis is entirely west of the projection of z. For the projection of x onto the East-West axis to be entirely east of the projection of z, the projection of x onto the East-West axis must be entirely east of the projection of y. But since x is S of y, the relationship between x and y in the East-West direction is undefined. So, x might be SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S, W, SW, SE.

Actually, I just realized that I've been overcomplicating this problem. Let me simplify.

Given that:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is W of region z

The problem is asking for the possible relations between region x and region z.

Using a coordinate-based approach, let's consider a simple case where all regions are points:
- If y is at (0, 0), then z is somewhere to the east of y, say at (1, 0).
- Since x is south of y, x is somewhere below y, say at (0, -1).

This would place x at (0, -1), y at (0, 0), and z at (1, 0). In this arrangement, x is southwest of z.

But of course, these regions can be shapes rather than points, and their relative positions can vary within the constraints. 

If y is W of z, then the entire region y is west of the entire region z. Similarly, if x is S of y, then the entire region x is south of the entire region y.

Given these constraints, x can be:
- SW of z (as in the simple point case above)
- S of z (if x extends eastward so that it's directly south of z)
- W of z (if x extends northward so that it's directly west of z)

x cannot be:
- N of z (because x is S of y, and y is not necessarily N of z)
- E of z (because y is W of z, and x is not necessarily E of y)
- NE of z (because x can't be both N and E of z)
- NW of z (because x can't be N of z)

SE is a bit tricky. In the coordinate-based approach, for x to be SE of z, x would need to be both south and east of z. Given that y is W of z, and x is S of y, it would require x to be east of both y and z, which is not guaranteed by the constraints.

BB is also tricky. For x to be BB with z, the regions would need to overlap or one would contain the other. Given the constraints, it's not immediately clear if this is possible.

OK, let me think about this using a grid. We can map the 2D space to a 3x3 grid in relation to region z:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | z | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Given that y is W of z, region y is somewhere in the W column:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 y | z | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Now, given that x is S of y, region x is somewhere below y, which can be in the SW or S cells:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 y | z | E
---+---+---
 x | ? | SE
```

If x is strictly in the SW cell, then x is SW of z. If x is strictly in the S cell, then x is S of z. And if x spans both the SW and S cells, then x is still considered SW of z, because the entire region x is still west of the entire region z.

But wait, that's not right. If x spans both the SW and S cells, then the entire region x is not west of the entire region z, so the W relation doesn't hold. Instead, we would say that x is S of z, because the projection of x onto the North-South axis is entirely south of the projection of z, and the projections of x and z onto the East-West axis overlap.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be S and SW.

Actually, I think I need to be more precise about what it means for a region to be S, W, or any other cardinal direction of another region. Let me clarify.

The cardinal direction relations between regions are based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of each region. The MBR is the smallest rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes that contains the entire region.

For a region x to be in a cardinal direction (e.g., S) of another region y, the following must be true:
- For the S relation, the northernmost point of x must be south of the southernmost point of y.
- For the W relation, the easternmost point of x must be west of the westernmost point of y.
- And so on for the other cardinal directions.

For the SE relation, x must be both S and E of z. For x to be E of z, the westernmost point of x must be east of the easternmost point of z. But given that y is W of z, and x is S of y, x is more likely to be southwest of z, not southeast.

Let me try again with a clear understanding of the cardinal direction relations.

Given that:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is W of region z

This means:
- The northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y.
- The easternmost point of y is west of the westernmost point of z.

For x to be S of z, the northernmost point of x must be south of the southernmost point of z. This is possible, especially if y is SW of z (because then y is both S and W of z, and x is further south than y).

For x to be W of z, the easternmost point of x must be west of the westernmost point of z. This is also possible, especially if x is W of y (because then x is further west than y, which is already W of z).

For x to be SW of z, x must be both S and W of z. As discussed, both of these are possible.

For x to be SE of z, x must be both S and E of z. For x to be E of z, the westernmost point of x must be east of the easternmost point of z. Given that y is W of z, and x is S of y, this might not be consistent with the constraints. But it's not impossible. It would require x to be SE of y, and the easternmost point of x to be east of the easternmost point of z. While not explicitly forbidden by the constraints, it would be an unusual arrangement.

Alright, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me use a different approach to validate my reasoning.

Using the composition table for cardinal direction relations, we can determine the possible relations between x and z based on the given relations between x and y, and y and z.

According to the composition table for cardinal direction relations, if x is S of y, and y is W of z, then the possible relations between x and z can be S, SW, and W.

Actually, I'm not certain about the composition table for cardinal direction relations. Let me reason through this without relying on a memorized table.

If x is S of y, then x is below y on a map.
If y is W of z, then y is to the left of z on a map.

So, x is below y, and y is to the left of z. This places x below and to the left of z, which is the SW direction. But depending on the exact positions and shapes of the regions, the relationship could be different.

For instance, if the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, but the projections of x and z onto the East-West axis overlap, then x is S of z.

Similarly, if the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z, but the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis overlap, then x is W of z.

And if both conditions are met (the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, and the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z), then x is SW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be S, W, and SW.

Actually, let me think about why SE might be a possibility:

```
    z
    |
    |
y---
|
|
    x
```

In this diagram, x is SE of z. But this would mean that x is E of y, which is not implied by the constraint that x is S of y. So, it's not clear if this arrangement is consistent with the constraints.

I'm thinking SE is not a possibility. Let me review the possibilities once more:

S: x is directly south of z. This is possible if the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, and the projections of x and z onto the East-West axis overlap.

W: x is directly west of z. This is possible if the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z, and the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis overlap.

SW: x is southwest of z. This is possible if the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, and the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z.

SE: x is southeast of z. For this to be true, the northernmost point of x would need to be south of the southernmost point of z, and the westernmost point of x would need to be east of the easternmost point of z. Given that y is W of z, and x is S of y, this arrangement doesn't seem consistent with the constraints.

BB: x and z overlap or one contains the other. This doesn't seem consistent with the constraints either.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S, W, and SW.

But let me double-check on SE once more.

If x is S of y, then the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y. This doesn't specify the east-west relationship between x and y. Similarly, if y is W of z, then the easternmost point of y is west of the westernmost point of z. This doesn't specify the north-south relationship between y and z.

So, it's possible that y is SW of z (both S and W of z), and x is SE of y (both S and E of y). In this arrangement, x could be SE of z (both S and E of z). Let me verify with a diagram:

```
    z
    |
    |
y---
|
|
    x
```

In this diagram, y is SW of z, x is SE of y, and x is SE of z. This arrangement is consistent with the constraints (x is S of y, and y is W of z).

Actually, I see a limitation in this diagram because it uses a single character to represent a region, which makes it a point rather than a region with some area. Let me try a more explicit representation:

```
   +---+
   | z |
   +---+
+---+
| y |
+---+
     +---+
     | x |
     +---+
```

In this diagram, y is clearly W of z, and x is clearly S of y. And in this arrangement, x is SE of z.

So, SE is a possibility too.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S, W, SW, and SE.

Actually, I'm not certain about the W relation. Let me verify it:

```
+---+
| z |
+---+
+---+
| y |
+---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this diagram, y is W of z, and x is S of y. But in this arrangement, x is SW of z, not W of z, because the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, and the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z.

For x to be W of z, the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis would need to overlap. But given that x is S of y, and y is not necessarily overlapping with z in the North-South axis, it's not clear if x can be W of z.

On second thought, it is possible for x to be W of z, if y is SW of z and x is NW of y (which would still make x S of y). Let me verify with a diagram:

```
+---+
| z |
+---+
+---+
| y |
+---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

This doesn't quite work. If y is SW of z, and x is NW of y, then x would be W of z. But for x to be S of y, the northernmost point of x would need to be south of the southernmost point of y, which isn't the case in this arrangement.

Let me try a different approach:

```
   +---+
   | z |
   +---+
+---+
| y |
+---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this diagram, y is W of z, x is S of y, and x is SW of z. But for x to be W of z, the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis would need to overlap, which isn't the case here.

Actually, let me try again:

```
   +-----+
   |  z  |
   +-----+
+---+
| y |
+---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

In this diagram, y is W of z, x is S of y, and the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis might overlap, making x W of z. But this would only be the case if the region z extends far enough south.

So, it's possible for x to be W of z, but it depends on the exact shapes and positions of the regions.

Given all the analysis, I believe the possible relations between x and z are S, W, SW, and SE. But I'm not entirely certain about the W relation.

Actually, S should definitely be a possibility. Let me see if I can give a clear example of x being S of z:

```
+-----+
|  z  |
+-----+
+-----+
|  y  |
+-----+
+-----+
|  x  |
+-----+
```

In this diagram, y is W of z, x is S of y, and x is S of z. This is a valid configuration. But oops, y is not W of z. It's south of z.

Let me try again:

```
    +-----+
    |  z  |
    +-----+
+-----+
|  y  |
+-----+
    +-----+
    |  x  |
    +-----+
```

In this diagram, y is W of z, x is S of y, and x is S of z. This is a valid configuration.

So, S is definitely a possibility.

Let me check SW too:

```
    +-----+
    |  z  |
    +-----+
+-----+
|  y  |
+-----+
+-----+
|  x  |
+-----+
```

In this diagram, y is W of z, x is S of y, and x is SW of z. This is a valid configuration.

So, SW is definitely a possibility.

Let me check SE too:

```
    +-----+
    |  z  |
    +-----+
+-----+
|  y  |
+-----+
        +-----+
        |  x  |
        +-----+
```

In this diagram, y is W of z, x is S of y, and x is SE of z. This is a valid configuration.

So, SE is definitely a possibility.

Let me check W:

```
    +-----+
    |  z  |
    +-----+
+-----+
|  y  |
+-----+
```

Hmm, it's difficult to place x in a way that it's S of y and W of z. Let me try a different approach:

```
    +-----+
    |  z  |
    +-----+
+-----+
|  y  |
+-----+
+-----+
|  x  |
+-----+
```

In this diagram, y is W of z, x is S of y, but x is SW of z, not W of z.

I'm not sure if W is a possibility. Let me think about it more carefully.

For x to be W of z, the easternmost point of x must be west of the westernmost point of z, and the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis must overlap. Given that y is W of z, the easternmost point of y is west of the westernmost point of z.

If x is S of y, then the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y. This constrains the placement of x in the North-South axis, but not in the East-West axis.

So, it's conceivable that x could be W of z, if x is positioned such that its easternmost point is still west of the westernmost point of z, and its projection onto the North-South axis overlaps with the projection of z.

But it's hard for me to visualize a specific configuration where this would be the case, given the constraints that x is S of y and y is W of z.

Let me make one more attempt with a more detailed diagram:

```
       +-----+
       |  z  |
       +-----+
+-----+
|  y  |
+-----+
  +------+
  |  x   |
  +------+
```

I'm trying to position x so that it's S of y and W of z. But as I draw it, x seems to be SW of z, not strictly W of z, because the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z.

I'm starting to doubt that W is a possibility. Let me reconsider.

For x to be W of z, the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis must overlap. Given that x is S of y, the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y. For the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis to overlap, the projection of z onto the North-South axis must extend far enough south to overlap with the projection of x.

But if y is W of z, then the easternmost point of y is west of the westernmost point of z. This places z to the east of y, not necessarily south of it. So, it's not guaranteed that the projection of z onto the North-South axis will extend far enough south to overlap with the projection of x.

So, I'm not convinced that W is a possibility.

Based on all the analysis, I believe the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE.

Actually, let me double-check W one more time with a visual:

```
       +-----+
       |     |
       |  z  |
       |     |
       +-----+
+-----+
|     |
|  y  |
|     |
+-----+
  +------+
  |      |
  |  x   |
  |      |
  +------+
```

In this diagram, y is W of z, x is S of y, and I'm trying to position x so that it's W of z. But for x to be W of z, the projections of x and z onto the North-South axis must overlap. In this diagram, they don't seem to.

Let me try another configuration:

```
       +------------+
       |            |
       |     z      |
       |            |
       +------------+
+-----+
|     |
|  y  |
|     |
+-----+
  +------+
  |      |
  |  x   |
  |      |
  +------+
```

In this diagram, z is much larger, and its projection onto the North-South axis might overlap with the projection of x. If that's the case, then x would be W of z.

So, it is possible for x to be W of z, but it depends on the specific shapes and positions of the regions.

Based on all the analysis, I believe the possible relations between x and z are S, W, SW, and SE.

So, to finally answer the question: the possible relations between region x and region z can be South, Southwest, Southeast, or West.

Actually, let me remove myself from the question and just provide a summary based on the original constraints:

Given that:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is W of region z

The possible relations between region x and region z can be:
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- Southeast (SE)
- West (W)

Actually, let me further check that I've got this right:

S (South): X can be south of Z. This is possible if the projections of X and Z onto the East-West axis overlap, and the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z.

W (West): X can be west of Z. This is possible if the projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis overlap, and the easternmost point of X is west of the westernmost point of Z.

SW (Southwest): X can be southwest of Z. This is possible if the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z, and the easternmost point of X is west of the westernmost point of Z.

SE (Southeast): X can be southeast of Z. This is possible if the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z, and the westernmost point of X is east of the easternmost point of Z.

I'm not sure about the last one. If Y is west of Z, and X is south of Y, it's hard to imagine how X could be east of Z. Let me reconsider SE.

For X to be SE of Z, the westernmost point of X must be east of the easternmost point of Z. But given that Y is W of Z, the easternmost point of Y is west of the westernmost point of Z. If X is south of Y, the westernmost point of X might be east of the easternmost point of Y, but it's still unclear if it would be east of the easternmost point of Z.

Actually, let me just reason this through once more. A region A is SE of a region B if both of the following are true:

1. The northernmost point of A is south of the southernmost point of B.
2. The westernmost point of A is east of the easternmost point of B.

Now, let's consider our constraints:
- X is S of Y: This means the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Y.
- Y is W of Z: This means the easternmost point of Y is west of the westernmost point of Z.

For X to be SE of Z:
1. The northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z.
2. The westernmost point of X is east of the easternmost point of Z.

Condition 1 is potentially true given that X is S of Y (though it depends on the relationship between Y and Z in the North-South axis).
Condition 2 is unlikely to be true given that Y is W of Z, and X is S of Y. For the westernmost point of X to be east of the easternmost point of Z, X would need to be significantly shifted to the east compared to Y, which is not implied by the constraint that X is S of Y.

Actually, let me try to visualize this with a specific example:

```
         +---+
         | Z |
         +---+
+---+
| Y |
+---+
            +---+
            | X |
            +---+
```

In this diagram, Y is W of Z, X is S of Y, and X is SE of Z. The northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z, and the westernmost point of X is east of the easternmost point of Z. So, SE is a possibility.

So, the possible relations between region X and region Z can be:
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- Southeast (SE)
- West (W)

Actually, I'm still skeptical about the W (West) relation. In order for region X to be West of region Z, the following must be true:

1. The easternmost point of X is west of the westernmost point of Z.
2. The projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis overlap.

Given the constraints:
- X is S of Y: This means the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Y.
- Y is W of Z: This means the easternmost point of Y is west of the westernmost point of Z.

For condition 1 to be true, the easternmost point of X must be west of the westernmost point of Z. This is possible if the easternmost point of X is west of the easternmost point of Y (since Y is W of Z).

For condition 2 to be true, the projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis must overlap. Given that X is S of Y, the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Y. This means the projection of X onto the North-South axis is below the projection of Y. For the projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis to overlap, the projection of Z onto the North-South axis must extend below the projection of Y. This is not guaranteed by the constraint that Y is W of Z.

So, I'm doubtful about the W relation. Let me try another specific example:

```
+---+
| Z |
+---+
+---+
| Y |
+---+
+---+
| X |
+---+
```

In this diagram, Y is W of Z, X is S of Y, but X is SW of Z, not W of Z. The projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis don't overlap.

Actually, I'm still skeptical about the W relation. Let me try to think about this in a different way.

If Y is W of Z, then the easternmost point of Y is west of the westernmost point of Z. This places Z to the east of Y.
If X is S of Y, then the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Y. This places X to the south of Y.

Given these constraints, X is to the south of Y, and Z is to the east of Y. In terms of their relative positions, X is southwest of Z (or possibly south or southeast, depending on the exact positions). It's difficult to imagine a configuration where X is west of Z, given the constraints.

Let me try one more specific example:

```
       +--------+
       |        |
       |   Z    |
       |        |
       +--------+
+---+
| Y |
+---+
  +---+
  | X |
  +---+
```

In this diagram, Y is W of Z, X is S of Y, and I'm trying to position X so that it's W of Z. But for X to be W of Z, the projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis must overlap. In this diagram, if Z is large enough, the projections might overlap, making X west of Z.

Actually, I think W is a possibility, but it requires Z to have a specific shape and position relative to Y and X.

So, based on all the analysis, the possible relations between region X and region Z can be:
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- Southeast (SE)
- West (W)

Actually, I realize that I might have been too strict in my definition of West. The region X is West of region Z if the following is true:

The easternmost point of X is west of the westernmost point of Z.

The definition of W relation is just above. It doesn't require that the projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis overlap, as I had previously stated. That would be the definition of "directly West."

With this more corrected understanding, the W relation is even more plausible. If X is S of Y, and Y is W of Z, then X is south of Y, and Y is west of Z. Given that the easternmost point of Y is west of the westernmost point of Z, if the easternmost point of X is west of the easternmost point of Y (which is not constrained by X being S of Y), then the easternmost point of X is west of the westernmost point of Z, making X west of Z.

So, the W relation is definitely a possibility.

But, actually, I think I'm equivocating with two different definitions of cardinal directions for regions. Let me distinguish them explicitly:

1. Single-tile direction: The tiles of the regions are strictly in the respective cardinal directions. For example, in the S relation, all points of the region X are strictly south of all points of the region Z.

2. Projection-based direction: The projections of the regions onto the cardinal axes relate in a specific way. For example, in the S relation, the projection of X onto the North-South axis is strictly south of the projection of Z, and the projections of X and Z onto the East-West axis overlap.

I think the question is asking for the projection-based definition, which is the more common understanding of cardinal direction relations between regions. If that's the case, then the W relation is not guaranteed to be possible, because it requires the projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis to overlap, which is not guaranteed by the constraints.

So, using the projection-based definition, the possible relations between region X and region Z can be:
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- Southeast (SE)

Wait, I think I'm still confusing things. Let me refer to the formal definitions of cardinal direction relations:

For two regions X and Z, the cardinal direction relation is determined by comparing the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. 

1. X is N of Z if the MBR of X is entirely north of the MBR of Z, i.e., the southernmost point of X is north of the northernmost point of Z.
2. X is S of Z if the MBR of X is entirely south of the MBR of Z, i.e., the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z.
3. X is E of Z if the MBR of X is entirely east of the MBR of Z, i.e., the westernmost point of X is east of the easternmost point of Z.
4. X is W of Z if the MBR of X is entirely west of the MBR of Z, i.e., the easternmost point of X is west of the westernmost point of Z.
5. X is NE of Z if the MBR of X is both north and east of the MBR of Z.
6. X is NW of Z if the MBR of X is both north and west of the MBR of Z.
7. X is SE of Z if the MBR of X is both south and east of the MBR of Z.
8. X is SW of Z if the MBR of X is both south and west of the MBR of Z.
9. X is BB of Z if none of the above, i.e., the MBRs of X and Z overlap.

Using these definitions, let's analyze the possible relations between X and Z given the constraints:

1. X is S of Y: This means the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Y.
2. Y is W of Z: This means the easternmost point of Y is west of the westernmost point of Z.

For X to be S of Z, the northernmost point of X must be south of the southernmost point of Z. This is possible, especially if Y is also south of Z (which is not constrained by Y being W of Z).

For X to be W of Z, the easternmost point of X must be west of the westernmost point of Z. This is possible, especially if the easternmost point of X is west of the easternmost point of Y (which is not constrained by X being S of Y), because Y is already W of Z.

For X to be SW of Z, X must be both S and W of Z. As discussed, both of these are possible.

For X to be SE of Z, X must be both S and E of Z. For X to be E of Z, the westernmost point of X must be east of the easternmost point of Z. Given that Y is W of Z, and X is S of Y, this requires X to be positioned far to the east, which is not constrained by X being S of Y.

So, based on the formal definitions, the possible relations between region X and region Z can be:
- South (S)
- West (W)
- Southwest (SW)
- Southeast (SE)

But I also need to consider the BB relation:

For X to be BB with Z, the MBRs of X and Z must overlap. Given that X is S of Y, and Y is W of Z, it's not clear if the MBRs of X and Z can overlap. The constraint that Y is W of Z places Z to the east of Y, and the constraint that X is S of Y places X to the south of Y. These relative positions suggest that X and Z are separated, not overlapping.

So, I don't think BB is a possibility.

In summary, the possible relations between region X and region Z can be:
- South (S)
- West (W)
- Southwest (SW)
- Southeast (SE)

Just to double-check each of these:

1. South (S): Possible if the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z, and the projection of X onto the East-West axis overlaps with the projection of Z.
2. West (W): Possible if the easternmost point of X is west of the westernmost point of Z, and the projection of X onto the North-South axis overlaps with the projection of Z.
3. Southwest (SW): Possible if the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z, and the easternmost point of X is west of the westernmost point of Z.
4. Southeast (SE): Possible if the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z, and the westernmost point of X is east of the easternmost point of Z.

Ah, okay. Let me be crystal clear here. The formal definition of the cardinal direction relations (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) between regions is based on the 9-intersection model. In this model, the plane is divided into 9 regions by extending the sides of the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of one region. The relation is determined by where the other region lies in this partition.

For example, region X is S of region Z if X lies entirely in the S region of the partition of the plane by the MBR of Z. Similarly, X is W of Z if X lies entirely in the W region of the partition.

Given the constraints:
- X is S of Y: This means X lies entirely in the S region of the partition of the plane by the MBR of Y.
- Y is W of Z: This means Y lies entirely in the W region of the partition of the plane by the MBR of Z.

For X to be S of Z, X must lie entirely in the S region of the partition of the plane by the MBR of Z. Given that X is S of Y, and Y is W of Z, this is possible if the S region of Y overlaps with the S region of Z.

For X to be W of Z, X must lie entirely in the W region of the partition of the plane by the MBR of Z. Given that X is S of Y, and Y is W of Z, this is possible if the S region of Y overlaps with the W region of Z.

For X to be SW of Z, X must lie entirely in the SW region of the partition of the plane by the MBR of Z. Given that X is S of Y, and Y is W of Z, this is possible if the S region of Y overlaps with the SW region of Z.

For X to be SE of Z, X must lie entirely in the SE region of the partition of the plane by the MBR of Z. Given that X is S of Y, and Y is W of Z, this is possible if the S region of Y overlaps with the SE region of Z.

And for the BB relation:

For X to be BB with Z, X must overlap with the MBR of Z. Given that X is S of Y, and Y is W of Z, this is only possible if the S region of Y overlaps with the MBR of Z, which isn't the case if Y is W of Z.

So, the possible relations between region X and region Z can be:
- South (S)
- West (W)
- Southwest (SW)
- Southeast (SE)

Actually, I realize that "W" may not be a correct answer for a different reason. For the W relation to be true, the projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis must overlap. Given that X is S of Y, the projection of X onto the North-South axis is entirely south of the projection of Y. For the projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis to overlap, the projection of Z onto the North-South axis must extend south of the northernmost point of X.

But given that Y is W of Z, the projection of Z onto the North-South axis might not extend that far south. So, it's not guaranteed that the W relation is possible.

Let me try to visualize this:

```
       +--------+
       |        |
       |   Z    |
       |        |
       +--------+
+---+
| Y |
+---+
  +---+
  | X |
  +---+
```

In this diagram, Y is W of Z, X is S of Y, and the projections of X and Z onto the North-South axis don't overlap. So, X is not W of Z.

Hmm, it's a bit ambiguous. I think the W relation is possibly true, but it depends on the specific shapes and positions of the regions. It's not guaranteed to be true given the constraints.

So, I'm now more confident that the possible relations between region X and region Z can be:
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- Southeast (SE)
- West (W) (depending on the specific shapes and positions)

Actually, I've been thinking about this more. Imagine a circle Z at the center of our space. We're dividing the space around Z into 9 parts (tiling the space): NW, N, NE, W, Z, E, SW, S, SE.

Y is W of Z, so Y lands in the W part of this tiling.
X is S of Y, so X lands in a southern part of our tiling.

Specifically, X lands at (0, -k) relative to Y for some k > 0, meaning it could be in the W, SW, or S part of the overall tiling relative to Z.

Actually, that's not quite right. If Y is in the W part, and X is S of Y, then X could be in the SW or the W part of the tiling, depending on the specific positions. It could also be in the S part if Y is positioned in a way that the S part of Y's partitioning overlaps with the S part of Z's partitioning.

So, I think the possible relations between region X and region Z can be:
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- West (W)

I'm excluding SE now, because if Y is W of Z, and X is S of Y, it's hard to see how X could be E of Z, which is required for the SE relation.

Actually, let me try to visualize the SE relation again:

```
         +---+
         | Z |
         +---+
+---+
| Y |
+---+
            +---+
            | X |
            +---+
```

In this diagram, Y is W of Z, X is S of Y, and X is SE of Z. But on further inspection, there's a problem with this diagram. If X is SE of Z, then the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Z, and the westernmost point of X is east of the easternmost point of Z. But given that Y is W of Z, and X is S of Y, the constraints would place X somewhere to the south and west of Z, not to the southeast.

So, I'm now doubtful about the SE relation.

Let me check one more time:

```
         +---+
         | Z |
         +---+
+---+
| Y |
+---+
            +---+
            | X |
            +---+
```

In this diagram, Y is W of Z, X is S of Y, and X is claimed to be SE of Z. But the northernmost point of X is south of the southernmost point of Y, not Z. And the westernmost point of X is east of the easternmost point of Z, which is not constrained by X being S of Y and Y being W of Z.

Actually, let me start over. Given Y is W of Z, that means Y is in the W region of Z. If X is S of Y, that means X is in the S region of Y.

For X to be S of Z, X must be in the S region of Z. The S region of Y might overlap with the S region of Z, depending on the exact positions, so this is a possibility.

For X to be SW of Z, X must be in the SW region of Z. The S region of Y might overlap with the SW region of Z, depending on the exact positions, so this is a possibility.

For X to be W of Z, X must be in the W region of Z. The S region of Y might overlap with the W region of Z, depending on the exact positions, so this is a possibility.

For X to be SE of Z, X must be in the SE region of Z. But if Y is W of Z, the S region of Y is more likely to overlap with the SW or S regions of Z, not the SE region. So, I'm doubtful about the SE relation. But it's not impossible, depending on the exact positions.

So, I'm revising my list of possibilities: the possible relations between region X and region Z can be:
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- West (W)

I'm excluding SE because it's not clear if it's possible given the constraints.
