PROMPT: Let  West and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

This is a problem about composing cardinal directions. Let's represent the spatial relations carefully.

First, we know:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is South of region z

We need to find the possible relation(s) between region x and region z.

Let's use a coordinate system to help visualize this. If we define an arbitrary origin, we can think of the compass directions in the standard way:
- North means increasing y-coordinate
- South means decreasing y-coordinate
- East means increasing x-coordinate
- West means decreasing x-coordinate

So if x is West of y, then x is at a lower x-coordinate than y.
If y is South of z, then y is at a lower y-coordinate than z.

Now, what do we know about the relationship between x and z?
- x is at a lower x-coordinate than y
- y is at a lower y-coordinate than z

What does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?
- x is at a lower x-coordinate than y, which doesn't tell us directly about the x-coordinate relationship between x and z
- y is at a lower y-coordinate than z, which also doesn't tell us directly about the y-coordinate relationship between x and z

However, we can conclude that x is at a lower x-coordinate than y, and y is at a lower y-coordinate than z. This means that x is in the Southwest quadrant relative to z.

But wait, that's not entirely correct. Let me try a different approach with a diagram:

If we denote coordinates as (x-coordinate, y-coordinate):
- Let's say z is at (0, 0)
- Since y is South of z, y could be at (0, -1)
- Since x is West of y, x could be at (-1, -1)

In this case, x would be Southwest of z.

But actually, y could be at any point South of z, such as (1, -1) or (-1, -1) or (2, -1).
And x could be at any point West of y.

So if y is at (1, -1) and x is at (0, -1), then x would be West of y but x would be South of z.
If y is at (-1, -1) and x is at (-2, -1), then x would be West of y but x would be Southwest of z.

Let me be more systematic. 
- z is at position (0, 0)
- y is South of z, so y's position is (a, b) where b < 0 and a can be any value
- x is West of y, so x's position is (c, d) where c < a and d can be any value

So the relation between x and z depends on the values of c and d compared to 0:
- If c < 0 and d < 0, then x is Southwest of z
- If c < 0 and d = 0, then x is West of z
- If c < 0 and d > 0, then x is Northwest of z
- If c = 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z
- If c > 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z (but this is not possible because c < a and if a <= 0, then c < 0)

But wait, I need to be more careful. The constraint is that x is West of y, which means the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y. And y is South of z, which means the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z.

Let me redo the analysis:
- z is at position (0, 0)
- y is South of z, so y's position is (a, b) where b < 0
- x is West of y, so x's position is (c, d) where c < a

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?
- If c < 0 and d < 0, then x is Southwest of z
- If c < 0 and d = 0, then x is West of z
- If c < 0 and d > 0, then x is Northwest of z
- If c = 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z (but this is not possible because c < a and if a = 0, then c < 0)
- If c > 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z

Actually, I see that I'm making things too complicated. Let me approach this differently.

We have region x is West of region y, and region y is South of region z.

The West relation means that x is in the Western half-plane of y, i.e., the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y.

The South relation means that y is in the Southern half-plane of z, i.e., the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Then y is at some position (a, b) where b < 0 (because y is South of z). And x is at some position (c, d) where c < a (because x is West of y).

Now, what's the relationship between x and z? It depends on the position of x relative to the origin:
- If c < 0 and d < 0, then x is Southwest of z
- If c < 0 and d = 0, then x is West of z
- If c < 0 and d > 0, then x is Northwest of z
- If c = 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z (but this is not possible because c < a and if a = 0, then c < 0)
- If c > 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z
- If c > 0 and d = 0, then x is not in any of the standard directions from z (but this is not possible because c < a and if a <= 0, then c < 0)
- If c > 0 and d > 0, then x is not in any of the standard directions from z (but this is not possible because c < a and if a <= 0, then c < 0)
- If c = 0 and d > 0, then x is North of z (but this is not possible because c < a and if a = 0, then c < 0)
- If c = 0 and d = 0, then x is at the same position as z (but this is not possible because c < a and if a = 0, then c < 0)

Alright, let's try to simplify. The constraints we have are that c < a and b < 0. Let's consider different cases for a:

Case 1: a < 0
In this case, c < a < 0, so c < 0. Then:
- If d < 0, then x is Southwest of z
- If d = 0, then x is West of z
- If d > 0, then x is Northwest of z

Case 2: a = 0
In this case, c < a = 0, so c < 0. Then:
- If d < 0, then x is Southwest of z
- If d = 0, then x is West of z
- If d > 0, then x is Northwest of z

Case 3: a > 0
In this case, c < a, but c can be either positive or negative. Then:
- If c < 0 and d < 0, then x is Southwest of z
- If c < 0 and d = 0, then x is West of z
- If c < 0 and d > 0, then x is Northwest of z
- If c >= 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z (because c < a implies c is bounded, so this is possible)

Based on the cases I've considered, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
- South

Let me double-check this by thinking about the problem in yet another way.

Given that x is West of y and y is South of z, we can think of the possible locations of x in a grid where z is at the center:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | z | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

y can be in the S, SW, or SE positions relative to z.

If y is in the S position, then x must be in the SW or W positions relative to z.
If y is in the SW position, then x must be in the SW or W positions relative to z.
If y is in the SE position, then x must be in the S, SW, or W positions relative to z.

Combining these, the possible positions for x relative to z are:
- Southwest (SW)
- West (W)
- South (S)

This contradicts my earlier analysis, where I also included Northwest (NW) as a possibility. Let me reconsider.

If y is South of z, then y is somewhere in the bottom row of the grid. If x is West of y, then x is to the left of y in the grid.

So if y is in the S position, then x can be in the SW position.
If y is in the SW position, then x can be to the left of the SW position, which isn't a standard cardinal direction in our grid.
If y is in the SE position, then x can be in the S or SW positions.

Actually, I think I'm getting confused with the grid representation. Let me revert to the coordinate approach, which is clearer.

We have region x is West of region y, and region y is South of region z.

Placing z at the origin (0, 0), we have:
- y is at some position (a, b) where b < 0 (because y is South of z).
- x is at some position (c, d) where c < a (because x is West of y).

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z by considering different cases for a and d:

Case 1: d < 0
In this case, the y-coordinate of x is negative, so x is in the South half-plane of z. And we know that c < a, but a can be positive, zero, or negative. If a is positive, then c can be positive or negative, but if a is non-positive, then c must be negative.
- If c < 0, then x is in the West half-plane of z, so x is Southwest of z.
- If c > 0, then x is in the East half-plane of z, so x is South of z.
(c cannot be exactly 0 because c < a and if a = 0, then c < 0)

Case 2: d = 0
In this case, the y-coordinate of x is zero, so x is neither in the North nor the South half-plane of z. And again, c < a, but a can be positive, zero, or negative. If a is positive, then c can be positive or negative, but if a is non-positive, then c must be negative.
- If c < 0, then x is in the West half-plane of z, so x is West of z.
- If c > 0, then x is in the East half-plane of z, which doesn't correspond to a standard cardinal direction in our list (it would be East).
(c cannot be exactly 0 because c < a and if a = 0, then c < 0)

Case 3: d > 0
In this case, the y-coordinate of x is positive, so x is in the North half-plane of z. And again, c < a, but a can be positive, zero, or negative. If a is positive, then c can be positive or negative, but if a is non-positive, then c must be negative.
- If c < 0, then x is in the West half-plane of z, so x is Northwest of z.
- If c > 0, then x is in the East half-plane of z, so x is North of z.
(c cannot be exactly 0 because c < a and if a = 0, then c < 0)

So, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are:
- Southwest
- South
- West
- Northwest
- North

But there's an issue with the North direction. For x to be North of z, we need c > 0 and d > 0. But we also know that c < a. For this to be possible, we need a > 0. However, I'm not sure if this is a valid configuration given the constraints. Let me try to visualize it:

z is at (0, 0).
y is South of z, so y is at (a, b) where b < 0.
x is West of y, so x is at (c, d) where c < a.

If a > 0, b < 0, c > 0, and d > 0, then x is North of z. But x being West of y means c < a, and y being South of z means b < 0. So x's position is (c, d) with c < a and d can be any value. 

I'm not convinced that d can be positive, though. If x is at (c, d) and y is at (a, b), then for x to be West of y, we need c < a and d = b, because West is a direction along the x-axis only.

Actually, that's not right. The cardinal directions in the problem are not just along the axes. West means the entire Western half-plane, South means the entire Southern half-plane, etc.

So, if x is West of y, it means the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y, but the y-coordinates can be anything. Similarly, if y is South of z, it means the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z, but the x-coordinates can be anything.

Given this, let's redo the analysis:

z is at (0, 0).
y is South of z, so y is at (a, b) where b < 0 and a can be any value.
x is West of y, so x is at (c, d) where c < a and d can be any value.

Now, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z depend on the signs of c and d:
- If c < 0 and d < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If c = 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z.
- If c > 0 and d < 0, then x is Southeast of z.
- If c < 0 and d = 0, then x is West of z.
- If c = 0 and d = 0, then x and z are the same point (which is not a cardinal direction).
- If c > 0 and d = 0, then x is East of z.
- If c < 0 and d > 0, then x is Northwest of z.
- If c = 0 and d > 0, then x is North of z.
- If c > 0 and d > 0, then x is Northeast of z.

But not all of these are possible given the constraints c < a, b < 0, and a, c, d can take any value.

Case 1: a < 0
In this case, c < a < 0, so c < 0. Then:
- If d < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If d = 0, then x is West of z.
- If d > 0, then x is Northwest of z.

Case 2: a = 0
In this case, c < a = 0, so c < 0. Then:
- If d < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If d = 0, then x is West of z.
- If d > 0, then x is Northwest of z.

Case 3: a > 0
In this case, c < a, but c can be positive, zero, or negative. Then:
- If c < 0 and d < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If c = 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z.
- If c > 0 and d < 0, then x is Southeast of z.
- If c < 0 and d = 0, then x is West of z.
- If c = 0 and d = 0, then x and z are the same point.
- If c > 0 and d = 0, then x is East of z.
- If c < 0 and d > 0, then x is Northwest of z.
- If c = 0 and d > 0, then x is North of z.
- If c > 0 and d > 0, then x is Northeast of z.

Combining all the cases, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- East
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast

Actually, I'm not being careful enough here. If y is at position (a, b) with b < 0, and x is at position (c, d) with c < a, then the position of x relative to z depends on the values of c and d compared to 0.

But I also need to ensure that these positions are consistent with the given constraints. If y is at (a, b) with b < 0, then y is somewhere in the Southern half-plane of z. If x is at (c, d) with c < a, then x is somewhere to the West of y.

Let's consider different possible positions for y:

If y is directly South of z, then a = 0 and b < 0. In this case, x must have c < 0 (since c < a = 0), which means x is in the Western half-plane of z. The position of x relative to z depends on the value of d:
- If d < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If d = 0, then x is West of z.
- If d > 0, then x is Northwest of z.

If y is Southwest of z, then a < 0 and b < 0. In this case, x must have c < a < 0, which means x is in the Western half-plane of z. Again, the position of x relative to z depends on the value of d:
- If d < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If d = 0, then x is West of z.
- If d > 0, then x is Northwest of z.

If y is Southeast of z, then a > 0 and b < 0. In this case, x must have c < a, but c can be positive, zero, or negative. The position of x relative to z depends on the values of c and d:
- If c < 0 and d < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If c = 0 and d < 0, then x is South of z.
- If c > 0 and d < 0, then x is Southeast of z.
- If c < 0 and d = 0, then x is West of z.
- If c = 0 and d = 0, then x and z are the same point.
- If c > 0 and d = 0, then x is East of z.
- If c < 0 and d > 0, then x is Northwest of z.
- If c = 0 and d > 0, then x is North of z.
- If c > 0 and d > 0, then x is Northeast of z.

Combining all these, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- East
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast
- x and z are the same point (but this is not a cardinal direction in our list)

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let me approach it differently. 

The cardinal directions in the problem define half-planes or quadrants, not just points along the axes. I'll use the following definitions:
- North: y-coordinate is greater than 0
- South: y-coordinate is less than 0
- East: x-coordinate is greater than 0
- West: x-coordinate is less than 0
- Northeast: x-coordinate is greater than 0 and y-coordinate is greater than 0
- Northwest: x-coordinate is less than 0 and y-coordinate is greater than 0
- Southeast: x-coordinate is greater than 0 and y-coordinate is less than 0
- Southwest: x-coordinate is less than 0 and y-coordinate is less than 0

If x is West of y, it means the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y.
If y is South of z, it means the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z.

If z is at (0, 0), then y is at (a, b) with b < 0. And x is at (c, d) with c < a.

The position of x relative to z depends on the values of c and d.

For x to be North of z, we need d > 0. This is possible if a > 0, b < 0, c > 0, and d > 0, which means y is Southeast of z and x is North of z.

For x to be South of z, we need d < 0. This is possible if a ≥ 0, b < 0, and c < a, which means y is South or Southeast of z and x is South of z.

For x to be East of z, we need c > 0 and d = 0. This is possible if a > 0, b < 0, 0 < c < a, and d = 0, which means y is Southeast of z and x is East of z.

For x to be West of z, we need c < 0 and d = 0. This is possible if a ≥ 0, b < 0, c < 0, and d = 0, which means y is South or Southeast of z and x is West of z.

For x to be Northeast of z, we need c > 0 and d > 0. This is possible if a > 0, b < 0, 0 < c < a, and d > 0, which means y is Southeast of z and x is Northeast of z.

For x to be Northwest of z, we need c < 0 and d > 0. This is possible if a ≥ 0, b < 0, c < 0, and d > 0, which means y is South or Southeast of z and x is Northwest of z.

For x to be Southeast of z, we need c > 0 and d < 0. This is possible if a > 0, b < 0, 0 < c < a, and d < 0, which means y is Southeast of z and x is Southeast of z.

For x to be Southwest of z, we need c < 0 and d < 0. This is possible if a ≥ 0, b < 0, c < 0, and d < 0, which means y is South or Southeast of z and x is Southwest of z.

Actually, there's a more systematic way to approach this problem:

Let's denote the position of region x as (x_x, x_y), the position of region y as (y_x, y_y), and the position of region z as (z_x, z_y).

We are given:
1. x is West of y, which means x_x < y_x.
2. y is South of z, which means y_y < z_y.

We want to find the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z.

First, let's set our origin at the position of z, so z_x = 0 and z_y = 0. This simplifies the constraints to:
1. x_x < y_x.
2. y_y < 0.

Now, the position of y can be in the South, Southwest, or Southeast quadrant relative to z. And the position of x is constrained to be to the West of y.

Let's enumerate the possible cases:

Case 1: y is South of z (y_x = 0, y_y < 0)
In this case, x must have x_x < 0 (since x_x < y_x = 0), which means x is in the Western half-plane of z. The position of x relative to z depends on the value of x_y:
- If x_y < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If x_y = 0, then x is West of z.
- If x_y > 0, then x is Northwest of z.

Case 2: y is Southwest of z (y_x < 0, y_y < 0)
In this case, x must have x_x < y_x < 0, which means x is in the Western half-plane of z. Again, the position of x relative to z depends on the value of x_y:
- If x_y < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If x_y = 0, then x is West of z.
- If x_y > 0, then x is Northwest of z.

Case 3: y is Southeast of z (y_x > 0, y_y < 0)
In this case, x must have x_x < y_x, but x_x can be positive, zero, or negative. The position of x relative to z depends on the values of x_x and x_y:
- If x_x < 0 and x_y < 0, then x is Southwest of z.
- If x_x = 0 and x_y < 0, then x is South of z.
- If x_x > 0 and x_y < 0, then x is Southeast of z.
- If x_x < 0 and x_y = 0, then x is West of z.
- If x_x = 0 and x_y = 0, then x and z are at the same point (not a cardinal direction).
- If x_x > 0 and x_y = 0, then x is East of z.
- If x_x < 0 and x_y > 0, then x is Northwest of z.
- If x_x = 0 and x_y > 0, then x is North of z.
- If x_x > 0 and x_y > 0, then x is Northeast of z.

Combining all these cases, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- East
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast
- Bounding Box (if x and z are at the same point)

Actually, I'm not sure if "Bounding Box" is a cardinal direction in the context of this problem, it's not one of the standard compass directions. If x and z are at the same point, then they are not in any of the compass directions from each other, so I'll exclude this as a possibility.

Also, I want to double-check if all of the directions I've listed are actually possible. For each direction, I'll verify if there's a configuration of x, y, and z that satisfies the given constraints:

1. Southwest: 
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (-1, -1) (Southwest of z, and West of y)
   So Southwest is a possible direction.

2. South:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (0, -1) (South of z, and West of y)
   So South is a possible direction.

3. Southeast:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (2, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (1, -1) (Southeast of z, and West of y)
   So Southeast is a possible direction.

4. West:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (-1, 0) (West of z, and West of y)
   So West is a possible direction.

5. East:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (2, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (1, 0) (East of z, and West of y)
   So East is a possible direction.

6. Northwest:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (-1, 1) (Northwest of z, and West of y)
   So Northwest is a possible direction.

7. North:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (0, 1) (North of z, and West of y)
   So North is a possible direction.

8. Northeast:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (2, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (1, 1) (Northeast of z, and West of y)
   So Northeast is a possible direction.

All of the compass directions are indeed possible. 

Actually, let me double-check all of these:

1. Southwest: 
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (-1, -1) (Southwest of z, and West of y)
   So Southwest is a possible direction.

2. South:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (0, -1) (South of z, and West of y)
   So South is a possible direction.

3. Southeast:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (2, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (1, -1) (Southeast of z, and West of y)
   So Southeast is a possible direction.

4. West:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (-1, 0) (West of z, and West of y)
   So West is a possible direction.

5. East:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (2, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (1, 0) (East of z, and West of y)
   So East is a possible direction.

6. Northwest:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (-1, 1) (Northwest of z, and West of y)
   So Northwest is a possible direction.

7. North:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (1, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (0, 1) (North of z, and West of y)
   So North is a possible direction.

8. Northeast:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (2, -1) (Southeast of z)
   - x at (1, 1) (Northeast of z, and West of y)
   So Northeast is a possible direction.

All of the compass directions are indeed possible.

Let me re-check this by constructing a diagram. I'll place z at the origin (0, 0) and consider the possible positions of y given that y is South of z. Then, I'll consider the possible positions of x given that x is West of y, and see which directions x can be relative to z.

```
  NW | N | NE
 ----+---+----
   W | z | E
 ----+---+----
  SW | S | SE
```

y can be in the South, Southwest, or Southeast position relative to z.

Case 1: y is in the South position.
If x is West of y, then x can be in the Southwest position relative to z, or x can be in the South or Southeast position of y which would put it in the South, Southwest, or West position relative to z, or x can be in the North, Northwest, or Northeast position of y which would put it in the West, Southwest, South, or Northwest position relative to z.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let me simplify.

If y is South of z, then y's y-coordinate is less than z's y-coordinate.
If x is West of y, then x's x-coordinate is less than y's x-coordinate.

This means x's x-coordinate is less than y's x-coordinate, but we don't know the relationship between x's y-coordinate and z's y-coordinate, or between x's y-coordinate and y's y-coordinate.

Let's place z at (0, 0) and try to enumerate the possible positions of x.

y is South of z, so y is at (a, b) where b < 0 (and a can be any value).
x is West of y, so x is at (c, d) where c < a (and d can be any value).

Now, let's consider different cases based on the values of a, c, and d.

If a ≤ 0 and c < a, then c < 0. In this case, x is in the Western half-plane of z.
If a > 0 and c < a, then c can be positive, zero, or negative. If c > 0, then x is in the Eastern half-plane of z. If c < 0, then x is in the Western half-plane of z. If c = 0, then x is on the y-axis.

Similarly, if d < 0, then x is in the Southern half-plane of z. If d > 0, then x is in the Northern half-plane of z. If d = 0, then x is on the x-axis.

So, the possible compass directions of x relative to z are:
- Southwest (c < 0, d < 0)
- South (c = 0, d < 0)
- Southeast (c > 0, d < 0)
- West (c < 0, d = 0)
- East (c > 0, d = 0)
- Northwest (c < 0, d > 0)
- North (c = 0, d > 0)
- Northeast (c > 0, d > 0)

But for each of these directions, we need to check if there's a configuration of a, b, c, and d that satisfies the constraints a, c, d can be any value, b < 0, and c < a.

For the South direction, we need c = 0, d < 0, b < 0, and c < a, which means 0 < a. So, we can have y at (1, -1) and x at (0, -1).

For the Southeast direction, we need c > 0, d < 0, b < 0, and c < a, which means c < a. So, we can have y at (2, -1) and x at (1, -1).

For the East direction, we need c > 0, d = 0, b < 0, and c < a, which means c < a. So, we can have y at (2, -1) and x at (1, 0).

For the Northeast direction, we need c > 0, d > 0, b < 0, and c < a, which means c < a. So, we can have y at (2, -1) and x at (1, 1).

For the North direction, we need c = 0, d > 0, b < 0, and c < a, which means 0 < a. So, we can have y at (1, -1) and x at (0, 1).

For the Northwest direction, we need c < 0, d > 0, b < 0, and c < a. So, we can have y at (0, -1) and x at (-1, 1).

For the West direction, we need c < 0, d = 0, b < 0, and c < a. So, we can have y at (0, -1) and x at (-1, 0).

For the Southwest direction, we need c < 0, d < 0, b < 0, and c < a. So, we can have y at (0, -1) and x at (-1, -1).

So, all of the compass directions are possible.

Now, I want to think of this problem one more time in a simpler way. If I have

(1) x West y
(2) y South z

I'm trying to figure out the possible relationships between x and z.

First, let's see what (1) and (2) tell us about the positions of x, y, and z.
- From (1), the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y. But their y-coordinates can be anything.
- From (2), the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z. But their x-coordinates can be anything.

Now, let's try to determine the relationship between x and z.
- From (1), the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y. And from (2), the x-coordinate of y can be anything compared to the x-coordinate of z. So, the x-coordinate of x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinate of z.
- From (2), the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z. And from (1), the y-coordinate of x can be anything compared to the y-coordinate of y. So, the y-coordinate of x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the y-coordinate of z.

In general I would say the possible relationships between x and z would be that x could be 
in any of the compass directions from z: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, or Northwest.

But when I check each one more time:

1. Southwest: The x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of z. This is possible if the x-coordinate of y is greater than or equal to the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the y-coordinate of y. For example, z at (0, 0), y at (0, -1), and x at (-1, -1).

2. South: The x-coordinate of x is equal to the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of z. This is possible if the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the y-coordinate of y. For example, z at (0, 0), y at (1, -1), and x at (0, -1).

3. Southeast: The x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of z. This is possible if the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of x, and the y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the y-coordinate of y. For example, z at (0, 0), y at (2, -1), and x at (1, -1).

4. West: The x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is equal to the y-coordinate of z. This is possible if the x-coordinate of y is greater than or equal to the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than or equal to the y-coordinate of y. For example, z at (0, 0), y at (0, -1), and x at (-1, 0).

5. East: The x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is equal to the y-coordinate of z. This is possible if the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of x, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than or equal to the y-coordinate of y. For example, z at (0, 0), y at (2, -1), and x at (1, 0).

6. Northwest: The x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of z. This is possible if the x-coordinate of y is greater than or equal to the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of y. For example, z at (0, 0), y at (0, -1), and x at (-1, 1).

7. North: The x-coordinate of x is equal to the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of z. This is possible if the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of y. For example, z at (0, 0), y at (1, -1), and x at (0, 1).

8. Northeast: The x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of z. This is possible if the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of x, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of y. For example, z at (0, 0), y at (2, -1), and x at (1, 1).

So all of the compass directions are possible.

To summarize and be sure:

The question was: "Let West and South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is West of region y and region y is South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

I analyzed the problem by considering the constraints on the coordinates of x, y, and z, and found that x can be in any of the compass directions from z: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, or Northwest.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

North
Northeast
East
Southeast
South
Southwest
West
Northwest
