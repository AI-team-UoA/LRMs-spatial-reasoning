PROMPT: Let  West and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step to figure out the possible relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Northeast of region z

I'll use a coordinate system to help analyze this. If I place z at the origin (0, 0), then:

Since y is Northeast of z, y must be in the Northeast quadrant relative to z. So y has coordinates (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

Since x is West of y, x must be directly to the west of y. So x has coordinates (a - c, b) for some c > 0.

So x is at position (a - c, b) and z is at position (0, 0), where a > 0, b > 0, and c > 0.

What's the relation between x and z? We need to determine which direction x is from z.

Let's consider some cases:

Case 1: If a - c < 0, then x is to the west of z (since the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of z).
Case 2: If a - c = 0, then x is directly north of z (since the x-coordinate of x equals the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of z).
Case 3: If a - c > 0, then x is still in the northeastern quadrant relative to z, but less far east than y.

Let's visualize this more carefully. If we use a compass direction diagram:

```
    N
 NW | NE
W --+-- E
 SW | SE
    S
```

If y is Northeast of z, then y is in the NE direction from z.
If x is West of y, then x is directly to the W of y.

Depending on how far west x is from y, x could be:
- Still in the NE quadrant relative to z (if x doesn't move west enough to cross the North line)
- On the North line relative to z (if x moves west exactly to the North line)
- In the NW quadrant relative to z (if x moves west past the North line)

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast (if x is still in the NE quadrant relative to z)
- North (if x is directly north of z)
- Northwest (if x is in the NW quadrant relative to z)

Actually, let's double-check this by working with a specific example. Suppose:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, 1), which is Northeast of z
- x is West of y, so x is at (0, 1)

In this case, x is directly North of z.

But if y is at (2, 1) (still Northeast of z), and x is at (0, 1) (still West of y), then x is Northwest of z.

And if y is at (1, 2) (still Northeast of z), and x is at (0, 2) (still West of y), then x is Northwest of z.

If we consider the general case:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0 (Northeast of z)
- x at (a - c, b) where c > 0 (West of y)

For x to be Northeast of z, we need a - c > 0 and b > 0. We already know b > 0, so we just need a - c > 0, which means a > c.
For x to be North of z, we need a - c = 0 and b > 0. We already know b > 0, so we just need a - c = 0, which means a = c.
For x to be Northwest of z, we need a - c < 0 and b > 0. We already know b > 0, so we just need a - c < 0, which means a < c.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast (if a > c)
- North (if a = c)
- Northwest (if a < c)

Wait, let me double-check if there are any other possible relations. If z is at the origin, y is in the Northeast quadrant, and x is West of y, can x ever be:
- East of z? No, because x is West of y, and y is Northeast of z, so x is more westerly than y. The most easterly x can be is if it's just slightly west of y, in which case it could still be Northeast of z, but never directly East.
- Southeast of z? No, because x is West of y, and y is Northeast of z. For x to be Southeast of z, it would need to be south of z, but we know it's north of z because y is Northeast (and thus north) of z, and x has the same y-coordinate as y.
- South of z? No, for the same reason as above.
- Southwest of z? No, for the same reason as above.

Hmm, but wait. I think I need to be more careful about the definition of "West". When we say x is West of y, does this mean:
1. x is directly to the west of y (same latitude, less longitude), or
2. x is in the western half-plane relative to y (less longitude, any latitude)?

Let me think about the standard definition of cardinal direction relations. Usually, when we say x is West of y, we mean that x is in the western half-plane relative to y. So, if y is at position (a, b), then x is at position (a - c, b + d) for some c > 0 and any d (positive, negative, or zero).

So, given:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0 (Northeast of z)
- x at (a - c, b + d) where c > 0 (West of y)

Let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z.

For x to be North of z, we need a - c = 0 and b + d > 0.
For x to be Northeast of z, we need a - c > 0 and b + d > 0.
For x to be East of z, we need a - c > 0 and b + d = 0.
For x to be Southeast of z, we need a - c > 0 and b + d < 0.
For x to be South of z, we need a - c = 0 and b + d < 0.
For x to be Southwest of z, we need a - c < 0 and b + d < 0.
For x to be West of z, we need a - c < 0 and b + d = 0.
For x to be Northwest of z, we need a - c < 0 and b + d > 0.

Actually, I think I made a mistake. In standard cardinal direction relations:
- "North" means the region is in the northern half-plane.
- "Northeast" means the region is in both the northern and eastern half-planes.
- And so on.

But let's actually double-check our definitions. In the context of cardinal direction relations, I believe the standard definitions are:

1. North: The region is in the northern half-plane (y > 0, any x).
2. Northeast: The region is in both the northern and eastern half-planes (y > 0, x > 0).
3. East: The region is in the eastern half-plane (x > 0, any y).
4. Southeast: The region is in both the southern and eastern half-planes (y < 0, x > 0).
5. South: The region is in the southern half-plane (y < 0, any x).
6. Southwest: The region is in both the southern and western half-planes (y < 0, x < 0).
7. West: The region is in the western half-plane (x < 0, any y).
8. Northwest: The region is in both the northern and western half-planes (y > 0, x < 0).

No, this doesn't seem right for the standard cardinal direction relations in qualitative spatial reasoning. Let me try again.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction calculus often uses a model where space is divided into nine tiles based on a reference object. The tiles are: Northwest, North, Northeast, West, Central (or "Same"), East, Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Given that, let's reinterpret the problem:

Given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Northeast of region z

When we say region y is Northeast of region z, we mean y is in the Northeast tile relative to z. Similarly, when we say region x is West of region y, we mean x is in the West tile relative to y.

Now, to find the possible relations between x and z, I need to consider all possible positions of y relative to z (while ensuring y is in the Northeast tile of z), and then consider all possible positions of x relative to y (while ensuring x is in the West tile of y).

Let's visualize this. If z is at the origin, then y is in the Northeast quadrant of z. If y is in the Northeast quadrant of z, and x is in the West tile of y, then x could be in:
- The North tile of z
- The Northeast tile of z
- The Northwest tile of z

No, this doesn't feel right. I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let's get back to the basic understanding:

1. Cardinal direction relations are often represented using a 9-tile model.
2. When we say "y is Northeast of z", we mean y is in the Northeast tile of the partition centered at z.
3. When we say "x is West of y", we mean x is in the West tile of the partition centered at y.

Now, let's visualize this:

```
z's view:
+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |
| NW  |  N  | NE  |
|     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |
|  W  |  O  |  E  |
|     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |
| SW  |  S  | SE  |
|     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+

y's view:
+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |
| NW  |  N  | NE  |
|     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |
|  W  |  O  |  E  |
|     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |     |
| SW  |  S  | SE  |
|     |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+
```

We know:
- y is in the NE tile of z's view.
- x is in the W tile of y's view.

Now, we need to find out which tile of z's view x could be in.

If y is in the NE tile of z, then y is both north and east of z. If x is in the W tile of y, then x is west of y.

Since y is north of z, and x is on the same north-south line as y (since x is directly west of y), x is also north of z.

Since y is east of z, and x is west of y, x could be:
- Still east of z (if x is not far enough west of y to cross the north-south line through z)
- On the same east-west line as z (if x is exactly as far west of y as y is east of z)
- West of z (if x is further west of y than y is east of z)

So, x could be in the North tile, Northeast tile, or Northwest tile of z's view.

Actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to approach it more directly.

In cardinal direction reasoning, we often use a coordinate system. If z is at the origin (0, 0):
- For y to be Northeast of z, y must be in the quadrant where both x and y coordinates are positive. So, y could be at coordinates (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0.
- For x to be West of y, x must be in the west half-plane of y. So, x could be at coordinates (a - c, b) where c > 0. This means x is directly west of y (same y-coordinate, smaller x-coordinate).

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to check which quadrant of z x falls into.

x is at (a - c, b):
- For x to be in the Northeast quadrant of z, we need a - c > 0 and b > 0. We already know b > 0, so we just need a - c > 0, which means a > c.
- For x to be in the North quadrant of z, we need a - c = 0 and b > 0. We already know b > 0, so we just need a - c = 0, which means a = c.
- For x to be in the Northwest quadrant of z, we need a - c < 0 and b > 0. We already know b > 0, so we just need a - c < 0, which means a < c.

Since a and c are arbitrary positive numbers, all three cases are possible. So, x could be Northeast, North, or Northwest of z.

I'm being a bit indecisive now, but I think we have it. The possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast
2. North
3. Northwest

Actually, I need to be more careful about the definitions of cardinal directions. I'm assuming that:
- "Northeast" means the region is in the northeast quadrant.
- "North" means the region is directly north (on the same longitude).
- "Northwest" means the region is in the northwest quadrant.
- "West" means the region is directly west (on the same latitude).

Under these definitions, if:
- z is at (0, 0),
- y is at (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0 (Northeast of z),
- x is at (a - c, b) where c > 0 (West of y),

Then:
- For x to be in the Northeast quadrant of z, we need a - c > 0 and b > 0. This can happen if a > c, which is entirely possible.
- For x to be in the Northwest quadrant of z, we need a - c < 0 and b > 0. This can happen if a < c, which is also entirely possible.
- For x to be directly North of z, we need a - c = 0 and b > 0. This can happen if a = c, which is a specific case but still possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast (if a > c)
2. North (if a = c)
3. Northwest (if a < c)

Given that a and c are arbitrary positive values, all three relations are possible.

Actually, maybe I need to reconsider the definition of "West" in the context of the problem. If x is West of y, does this mean:
1. x is directly to the west of y (same latitude, less longitude), or
2. x is in the western half-plane relative to y (less longitude, any latitude)?

I assumed definition 1 in my analysis, but it's possible that the problem intended definition 2.

Under definition 2, if y is at (a, b), then x could be at (a - c, b + d) for some c > 0 and any d (positive, negative, or zero).

In that case, the possible relations between x and z would be more varied, including South, Southwest, West, etc. But I think definition 1 is more commonly used in these types of problems, so I'll stick with my analysis using that definition.

OK, let's try a different approach. Let's use a grid-based model, where the space is divided into 9 regions based on a reference point. For a reference point p, the regions are:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | O | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Where O is the same location as p.

Now, given the statement "Region y is Northeast of region z", we place z at the center and y in the NE region.

```
   |   | y
---+---+---
   | z |  
---+---+---
   |   |  
```

Given the statement "Region x is West of region y", we place y at the center and x in the W region.

```
   |   |  
---+---+---
 x | y |  
---+---+---
   |   |  
```

Now, to find the possible relations between x and z, we need to see where x can be relative to z. Given the two constraints, x can be:

```
 x |   |  
---+---+---
   | z | y
---+---+---
   |   |  
```

or 

```
   | x |  
---+---+---
   | z | y
---+---+---
   |   |  
```

or

```
   |   | x
---+---+---
   | z | y
---+---+---
   |   |  
```

Actually, x cannot be in the NE region of z, because x is West of y, and y is in the NE region of z. So, the third case is not valid.

But I'm still not sure about the second case. Let's double-check.

Given:
- y is in the NE region of z
- x is in the W region of y

Let's consider a specific example to clarify. Say:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, 1) (NE of z)
- For x to be W of y, x is at (-1, 1) (assuming the W region is directly to the west)

In this case, x is at (-1, 1), which is NW of z.

But if:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (1, 1) (NE of z)
- For x to be W of y, x is at (0, 1) (assuming the W region means just to the west)

In this case, x is at (0, 1), which is N of z.

So, based on the constraints and the model I'm using, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. North
2. Northwest

But wait, I think I'm still not addressing the problem correctly. I'm using a grid-based model, but the problem is asking about cardinal direction relations. Let's use the right model for the cardinal direction calculus.

In the cardinal direction calculus, space is typically divided into 8 or 9 tiles based on a reference object. The tiles are: Northwest (NW), North (N), Northeast (NE), West (W), Origin/Center/Equal (O/C/EQ), East (E), Southwest (SW), South (S), and Southeast (SE).

Let's define the tiles more precisely:
- N: y > 0, x = 0
- NE: y > 0, x > 0
- E: y = 0, x > 0
- SE: y < 0, x > 0
- S: y < 0, x = 0
- SW: y < 0, x < 0
- W: y = 0, x < 0
- NW: y > 0, x < 0
- O/C/EQ: y = 0, x = 0

With these definitions, if:
- z is at (0, 0),
- y is in the NE tile of z, so y is at (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0,
- x is in the W tile of y, so x is at (a - c, b) where c > 0 (assuming W means directly west).

The relation between x and z depends on the values of a and c:
- If a > c, then x is at (a - c, b) where a - c > 0 and b > 0, which puts x in the NE tile of z.
- If a = c, then x is at (0, b) where b > 0, which puts x in the N tile of z.
- If a < c, then x is at (a - c, b) where a - c < 0 and b > 0, which puts x in the NW tile of z.

OK, I think I'm now confident in my answer. The possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast (if a > c)
2. North (if a = c)
3. Northwest (if a < c)

Actually, there's one more thing to consider. The definition of "West" in the problem statement.

In the strictest sense, when we say "x is West of y" in the cardinal direction calculus, we mean x is in the W tile of y. This would mean x is directly west of y (same latitude, less longitude).

However, it's also possible that "West" could refer to a broader concept, which includes all tiles to the west of y (NW, W, SW). In that case, x could be at coordinates (a - c, b + d) for some c > 0 and any d.

But I think the most common interpretation in the context of the cardinal direction calculus would be the stricter definition, where "West" refers specifically to the W tile.

Given that, and the reasoning I've gone through above, I'm confident in my answer:

The possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast (if a > c)
2. North (if a = c)
3. Northwest (if a < c)

Since we can't determine the exact values of a and c from the problem statement, all three relations are possible.

Ok, I'm overthinking this. Let me start with precise definitions and provide a clearer derivation:

In the Cardinal Direction Calculus, when we say "region y is Northeast of region z," we mean that y is located in the Northeast quadrant relative to z. Similarly, when we say "region x is West of region y," we mean that x is located directly to the west of y.

Let's set up a coordinate system with z at the origin (0, 0).

Given that y is Northeast of z, y is located at some point (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

Given that x is West of y, x is located at (a - c, b) for some c > 0. This means x is directly to the west of y (same y-coordinate, smaller x-coordinate).

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to compare the coordinates of x (a - c, b) with the coordinates of z (0, 0).

Case 1: If a - c > 0, then x is to the east of z. Since b > 0, x is to the north of z. So, x is Northeast of z.
Case 2: If a - c = 0, then x is directly north of z (since b > 0). So, x is North of z.
Case 3: If a - c < 0, then x is to the west of z. Since b > 0, x is to the north of z. So, x is Northwest of z.

Since we can't determine the exact values of a and c from the problem statement, all three relations are possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast
2. North
3. Northwest

Actually, we're really overthinking the problem. Let's simplify it.

The cardinal direction relations are defined as follows:
- Northeast: The region is in the northeastern quadrant (both north and east).
- North: The region is directly north (same longitude, greater latitude).
- Northwest: The region is in the northwestern quadrant (both north and west).
- West: The region is directly west (same latitude, less longitude).

Given:
- y is Northeast of z
- x is West of y

Visually, this means:
```
    N
    |
x -- y
    |
    z
    |
    S
```

From this visualization, we can see that x is north of z and could be west, on the same longitude, or east of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast (if x is east of z)
2. North (if x is on the same longitude as z)
3. Northwest (if x is west of z)

Actually, the "north of z" part isn't obvious from the diagram. Let's verify.

Given y is Northeast of z, y is both north and east of z.
Given x is West of y, x is on the same latitude as y but west of it.
Since y is north of z, and x is on the same latitude as y, x is also north of z.

Now, for the east-west relation:
- If x is west of y by a small amount, x might still be east of z (since y is east of z). In this case, x is Northeast of z.
- If x is west of y by exactly the amount that y is east of z, x will be on the same longitude as z. In this case, x is North of z.
- If x is west of y by a large amount, x will be west of z. In this case, x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast
2. North
3. Northwest

Now I think I can explain this a bit more clearly. I'll use a coordinate system to understand where the points could be, with z at the origin.

First, we know that y is Northeast of z. This means that y is at position (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

Next, we know that x is West of y. This means that x is at position (a - c, b) for some c > 0, so x is directly west of y.

Now, we want to determine the cardinal relation between x and z. That is, we need to determine which direction x is from z.

The position of x relative to z is (a - c, b). Let's analyze this:
- The y-coordinate of x is b, which is greater than 0. This means x is North of z.
- The x-coordinate of x is a - c. This could be positive (if a > c), zero (if a = c), or negative (if a < c).
  - If a - c > 0, then x is East of z. Combined with the fact that x is North of z, this means x is Northeast of z.
  - If a - c = 0, then x is neither East nor West of z. Since x is North of z, the cardinal relation is just North.
  - If a - c < 0, then x is West of z. Combined with the fact that x is North of z, this means x is Northwest of z.

Since a and c are arbitrary positive numbers, all three cases are possible. Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast (if a > c)
2. North (if a = c)
3. Northwest (if a < c)

This is my final answer.

Actually, let me visualize it to make sure I'm right:

```
        ^ North
        |
        |
        |
        |
   x    |    y
   .    |    .
        |
        |
        +----------> East
        |
        |
        |
        |
        z
        .
        |
        |
```

In this diagram, I've placed z at the origin, with the North direction pointing upward and the East direction pointing to the right. I've placed y in the Northeast quadrant relative to z, which means y is both north and east of z. I've placed x directly west of y, which means x is on the same horizontal line as y but further to the west.

From this diagram, we can see that x is north of z. Depending on how far west x is from y, x could be:
- East of z (if x is not too far west of y), making x Northeast of z.
- On the same vertical line as z (if x is exactly as far west of y as y is east of z), making x North of z.
- West of z (if x is further west of y than y is east of z), making x Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast
2. North
3. Northwest

It's clearer now. Let me visually represent the 3 cases to make sure:

Case 1: x is Northeast of z (a > c)
```
        ^ North
        |
        |
   x    |    y
   .    |    .
        |
        |
        +----------> East
        |
        |
        |
        z
        .
        |
```

Case 2: x is North of z (a = c)
```
        ^ North
        |
        |
        |
   x    |    y
   .    |    .
        |
        |
        +----------> East
        |
        |
        z
        .
        |
```

Case 3: x is Northwest of z (a < c)
```
        ^ North
        |
        |
        |
   x    |    y
   .    |    .
        |
        |
        +----------> East
        |
        z
        .
        |
        |
```

Yep, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. Northeast
2. North
3. Northwest

ANSWER:

The question asks about possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Northeast of region z

To solve this, I need to determine where x could be in relation to z.

Since y is Northeast of z, it means y is both north and east of z.
Since x is West of y, it means x is directly west of y (same latitude, less longitude).

The position of x relative to z depends on how far west x is from y:

1. If x is west of y by a small amount (less than y is east of z), then x would still be east of z while remaining north of z. This makes x Northeast of z.

2. If x is west of y by exactly the same amount that y is east of z, then x would be directly north of z. This makes x North of z.

3. If x is west of y by a large amount (more than y is east of z), then x would be west of z while remaining north of z. This makes x Northwest of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.
