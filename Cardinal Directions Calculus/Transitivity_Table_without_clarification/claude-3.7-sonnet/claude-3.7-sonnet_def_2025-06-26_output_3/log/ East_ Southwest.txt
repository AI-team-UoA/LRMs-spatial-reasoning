PROMPT: Let  East and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I need to reason about the possible relation between region x and region z, given that region x is East of region y, and region y is Southwest of region z.

Let's use some notation to make this clearer. Let's denote "region x is East of region y" as $x E y$, and "region y is Southwest of region z" as $y SW z$.

We know that $x E y$ and $y SW z$. We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

The cardinal directions are North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest. I'll denote them as N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, respectively.

Let's think about what it means for a region to be East of another. If region x is East of region y, then x is located directly to the east of y. Similarly, if region y is Southwest of region z, then y is located to the southwest of z.

Now, let's think about where region x could be relative to region z. 

Given that:
- x is East of y
- y is Southwest of z

Let's visualize this:

```
        z
       /
      /
     y -- x
```

Here, y is Southwest of z, and x is East of y. 

Now, the question is: what direction is x from z?

From the diagram, it seems like x could be South of z, or perhaps Southeast of z. But I should be more precise in my reasoning.

Actually, let's use a coordinate system to represent the directions more accurately. Suppose we have a coordinate system where:
- North corresponds to the positive y-axis.
- East corresponds to the positive x-axis.
- South corresponds to the negative y-axis.
- West corresponds to the negative x-axis.
- Northeast corresponds to a direction along the line y = x for x > 0.
- Southeast corresponds to a direction along the line y = -x for x > 0.
- Southwest corresponds to a direction along the line y = -x for x < 0.
- Northwest corresponds to a direction along the line y = x for x < 0.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0).

If y is Southwest of z, then y is at a position (a, b) where a < 0 and b < 0, and a and b are related by the line b = a. Let's say y is at (-d, -d) for some d > 0.

Now, if x is East of y, then x is at a position (c, b) where c > a. In our case, x is at a position (c, -d) where c > -d.

Now, the direction from z to x is determined by the position of x relative to z. The position of x is (c, -d) where c > -d, and z is at (0, 0).

For x to be:
- North of z: -d would need to be > 0, which is not possible.
- South of z: -d would need to be < 0, which is true.
- East of z: c would need to be > 0.
- West of z: c would need to be < 0.

So, x is definitely South of z. Now, whether x is East, West, Southeast, or Southwest of z depends on the value of c.

Actually, let me back up. I made an error. If y is at (-d, -d) for some d > 0, and x is East of y, then x is at a position (c, -d) where c > -d. This means c could be negative, zero, or positive.

For x to be:
- East of z: c > 0.
- West of z: c < 0.
- Exactly South of z: c = 0.

So, x could be:
- South of z (when c = 0).
- Southeast of z (when c > 0).
- Southwest of z (when c < 0).

Actually, I missed something. I was assuming that "East" means "directly East" in a coordinate system. But in the context of regions, "East" might mean "anywhere to the east". Let me refine my understanding.

When we say "region x is East of region y", it means every point in region x is East of some point in region y, and every point in region y is West of some point in region x. Mmm but this doesn't sound right either. Let's check the formal definition of cardinal direction relations in the context of regions.

Hmm, actually I think "East" has a very specific interpretation with respect to Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. Let me reconsider.

Given two regions, we can define their MBRs, which are the smallest rectangles (with sides parallel to the axes) that completely contain the regions.

The cardinal direction relations are then defined based on the relative positions of these MBRs. For instance, "region x is East of region y" means the MBR of x is entirely to the east of the MBR of y, with no overlap in the x-coordinate.

Actually, let me not overthink this. Let's just use a simple coordinate system and interpret "East" and "Southwest" as cardinal directions.

If y is Southwest of z, then y is located at a position that is both South and West of z. Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Then, y is at a position (a, b) where a < 0 and b < 0.

If x is East of y, then x is at a position (c, b) where c > a.

Now, the direction from z to x is determined by the position of x relative to z. The position of x is (c, b) where c > a and a < 0, and z is at (0, 0).

For x to be:
- East of z: c > 0.
- West of z: c < 0.
- North of z: b > 0.
- South of z: b < 0.

Given that b < 0 (since y is South of z and x is at the same y-coordinate as y), x is definitely South of z.

Now, regarding the East-West direction, since a < 0 and c > a, c could be negative, zero, or positive. Depending on the value of c, x could be:
- East of z: c > 0.
- West of z: c < 0.
- Exactly South of z: c = 0.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South (when c = 0).
- Southeast (when c > 0).
- Southwest (when c < 0).

Actually, I made an error again. I'm assuming that "x is East of y" places x and y at the same y-coordinate, which might not be the case for regions. Let me reconsider again. I think I'm overcomplicating this, so let me try one more approach.

Let's use a simple model for the Cardinal Direction Relations based on splitting the 2D space around a region into 9 areas: Northwest, North, Northeast, West, the region itself, East, Southwest, South, and Southeast. This is similar to how the Region Connection Calculus works.

Given this model, if y is Southwest of z, it means y is in the southwest area of z. And if x is East of y, it means x is in the east area of y.

Now, the question is: where can x be relative to z?

Actually, the coordinates approach is easier. So let's continue. If we use bounding boxes for the regions, we can place the bounding box for z at the origin.

If y is Southwest of z, then the bounding box for y is in the southwest quadrant, with coordinates all negative. Let's say y is bounded by the region x_y is in [a, b] and y_y is in [c, d] with a, b, c, d all negative.

Now, if x is East of y, then the bounding box for x has x-coordinates that are all greater than the x-coordinates of y. Let's say x is bounded by the region x_x is in [e, f] and y_x is in [g, h].

Given that x is East of y, we have e > b.

Now, the relation between x and z depends on the position of the bounding box of x relative to the origin. Specifically:
- If f < 0, then x is West of z.
- If e > 0, then x is East of z.
- If e < 0 and f > 0, then x has a part that is West of z and a part that is East of z.
- If h < 0, then x is South of z.
- If g > 0, then x is North of z.
- If g < 0 and h > 0, then x has a part that is South of z and a part that is North of z.

Given the constraints, we know that y_x can range from c to d, which are both negative. Therefore, g and h can be anywhere from c to d, which means x is definitely South of z.

However, the x-coordinates of x, namely e and f, could vary. We know that e > b (which is negative), but e could still be negative, zero, or positive. Similarly, f could be negative, zero, or positive (as long as f > e).

Based on these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest (when f < 0, meaning x is entirely West of z).
- South (when e < 0 and f > 0, meaning x spans both West and East of z).
- Southeast (when e > 0, meaning x is entirely East of z).

But this model has problems. For example, if a region is directly east of the origin, it's not northeast or southeast; it's just east. Let me double check against the standard model for cardinal direction calculus.

After reviewing, it seems that my model is reasonable. In the Cardinal Direction Calculus, the space around a reference region is partitioned into 9 tiles: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE (where B is the bounding box of the reference region itself).

Given this model, if y is Southwest of z, it means y is in the SW tile of z. And if x is East of y, it means x is in the E tile of y.

Now, the question is: where can x be relative to z?

Given the constraints:
- y is in the SW tile of z.
- x is in the E tile of y.

x could be in various tiles of z depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z. Let's enumerate the possibilities:

1. x could be in the S tile of z if it is directly South of z.
2. x could be in the SW tile of z if it is South and West of z.
3. x could be in the SE tile of z if it is South and East of z.
4. x could be in the W tile of z if it is directly West of z.
5. x could be in the B tile of z if it overlaps with z's bounding box.
6. x could be in the E tile of z if it is directly East of z.

However, given that y is in the SW tile of z and x is in the E tile of y, some of these possibilities might be ruled out. For example, if y is Southwest of z and x is East of y, it's unlikely that x would be in the NW, N, or NE tiles of z.

After consideration, and given the constraints that y is in the SW tile of z and x is in the E tile of y, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (South)
- SE (Southeast)
- E (East)
- SW (Southwest)
- W (West)
- B (Bounding Box)

Actually, let me draw this out more clearly. Suppose we have z with a bounding box, and the 9 tiles around it:

```
NW | N | NE
---|---|---
W  | B | E
---|---|---
SW | S | SE
```

Now, y is in the SW tile of z. Let's represent this:

```
NW | N | NE
---|---|---
W  | B | E
---|---|---
SW | S | SE
 y |   |
```

Now, x is in the E tile of y. Let's represent this:

```
  NW  |  N  | NE
------|------|----
  W   |  B  | E
------|------|----
  SW  |  S  | SE
  y   |     |
------|------|----
      |     | x
```

Hmm, but this isn't right, since the E tile of y isn't properly represented in this grid. 

Let me redefine the tiles relative to y. If y is at the origin, then the tiles around y are:

```
NW(y) | N(y) | NE(y)
------|------|------
W(y)  | B(y) | E(y)
------|------|------
SW(y) | S(y) | SE(y)
```

Now, x is in the E(y) tile. Given that y is in the SW tile of z, and z is North-East of y, then the relation between x and z could be various, as x could be anywhere in the E(y) tile. It depends on the exact positioning.

Hmm, I'm realizing we're going around circles. Let me try a different approach.

Let's try to use the concept of the composition of cardinal direction relations. If y is Southwest of z, then z is Northeast of y. And if x is East of y, we want to find the possible relations between x and z.

I'm having trouble with this, so let's approach it from an intuitive perspective.

If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- If z is Northeast of y, then z is somewhere in the positive quadrant (z_x > 0, z_y > 0).
- If x is East of y, then x is somewhere along the positive x-axis (x_x > 0, x_y = 0).

Now, the relation between x and z depends on the exact positions of x and z. Given the constraints:
- x_x > 0, x_y = 0 (x is East of y)
- z_x > 0, z_y > 0 (z is Northeast of y)

The relation from x to z would be:
- x_x < z_x, x_y < z_y -> x is Southwest of z
- x_x = z_x, x_y < z_y -> x is South of z
- x_x > z_x, x_y < z_y -> x is Southeast of z

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

But wait, I think I misunderstood the original problem. Let's go back to the original problem:

Given that region x is East of region y, and region y is Southwest of region z, what are the possible relations between region x and region z?

I think I was confusing myself by trying to place y at the origin. Let's place z at the origin for clarity.

If y is Southwest of z, and z is at the origin, then y is in the third quadrant (negative x, negative y). Let's say y is at the point (-a, -b) for some positive a and b.

Now, if x is East of y, then x is located at a point (c, -b) where c > -a.

The relation between x and z (which is at the origin) depends on the value of c:
- If c < 0, then x is in the third quadrant, which means x is Southwest of z.
- If c = 0, then x is on the negative y-axis, which means x is South of z.
- If c > 0, then x is in the fourth quadrant, which means x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

But I'm not entirely satisfied with this approach, because I'm just picking a specific location for y, not a whole region. Let me rethink.

If I have regions instead of points, I could use the Bounding Box model, where a region is approximated by the smallest rectangle that fully contains it. Then, we can use the center of the bounding box of z as our reference point, and define the 9 tiles around it. Let me try this approach.

Let's say we have regions x, y, and z, and we're using the center of z's bounding box as our reference point. The space around z is divided into 9 tiles: NW, N, NE, W, B (the Bounding Box of z), E, SW, S, and SE.

Given that y is Southwest of z, it means y is in the SW tile. And given that x is East of y, it means x is in the E tile of y.

Now, the question is: which tiles of z can x possibly be in?

Let's imagine the situation.

Tiles of z:
```
NW | N | NE
---|---|---
W  | B | E
---|---|---
SW | S | SE
```

y is in the SW tile, so we have:
```
NW | N | NE
---|---|---
W  | B | E
---|---|---
SW | S | SE
y  |   |
```

Now, given that x is East of y, x is in the E tile of y, which means x is to the right of y. Depending on the exact position of y within the SW tile and the position of x, x could be in various tiles of z.

Let's try to determine the possible locations of x. If y is in the SW tile and x is East of y, then there are multiple possibilities for where x could be. But all these possibilities are on the east side of y.

If we imagine y spanning across the entire SW tile of z, and x being East of every point in y, then x would cover the S and SE tiles of z, and potentially parts of the B and E tiles as well.

However, if y is confined to a smaller part of the SW tile, the possible locations for x could be even more restricted. For instance, if y is in the lower left corner of the SW tile, then x being East of y could place it anywhere in the rest of the SW tile, as well as the S, SE, and potentially other tiles.

After carefully considering the problem, it seems the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- SW (Southwest)
- S (South)
- SE (Southeast)
- W (West)
- B (Bounding Box)
- E (East)

But I'm not entirely confident in this result, because the cardinal direction relations depend on the exact boundaries of the regions, and I'm making assumptions about the positions of x, y, and z.

Actually, I'm overthinking. The problem is about the composition of cardinal direction relations, which is a standard problem in the field of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning. Let's find the answer to this specific question. 

The composition of "East" and "Southwest" is:

East ○ Southwest = { Southwest, South, Southeast, West, Bounding Box, East }

This means if x is East of y and y is Southwest of z, then x could be Southwest, South, Southeast, West, Bounding Box, or East of z.

Let me double check: I can imagine specific cases for each of these relationships. 

Southwest: If y is deeply southwest and x is only slightly east of y, then x could still be southwest of z.

South: If y is directly southwest and x is east of y, x could be directly south of z.

Southeast: If y is southwest and x is significantly east of y, x could be southeast of z.

West: If y is almost directly west but slightly south of z, and x is east of y, x could be directly west of z.

Bounding Box: If y is southwest of z but very close to z, and x is east of y, x could overlap with z.

East: If y is almost directly south but slightly west of z, and x is east of y, x could be directly east of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- Bounding Box
- East

To be 100% sure, let me look up the composition of cardinal direction relations for "East ○ Southwest" to confirm my answer.

Actually, given my reasoning I think the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- Bounding Box
- East

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- Bounding Box
- East

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- Bounding Box
- East
