PROMPT: Let North and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

In this problem, we're trying to figure out the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z based on the given information. We know:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

I'll analyze what these constraints mean for the relation between x and z.

First, let's think about what "North" means. If x is North of y, then x is located directly above y. 

Second, let's consider what "Southwest" means. If y is Southwest of z, then y is located diagonally below and to the left of z.

Now, let's visualize this scenario:

z is at some position.
y is to the southwest of z, so y is diagonally below and to the left of z.
x is to the north of y, so x is directly above y.

So if we imagine a coordinate system, with higher y-coordinates representing "more north" and higher x-coordinates representing "more east", we might have:

z at position (z_x, z_y)
y at position (y_x, y_y) where y_x < z_x and y_y < z_y
x at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x = y_x and x_y > y_y

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to compare x_x to z_x and x_y to z_y.

We know:
- x_x = y_x < z_x
- x_y > y_y < z_y

The relation between x_y and z_y is not determined from these constraints. We have x_y > y_y and y_y < z_y, but that doesn't tell us whether x_y is greater than, less than, or equal to z_y.

Let's consider different possibilities.

Case 1: If x_y < z_y
Given that x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y, x would be to the southwest of z. This is a valid possibility.

Case 2: If x_y = z_y
Given that x_x < z_x and x_y = z_y, x would be to the west of z. This is a valid possibility.

Case 3: If x_y > z_y
Given that x_x < z_x and x_y > z_y, x would be to the northwest of z. This is a valid possibility.

Let me double-check these conclusions by visualizing the spatial relationships.

Wait, I realized I made a mistake in my analysis above. Let me correct it.

First, I'm considering a coordinate system where the y-coordinate increases going north, and the x-coordinate increases going east.

Given that region x is North of region y, this means that x is directly above y. In coordinates, if y is at position (y_x, y_y), then x would be at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x = y_x and x_y > y_y.

Given that region y is Southwest of region z, this means that y is diagonally below and to the left of z. In coordinates, if z is at position (z_x, z_y), then y would be at position (y_x, y_y) where y_x < z_x and y_y < z_y.

Combining these, we have:
- x is at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x = y_x and x_y > y_y.
- y is at position (y_x, y_y) where y_x < z_x and y_y < z_y.

We can infer that x_x = y_x < z_x (x is to the left of z) and x_y > y_y < z_y (but the relation between x_y and z_y is uncertain).

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z based on the relation between x_y and z_y:

Case 1: If x_y < z_y
In this case, x would be to the west of z because x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y. But actually, if x_y < z_y and x_x < z_x, then x would be to the southwest of z.

Let me rethink this...

If x_y < z_y and x_x < z_x, then x is below and to the left of z, which corresponds to x being southwest of z.

Case 2: If x_y = z_y
In this case, x would be directly to the left of z because x_x < z_x and x_y = z_y. This corresponds to x being west of z.

Case 3: If x_y > z_y
In this case, x would be above and to the left of z because x_x < z_x and x_y > z_y. This corresponds to x being northwest of z.

So, given the constraints, x could be southwest, west, or northwest of z.

Wait, let me verify again.

Actually, there might be a mistake. I've been a bit confused, because there's some variation between how people define the cardinal directions in terms of a coordinate system.

Let's be more systematic. Let's define the following spatial relations:

North: (0, 1)
Northeast: (1, 1)
East: (1, 0)
Southeast: (1, -1)
South: (0, -1)
Southwest: (-1, -1)
West: (-1, 0)
Northwest: (-1, 1)

Here, (0, 1) means there's no change in the x-coordinate but a positive change in the y-coordinate (moving north). Similarly, (-1, -1) means a negative change in both x and y coordinates (moving southwest).

Given:
- Region x is North of region y, which means the relative position of x with respect to y is (0, 1).
- Region y is Southwest of region z, which means the relative position of y with respect to z is (-1, -1).

To find the relation between x and z, we need to find the relative position of x with respect to z.

The relative position of x with respect to y is (0, 1).
The relative position of y with respect to z is (-1, -1).

To find the relative position of x with respect to z, we add these vectors:
(0, 1) + (-1, -1) = (-1, 0)

This means x is West of z.

But wait, I might be making a mistake here. Let's visualize the spatial relationships clearly.

The spatial relation "North" means the y-coordinate increases, but the x-coordinate remains the same.
The spatial relation "Southwest" means both the x and y coordinates decrease.

Hmm, I think the vector approach doesn't work quite right here, because the description of the spatial relationships is not symmetric. Let's take a literal, coordinate-based approach.

We can establish a 2D coordinate system (x, y) where increasing y means going north and increasing x means going east.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y, which means x has the same x-coordinate as y but a higher y-coordinate. If y is at position (a, b), then x is at position (a, b+δ) where δ > 0.
- Region y is Southwest of region z, which means y has a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than z. If z is at position (c, d), then y is at position (c-ε, d-η) where ε, η > 0.

Now we know that x is at position (a, b+δ) and y is at position (c-ε, d-η). But we also know that y is at position (a, b). So, we can equate these:
a = c-ε
b = d-η

This gives us:
c = a+ε
d = b+η

Given these, x is at position (a, b+δ).

Let's determine the relation between x and z.
z is at position (c, d) = (a+ε, b+η).
x is at position (a, b+δ).

To determine the cardinal direction of x relative to z, we need to find the difference in coordinates.
x_x - z_x = a - (a+ε) = -ε < 0
x_y - z_y = (b+δ) - (b+η) = δ - η, which could be positive, negative, or zero depending on the relative values of δ and η.

Let's consider the different cases:

Case 1: δ > η
In this case, x_y > z_y, which means x is "higher" (more north) than z. Combined with x being "more left" (more west) than z, this means x is Northwest of z.

Case 2: δ = η
In this case, x_y = z_y, which means x is at the same "height" (north-south direction) as z. Combined with x being "more left" than z, this means x is directly West of z.

Case 3: δ < η
In this case, x_y < z_y, which means x is "lower" (more south) than z. Combined with x being "more left" than z, this means x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, I want to be really sure, so I'll approach this problem differently, but I think I was on the right track.

North means that the y-coordinate is higher, but the x-coordinate is the same.
Southwest means that both the x and y coordinates are lower.

Let's set up the problem with coordinates:
- Suppose z is at position (z_x, z_y).
- Given that y is Southwest of z, y is at position (y_x, y_y) where y_x < z_x and y_y < z_y.
- Given that x is North of y, x is at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x = y_x and x_y > y_y.

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
We have x_x = y_x < z_x, which means x is to the west of z.
We have x_y > y_y < z_y, but this doesn't tell us how x_y compares to z_y.

Let's consider the possibilities:
- If x_y < z_y, then x is to the southwest of z.
- If x_y = z_y, then x is to the west of z.
- If x_y > z_y, then x is to the northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Let's do this one more time, focusing on the cardinal directions:

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z.

Let's visualize this:

```
      N
      |
W-----+-----E
      |
      S
```

In this cardinal system, North means moving up, South means moving down, East means moving right, and West means moving left. Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest are the diagonal combinations.

Now, if x is North of y, it means x is directly above y. If y is Southwest of z, it means y is diagonally below and to the left of z.

Let's visualize the positions of x, y, and z:

```
      z
     /
    /
   y
   |
   |
   x
```

Note that this is just one possible visualization. The actual alignment of x and y along the North-South axis and the alignment of y and z along the Southwest-Northeast axis can vary, as long as the given cardinal relations are satisfied.

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to consider all the consistent arrangements.

From our visualization, we can see that x is to the left of z (because y is to the left of z, and x is directly below y). But the vertical position of x relative to z can vary.

Let's think about this systematically. If we denote the east-west axis as the x-axis and the north-south axis as the y-axis (with north being the positive y-direction), then:

- x is North of y means: (x_x, x_y) = (y_x, y_y + a) for some a > 0.
- y is Southwest of z means: (y_x, y_y) = (z_x - b, z_y - c) for some b, c > 0.

Combining these:
(x_x, x_y) = (z_x - b, z_y - c + a)

So:
- x_x = z_x - b < z_x, which means x is to the west of z.
- x_y = z_y - c + a, which is z_y + (a - c). The relation between x_y and z_y depends on the relative values of a and c.

Case 1: a < c
In this case, x_y < z_y, which means x is to the south of z. Combined with x being to the west of z, this means x is to the southwest of z.

Case 2: a = c
In this case, x_y = z_y, which means x is neither north nor south of z. Combined with x being to the west of z, this means x is directly to the west of z.

Case 3: a > c
In this case, x_y > z_y, which means x is to the north of z. Combined with x being to the west of z, this means x is to the northwest of z.

Based on the given information, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Alright, one last check. Let's define the coordinate system and the cardinal directions:

- The x-axis goes from west to east (left to right), with east being the positive direction.
- The y-axis goes from south to north (bottom to top), with north being the positive direction.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y: This means x has the same x-coordinate as y but a higher y-coordinate.
- Region y is Southwest of region z: This means y has a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than z.

Let's say:
- z is at position (z_x, z_y).
- y is at position (y_x, y_y) where y_x < z_x and y_y < z_y (because y is southwest of z).
- x is at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x = y_x and x_y > y_y (because x is north of y).

From these, we can conclude that x is at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x < z_x (because x_x = y_x < z_x) and the relation between x_y and z_y is undetermined (because x_y > y_y < z_y).

Now, let's consider the possible cardinal directions based on the relation between x_y and z_y:

- If x_y < z_y, then x is below z (more south) and to the left of z (more west). This corresponds to x being Southwest of z.
- If x_y = z_y, then x is at the same height as z (neither north nor south) and to the left of z (more west). This corresponds to x being West of z.
- If x_y > z_y, then x is above z (more north) and to the left of z (more west). This corresponds to x being Northwest of z.

So, based on the given information, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

I'm consistently arriving at the same answer, so I'm confident in it. The possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Wait, I think I got confused with the directions. Let me clarify:

- North: Directly above
- Northeast: Above and to the right
- East: Directly to the right
- Southeast: Below and to the right
- South: Directly below
- Southwest: Below and to the left
- West: Directly to the left
- Northwest: Above and to the left

Ok, now let's solve the problem clearly.

Let's place all regions on a coordinate plane, with the y-axis pointing north and the x-axis pointing east:

If region x is North of region y, then x has the same x-coordinate as y and a higher y-coordinate.
If region y is Southwest of region z, then y has a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than z.

Let's say:
- z is at position (z_x, z_y)
- y is at position (y_x, y_y) where y_x < z_x and y_y < z_y (because y is Southwest of z)
- x is at position (x_x, x_y) where x_x = y_x and x_y > y_y (because x is North of y)

From this, we can conclude that:
- x_x = y_x < z_x, which means x is to the west of z
- x_y > y_y < z_y, which tells us that x_y > y_y and y_y < z_y, but doesn't determine the relation between x_y and z_y

Let's consider the three possible cases:

Case 1: x_y < z_y
In this case, x is to the west and south of z, which means x is Southwest of z.

Case 2: x_y = z_y
In this case, x is directly to the west of z, which means x is West of z.

Case 3: x_y > z_y
In this case, x is to the west and north of z, which means x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Alright, it seems like my reasoning is very consistent. Based on the given information:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Great, I have the answer: Northwest, West, Southwest.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

Let me determine the possible relations between region x and region z:

When I visualize this on a coordinate system (with North being up and East being right):
- x is directly above y (same east-west position but more northerly)
- y is to the southwest of z (less easterly and less northerly than z)

Combining these facts, I can determine that:
- x is always west of z (since x and y share the same east-west position, and y is west of z)
- The north-south relationship between x and z is undetermined

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest (if x is north of z)
- West (if x is at the same north-south level as z)
- Southwest (if x is south of z)
