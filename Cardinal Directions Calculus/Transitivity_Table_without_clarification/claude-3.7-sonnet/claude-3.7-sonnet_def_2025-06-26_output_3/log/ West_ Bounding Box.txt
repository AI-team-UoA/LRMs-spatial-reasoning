PROMPT: Let  West and  Bounding Box be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Bounding Box of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step. 

We are given that:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Bounding Box of region z

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

First, let me clarify what these relations mean:
- "x is West of y" means that x is located to the west of y, so x is to the left of y on a map.
- "y is Bounding Box of z" means that z is completely contained within y. In other words, y fully encloses or surrounds z.

Now, if x is West of y, and z is completely contained within y (i.e., y is the Bounding Box of z), what does this tell us about the relationship between x and z?

Since z is contained within y, z must be somewhere inside y. And since x is West of y, x must be to the west of any point within y, including all points in z. Therefore, x must be West of z.

However, there might be more specific relations possible depending on where exactly z is located within y. 

Let's consider a few cases:
1. If z is located in the western part of y (but still contained within y), then x is West of z.
2. If z is located in the northern part of y, then x might be Northwest of z.
3. If z is located in the southern part of y, then x might be Southwest of z.

But regardless of where z is within y, x will always be to the west of z in some capacity.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (definitely)
- Northwest (possibly, if z is in the southern part of y)
- Southwest (possibly, if z is in the northern part of y)

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. If z can be anywhere inside y, then the relation between x and z could be:
- West (if z spans the entire north-south extent of y or is centrally located)
- Northwest (if z is in the southern part of y)
- Southwest (if z is in the northern part of y)

Wait, let me reconsider this again. If y is the Bounding Box of z, then z can be anywhere inside y, including touching the boundary of y. So, if z touches the western boundary of y, then x might not be strictly West of z, but might overlap with z in some way.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the definitions:
- "x is West of y" means that x is located entirely to the west of y, with no overlap.
- "y is Bounding Box of z" means that z is completely contained within y.

Given these definitions, if x is entirely to the west of y, and z is completely contained within y, then x must be entirely to the west of z as well. So, the relation between x and z is definitely West.

But, I need to consider the possibility that z might not occupy the entire area of y. If z is in a specific part of y, then the relation between x and z might be more specific.

If z is in the northern part of y, then x is West and slightly south of z, which would make x Southwest of z.
If z is in the southern part of y, then x is West and slightly north of z, which would make x Northwest of z.

Actually, let me think about this differently. Let's place this on a coordinate system:

Let's say that y is located at coordinates (1, 1) to (3, 3). That's a square region from (1, 1) to (3, 3).

Then, since x is West of y, x might be located at coordinates (-2, 1) to (0, 3). This puts x entirely to the west of y.

Now, since y is the Bounding Box of z, z must be contained within y. Z could be at coordinates (1.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 2.5), for example.

Given these coordinates:
- x is at (-2, 1) to (0, 3)
- z is at (1.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 2.5)

It's clear that x is entirely to the west of z, so the relation is West.

However, if z is at coordinates (1, 1) to (2, 2) (the bottom-left corner of y), then x is both to the west and partly to the north of z. This could be interpreted as Northwest.

Similarly, if z is at coordinates (1, 2) to (2, 3) (the top-left corner of y), then x is both to the west and partly to the south of z. This could be interpreted as Southwest.

Given these considerations, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest

But this is only true if we assume that the Bounding Box relation allows for z to be positioned anywhere within y.

Actually let me consider it directly. We have that y is the Bounding Box of z. That means that z is contained within y. So the bounding box (i.e., the smallest rectangle with sides parallel to the axes that contains z) is y.

Let's think about the cardinal directions. The cardinal direction relation "x West of y" means that x is strictly to the left of y. So, for any point in x and any point in y, the x-coordinate of the point in x is less than the x-coordinate of the point in y.

Now, if y is the Bounding Box of z, then z is contained within y. This means that for any point in z, there's a corresponding point in y with the same coordinates.

Given that x is West of y, and y contains z, it follows that x is also West of z. This is because any point in x has an x-coordinate less than any point in y, and consequently, less than any point in z.

However, if z doesn't occupy the entire region of y, there might be more specific relations:

If z is positioned in the northern part of y, then x might be Southwest of z.
If z is positioned in the southern part of y, then x might be Northwest of z.
If z spans the entire north-south extent of y, then x is directly West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest

Ok, but I'm still not being very concrete, because there's a precise definition of the cardinal directions. Let me be explicit. We have the following standard definitions:

1. x North of y if and only if min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y) and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
2. x South of y if and only if max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y) and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
3. x East of y if and only if min_x(x) ≥ max_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
4. x West of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
5. x Northeast of y if and only if min_x(x) ≥ max_x(y) and min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y).
6. x Northwest of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y).
7. x Southeast of y if and only if min_x(x) ≥ max_x(y) and max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y).
8. x Southwest of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y).
9. x Bounding Box of y if y is contained within x.

Let's denote the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of a region r as min_x(r) and max_x(r), respectively, and similarly for y-coordinates.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y: max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y.
- Region y is Bounding Box of region z: z is contained within y, which means min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z) and max_x(z) ≤ max_x(y), and similarly for y-coordinates.

From the first condition, we have max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y).
From the second condition, we have min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z).

Combining these, we get max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z), which simplifies to max_x(x) ≤ min_x(z). This means x is to the west of z in terms of x-coordinates.

Now, for the y-coordinates, the first condition states that there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y. Let's denote this as: min_y(y) ≤ max_y(x) and min_y(x) ≤ max_y(y).

From the second condition, we know that z is contained within y in terms of y-coordinates, which means min_y(y) ≤ min_y(z) and max_y(z) ≤ max_y(y).

Given these constraints, there are three possibilities for the y-coordinate relationship between x and z:

1. x and z have an overlap in y-coordinates: min_y(z) ≤ max_y(x) and min_y(x) ≤ max_y(z). This would make x West of z.

2. x is entirely above z in terms of y-coordinates: min_y(x) > max_y(z). This would make x Northwest of z.

3. x is entirely below z in terms of y-coordinates: max_y(x) < min_y(z). This would make x Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest

Actaully, I believe the definitions I provided are correct. Let me double-check the Northwest and Southwest cases:

- x Northwest of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y).
- x Southwest of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y).

I think the Northwest definition is wrong. Let's correct it:

- x Northwest of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y).

But this doesn't make sense either, because it would mean that x is both to the west and to the north of y, which is the definition of Northwest.

Let me rethink the cardinal direction definitions:

1. x North of y if and only if min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y) and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
2. x South of y if and only if max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y) and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
3. x East of y if and only if min_x(x) ≥ max_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
4. x West of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
5. x Northeast of y if and only if min_x(x) ≥ max_x(y) and min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y).
6. x Northwest of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y).
7. x Southeast of y if and only if min_x(x) ≥ max_x(y) and max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y).
8. x Southwest of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y).

These definitions now seem correct. Let's reapply them to our problem.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y: max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y, which means min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x).
- Region y is Bounding Box of region z: z is contained within y, which means min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z) and max_x(z) ≤ max_x(y), and similarly for y-coordinates.

For the x-coordinate relation between x and z, we have max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z), which simplifies to max_x(x) ≤ min_x(z). This confirms that x is to the west of z in terms of x-coordinates.

For the y-coordinate relation, we know that z is contained within y, which means min_y(y) ≤ min_y(z) ≤ max_y(z) ≤ max_y(y).

Given the constraint that there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y (min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x)), we need to determine the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z.

There are several possibilities:

1. x and z have an overlap in y-coordinates: min_y(x) < max_y(z) and min_y(z) < max_y(x). This would make x West of z.

2. x is entirely above z in terms of y-coordinates: min_y(x) ≥ max_y(z). This would make x Northwest of z.

3. x is entirely below z in terms of y-coordinates: max_y(x) ≤ min_y(z). This would make x Southwest of z.

Given the constraints, all three scenarios are possible depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest

Actually, the definitions I gave for Northwest and Southwest aren't consistent with the way I'm answering the question. Let me clarify the definitions again.

For the cardinal direction "Northwest", it means that the region is both to the north and to the west of another region. Similarly, for "Southwest", it means the region is both to the south and to the west of another region.

Let's use the formal definitions:

- x North of y if and only if min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y) and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
- x South of y if and only if max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y) and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
- x East of y if and only if min_x(x) ≥ max_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
- x West of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.

For the composite directions:

- x Northeast of y if and only if min_x(x) ≥ max_x(y) and min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y) (i.e., x is both East and North of y).
- x Northwest of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and min_y(x) ≥ max_y(y) (i.e., x is both West and North of y).
- x Southeast of y if and only if min_x(x) ≥ max_x(y) and max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y) (i.e., x is both East and South of y).
- x Southwest of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and max_y(x) ≤ min_y(y) (i.e., x is both West and South of y).

For the Bounding Box relation:
- x Bounding Box of y if y is contained within x, which means min_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and max_x(y) ≤ max_x(x), and similarly for y-coordinates.

Given our problem:
- Region x is West of region y: max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
- Region y is Bounding Box of region z: z is contained within y.

For the x-coordinate relation between x and z, we have max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z), which means x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate relation, we need to consider the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z. We know that z is contained within y, so min_y(y) ≤ min_y(z) ≤ max_y(z) ≤ max_y(y).

Given that there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y, we have min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x).

There are several possibilities for the y-coordinate relationship between x and z:

1. x and z have an overlap in y-coordinates: min_y(x) < max_y(z) and min_y(z) < max_y(x). In this case, x is West of z.

2. x is entirely above z in terms of y-coordinates: min_y(x) ≥ max_y(z). In this case, x is Northwest of z.

3. x is entirely below z in terms of y-coordinates: max_y(x) ≤ min_y(z). In this case, x is Southwest of z.

Given the constraints, all three scenarios are possible depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z. So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest

Let me visualize this to be sure:

Let's consider a scenario:
- y is a square with coordinates (1, 1) to (3, 3).
- x is a square with coordinates (-1, 1) to (0, 3). This puts x entirely to the west of y with an overlap in y-coordinates.
- z can be anywhere inside y.

Scenario 1: z is a small square at the center of y, e.g., (1.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 2.5).
In this case, x is West of z.

Scenario 2: z is a small square at the top of y, e.g., (1.5, 2.5) to (2.5, 3).
In this case, x is West of z (since there's an overlap in y-coordinates).

Scenario 3: z is a small square at the very top of y, e.g., (1.5, 2.9) to (2.5, 3).
In this case, there's just a tiny overlap in y-coordinates, but x is still West of z.

Scenario 4: z is a small square at the very bottom of y, e.g., (1.5, 1) to (2.5, 1.1).
Similarly, there's just a tiny overlap in y-coordinates, but x is still West of z.

Scenario 5: z is a very small square at the very top of y, e.g., (1.5, 2.95) to (2.5, 3).
In this case, the overlap in y-coordinates is even smaller, but x is still West of z.

Looking at these scenarios, it seems that if z is anywhere inside y, the relation between x and z will always be West, not Northwest or Southwest. This is because if z is inside y, and there's an overlap in y-coordinates between x and y, then there will always be an overlap in y-coordinates between x and z as well.

Hmm I'm overthinking it. Let me just be concrete. If y is a square with coordinates (1, 1) to (3, 3) and z is a small square with coordinates (1.1, 2.9) to (1.2, 3), then z is mostly in the top-left corner of y. Now, if x is a square with coordinates (-1, 1) to (0, 3), then x is to the west of z, but there's little overlap in the y-coordinates. As z moves towards the top-left corner of y, the overlap in y-coordinates between x and z decreases.

Actually, I still think it's important to be precise. Let's reason more carefully, focusing on the constraints given by the West and Bounding Box relations.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y: max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates, which means min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x).
- Region y is Bounding Box of region z: z is contained within y, which means min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z) ≤ max_x(z) ≤ max_x(y), and similarly for y-coordinates.

For the x-coordinate relation between x and z, we have:
max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z)

This confirms that x is to the west of z in terms of x-coordinates.

For the y-coordinate relation, we have:
min_y(y) ≤ min_y(z) ≤ max_y(z) ≤ max_y(y)

and
min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x)

Hmm, wait, what I don't know is the relationship between min_y(z) and max_y(x). It could go either way. I think this is where I'm getting confused.

What this means is that the amount of overlap in the y-coordinates between x and z could vary. If there's substantial overlap, then x is West of z. If there's no overlap, then x is either Northwest or Southwest of z, depending on whether z is below or above x, respectively.

Actually let me try a specific example:

Let's say:
- y has coordinates (10, 10) to (20, 20).
- x has coordinates (0, 15) to (5, 25). This places x to the west of y with some overlap in y-coordinates.
- z has coordinates (12, 12) to (18, 18). This places z entirely inside y.

In this example, x is at (0, 15) to (5, 25), and z is at (12, 12) to (18, 18). We can check that max_x(x) = 5 < min_x(z) = 12, so x is to the west of z. We also have min_y(x) = 15 < max_y(z) = 18 and min_y(z) = 12 < max_y(x) = 25, which means there's an overlap in y-coordinates. So, in this example, x is West of z.

Now, let's modify the example slightly:
- y has coordinates (10, 10) to (20, 20).
- x has coordinates (0, 15) to (5, 25). This places x to the west of y with some overlap in y-coordinates.
- z has coordinates (12, 18) to (18, 19). This places z entirely inside y, but closer to the top.

In this modified example, max_x(x) = 5 < min_x(z) = 12, so x is to the west of z. But now, min_y(x) = 15 < max_y(z) = 19 and min_y(z) = 18 > min_y(x) = 15, which still means there's an overlap in y-coordinates. So, even in this modified example, x is West of z.

Let me try another example where z is placed closer to the bottom of y:
- y has coordinates (10, 10) to (20, 20).
- x has coordinates (0, 15) to (5, 25). This places x to the west of y with some overlap in y-coordinates.
- z has coordinates (12, 10) to (18, 12). This places z entirely inside y, but closer to the bottom.

In this example, max_x(x) = 5 < min_x(z) = 12, so x is to the west of z. But now, max_y(x) = 25 > min_y(z) = 10 and max_y(z) = 12 < min_y(x) = 15, which means there's no overlap in y-coordinates. Instead, x is entirely above z. So, in this example, x is Northwest of z.

Hold on, I think I made an error in my understanding of the West relation. The condition min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x) doesn't necessarily mean there's an overlap in the y-coordinates. It only means that the ranges of y-coordinates of x and y aren't completely disjoint.

For there to be an overlap in y-coordinates, we need min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x).

Ok what I think I'm doing wrong is using the wrong definition of the West relation. Let me redefine it:

x is West of y if and only if max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y. For there to be an overlap in y-coordinates, we need min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x).

Let's reapply this to our problem.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y: max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates, which means min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x).
- Region y is Bounding Box of region z: z is contained within y, which means min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z) ≤ max_x(z) ≤ max_x(y), and similarly for y-coordinates.

For the x-coordinate relation between x and z, we have:
max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z)

This confirms that x is to the west of z in terms of x-coordinates.

For the y-coordinate relation, we have:
min_y(y) ≤ min_y(z) ≤ max_y(z) ≤ max_y(y)

Given that there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of x and y, we have:
min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x)

Now, let's see if there's always an overlap in the y-coordinates of x and z:
min_y(x) < max_y(y) ≥ max_y(z) (since z is contained within y)
min_y(y) ≤ min_y(z) < max_y(x) (if min_y(z) is not too high)

The second condition, min_y(z) < max_y(x), is not guaranteed. If min_y(z) is high enough, it could be that min_y(z) ≥ max_y(x), which would mean there's no overlap in y-coordinates between x and z.

Similarly, the first condition, min_y(x) < max_y(z), is not guaranteed. If max_y(z) is low enough, it could be that max_y(z) ≤ min_y(x), which would also mean there's no overlap in y-coordinates.

So, if there's an overlap in y-coordinates between x and z, then x is West of z.
If there's no overlap and z is below x, then x is Northwest of z.
If there's no overlap and z is above x, then x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest

Actually, from my own examples above, I can be more concrete. If z has coordinates (12, 10) to (18, 12) and x has coordinates (0, 15) to (5, 25). In this case, max_y(z) = 12 and min_y(x) = 15, so z is below x, and the relation is Northwest of z.

Actually, no, that's backwards. If z is below x, then x is above z, meaning x is to the North of z, relative to z. I will try again:

Let me try another example where z is placed closer to the bottom of y:
- y has coordinates (10, 10) to (20, 20).
- x has coordinates (0, 15) to (5, 25). This places x to the west of y with some overlap in y-coordinates.
- z has coordinates (12, 10) to (18, 12). This places z entirely inside y, but closer to the bottom.

In this example, max_x(x) = 5 < min_x(z) = 12, so x is to the west of z. But now, max_y(z) = 12 < min_y(x) = 15, which means there's no overlap in y-coordinates. Instead, x is entirely above z. So, in this example, x is (to the northwest of z).

If z is entirely below x, then x is to the northwest of z. Similarly, if z is entirely above x, then x is to the southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (if there's an overlap in y-coordinates)
- Northwest (if z is entirely below x)
- Southwest (if z is entirely above x)

Wait I think I have it backwards still. Let me go back to the original definitions:
Northwest means both to the North and to the West.
Southwest means both to the South and to the West.

If x is Northwest of z, then x is both to the North and to the West of z. This means:
- max_x(x) ≤ min_x(z) (West)
- min_y(x) ≥ max_y(z) (North)

Similarly, if x is Southwest of z, then x is both to the South and to the West of z. This means:
- max_x(x) ≤ min_x(z) (West)
- max_y(x) ≤ min_y(z) (South)

Actually, what I had was fine. If z is closer to the bottom of y, and x is to the west of y with an overlap in y-coordinates, but z is so low that it doesn't overlap with x's y-coordinates and z is below x, then x is Northwest of z. This is because x is both to the North and to the West of z.

Let me try another example where z is placed closer to the bottom of y:
- y has coordinates (10, 10) to (20, 20).
- x has coordinates (0, 15) to (5, 25). This places x to the west of y with some overlap in y-coordinates.
- z has coordinates (12, 10) to (18, 12). This places z entirely inside y, but closer to the bottom.

In this example, max_x(x) = 5 < min_x(z) = 12, so x is to the west of z. Also, min_y(x) = 15 > max_y(z) = 12, which means x is to the north of z. So, in this example, x is Northwest of z.

Similarly, if z is closer to the top of y:
- y has coordinates (10, 10) to (20, 20).
- x has coordinates (0, 5) to (5, 15). This places x to the west of y with some overlap in y-coordinates.
- z has coordinates (12, 18) to (18, 20). This places z entirely inside y, but closer to the top.

In this example, max_x(x) = 5 < min_x(z) = 12, so x is to the west of z. Also, max_y(x) = 15 < min_y(z) = 18, which means x is to the south of z. So, in this example, x is Southwest of z.

Hmm, but, when we say there's an overlap in y-coordinates, we mean:
min_y(x) < max_y(y) and min_y(y) < max_y(x).

So, let me think differently. If y has coordinates (10, 10) to (20, 20), and if the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than 10 and the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than 20, then x is entirely within the y-range of y. In this case, if z spans the entire y-range of y, then x is West of z.

But if z doesn't span the entire y-range of y and is placed such that there's no overlap in y-coordinates with x, then x can be Northwest or Southwest of z, depending on the specific placement.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- West (if there's an overlap in y-coordinates)
- Northwest (if z is entirely below x)
- Southwest (if z is entirely above x)

Ok so I think the possible relations between x and z are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest

But I think some more thought needs to go into whether or not there could be any other possible relations. If region x is West of region y, and region y is the Bounding Box of region z, what else could the relation between x and z be?

Given that y is the Bounding Box of z, z is entirely contained within y. And given that x is West of y, x is entirely to the west of y with some overlap in the y-coordinates.

The key constraint we need to check is whether x could be the Bounding Box of z, i.e., whether z could be entirely contained within x.

From our given conditions, we know that max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z). This means x is entirely to the west of z, so z cannot be contained within x. Therefore, the relation "x is Bounding Box of z" is not possible.

Are there any other cardinal direction relations we haven't considered?
- North: This would require min_y(x) ≥ max_y(z) and an overlap in x-coordinates. But we know max_x(x) ≤ min_x(z), which means there's no overlap in x-coordinates. So, North is not possible.
- South: This would require max_y(x) ≤ min_y(z) and an overlap in x-coordinates. Again, there's no overlap in x-coordinates, so South is not possible.
- East: This would require min_x(x) ≥ max_x(z). But we know max_x(x) ≤ min_x(y) ≤ min_x(z) ≤ max_x(z), which contradicts the condition for East. So, East is not possible.
- Northeast: This would require min_x(x) ≥ max_x(z) and min_y(x) ≥ max_y(z). As we've seen, min_x(x) ≥ max_x(z) is not possible. So, Northeast is not possible.
- Southeast: This would require min_x(x) ≥ max_x(z) and max_y(x) ≤ min_y(z). Again, min_x(x) ≥ max_x(z) is not possible. So, Southeast is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are limited to:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest

Great, so to summarize:

Given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Bounding Box of region z

The possible relations between x and z are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest

These are the only possible relations given the constraints.

ANSWER:

Given the information that:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Bounding Box of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

First, let's understand what these relations mean:
- "x is West of y" means x is entirely to the west of y with some overlap in y-coordinates
- "y is Bounding Box of z" means z is completely contained within y

Since x is West of y, we know that x is entirely to the west of any point in y. And since z is completely contained within y, x must also be entirely to the west of z.

However, the exact relation depends on the vertical positioning of z within y:

1. If there's a vertical overlap between x and z, then x is West of z
2. If z is positioned in the lower part of y such that it's entirely below x, then x is Northwest of z
3. If z is positioned in the upper part of y such that it's entirely above x, then x is Southwest of z

The possible relations are:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest
