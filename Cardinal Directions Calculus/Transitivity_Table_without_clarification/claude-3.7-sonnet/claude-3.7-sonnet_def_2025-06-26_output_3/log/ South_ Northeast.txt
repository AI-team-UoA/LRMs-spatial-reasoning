PROMPT: Let  South and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I need to figure out the possible cardinal direction relation between regions x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z.

First, let's be clear about the cardinal directions:
- North (N): directly above
- Northeast (NE): above and to the right
- East (E): directly to the right
- Southeast (SE): below and to the right
- South (S): directly below
- Southwest (SW): below and to the left
- West (W): directly to the left
- Northwest (NW): above and to the left
- Bounding Box (BB): one region completely contains the other

Now, let's visualize this:
- x is South of y: This means x is directly below y.
- y is Northeast of z: This means y is above and to the right of z.

If we put these together:
- z is to the southwest of y (since y is to the northeast of z)
- x is to the south of y

So, where could x be in relation to z?

Let's think about this spatially. If z is to the southwest of y, and x is to the south of y, then x could be:
- Southeast of z: If x is slightly to the east of the line connecting z and y.
- South of z: If x is directly below z (which is possible if y is directly north of z, and x is directly south of y).
- Southwest of z: If x is slightly to the west of the line connecting z and y.
- East of z: If x is directly to the right of z.
- Bounding Box relation with z: If one region completely contains the other.

Hmm, on second thought, I don't think East is a possible relation between x and z based on the given conditions. Let me reconsider.

Given:
- x is South of y
- y is Northeast of z

This means:
- z is Southwest of y
- x is South of y

Now, let's think about where x could be in relation to z.

If we visualize these as points on a grid, with North being up and East being right:
- If y is at position (0, 0)
- Then z could be at position (-1, -1) because z is Southwest of y
- And x could be at position (0, -1) because x is South of y

In this scenario, x would be Southeast of z.

But there are other possibilities. Let's try a few more positions:
- If y is at position (0, 0)
- Then z could be at position (-2, -1) because z is Southwest of y
- And x could be at position (0, -1) because x is South of y

In this scenario, x would be Southeast of z.

Let's try one more:
- If y is at position (0, 0)
- Then z could be at position (-1, -2) because z is Southwest of y
- And x could be at position (0, -1) because x is South of y

In this scenario, x would be East of z.

So, based on these scenarios, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Southeast of z
- East of z

But let me think about this more systematically. If:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (0, -a) for some positive a (since x is South of y)
- z is at position (-b, -c) for some positive b and c (since z is Southwest of y)

Then the relation between x and z depends on the relative values of a, b, and c:
- If a < c, then x is North of z
- If a = c, then x is neither North nor South of z (on the same horizontal level)
- If a > c, then x is South of z

And:
- If 0 < b, then x is East of z
- If 0 = b, then x is neither East nor West of z (on the same vertical line)
- If 0 > b, which isn't possible given our assumption, then x would be West of z

Combining these:
- If a < c and 0 < b, then x is Northeast of z
- If a = c and 0 < b, then x is East of z
- If a > c and 0 < b, then x is Southeast of z

Given the constraints, it seems that the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast of z
- East of z
- Southeast of z

Now let me double-check this analysis by visualizing the scenario differently:

We have three regions: x, y, and z.
- y is Northeast of z, which means z is Southwest of y.
- x is South of y.

So the question is: where can x be in relation to z?

Let's think about this in terms of their relative positions on a 2D plane:
- If z is Southwest of y, it means z is below and to the left of y.
- If x is South of y, it means x is directly below y.

So, x is directly below y, and z is below and to the left of y.

If we draw a straight line from z to x, the direction of this line could be:
- Southeast (if x is more to the right than z, which is the case in our scenario)
- East (if x is directly to the right of z, which can happen if y is directly above z, and x is directly below y)
- Northeast (if x is to the right and above z, which seems counterintuitive given that both x and z are below y, but it's technically possible if z is very far below y and x is not as far below)

I'm not sure about the Bounding Box relation, as we're thinking of these regions in terms of their centers or representative points.

Let me reconsider again, perhaps more concretely:

Imagine a grid with coordinates. If:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (0, -1) (South of y)
- z is at position (-1, -1) (Southwest of y)

In this case, x is East of z.

Now, let's try another configuration:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (0, -2) (South of y)
- z is at position (-1, -1) (Southwest of y)

In this case, x is Southeast of z.

And let's try one more:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (0, -1) (South of y)
- z is at position (-1, -2) (Southwest of y)

In this case, x is Northeast of z.

So based on these examples, it seems the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Northeast of z
- East of z
- Southeast of z

Actually, I'm realizing that the Bounding Box relation isn't applicable here because we're dealing with cardinal direction relations, which assume that regions are represented by their centroids or representative points. The Bounding Box relation is more about containment than direction.

So, the answer is that the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Northeast of z
- East of z
- Southeast of z

Actually, now I'm having second thoughts about Northeast. Let me check that case again.

If:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- z is at position (-1, -2) (Southwest of y)
- x is at position (0, -1) (South of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (1, 1), which is Northeast of z.

This seems correct. But let me try a few more configurations to be certain.

If:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- z is at position (-2, -1) (Southwest of y)
- x is at position (0, -1) (South of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (2, 0), which is East of z.

If:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- z is at position (-1, -0.5) (Southwest of y)
- x is at position (0, -1) (South of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (1, -0.5), which is Southeast of z.

So, based on these examples, it seems the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Let me just double-check the Northeast case again, because it's a bit counterintuitive.

If y is Northeast of z, it means z is Southwest of y. If x is South of y, one might initially think that x is below y, which should place it South, Southeast, or Southwest of z. But the Northeast relation is possible due to the relative positions.

For instance, if:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (0, 0) (Southwest of y)
- x is at position (1, 0) (South of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (1, 0), which is East of z, not Northeast.

Let's try another configuration:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (0, 0) (Southwest of y)
- x is at position (1, -1) (South of y, but further South than just (1, 0))

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (1, -1), which is Southeast of z, not Northeast.

So, I'm revising my answer. The possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- East
- Southeast

Let me triple-check with one more example:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (-1, -1) (Southwest of y, but further Southwest)
- x is at position (1, 0) (South of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (2, 1), which is Northeast of z.

So, Northeast is a possible relation after all.

Let me also check if South is a possible relation:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (1, -1) (Southwest of y, but directly South with a bit of West)
- x is at position (1, 0) (South of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (0, 1), which is North of z.

No, that doesn't work. z is Southwest of y, so z cannot be directly South of y; it must also be to the West.

Let's try again:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (0, 0) (Southwest of y)
- x is at position (1, 0) (South of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (1, 0), which is East of z.

Let's try one more:
- y is at position (2, 2)
- z is at position (0, 0) (Southwest of y)
- x is at position (2, 0) (South of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (2, 0), which is East of z.

So, based on these checks, it seems the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Let me try a few more configurations to check if South is a possible relation:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (0, 0) (Southwest of y)
- x is at position (1, -1) (South of y, but further South)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (1, -1), which is Southeast of z, not South.

Let's try another:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (-1, 0) (Southwest of y, but more West than South)
- x is at position (1, 0) (South of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (2, 0), which is East of z, not South.

Given the constraints (x is South of y, and y is Northeast of z), it doesn't seem possible for x to be South of z. Similarly, it doesn't seem possible for x to be West, Northwest, or Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, let's make sure I'm being systematic here. Let's define our coordinate system with y at the origin (0, 0). Then:
- x is at position (0, -a) for some positive a (since x is South of y)
- z is at position (-b, -c) for some positive b and c (since z is Southwest of y)

The relation between x and z can be determined by comparing their coordinates.

The East-West relation is determined by comparing the x-coordinates:
- If 0 > -b, which is always true, then x is East of z.

The North-South relation is determined by comparing the y-coordinates:
- If -a > -c, then x is South of z.
- If -a = -c, then x is neither North nor South of z (on the same horizontal level).
- If -a < -c, then x is North of z.

Simplifying:
- If a < c, then x is North of z.
- If a = c, then x is neither North nor South of z.
- If a > c, then x is South of z.

Combining these:
- If a < c and 0 > -b (always true), then x is Northeast of z.
- If a = c and 0 > -b (always true), then x is East of z.
- If a > c and 0 > -b (always true), then x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Northeast (if a < c)
- East (if a = c)
- Southeast (if a > c)

This confirms our previous analysis. The possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Let me double-check the South relation again. If:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (0, -a) for some positive a (since x is South of y)
- z is at position (-b, -c) for some positive b and c (since z is Southwest of y)

For x to be South of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be the same as z's x-coordinate (0 = -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be less than z's y-coordinate (-a < -c)

But this is not possible because 0 ≠ -b (since b is positive). So, South is not a possible relation between x and z.

What about Southwest? For x to be Southwest of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be less than z's x-coordinate (0 < -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be less than z's y-coordinate (-a < -c)

Again, this is not possible because 0 > -b (since b is positive). So, Southwest is not a possible relation between x and z.

And North? For x to be North of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be the same as z's x-coordinate (0 = -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be greater than z's y-coordinate (-a > -c)

This is not possible because 0 ≠ -b. So, North is not a possible relation between x and z.

Similarly, Northwest and West are also not possible relations between x and z.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, let me quadruple check the Southwest case. If:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (0, -a) for some positive a (since x is South of y)
- z is at position (-b, -c) for some positive b and c (since z is Southwest of y)

For x to be Southwest of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be less than z's x-coordinate (0 < -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be less than z's y-coordinate (-a < -c)

But 0 < -b is false for positive b. So, Southwest is not a possible relation.

For completeness, let's check the remaining directions:

For x to be West of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be less than z's x-coordinate (0 < -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be the same as z's y-coordinate (-a = -c)

Again, 0 < -b is false for positive b. So, West is not a possible relation.

For x to be Northwest of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be less than z's x-coordinate (0 < -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be greater than z's y-coordinate (-a > -c)

0 < -b is false for positive b. So, Northwest is not a possible relation.

For x to be North of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be the same as z's x-coordinate (0 = -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be greater than z's y-coordinate (-a > -c)

0 = -b is false for positive b. So, North is not a possible relation.

So, my final answer remains: the possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Hold on, let me ensure consistency in my notations. If:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (0, -a) for some positive a (since x is South of y)
- z is at position (-b, -c) for some positive b and c (since z is Southwest of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at position (0 - (-b), -a - (-c)) = (b, c - a).

The cardinal direction of x from z's perspective depends on the signs of these components:
- If b > 0 and c - a > 0, then x is Northeast of z.
- If b > 0 and c - a = 0, then x is East of z.
- If b > 0 and c - a < 0, then x is Southeast of z.

Since b is positive, the East component is always positive. The North-South component depends on the relative values of a and c.

Given our constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast (if c > a)
- East (if c = a)
- Southeast (if c < a)

This is consistent with our previous analysis. So, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Given the question's phrasing and structure, I believe I should choose from the given options: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

Based on our analysis, the answer is:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, for completeness, let me verify the possibility of a bounding box relation. In a bounding box relation, one region completely contains the other. Given our cardinal direction constraints, it doesn't seem immediately clear if a bounding box relation is possible.

If one region completely contains the other, the centroids of the two regions might not have a specific cardinal direction relation. However, given our original constraints (x is South of y and y is Northeast of z), it seems like the relative positions of x, y, and z are determined by their centroids, and the bounding box relation is not being considered. So, I'll stick with my current answer.

To summarize, based on our analysis, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

But wait, I'm noticing that the question is asking about which relations "could" be possible, implying there might be more than one possibility.

Given the constraints, the relative positions of x, y, and z could have different configurations, leading to different cardinal direction relations between x and z. Our analysis has shown that the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Northeast (if x is to the right and above z)
- East (if x is directly to the right of z)
- Southeast (if x is to the right and below z)

So, my final answer is:
The possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, could be: Northeast, East, or Southeast.

Actually, wait a second. Could South be a possible relation between x and z? Let me think of a concrete case:

If:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (0, -1)

In this case, y is Northeast of z and x is South of y. Furthermore, x is directly South of z.

But wait, this doesn't make sense because if x is South of y, it should be at a position (1, 0) in our current setup, not at (0, -1).

Let me re-think. If:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (1, 0)

In this case, y is Northeast of z and x is South of y. However, x is East of z, not South of z.

Hmm, but what if:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (1, 0)
- x is at position (1, 0)

This doesn't work because y is not Northeast of z; y is North of z.

Let me try once more. If:
- y is at position (1, 1)
- z is at position (0, 1)
- x is at position (1, 0)

This doesn't work because y is not Northeast of z; y is East of z.

Actually, I've overcomplicated things. Let's stick with our original coordinate system, with y at the origin (0, 0):
- x is at position (0, -a) for some positive a (since x is South of y)
- z is at position (-b, -c) for some positive b and c (since z is Southwest of y)

For x to be South of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be the same as z's x-coordinate (0 = -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be less than z's y-coordinate (-a < -c)

This is not possible because 0 ≠ -b for positive b. So, South is not a possible relation between x and z.

I think I got confused with the Northeast relation. Let me reconsider that.

From z's perspective, x is at position (0 - (-b), -a - (-c)) = (b, c - a).

For x to be Northeast of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be greater than z's x-coordinate (b > 0)
- x's y-coordinate to be greater than z's y-coordinate (c - a > 0)

Since b is positive, the first condition is always met. The second condition is met if c > a.

So, x is Northeast of z if c > a, which is certainly a possibility.

Similarly, x is East of z if c = a, and x is Southeast of z if c < a.

So, our analysis remains: the possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, let me carefully draw this out using a concrete example, and then generalize. Let's use a coordinate system where positive y is North, and positive x is East.

Given:
- x is South of y, which means y is at (x_x, y_y) and x is at (x_x, y_y - d) for some positive d.
- y is Northeast of z, which means z is at (y_x - e, y_y - f) for some positive e and f.

So, x is at (x_x, y_y - d) and z is at (y_x - e, y_y - f). The relation between x and z depends on the relative positions of these points.

Let's calculate the vector from z to x:
(x_x - (y_x - e), (y_y - d) - (y_y - f)) = (x_x - y_x + e, f - d)

If x_x = y_x, which is the case when x is directly South of y, the vector is (e, f - d).

The cardinal direction of this vector is determined by its components:
- If e > 0 and f - d > 0, then x is Northeast of z.
- If e > 0 and f - d = 0, then x is East of z.
- If e > 0 and f - d < 0, then x is Southeast of z.

Since e is positive, the vector always has a positive x-component. This means x is always to the East of z. The North-South relation depends on the values of f and d.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast (if f > d)
- East (if f = d)
- Southeast (if f < d)

This is consistent with our previous analysis.

Actually, I notice the analysis above I made the assumption that x is directly South of y, which means its x-coordinate is the same as y's. But the problem only specifies that x is South of y, not necessarily directly South. If x is "South" of y, it could be to the Southeast, South, or Southwest of y.

Actually no, as I think about this more, if x is South of y, that is specifically the cardinal direction South, not Southeast or Southwest. The cardinal direction relation "South" means directly to the South of y. Similarly, if y is "Northeast" of z, it is specifically at the Northeast of z, not just North or East.

With this clearer understanding, let's reconsider our analysis:
- If y is at position (0, 0)
- If x is South of y, then x is at position (0, -a) for some positive a.
- If y is Northeast of z, then z is at position (-b, -c) for some positive b and c.

From z's perspective, x is at position (0 - (-b), -a - (-c)) = (b, c - a).

This vector's direction determines the cardinal relation of x from z:
- If b > 0 and c - a > 0, then x is Northeast of z.
- If b > 0 and c - a = 0, then x is East of z.
- If b > 0 and c - a < 0, then x is Southeast of z.

Since b is positive, the vector always has a positive x-component. The y-component depends on the values of c and a.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast (if c > a)
- East (if c = a)
- Southeast (if c < a)

And it's reasonable to expect all three of these to be possible given the constraints.

So, my final answer is:
The possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, could be: Northeast, East, or Southeast.

I think my answer is correct. Let me one more time consider if any other cardinal directions are possible. For the sake of thoroughness, let me check if North, South, Southwest, West, Northwest could be possible relations:

North: For x to be North of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be the same as z's x-coordinate (0 = -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be greater than z's y-coordinate (-a > -c)

This is not possible because 0 ≠ -b for positive b. So, North is not a possible relation.

South: For x to be South of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be the same as z's x-coordinate (0 = -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be less than z's y-coordinate (-a < -c)

This is not possible because 0 ≠ -b for positive b. So, South is not a possible relation.

Southwest: For x to be Southwest of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be less than z's x-coordinate (0 < -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be less than z's y-coordinate (-a < -c)

This is not possible because 0 > -b for positive b, not 0 < -b. So, Southwest is not a possible relation.

West: For x to be West of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be less than z's x-coordinate (0 < -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be the same as z's y-coordinate (-a = -c)

This is not possible because 0 > -b for positive b, not 0 < -b. So, West is not a possible relation.

Northwest: For x to be Northwest of z, we need:
- x's x-coordinate to be less than z's x-coordinate (0 < -b)
- x's y-coordinate to be greater than z's y-coordinate (-a > -c)

This is not possible because 0 > -b for positive b, not 0 < -b. So, Northwest is not a possible relation.

Bounding Box: For a bounding box relation, one region completely contains the other. Given the constraints, it doesn't seem like we have enough information to determine if such a relation is possible. But if we're treating regions as points or centroids for cardinal direction relations, a bounding box relation doesn't seem applicable here.

So, after thorough analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

These cardinal direction relations are the only ones that satisfy the given constraints.

Actually, I want to make sure that I have the terminology correct. Based on my understanding, cardinal directions refer to the 8 directions of the compass: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), and Northwest (NW).

For clarity, I've been operating under the assumption that "South" means directly to the South, not to the Southeast or Southwest. Similarly, "Northeast" means specifically to the Northeast. These are precise directions, not general areas.

Given this precision, when I say "x is South of y", I mean that x is directly below y, with the same East-West coordinate. And when I say "y is Northeast of z", I mean that y is above and to the right of z, at a 45-degree angle.

With this understanding, my analysis remains:

Given:
- x is South of y
- y is Northeast of z

This means:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- x is at position (0, -a) for some positive a
- z is at position (-b, -c) for some positive b and c

From z's perspective, x is at position (b, c - a).

If c > a, then x is Northeast of z.
If c = a, then x is East of z.
If c < a, then x is Southeast of z.

All of these are possible given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

I'm confident in this answer.

Actually, to ensure complete clarity, let me just double check, using a concrete example, whether the cardinal directions are as I've defined them.

If:
- y is at (1, 1)
- If x is South of y, then x is at (1, 0).
- If y is Northeast of z, then z is at (0, 0).

In this scenario, x is at (1, 0) and z is at (0, 0). The direction from z to x is East.

Let's try another:
- y is at (1, 1)
- If x is South of y, then x is at (1, 0).
- If y is Northeast of z, then z is at (0, -1).

In this scenario, x is at (1, 0) and z is at (0, -1). The direction from z to x is Northeast.

And one more:
- y is at (1, 1)
- If x is South of y, then x is at (1, -1).
- If y is Northeast of z, then z is at (0, 0).

In this scenario, x is at (1, -1) and z is at (0, 0). The direction from z to x is Southeast.

These concrete examples confirm our analysis. The possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

WAIT. I'm getting confusing because of the definition of South. Let me go back to basics:
- North = (0, 1)
- South = (0, -1)
- East = (1, 0)
- West = (-1, 0)
- Northeast = (1, 1)
- Southeast = (1, -1)
- Northwest = (-1, 1)
- Southwest = (-1, -1)

Given:
- x is South of y
- y is Northeast of z

If y is at (0, 0), then:
- x is at (0, -a) for some positive a
- z is at (-b, -c) for some positive b and c

From z's perspective, x is at (b, c - a).

If c > a, then x is to the North of z's East-West line, and to the East of z's North-South line. So, x is to the Northeast of z.

If c = a, then x is on z's East-West line, and to the East of z's North-South line. So, x is to the East of z.

If c < a, then x is to the South of z's East-West line, and to the East of z's North-South line. So, x is to the Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

This is consistent with our original analysis.

Let me check a concrete example for the "South" case, to make sure it's impossible:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (0, -1) (South of y)
- z is at (-1, -1) (Southwest of y)

From z's perspective, x is at (1, 0), which is East of z, not South.

Let's try to manipulate the positions to see if x can be South of z:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (0, -1) (South of y)
- z is at (0, -2) (Southwest of y)

But this doesn't work because z is not Southwest of y; z is South of y.

The constraint that y is Northeast of z means z is Southwest of y. So, z is below and to the left of y. Given that x is South of y, x is directly below y. This places x to the right of the line connecting y and z, which means x must be to the East of z (or some combination of East with North or South, depending on the specific positions).

So, based on our analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, hold on. I might have been confusing myself. Let me ensure I have the definition of Northeast correct. If y is Northeast of z, it means y is above and to the right of z. Which means z is below and to the left of y. In other words, the vector from z to y is (a, b) for some positive a and b. This is consistent with how I've been describing it.

Using a North-up, East-right coordinate system, if y is at (0, 0), and y is Northeast of z, then z is at (-a, -b) for some positive a and b. If x is South of y, then x is at (0, -c) for some positive c.

From z's perspective, x is at (a, b - c).

The direction of this vector depends on the values of a, b, and c:
- If a > 0 and b - c > 0, then x is Northeast of z.
- If a > 0 and b - c = 0, then x is East of z.
- If a > 0 and b - c < 0, then x is Southeast of z.

Since a is positive, the first condition is always met. The second condition depends on the relative values of b and c.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, are:
- Northeast (if b > c)
- East (if b = c)
- Southeast (if b < c)

This is consistent with our previous analysis. I've just been re-explaining the same reasoning in different ways.

My final answer is:
The possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is South of y and y is Northeast of z, could be:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

Northeast
East
Southeast
