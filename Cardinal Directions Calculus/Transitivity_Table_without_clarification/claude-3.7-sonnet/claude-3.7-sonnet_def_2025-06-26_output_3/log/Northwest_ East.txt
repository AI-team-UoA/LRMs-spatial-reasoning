PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's reason through this. 

1) Region x is Northwest of region y.
2) Region y is East of region z.

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relation(s) between region x and region z.

Let's establish a coordinate system where:
- North corresponds to the positive y-axis.
- East corresponds to the positive x-axis.
- South corresponds to the negative y-axis.
- West corresponds to the negative x-axis.
- Northwest is in the direction of negative x and positive y.
- Northeast is in the direction of positive x and positive y.
- Southwest is in the direction of negative x and negative y.
- Southeast is in the direction of positive x and negative y.

Given that x is Northwest of y, this means x is in the northwest direction from y. So if y is at position (x_y, y_y), then x is at position (x_x, y_x) where x_x < x_y and y_x > y_y.

Given that y is East of z, this means y is in the east direction from z. So if z is at position (x_z, y_z), then y is at position (x_y, y_y) where x_y > x_z and y_y = y_z.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

- We know x_x < x_y and x_y > x_z.
- From these, we can't definitively conclude the relationship between x_x and x_z.

- We know y_x > y_y and y_y = y_z.
- From these, we can conclude that y_x > y_z.

Let's consider different cases:

1. If x_x > x_z:
   - y_x > y_z (already established)
   - x_x > x_z
   This means x is Northeast of z.

2. If x_x = x_z:
   - y_x > y_z (already established)
   - x_x = x_z
   This means x is North of z.

3. If x_x < x_z:
   - y_x > y_z (already established)
   - x_x < x_z
   This means x is Northwest of z.

Wait, let me rethink this. I think I made a mistake in setting up the coordinates.

Let's redefine our coordinate system more explicitly:
- (0, 0) is our reference point.
- North means y > 0, x = 0
- East means x > 0, y = 0
- South means y < 0, x = 0
- West means x < 0, y = 0
- Northwest means x < 0, y > 0
- Northeast means x > 0, y > 0
- Southwest means x < 0, y < 0
- Southeast means x > 0, y < 0

Given the information, let's place z at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity.

Since y is East of z, this means y is at a position like (x_y, 0) where x_y > 0.

Now, x is Northwest of y. This means x is at a position (x_x, y_x) where x_x < x_y and y_x > 0.

Given that x_y > 0 and x_x < x_y, we can have x_x > 0, x_x = 0, or x_x < 0.

Let's consider each case:

1. If x_x > 0:
   - y_x > 0 (already established)
   - x_x > 0
   This means x is Northeast of z.

2. If x_x = 0:
   - y_x > 0 (already established)
   - x_x = 0
   This means x is North of z.

3. If x_x < 0:
   - y_x > 0 (already established)
   - x_x < 0
   This means x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Actually, let me double-check this. I'm a bit unsure about the exact definitions of the cardinal direction relations in this context, especially when we're talking about regions rather than points.

Actually, let's go back to the very definition of cardinal directions between regions.

If region A is North of region B, then every point in A is North of some point in B, and there's at least one point in A that's North of every point in B.

For "Northwest", a region x is Northwest of region y if every point in x is to the north or west (or both) of some point in y, and there's at least one point in x that's to the north or west (or both) of every point in y.

Similarly, for "East", a region y is East of region z if every point in y is to the east of some point in z, and there's at least one point in y that's to the east of every point in z.

Now, given that x is Northwest of y and y is East of z, let's reason:

Since y is East of z, every point in y is to the east of some point in z, and there's at least one point in y (let's call it y_e) that's to the east of every point in z.

Since x is Northwest of y, every point in x is to the north or west (or both) of some point in y, and there's at least one point in x (let's call it x_nw) that's to the north or west (or both) of every point in y, including y_e.

Now, x_nw is to the north or west (or both) of y_e, and y_e is to the east of every point in z. This means x_nw is to the north of y_e (which is directly east of z), and possibly also to the west, depending on the exact positions.

Hmm, let me try a different approach with a concrete example.

Let's visualize this:

```
     N
     |
W----+----E
     |
     S
```

Suppose z is at the origin (the "+"), y is directly East of z, and x is Northwest of y.

Then, y could be at a position like E, and x could be at a position like N (North of y) or W (West of y) or somewhere in between (Northwest of y).

Now, relative to z, where is x?

- If x is directly North of y, and y is directly East of z, then x is Northeast of z.
- If x is directly West of y, and y is directly East of z, then x could be North, or it could be at the same latitude as z, making it directly North or at the same position as z.
- If x is truly Northwest of y, and y is directly East of z, then x can be North, Northeast, or Northwest of z, depending on the exact positions.

Let me try a more systematic approach.

Let's consider the bounding box of a region: the smallest rectangle aligned with the cardinal directions that completely contains the region.

Given two regions A and B, we can relate them based on the relative positions of their bounding boxes. For example, if every point in A's bounding box is to the north of every point in B's bounding box, then A is strictly North of B.

Actually, hmm, as I think about it more, the canonical definition of cardinal direction relations between regions can be more complex. There are different formalisms, and I'm not entirely clear which one is being referred to in this question. Let me try to derive the answer based on the direction calculus:

In the direction calculus, the Cardinal Direction Calculus defines relations between regions based on tiles. The 9-tile approach divides the space into 9 tiles with respect to a reference region. These tiles are: Northwest (NW), North (N), Northeast (NE), West (W), the reference region itself (O), East (E), Southwest (SW), South (S), and Southeast (SE).

Given that x is Northwest of y, this doesn't necessarily mean x is strictly in the NW tile with respect to y. It could be in N, W, or NW, or spanning multiple tiles.

Similarly, y being East of z means y is in the E tile with respect to z, or spanning multiple tiles including E.

Given these, it's challenging to conclusively determine the exact relation between x and z without more information.

But, let's think again using some logical deduction.

If x is Northwest of y, then x is in a position that is in a northwesterly direction from y.
If y is East of z, then y is in a position that is in an easterly direction from z.

Combining these, if we move from z to y (moving eastward), and then from y to x (moving northwestward), the combined movement from z to x could be in various directions, including North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Actually, I think there's still some ambiguity in how the cardinal direction relations are defined, especially when dealing with regions. Let me try to reason it out in a different way.

Let's consider two distinct points: one is in region x, and the other is in region z. Let's call these points px and pz, respectively.

We know that region x is Northwest of region y. This means that point px is either to the North, or to the West, or both (i.e., Northwest) of at least one point in region y. Let's call this point py.

We also know that region y is East of region z. This means that point py is to the East of at least one point in region z, which could be pz.

So, we have px which is Northwest of py, and py which is East of pz. What does this tell us about the relationship between px and pz?

If px is directly North of py, and py is directly East of pz, then px is Northeast of pz.
If px is directly West of py, and py is directly East of pz, then px and pz have the same vertical alignment. Their horizontal alignment depends on the distances: if the westward distance from py to px is less than the eastward distance from pz to py, then px is still East of pz; if the distances are equal, px and pz are horizontally aligned; if the westward distance is greater, then px is West of pz.
If px is truly Northwest of py, then the combined movement depends on the exact angles and distances. It could be North, Northeast, East, Northwest, West, or even Southwest of pz.

This gets further complicated when we consider regions, not just single points, because regions have spatial extent.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. The question seems to be asking for a more straightforward application of the cardinal direction relations.

Let me trace through the scenario once more.

Region x is Northwest of region y. This means x is in a direction that is Northwest (or North, or West) from y.
Region y is East of region z. This means y is in a direction that is East from z.

If we place these on a map, we might have z, and then y to the east of z, and then x to the northwest of y.

From the perspective of z, where is x?

Let's try to draw this:

```
     N
     |
W----+----E
     |
     S
```

If y is East of z, it's somewhere on the positive x-axis. If x is Northwest of y, it's in the upper left quadrant from y. Now, from z's perspective, x can be in the upper half of the plane, and depending on the distances, it can be in the left or right half of the plane.

So, x can be North, Northeast, or Northwest of z.

But wait, if I have a region, can I go as far as to say that it has a bounding box? And are we assuming that region x is a point or a region? 

Let's see the question again. It says "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" So it sounds like both x and z are regions, not just points. 

This actually opens up other possibilities. If both x and z are regions of significant spatial extent, then the relationship between them could be more complex. For instance, if region x is large and spans across the Northwest, North, and Northeast of y, and region z is also large, they might overlap or have a more complex relationship.

But I think the question is asking for the basic cardinal direction relation, treating the regions as cohesive units.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Actually, hang on. Let me try one more specific mapping to verify. Let's place the regions in a 2D space.

Suppose z is at position (0, 0), y is at (1, 0), and x is at (0, 1).

In this setup, y is East of z, and x is Northwest of y. From z's perspective, x is at (0, 1), which is North of z.

Suppose z is at position (0, 0), y is at (2, 0), and x is at (1, 1).

In this setup, y is East of z, and x is Northwest of y. From z's perspective, x is at (1, 1), which is Northeast of z.

Suppose z is at position (0, 0), y is at (3, 0), and x is at (1, 1).

In this setup, y is East of z, and x is Northwest of y. From z's perspective, x is at (1, 1), which is still Northeast of z.

Suppose z is at position (0, 0), y is at (3, 0), and x is at (-1, 1).

In this setup, y is East of z, and x is Northwest of y. From z's perspective, x is at (-1, 1), which is Northwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

But I think I need to think about regions instead of just points. 

Let's define the relationship using region-based cardinal direction calculus.

In the region-based cardinal direction calculus, we define a set of nine tiles with respect to a reference region (usually the bounding box of a region). These tiles are: NW, N, NE, W, O (the bounding box itself), E, SW, S, and SE.

Given two regions, A and B, the cardinal direction relation from A to B is determined by the set of tiles of A where B has non-empty intersection.

In the problem, we're told that region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is East of region z.

Using the tiling approach, if x is Northwest of y, then the bounding box of x has non-empty intersection with the NW, N, or W tiles of y (or a combination of them).

If y is East of z, then the bounding box of y has non-empty intersection with the E tile of z.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we need to see which tiles of z have non-empty intersection with the bounding box of x.

Let's think about this spatially.

If y is East of z, then y's bounding box is in the E tile of z. If x is Northwest of y, then x's bounding box is in the NW, N, or W tiles of y. Given y's position, x's bounding box could be in the N, NE, or E tiles of z, depending on the exact positions and extents of the regions.

But I think my earlier reasoning still stands. The possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Actually I think I'm confused at this stage. let me solve it from the beginning with a clearer approach.

Coordinates. I'm going to use 2D coordinates to understand the problem.

Region x is Northwest of region y: This means that x is in the upper left quadrant from y. If y is at the origin (0, 0), then x could be at a position like (-1, 1).

Region y is East of region z: This means that y is to the right of z. If z is at the origin (0, 0), then y could be at a position like (1, 0).

Now, to combine these: If z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, 0), and x is Northwest of y, then x could be at a position like (0, 1) (which is North of y) or (0, 2) (which is West of y and at the same horizontal level as z), or (-1, 1) (which is truly Northwest of y).

From z's perspective, if x is at (0, 1), then x is North of z. If x is at (0, 2), then x is North of z. If x is at (-1, 1), then x is Northwest of z.

Ok so now I'm getting North and Northwest as possible relations.

Wait, I think I might be making a mistake. Let me reconsider.

If z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, 0), and x is Northwest of y, then x could be at a position like (0, 1) (which is North of y) or (0, 1) (which is West of y), or (0, 1) (which is truly Northwest of y).

Actually, I meant to say "x could be at a position like (0, 1) (which is North of y) or (-1, 0) (which is West of y), or (-1, 1) (which is truly Northwest of y)". Excuse the typo earlier.

From z's perspective, if x is at (0, 1), then x is North of z. If x is at (-1, 0), then x is West of z. If x is at (-1, 1), then x is Northwest of z.

OK, actually I think my analysis is correct. Let me try to more systematically go through different possibilities.

Let's lay out a coordinate system with z at origin (0, 0), y at (1, 0), which ensures y is East of z.

Now, x can be Northwest of y in three main ways:
1. x could be North of y, e.g., at (1, 1).
2. x could be West of y, e.g., at (0, 0).
3. x could be Northwest of y, e.g., at (0, 1).

Let's evaluate where x is relative to z in each case:
1. If x is at (1, 1), then it's Northeast of z.
2. If x is at (0, 0), then it's at the same position as z.
3. If x is at (0, 1), then it's North of z.

Hmm, there's something wrong with my previous reasoning. Let me try again.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0).
Since y is East of z, y is at a position (a, 0) where a > 0.

Now, x is Northwest of y. If y is at (a, 0), then x is at a position (b, c) where b < a and c > 0.

Depending on the relationship between b and 0, we have different possibilities for the cardinal direction relation between x and z:
1. If b > 0, then x is Northeast of z.
2. If b = 0, then x is North of z.
3. If b < 0, then x is Northwest of z.

OK, So the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

OK, to wrap up, let's just double-check our final answer with a test case.

I'll place z at the origin (0, 0). I'll put y at (5, 0), which makes it East of z. Now, I'll place x at different positions to check if it's Northwest of y and which relations it has with z.

1. x at (4, 1) - x is Northwest of y, and Northeast of z.
2. x at (0, 1) - x is Northwest of y, and North of z.
3. x at (-1, 1) - x is Northwest of y, and Northwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Wait, I need to be careful with my definition of Northwest. Northwest means the region is both North and West simultaneously. In coordinate terms, if y is at (a, b), then x is Northwest of y if x is at (c, d) where c < a and d > b.

Let's recheck our test cases:

1. x at (4, 1) and y at (5, 0) - Is x Northwest of y? x is to the West of y (4 < 5) and to the North of y (1 > 0), so x is Northwest of y. Is x Northeast of z? x is to the East of z (4 > 0) and to the North of z (1 > 0), so x is Northeast of z.

2. x at (0, 1) and y at (5, 0) - Is x Northwest of y? x is to the West of y (0 < 5) and to the North of y (1 > 0), so x is Northwest of y. Is x North of z? x is at the same longitude as z (0 = 0) and to the North of z (1 > 0), so x is North of z.

3. x at (-1, 1) and y at (5, 0) - Is x Northwest of y? x is to the West of y (-1 < 5) and to the North of y (1 > 0), so x is Northwest of y. Is x Northwest of z? x is to the West of z (-1 < 0) and to the North of z (1 > 0), so x is Northwest of z.

So, all of our test cases check out. The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Actually, hold on. Let me think about this one more time. The definition of cardinal direction relations between regions (as opposed to points) can be more intricate than what I've been discussing.

Let's define the cardinal direction relations between regions x and y using the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle (aligned with the coordinate axes) that completely contains the region.

Given the MBRs of regions x and y, the cardinal direction relation from x to y is determined by the relative positions of the vertices of the MBRs.

Let's denote the MBR of a region r as [r.min_x, r.min_y, r.max_x, r.max_y], where min_x and min_y are the coordinates of the lower-left corner, and max_x and max_y are the coordinates of the upper-right corner.

Now, x is North of y if x.min_y > y.max_y.
x is East of y if x.min_x > y.max_x.
x is South of y if x.max_y < y.min_y.
x is West of y if x.max_x < y.min_x.

For the composite directions: x is Northeast of y if x is both North of y and East of y, and so on.

Using this definition, let's go back to our problem.

Region x is Northwest of region y. This means x.max_x < y.min_x (x is West of y) and x.min_y > y.max_y (x is North of y).
Region y is East of region z. This means y.min_x > z.max_x.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z.

From x.max_x < y.min_x and y.min_x > z.max_x, we get x.max_x < z.max_x. But this doesn't tell us the relationship between x.min_x and z.max_x, so we can't definitively say if x is West of z.

From x.min_y > y.max_y, we know that x is above y. And since the question doesn't specify the vertical relationship between y and z, x could be above, below, or at the same level as z.

Without further constraints, it's hard to determine the exact cardinal direction relation between x and z using this formalism.

Hmm, that approach doesn't lead to a clear answer.

Let's go back to a simpler approach, using the central points of the regions.

If the central point of region x is Northwest of the central point of region y, and the central point of region y is East of the central point of region z, what can we say about the relationship between the central points of regions x and z?

Let's call the central points of regions x, y, and z as x', y', and z' respectively.

If x' is Northwest of y', then x' is above and to the left of y'.
If y' is East of z', then y' is to the right of z'.

Combining these, we get that x' is above y', which is at the same level as z', and x' is to the left of y', which is to the right of z'.

For the vertical component, x' is above y', which is at the same level as z', so x' is above z'.
For the horizontal component, x' is to the left of y', which is to the right of z'. So, x' can be to the left of z', at the same longitude as z', or to the right of z', depending on the exact positions.

If x' is to the left of z', then x' is Northwest of z'.
If x' is at the same longitude as z', then x' is North of z'.
If x' is to the right of z', then x' is Northeast of z'.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Hmm, this is the same answer I arrived at before. Let me try one more approach to be sure.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, especially for cardinal direction relations, there are different calculi to define the relationships. Two prominent ones are the cone-based and the projection-based approaches.

In the cone-based approach, the space is divided into sectors (cones), and the relationship between regions is determined by which sectors they occupy. In the projection-based approach, the space is divided based on projections onto the coordinate axes.

Using the projection-based approach, if region x is Northwest of region y, then the projection of x onto the east-west axis is to the west of the projection of y, and the projection of x onto the north-south axis is to the north of the projection of y.

Similarly, if region y is East of region z, then the projection of y onto the east-west axis is to the east of the projection of z, and the projections of y and z onto the north-south axis overlap.

Combining these, the projection of x onto the north-south axis is to the north of the projection of y, which overlaps with the projection of z. So, the projection of x onto the north-south axis is to the north of the projection of z.

For the east-west axis, the projection of x is to the west of the projection of y, which is to the east of the projection of z. Depending on the exact positions, the projection of x onto the east-west axis can be to the west, to the east, or overlapping with the projection of z.

OK, OK, OK. I am going to go with my earlier answer. I think the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest. 

But, if the projection-based approach is to be used, there might be other relationships like Bounding Box (if x and z overlap in their projections).

Actually, OK I'm not being clear enough. Let me be more precise about the relation. In the projection-based approach, regions are often represented by their minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs). The cardinal direction relation between two regions, x and y, is determined based on the relative positions of their MBRs. If the MBR of x is to the north of the MBR of y (no overlap on the east-west axis), then x is North of y. If the MBR of x is to the east of the MBR of y (no overlap on the north-south axis), then x is East of y, and so on.

In the cone-based approach, regions are represented by a reference point (often the centroid of the region), and the cardinal direction relation is determined based on the direction from the reference point of one region to the reference point of the other.

Frankly, I might be overthinking this problem.

Let's go back to the question itself:

Let  Northwest and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

I think I should be using the same definition of cardinal direction for all the relationships. If I'm using the projection-based approach for "Northwest" and "East", then I should also use the projection-based approach for the relationship between x and z.

Using the projection-based approach, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Actually, let me try a clearer and perhaps the most intuitive approach. I'll specify regions as points for simplicity. I hope this gives a clearer illustration.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0).
Given that y is East of z, y is at (a, 0) where a > 0.
Given that x is Northwest of y, x is at (b, c) where b < a and c > 0.

To find the relationship between x and z, we need to determine the relative position of x to z. That is, we compare (b, c) to (0, 0):

- Vertical relation: c > 0, so x is North of z.
- Horizontal relation: If b > 0, then x is East of z. If b = 0, then x is at the same longitude as z. If b < 0, then x is West of z.

Combining these, the cardinal direction relation between x and z can be:
- North (if b = 0, c > 0)
- Northeast (if b > 0, c > 0)
- Northwest (if b < 0, c > 0)

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

OK, so I think that's my final answer.

Actually, hold on. I'm not sure if "Bounding Box" is a cardinal direction relation in the traditional sense. The typical cardinal direction relations are North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest. But maybe "Bounding Box" is used to indicate that the two regions overlap? In that case, I don't think it's possible for x and z to have a "Bounding Box" relation given the constraints.

Actually this is a new issue that I hadn't considered. Can the region x and z, given the constraints, overlap? 

If y is East of z, it means y is strictly to the east of z. Using the projection-based approach, their MBRs don't overlap on the east-west axis.

If x is Northwest of y, it means x is strictly to the northwest of y. Their MBRs don't overlap on either the east-west or the north-south axis.

Given these non-overlapping relationships, and the transitive nature of the east-west axis, it seems unlikely that x and z would overlap. But without a more precise definition of "Bounding Box" and the formalism being used, I can't definitively rule it out.

So, my answer remains: the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

I realized one other possibility. "Bounding Box" might refer to the scenario where one region's MBR completely encompasses the other's. But again, given the strict nature of the Northwest and East relations, I don't see how x's MBR could completely contain z's or vice versa.

OK, let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

1. x is Northwest of y: The projection of x onto the east-west axis is to the west of the projection of y, and the projection of x onto the north-south axis is to the north of the projection of y.
2. y is East of z: The projection of y onto the east-west axis is to the east of the projection of z, and the projections of y and z onto the north-south axis can overlap.

Now, for the relation between x and z:
- For the north-south axis: x's projection is to the north of y's projection. y's projection can overlap with z's projection. If y's projection is at the same level as z's, then x's projection is to the north of z's. If there's a gap between y's and z's projections, and y's is to the north, then it's still possible for x's projection to be to the north of z's. If there's a gap, and y's is to the south, it's still possible for x's projection to be to the north of z's. So, on the north-south axis, x's projection is to the north of z's.
- For the east-west axis: x's projection is to the west of y's projection. y's projection is to the east of z's projection. Depending on the exact positions, x's projection can be to the west, to the east, or at the same longitude as z's projection.

Ah, I see now the Bounding Box relation. In the 9-intersection model (a formalism for spatial relations), the Bounding Box relation refers to the scenario where one region is inside or overlaps with the minimum bounding rectangle of the other. Given the constraints of the problem, I don't see how x's MBR could overlap with z's MBR.

OK OK. I think my answer remains: the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Actually, one thing I'm wondering is: why would bounding box be a cardinal direction? Let me think, let me think…Bounding Box might refer to the scenario where one region's MBR (minimum bounding rectangle) contains the other region. But this doesn't seem to be a cardinal direction relation in the usual sense. Are we mixing different formalisms here?

Actually, I think I'm overthinking, maybe "Bounding Box" is just another term for "Same Location" or "Overlapping".

Let me see if it's possible for x and z to overlap. If y is East of z, then y is strictly to the east of z. If x is Northwest of y, then x is strictly to the northwest of y. This means x is to the west and to the north of y. For x to overlap with z, given these constraints, it would require very specific geometries and positions.

OK, wait, let me try and clarify if Bounding Box is part of the standard cardinal directions. In qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction relations are typically North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest. Sometimes, a ninth relation "Same Location" or "Origin" is included to indicate that two regions occupy the same position. "Bounding Box" is not a standard cardinal direction term.

I don't see the definition of bounding box in the context of the options given. It's possible that in the specific formalism the question refers to, "Bounding Box" indicates some special relationship that I'm not familiar with. 

But in the absence of a clear definition, and going by the standard cardinal direction relations, my answer would still be the three relations: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Actually, I think I was right the first time. The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Let me just double-check my thinking once more. 

We know that region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is East of region z. 

If region y is East of region z, then y's MBR is strictly to the east of z's MBR. 

If region x is Northwest of region y, then x's MBR is strictly to the northwest (both north and west) of y's MBR. 

Given these constraints, x's MBR can be:
1. North of z's MBR if x's MBR is directly above z's MBR.
2. Northeast of z's MBR if x's MBR is to the northeast of z's MBR.
3. Northwest of z's MBR if x's MBR is to the northwest of z's MBR.
4. Potentially overlapping with z's MBR in very specific geometries, but without a clear definition of what "Bounding Box" relation means, I can't say for sure if this is one of the possible relations.

Given the standard cardinal direction relations, the possible relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Hmm, actually, I think I'm being unclear because of my ignorance of a particular spatial reasoning formalism. Let me take one more approach, to be as clear as possible.

In the context of the projection-based approach to cardinal direction relations:

A region x is North of a region z if the y-coordinate of the southernmost point of x is greater than the y-coordinate of the northernmost point of z.
A region x is East of a region z if the x-coordinate of the westernmost point of x is greater than the x-coordinate of the easternmost point of z.
A region x is South of a region z if the y-coordinate of the northernmost point of x is less than the y-coordinate of the southernmost point of z.
A region x is West of a region z if the x-coordinate of the easternmost point of x is less than the x-coordinate of the westernmost point of z.

And the combinations (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest) are defined based on these basic relations.

Given these, if a region y is East of a region z, then the westernmost point of y is to the east of the easternmost point of z. And if a region x is Northwest of a region y, then the easternmost point of x is to the west of the westernmost point of y, and the southernmost point of x is to the north of the northernmost point of y.

From these, we can deduce that the southernmost point of x is to the north of the northernmost point of y, which might be north of the northernmost point of z, at the same level, or south of it. Similarly, the easternmost point of x is to the west of the westernmost point of y, which is to the east of the easternmost point of z. The exact relation on the east-west axis between x and z depends on the specific positions.

Given the constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

So, the answer is: North, Northeast, Northwest.

Actually, I've spent some time thinking about this problem, but I'm not sure if I'm overlooking some aspect of the formalism that the question is based on. Without a clear definition of all the possible relations and the specific formalism, I'll stick with my analysis.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

Actually, now I wonder. Is "Bounding Box" an option for the relation between x and z? It's not a standard cardinal direction term. But maybe in the formalism this question is referring to, it indicates a specific type of relation? Unfortunately, I don't have more information to figure out what it might mean in this context. 

Based on the logic and the standard cardinal direction relations, my answer is: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

OK, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
1. Region x is Northwest of region y
2. Region y is East of region z

To determine the possible relations between x and z, I'll analyze their relative positions.

Since y is East of z, we can place y to the right of z.
Since x is Northwest of y, we know x is both to the left and above y.

Looking at the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If x is directly above z (same longitude), then x is North of z.
2. If x is to the right of z while still being Northwest of y, then x is Northeast of z.
3. If x is to the left of z, then x is Northwest of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, Northwest.
