PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's reason about this step by step.

We have:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is West of region z

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall what these cardinal directions mean in terms of spatial positioning:
- Northwest: x is diagonally to the upper left of y
- West: y is directly to the left of z

Now, let's visualize this:

We start with: x is Northwest of y
This means x is diagonally to the upper left of y.

Then: y is West of z
This means y is directly to the left of z.

Combining these:
- x is to the upper left of y
- y is to the left of z

So, x is to the left and above y, and y is to the left of z.

This means x is to the left of z (further left than y) and also above z.

Given these constraints, x could be:
- Northwest of z (if x is significantly above z)
- West of z (if x is roughly at the same level as z)
- Southwest of z (if x is below z)

Actually, let me think more carefully. 

If x is Northwest of y, then x is to the left and above y.
If y is West of z, then y is to the left of z (and at approximately the same vertical level).

Combining these:
- x is to the left and above y
- y is to the left of z (at the same vertical level)

So, x is to the left of z (because it's to the left of y, which is to the left of z).
And x is above y, which is at the same level as z.
Therefore, x is above z.

Given these constraints, x is to the left and above z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Actually, let me be more precise. I need to consider the spatial calculus more carefully.

When I say "x is Northwest of y", I mean that x is located in the Northwest cone or sector of y. Similarly, "y is West of z" means y is in the West cone of z.

If we use a coordinate system with origin at z, and y is in the West direction from z, then y has coordinates (-a, 0) for some positive a. If x is in the Northwest direction from y, then x has coordinates (-a-b, c) for some positive b and c, relative to y.

Converting to coordinates relative to z:
x has coordinates (-a-b, c) relative to z.

Since -a-b < 0 and c > 0, x is in the Northwest quadrant of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Actually, I'm being imprecise. Let's define the cardinal directions more carefully. 

I need to consider the possibility that regions have extent (they're not just points). Cardinal directions in this context are often defined using a projection-based model. But for simplicity, let's use the cone-based model where:
- Northwest is the 45-degree cone centered on the NW diagonal
- West is the 45-degree cone centered on the W axis

Let's clarify using the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) representation:

If x is Northwest of y, it means the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest cone of the MBR of y.
If y is West of z, it means the MBR of y is entirely within the West cone of the MBR of z.

Given these constraints, x could be:
- Northwest of z
- West of z
- North of z

But I'm not 100% sure if North is possible. Let me check...

Actually, I think I'm getting confused because I'm not defining the cardinal directions precisely. Let's try again.

In the context of cardinal direction relations between regions, we often use the projection-based model or the cone-based model. 

For the cone-based model:
- West means the center of region y is in the western semicircle of region z.
- Northwest means the center of region x is in the northwestern quadrant of region y.

With these definitions:
- If x is Northwest of y, the center of x is in the NW quadrant of y.
- If y is West of z, the center of y is in the W semicircle of z.

From these, we can't determine a unique cardinal direction for x relative to z, as it depends on the exact positions of the regions. x could be:
- Northwest of z
- West of z
- North of z

But I feel like there should be a more definitive answer given the constraints of the problem.

Actually, let me reason about this from a purely directional perspective.

If we have three points x, y, and z:
- If x is Northwest of y, then x is in the direction 315 degrees from y (assuming 0 degrees is East, and we go counterclockwise).
- If y is West of z, then y is in the direction 270 degrees from z.

Now, the direction from z to x is the combined effect of these two directions.

To go from z to x, we first go from z to y in the direction 270 degrees. Then, from y, we go in the direction 315 degrees to reach x.

We can't simply add these angles, but we can use vector addition. Let's say the distance from z to y is 1 unit in the 270-degree direction, and the distance from y to x is 1 unit in the 315-degree direction.

From z to y: (-1, 0)
From y to x: (-√2/2, √2/2)

The combined vector from z to x is (-1, 0) + (-√2/2, √2/2) = (-1-√2/2, √2/2).

This vector points in a direction between West and Northwest from z, which would be in the Northwest direction.

Actually, let's use a 9-direction framework for regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and equal (or bounding box, which means one region contains the other).

In this framework, the question asks: If x is Northwest of y and y is West of z, what is the relation between x and z?

Let's use the direction matrix to combine cardinal direction relations. If we denote Northwest as NW and West as W, then:

NW ⊗ W = ?

Using the composition table for the 9-direction model, we get:

NW ⊗ W = NW (Northwest)

That makes intuitive sense. If you go Northwest from y, and y is West of z, you end up in the Northwest direction from z.

But I realize that there's an issue with my reasoning. When we're talking about regions (not points), cardinal directions become more complex.

For regions, we often use the Rectangle Algebra (RA) or the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC). In these models, the cardinal direction between two regions is determined based on the relationships between their projections on the x and y axes.

However, I still think the most intuitive interpretation of the question is using the cone-based model or a simple directional model for points, where the direction from region A to region B is determined by the direction from the center of A to the center of B.

In that case, if x is Northwest of y, and y is West of z, then x is Northwest of z.

Actually, let me try a different approach. Spatial relations can be binary or ternary. In binary relations (which I think is what the question is about), each cardinal direction represents a specific area in a 2D space.

If we divide the 2D space around a region into 9 tiles (the original region and 8 surrounding it), we can name each tile according to its cardinal direction from the original region.

Now, if x is in the Northwest tile of y, and y is in the West tile of z, we want to determine which tile of z contains x.

Let's denote the coordinates of regions x, y, and z as (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max), (y_min, y_max, y_min, y_max), and (z_min, z_max, z_min, z_max), respectively.

If x is Northwest of y, then:
x_max < y_min and y_max < x_min

If y is West of z, then:
y_max < z_min and z_min <= y_max and y_min <= z_max

From these, we can derive:
x_max < y_min < z_min and y_max < x_min

But this doesn't tell us the vertical relationship between x and z directly.

I see where I went wrong. I misunderstood the cardinal direction relations for regions. Let me clarify:

For two regions A and B, the cardinal direction relation between them is determined by the relative position of B with respect to A. We divide the space around A into 9 tiles (including A itself) and determine which tile(s) B intersects with.

However, the question seems to be using a binary relation approach, where each region is related to another by a single cardinal direction.

In this approach, if x is Northwest of y, it means x is entirely in the Northwest tile of y. And if y is West of z, it means y is entirely in the West tile of z.

Given these constraints, and assuming a consistent coordinate system, we need to determine which tile of z contains x.

If x is entirely in the Northwest tile of y, then x is above and to the left of y.
If y is entirely in the West tile of z, then y is to the left of z and at the same vertical level.

Combining these, x is to the left of z (because it's to the left of y, which is to the left of z), and x is above z (because it's above y, which is at the same level as z).

Therefore, x is in the Northwest tile of z, which means the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Actually, let me try to be more grounded in cardinal direction calculus.

In cardinal direction calculus for regions, we typically use one of two main models:

1. The cone-based model: This divides the space around a region into 8 cones (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest).
2. The projection-based model: This divides the space around a region into 9 tiles using the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the region.

Let's focus on the projection-based model, which is more commonly used for regions. Given two regions, we can determine the cardinal direction relation based on which tile(s) of the first region the second region intersects with.

If x is Northwest of y, it means x is in the Northwest tile of y. In terms of the MBR coordinates:
x_max < y_min and y_max < x_min

If y is West of z, it means y is in the West tile of z. In terms of the MBR coordinates:
y_max < z_min and z_min <= y_max and y_min <= z_max

From these, we can derive:
x_max < y_min < z_min
And based on the vertical relationship, we know x_min > y_max. But we need to relate x_min and z_max to determine the vertical relationship between x and z.

Given the constraints, it's possible that x is:
1. Northwest of z (if x_min > z_max)
2. West of z (if x_min <= z_max and x_max >= z_min)
3. Southwest of z (if x_max < z_min)

Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Let me think about this more carefully.

If x is Northwest of y, then x is in the Northwest tile of y. This means:
x_max < y_min and x_min > y_max

If y is West of z, then y is in the West tile of z. This means:
y_max < z_min and y_min <= z_max and y_max >= z_min

From these, we can derive:
x_max < y_min < z_min (horizontal relationship)
And for the vertical relationship:
x_min > y_max

But the relationship between x_min and z_max, and between x_max and z_min, is not immediately clear from the given constraints.

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused because I'm not being precise enough.

Let's use a precise definition for the cardinal directions using the projection-based model:

- North (N): x_min >= y_min and x_max <= y_max and x_min > y_max
- Northeast (NE): x_min > y_max and x_min > y_max
- East (E): x_min > y_max and y_min <= x_min and x_max <= y_max
- Southeast (SE): x_min > y_max and x_max > y_max
- South (S): x_min >= y_min and x_max <= y_max and x_max < y_min
- Southwest (SW): x_max < y_min and x_max < y_min
- West (W): x_max < y_min and y_min <= x_min and x_max <= y_max
- Northwest (NW): x_max < y_min and x_min > y_max
- Equal or Bounding Box (EQ): x_min = y_min and x_max = y_max and x_min = y_min and x_max = y_max

Now, given:
- x is Northwest of y: x_max < y_min and x_min > y_max
- y is West of z: y_max < z_min and y_min <= z_max and y_max >= z_min

From these, we can derive:
x_max < y_min < z_min

Also, since x_min > y_max, and we don't have direct constraints on the relationship between y_max and z_max, we can't determine the exact relationship between x_min and z_max.

Therefore, x could be:
- Northwest of z (if x_min > z_max)
- West of z (if x_min <= z_max and x_max >= z_min, but this conflicts with x_max < y_min < z_min)

Actually, no, west of z can't be the case because we said x_max < y_min < z_min, which means x_max < z_min. For west of z to be true, we'd need y_min <= x_max and we don't have that. So x being west of z is not valid here.

Actually, there's another possibility:
- North of z (if x_min >= z_min and x_max <= z_max and x_min > z_max)

But this would require x_min >= z_min, which is less than y_min, which is greater than x_max. This gives us x_max < x_min, which is a contradiction. So x being North of z is not a valid possibility.

Let's try to reason again.

If x is Northwest of y, then in terms of coordinates:
x_max < y_min and x_min > y_max

If y is West of z, then:
y_max < z_min and y_min <= z_max and y_max >= z_min

From these, we have:
x_max < y_min < z_min (horizontal relationship)
x_min > y_max (vertical relationship for x and y)

But we don't have a direct constraint for the vertical relationship between x and z. The vertical relationship would depend on the specific values of x_min, y_max, and z_max.

Given the horizontal constraint x_max < z_min, we know x is either Northwest, North, or Northeast of z, depending on the vertical relationship:

- If x_min > z_max, then x is Northwest of z.
- If x_min <= z_max and x_max >= z_min, then x is North of z. But we said x_max < z_min, so this is a contradiction. This isn't a valid case.
- If x_max < z_min, then x is Northeast of z. But wait, we've already said x_max < z_min. But for Northeast, we also need x_min > z_max. So the key is the comparison between x_min and z_max.

Actually, let me try reasoning about this with the cardinal direction constraints more directly.

From the cardinal direction constraints, if x is Northwest of y, then x is in the space such that:
- x is to the west of y (horizontally).
- x is to the north of y (vertically).

If y is West of z, then y is in the space such that:
- y is to the west of z (horizontally).
- y is neither to the north nor to the south of z (vertically).

Combining these, we know:
- x is to the west of y, which is to the west of z, so x is to the west of z (horizontally).
- x is to the north of y, which is neither to the north nor to the south of z, so x is to the north of z (vertically).

Given these, x is in the space that is to the west and to the north of z, which is the Northwest direction.

So, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Alright, I think that's right. Let me try one more time, thinking of the direction calculus as a composition of relations.

In direction calculus, we can compose two direction relations to get a resulting direction. For example, if A is North of B and B is East of C, then A is Northeast of C.

In our case, we have:
- x is Northwest of y
- y is West of z

Using the composition table for cardinal directions, we have:
Northwest ⊗ West = Northwest

This is because going Northwest from y and then coming from a region that is West of z puts x in the Northwest direction from z.

So, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Wait, I'm confused as to why there seems to be a unique answer. Let me double-check by drawing it out.

If we have three regions on a 2D plane:
- Region z is at position (0, 0).
- Region y is West of z, so it's at a position like (-2, 0).
- Region x is Northwest of y, so it's at a position like (-4, 2).

In this scenario, the relation between x and z is clearly Northwest. x is to the left (West) and above (North) of z.

But I'm wondering if there are other valid positions for x given the constraints. Let me check...

If y is at (-2, 0) and z is at (0, 0), the constraint "y is West of z" is satisfied.

Now, for x to be Northwest of y, it must be to the left and above y. So, x could be at positions like (-3, 1), (-4, 2), (-5, 3), etc.

Regardless of the exact position of x, as long as it's to the left and above y, it will always be to the left and above z. This means x will always be Northwest of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z, given the constraints, is Northwest.

Actually, as a sanity check, let me see what happens when we abstract from these specific numerical instances and just use the calculus for cardinal directions.

I'm not sure what are the standard notations, so I'll use N for north, NW for northwest, and so on.

If x is NW of y, and y is W of z, what is the relation between x and z?

Let's apply the composition of cardinal direction relations. To do this, I need the composition table, which gives us the result of composing two cardinal direction relations.

For our specific case, we need the result of NW ⊗ W (the composition of Northwest and West).

From the composition table (if I remember correctly), NW ⊗ W = NW.

This means that if x is Northwest of y, and y is West of z, then x is Northwest of z.

Actually, I'm now convinced that the relation between x and z is Northwest, and there's a unique answer to this question.

Actually, let's think again about the cardinal direction calculus, which gives constraints on the relation between the projections of MBRs along the x and y axes.

We know:
- x is Northwest of y.
- y is West of z.

For x to be Northwest of y, we need:
x_max < y_min (x is to the west of y) and x_min > y_max (x is to the north of y).

For y to be West of z, we need:
y_max < z_min (y is to the west of z) and y_min <= z_max and y_max >= z_min (y has no constraint in the north-south direction relative to z).

From these, we can derive:
x_max < y_min < z_min (which means x is to the west of z).

For the north-south relationship between x and z, we know:
x_min > y_max, but we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between y_max and z_max.

However, because y is West of z, it means y is neither to the north nor to the south of z. In our projection-based model, this means:
y_min <= z_max and y_max >= z_min.

Actually, I realized that there's a distinction between cardinal direction relations for points and for regions. For points, it's simple: we just look at the direction vector from one point to another. But for regions, it's more complex because regions have spatial extent.

In the case of regions, there are different models to define cardinal direction relations. The two main ones are the projection-based model and the cone-based model.

Let's ignore the finer details of these models for now and just think of cardinal directions as binary relations between regions.

If we know that x is Northwest of y and y is West of z, we're trying to determine the possible relations between x and z.

The key insight is that direction relations are not always uniquely composable. For instance, if A is North of B and B is East of C, then A could be Northeast, North, or Northwest of C, depending on the exact positions.

In our case, x is Northwest of y, which means x is to the left and above y. And y is West of z, which means y is to the left of z.

From these, we can deduce that x is to the left of z (because it's to the left of y, which is to the left of z). But the vertical relationship between x and z depends on the exact vertical positions of the regions.

Given that y is West of z, we know y is at the same vertical level as z. Since x is above y, it's also above z. Combining this vertical and horizontal relationship, x is to the left and above z, which means x is Northwest of z.

So, the relation between x and z is Northwest, and only Northwest.

I'm pretty confident that the answer is Northwest, but let me sanity-check this with a different approach.

In Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC), relations are often represented using a direction matrix. This matrix records the intersection of two regions' projections along the cardinal directions.

In our case, we have:
- x is Northwest of y: This means that region x is entirely in the Northwest sector of region y.
- y is West of z: This means that region y is entirely in the West sector of region z.

To determine the relation between x and z, we need to find the sector of z in which x lies.

Since x is in the Northwest sector of y, and y is in the West sector of z, we can deduce that x is in the Northwest sector of z.

I believe this approach also confirms that the relation between x and z is Northwest, and only Northwest.

I guess what confused me is that I don't believe in a uniqueness in cardinal direction reasoning. For example, if x is Northeast of y, and y is Northeast of z, x can be North, Northeast, or East of z. But in this specific case, there is a unique answer.

Actually, actually, I'm wrong. Let me reason it out more carefully.

Cardinal direction relations can be combined using a composition operation, often denoted as ⊗. When we combine two cardinal direction relations, we get a set of possible resulting relations.

For our case, we're trying to determine NW ⊗ W, which is the composition of Northwest and West.

From cardinal direction reasoning, we know that the composition of two cardinal direction relations can result in multiple possible relations. For instance, N ⊗ E = {N, NE, E}, meaning if A is North of B and B is East of C, then A can be North, Northeast, or East of C, depending on the exact positions.

However, for NW ⊗ W, the result is {NW}. This means that if x is Northwest of y and y is West of z, then x can only be Northwest of z.

I think what confused me is that I was thinking of other compositions where the result can be multiple relations. But for NW ⊗ W, the result is uniquely {NW}.

Wait but I'm still confused, let me try to actually go through the constraints one by one.

If x is Northwest of y, then:
- x is to the left of y.
- x is above y.

If y is West of z, then:
- y is to the left of z.
- y is at the same vertical level as z (neither above nor below).

From these, we can deduce:
- x is to the left of z (because it's to the left of y, which is to the left of z).
- x is above z (because it's above y, which is at the same level as z).

The combination of "to the left" and "above" is Northwest.

So, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Actually, wait, did I make a mistake earlier about West? I've been assuming that West means directly to the left and at the same vertical level, but is that right?

In cardinal direction relations, West typically means a region is to the left of another region, without implying anything about the vertical relationship. Similarly, East means a region is to the right, North means a region is above, and South means a region is below.

But actually, I need to be careful with how cardinal direction relations work in the context of regions (as opposed to points). Let me re-reason more carefully.

For regions, cardinal directions are defined using the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle enclosing the region with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given two regions A and B with their MBRs, the cardinal direction relation between them is defined based on the relation between their MBRs. We can project the MBRs onto the x and y axes to get intervals, and then define the cardinal direction relation based on the relation between these intervals.

Specifically, for the cardinal direction "West", region A is West of region B if the x-interval of A's MBR is strictly to the left of the x-interval of B's MBR. There's no constraint on the y-intervals.

Similarly, for the cardinal direction "Northwest", region A is Northwest of region B if the x-interval of A's MBR is strictly to the left of the x-interval of B's MBR, AND the y-interval of A's MBR is strictly above the y-interval of B's MBR.

Now, let's apply these definitions to our problem.

If x is Northwest of y, then:
- The x-interval of x's MBR is strictly to the left of the x-interval of y's MBR.
- The y-interval of x's MBR is strictly above the y-interval of y's MBR.

If y is West of z, then:
- The x-interval of y's MBR is strictly to the left of the x-interval of z's MBR.
- There's no constraint on the relation between the y-intervals of y's MBR and z's MBR. This means the y-interval of y's MBR can be anywhere relative to the y-interval of z's MBR.

From these, we can deduce:
- The x-interval of x's MBR is strictly to the left of the x-interval of z's MBR (because it's to the left of y's MBR, which is to the left of z's MBR).
- The relation between the y-intervals of x's MBR and z's MBR depends on the relation between the y-intervals of y's MBR and z's MBR, which isn't constrained.

Given these, the relation between x and z could be:
- Northwest (if the y-interval of x's MBR is strictly above the y-interval of z's MBR)
- West (if the y-intervals of x's MBR and z's MBR overlap)
- Southwest (if the y-interval of x's MBR is strictly below the y-interval of z's MBR)

But, now we have a contridiction. The y-interval of x's MBR is strictly above the y-interval of y's MBR, since x is Northwest of y. And the y-interval of y's MBR can be anywhere relative to the y-interval of z's MBR, since y is West of z. So, the y-interval of x's MBR can be strictly above, overlapping, or strictly below the y-interval of z's MBR.

But I just said the possible relations are NW, W, and SW, which I think is right. Actually, let me reconsider.

Actually, I think my reasoning was problematic. Let's be careful, step by step.

For convenience, define the coordinates of x, y, and z as:

x: [x_x_min, x_x_max] x [x_y_min, x_y_max]
y: [y_x_min, y_x_max] x [y_y_min, y_y_max]
z: [z_x_min, z_x_max] x [z_y_min, z_y_max]

I have the constraints:
1. x is Northwest of y:
   - x_x_max < y_x_min
   - x_y_min > y_y_max

2. y is West of z:
   - y_x_max < z_x_min
   - There are no constraints on the y-coordinates; that is, the y-interval of y can be anywhere relative to the y-interval of z.

From 1 and 2, I can deduce:
   - x_x_max < y_x_min < z_x_min
   - x_y_min > y_y_max
   - But I cannot tell how x_y_min and z_y_max relate, since I don't know how y_y_max and z_y_max relate.

Now, let's reason about the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z. 

For x to be Northwest of z, I need:
   - x_x_max < z_x_min
   - x_y_min > z_y_max

I already know x_x_max < z_x_min. But I don't know if x_y_min > z_y_max.

For x to be West of z, I need:
   - x_x_max < z_x_min
   - x_y_min <= z_y_max and x_y_max >= z_y_min (i.e., the y-intervals of x and z overlap)

I already know x_x_max < z_x_min. But I don't know if the y-intervals of x and z overlap.

For x to be Southwest of z, I need:
   - x_x_max < z_x_min
   - x_y_max < z_y_min

I already know x_x_max < z_x_min. But I don't know if x_y_max < z_y_min.

Given the constraints, I know that x_y_min > y_y_max. But I don't know how y_y_max and z_y_max relate. 

Actually, wait. I just realized I'm not using all the constraints. The full implications of "x is Northwest of y" are:
   - x_x_max < y_x_min
   - x_y_min > y_y_max

And the full implications of "y is West of z" are:
   - y_x_max < z_x_min
   - No constraints on the y-coordinates

From these, I can deduce:
   - x_x_max < y_x_min < z_x_min (so x is to the left of z)
   - x_y_min > y_y_max (so x is above y)
   - But I don't know how x_y_min and z_y_max relate, since I don't know how y_y_max and z_y_max relate.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
   - Northwest (if x_y_min > z_y_max)
   - West (if x_y_min <= z_y_max and x_y_max >= z_y_min)
   - Southwest (if x_y_max < z_y_min)

Hmm, I'm not sure which is correct. Let me try reasoning differently.

Given the constraints, we know:
   - x is to the left of y, which is to the left of z. So, x is to the left of z.
   - x is above y.
   - y can be above, at the same level, or below z.

Given these, the possible relations between x and z are:
   - Northwest (if x is above z)
   - West (if x is at the same level as z)
   - Southwest (if x is below z)

But wait, we know x is above y. If y is at the same level as z, then x is above z, so the relation is Northwest. If y is above z, then x is definitely above z, so the relation is still Northwest. If y is below z, then x can be above, at the same level, or below z, depending on the exact positions.

But this doesn't seem consistent with our cardinal direction constraints. The key is that while x is above y, we don't know how y and z compare vertically.

Let's try to reason using the basic definition of cardinal directions.

If x is Northwest of y, then:
   - x is to the left and above y.

If y is West of z, then:
   - y is to the left of z.
   - The vertical relationship between y and z can be anything.

From these, we know:
   - x is to the left of z (because it's to the left of y, which is to the left of z).
   - x is above y.
   - y can be above, at the same level, or below z.

Now, the relation between x and z depends on the vertical relationship:
   - If y is above z, then x is above z (because x is above y, which is above z). So, x is Northwest of z.
   - If y is at the same level as z, then x is above z (because x is above y, which is at the same level as z). So, x is Northwest of z.
   - If y is below z, then the vertical relationship between x and z depends on the exact positions. If x is above z, then x is Northwest of z. If x is at the same level as z, then x is West of z. If x is below z, then x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
   - Northwest
   - West
   - Southwest

I think I was correct earlier.

Let me try a more intuitive approach. Imagine a scenario where:
   - z is at the origin (0, 0).
   - y is at (-1, 0), which is West of z.
   - x is at (-2, 1), which is Northwest of y.

In this scenario, x is Northwest of z.

But now, consider a scenario where:
   - z is at the origin (0, 0).
   - y is at (-1, 2), which is still West of z, but now it's above z.
   - x is at (-2, 3), which is Northwest of y.

In this scenario, x is still Northwest of z.

And now, consider a scenario where:
   - z is at the origin (0, 0).
   - y is at (-1, -2), which is still West of z, but now it's below z.
   - x is at (-2, -1), which is Northwest of y.

In this scenario, x is Southwest of z.

These examples demonstrate that the relation between x and z can be Northwest, West, or Southwest, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Actually, I'm going to use a broader approach. I'll work with regions and the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) here.

Given three regions x, y, and z in 2D space, the basic cardinal direction relations between them are: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), and Northwest (NW).

We are given:
- x is NW of y
- y is W of z

In CDC, composing relations is the right approach for deriving what's possible for the relation between x and z, given the above two facts.

If we use the CDC's formal relation composition, we'd have:
NW ⊗ W = ?

This composition is typically represented using a matrix. 

Actually, we have the conjunction of two constraints:
- x is NW of y: This means the x-interval of x is to the left of the x-interval of y, and the y-interval of x is above the y-interval of y.
- y is W of z: This means the x-interval of y is to the left of the x-interval of z. There's no constraint on the y-intervals.

From these, we can derive:
- The x-interval of x is to the left of the x-interval of z (because it's to the left of y's x-interval, which is to the left of z's x-interval).
- We don't know the relation between the y-interval of x and the y-interval of z because we don't know the relation between the y-interval of y and the y-interval of z.

Given these constraints:
- If the y-interval of x is above the y-interval of z, then x is NW of z.
- If the y-interval of x overlaps with the y-interval of z, then x is W of z.
- If the y-interval of x is below the y-interval of z, then x is SW of z.

Since we don't have enough information to determine which of these is the case, all three are possible relations between x and z.

Hmm, let me not try to overthink this problem. 

We're told:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is West of region z

We're asked:
What are the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z?

I already reasoned through this and I believe the answer is: Northwest, West, or Southwest. All three are possible, depending on the exact vertical relationship between y and z (and consequently, the vertical relationship between x and z).

Actually, actually, let me try a purely example-based approach. 

Consider a grid with z at the origin, and let's place y and x such that the constraints are satisfied:

1. Place z at (0, 0).
2. Place y at (-1, 0) to satisfy the constraint that y is West of z.
3. Place x at (-2, 1) to satisfy the constraint that x is Northwest of y.

Now, the relation between x and z is Northwest, since x is to the left and above z.

Let's try a different placement:

1. Place z at (0, 0).
2. Place y at (-1, 2) to satisfy the constraint that y is West of z (note: y is now also above z, but it's still West of z because in cardinal direction calculus, West only constrains the x-coordinate).
3. Place x at (-2, 3) to satisfy the constraint that x is Northwest of y.

Now, the relation between x and z is still Northwest, since x is to the left and above z.

Let's try another placement:

1. Place z at (0, 0).
2. Place y at (-1, -2) to satisfy the constraint that y is West of z (note: y is now below z, but it's still West of z because in cardinal direction calculus, West only constrains the x-coordinate).
3. Place x at (-2, -1) to satisfy the constraint that x is Northwest of y.

Now, the relation between x and z is Southwest, since x is to the left and below z.

And one more:

1. Place z at (0, 0).
2. Place y at (-1, -2) to satisfy the constraint that y is West of z.
3. Place x at (-2, 0) to satisfy the constraint that x is Northwest of y.

Now, the relation between x and z is West, since x is to the left and at the same vertical level as z.

These examples confirm that the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, or Southwest.

I think the constraint "x is Northwest of y" means the x-interval of x is to the left of the x-interval of y, and the y-interval of x is above the y-interval of y. The constraint "y is West of z" means the x-interval of y is to the left of the x-interval of z. There's no constraint on the y-intervals for the West relation.

Given these, I've shown through examples that x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z, depending on the exact vertical relationship between y and z (and consequently, the vertical relationship between x and z).

Actually, there's a concept called a "bounding box" that I need to take into account. In CDC, cardinal directions are defined with respect to the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of a region. So when i say "West" or "Northwest", it's in the context of MBRs.

So, in the context of the original question, when we say:
- Region x is Northwest of region y, it means the MBR of x is entirely in the Northwest sector of the MBR of y.
- Region y is West of region z, it means the MBR of y is entirely in the West sector of the MBR of z.

Given these constraints, the MBR of x is entirely in the left half-plane of the MBR of z. However, the vertical relationship between the MBR of x and the MBR of z depends on the exact vertical positions.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between the MBR of x and the MBR of z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Alright, I'm pretty convinced that these are the possible relations between x and z given the constraints in the question. The key thing is that the constraint "y is West of z" doesn't give any vertical constraint on y and z, and the constraint "x is Northwest of y" fixes the vertical relationship between x and y, but there's still a vertical uncertainty between x and z.

Actually, let me do a quick reconsideration:

- Region x is Northwest of region y. This can be broken down into: x is to the left of y and x is above y.
- Region y is West of region z. This means y is to the left of z (no vertical constraint).

So, x is to the left of y, which is to the left of z. This means x is to the left of z.

The vertical relationship between x and z is less clear. We know x is above y. But y can be anywhere vertically with respect to z.

Therefore, depending on the exact vertical relationship between y and z, x can be above, at the same level, or below z.

Given that x is to the left of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is above z)
- West (if x is at the same level as z)
- Southwest (if x is below z)

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

But I suddenly realize that the constraint that "x is Northwest of y" means not just that x is above y, but that the distance from x to directly above y is similar to the distance from x to directly to the left of y.

Actually, no, I don't think cardinal directions in the context of CDC depend on the exact distances. I think in the projection-based model, the cardinal direction is determined by the projection relationship along the x and y axes.

So, if x is Northwest of y, it means the x-projection of x is to the left of the x-projection of y, and the y-projection of x is above the y-projection of y. That's all it specifies; it doesn't say anything about the exact distances.

Given these clarifications, I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is West of region z

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the constraints:

When x is Northwest of y:
- x is to the left of y (horizontally)
- x is above y (vertically)

When y is West of z:
- y is to the left of z (horizontally)
- There is no vertical constraint between y and z

From these constraints:
- x is definitely to the left of z (since x is left of y, which is left of z)
- The vertical relationship between x and z depends on the vertical relationship between y and z, which isn't constrained

The possible relations are:
- Northwest (if x is above z)
- West (if x is at the same vertical level as z)
- Southwest (if x is below z)
