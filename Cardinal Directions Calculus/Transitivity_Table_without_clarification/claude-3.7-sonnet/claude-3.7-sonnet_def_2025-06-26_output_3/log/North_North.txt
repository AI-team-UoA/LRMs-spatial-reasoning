PROMPT: Let North and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We have regions x, y, and z.

We know that:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is North of region z

We need to find out what could be the relation between region x and region z.

In the cardinal direction framework, North means that a region is directly above another region. Let's use coordinates to think about this.

If x is North of y, then x is above y. Similarly, if y is North of z, then y is above z. 

Let's say North is in the positive y-direction. So:
- If x is North of y, then y-coordinate of x > y-coordinate of y
- If y is North of z, then y-coordinate of y > y-coordinate of z

By transitivity:
- y-coordinate of x > y-coordinate of y > y-coordinate of z
- Therefore, y-coordinate of x > y-coordinate of z

This means x is definitely above z, which in cardinal directions means x is North of z.

So, region x is North of region z.

Actually, wait, I think I should be more careful about this analysis. Let me revisit. In the cardinal direction calculus, regions can have spatial extent. They're not just points. So, I need to think about the possible relationships more carefully.

Let's consider what it means for region x to be North of region y. This typically means that region x is entirely above region y, with no overlap in the North-South direction. Similarly, if region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely above region z.

Given these two relations, what can we say about the relationship between region x and region z?

From the transitivity of the North relation:
- If x is North of y and y is North of z, then x is North of z.

So, region x is North of region z.

However, I want to double-check if there's anything else to consider. Let's see if there are any other possible relations between region x and region z given the constraints.

If we're only considering the North relation, then by transitivity, region x is North of region z. There's no other possibility if we're strictly considering the cardinal direction relations as given.

But wait, the question asks for possible relations, which might suggest there's more than one possible relation. Let me think more deeply.

If regions x, y, and z have spatial extent and are not just points, and if "North" means entirely above with no East-West constraints, then there are some other possibilities for the relationship between x and z in terms of their East-West relationship.

For instance, region x could be:
- Directly North of region z (if x and z are aligned in the East-West direction)
- North and East of region z (if x is to the East of z in the East-West direction)
- North and West of region z (if x is to the West of z in the East-West direction)

Actually, wait. Given that regions have extent, let's be clearer on what "North of" means. 

In the Cardinal Direction Calculus, "North of" typically means that one region is entirely above another region, but they can have any East-West relationship. So, region x being North of region y doesn't constrain their East-West relationship. Similarly, region y being North of region z doesn't constrain their East-West relationship.

Given these, what can we say about the relationship between region x and region z?

We definitely know that region x is entirely above region z (from the transitivity of the North relation). But the East-West relationship between region x and region z is not fully determined by the given constraints.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z could be:
- North (if x is directly above z in terms of the East-West direction)
- Northeast (if x is above and to the East of z)
- Northwest (if x is above and to the West of z)

Let me check if this is right. Actually, let's define our directions more precisely.

North: Entirely above, but can have any East-West relationship.
Northeast: Entirely above and entirely to the East.
Northwest: Entirely above and entirely to the West.
East: Entirely to the East, but can have any North-South relationship.
West: Entirely to the West, but can have any North-South relationship.
Southeast: Entirely below and entirely to the East.
South: Entirely below, but can have any East-West relationship.
Southwest: Entirely below and entirely to the West.

Now, let's think about the possible relations between region x and region z, given that region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z.

From the North relationships, we know that:
- x is entirely above y
- y is entirely above z

By transitivity, x is entirely above z, which means x is North of z.

But wait, that's just in terms of the North-South direction. What about the East-West direction?

Since the North relation doesn't constrain the East-West relationship, region x and region z can have any East-West relationship. This means:
- x can be entirely to the East of z, making the relation Northeast.
- x can be entirely to the West of z, making the relation Northwest.
- x can overlap with z in the East-West direction, making the relation North.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

But actually, I'm a bit confused about this. Let me try to be more rigorous. I think I'm thinking of extended regions, and the question might be assuming point-like regions. Let me try to understand the direction calculus more precisely.

The Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) is a formalism used to represent directional relations between extended regions in a 2D space. There are various versions, but the basic one divides the 2D space into nine tiles using the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a reference region.

Given a reference region y, the space is divided into: NorthWest (NW), North (N), NorthEast (NE), West (W), Equal (EQ), East (E), SouthWest (SW), South (S), and SouthEast (SE).

A region x can be in one or more of these tiles in relation to region y.

Using this understanding, let's revisit the problem.

If region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely in the North, NorthEast, and/or NorthWest tiles of region y.

If region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely in the North, NorthEast, and/or NorthWest tiles of region z.

Now, where is region x in relation to region z?

If region y is in the North, NorthEast, and/or NorthWest tiles of region z, then the tiles of region y are entirely above region z. Now, if region x is in the North, NorthEast, and/or NorthWest tiles of region y, then region x is entirely above region y, which is entirely above region z. Therefore, region x is entirely above region z.

But the East-West relationship between region x and region z is not directly constrained.

Hmm, I think I'm not being clear. I'm getting confused about the precise definition of the CDC. Let me try to be more concrete.

In many versions of the CDC, the relation "North of" means that a region is entirely in the North tile of the reference region, without extending into the NorthEast or NorthWest tiles.

But, there's also a coarser version where "North of" can include NorthEast and NorthWest. In this context, "North of" would mean that a region is entirely in the North, NorthEast, and/or NorthWest tiles of the reference region.

Let's first assume the more specific version where "North of" means entirely in the North tile.

If region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely in the North tile of region y.
If region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely in the North tile of region z.

Now, where is region x in relation to region z?

Given the constraints, region x is entirely in the North tile of region y, and region y is entirely in the North tile of region z. This doesn't directly constrain the East-West relationship between region x and region z.

Ok, let me try a different approach. 

Let's establish a coordinate system. The positive y-axis is North, the positive x-axis is East.

If region x is North of region y, then the y-coordinates of region x are greater than the y-coordinates of region y. But there's no constraint on the x-coordinates.

Similarly, if region y is North of region z, then the y-coordinates of region y are greater than the y-coordinates of region z, but there's no constraint on the x-coordinates.

By transitivity, the y-coordinates of region x are greater than the y-coordinates of region z. This means region x is in the North, Northeast, or Northwest of region z.

Actually, I think I was on the right track earlier.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Let me actually try this with a specific example to check my reasoning.

Let's define the regions:
- z is the square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).
- y is the square with corners at (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), and (1, 3). Since y is entirely above z, y is North of z.

Now, let's consider different positions for region x, all of which are North of y:

1. x is the square with corners at (0, 4), (1, 4), (0, 5), and (1, 5). Here, x is directly North of z.
2. x is the square with corners at (2, 4), (3, 4), (2, 5), and (3, 5). Here, x is Northeast of z.
3. x is the square with corners at (-2, 4), (-1, 4), (-2, 5), and (-1, 5). Here, x is Northwest of z.

All three positions of x satisfy the constraint that x is North of y. And all three positions result in different cardinal direction relations between x and z.

So, based on this example, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Wait, I think I'm overgeneralizing.

"North" means that the region is in the North tile of the reference region. The North tile is defined by the projection of the maximum y-coordinate of the reference region.

If y is North of z, then y is entirely in the North tile of z. This means the minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

Similarly, if x is North of y, then the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.

By transitivity, the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, which means x is entirely above z. This places x in one of the North tiles of z (North, Northeast, or Northwest).

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me take a step back and think about the question in simpler terms.

In cardinal directions, "North" represents a relation where one region is entirely above another region. The East-West relationship is not specified.

If region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely above region y.
If region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely above region z.

By transitivity, region x is entirely above region z, which means region x is North of region z.

However, the question asks for "possible" relations, suggesting there might be multiple possibilities. But I don't see how there can be multiple cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given the constraints. The only relation that satisfies the constraints is "North".

Actually, let's reconsider the CDC again. I think the issue might be that I was thinking too broadly of what these cardinal directions might mean.

In the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC), the directional relation between two regions is typically represented as a binary relation. Given that there are 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, EQ), there are 2^9 = 512 possible binary relations. However, many of these are conceptually meaningless, so the system is usually simplified.

In the most basic form, the 9 tiles are reduced to 8 (excluding EQ), and each relation is single-tile (i.e., one region is entirely in one tile of the other region). This gives us 8 basic cardinal direction relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.

In this simplified system, if region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely in the North tile of region y. And if region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely in the North tile of region z.

Given these, what's the relation between region x and region z?

Well, region x is entirely in the North tile of region y, and region y is entirely in the North tile of region z. This doesn't directly constrain the East-West relationship between region x and region z.

However, given the way the Cardinal Direction Calculus is defined, if region x is entirely in the North tile of region y, and region y is entirely in the North tile of region z, then region x will be entirely in one of the following tiles of region z: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

This is because the North tile of region y is entirely in the North, Northeast, or Northwest tiles of region z. And since region x is entirely in the North tile of region y, it must be entirely in one of these tiles of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Actually, I might be misunderstanding the CDC. Let me try again with a clear understanding. I think my confusion arises from how I'm interpreting the relation "North".

In the Cardinal Direction Calculus, each region has a minimum bounding rectangle (MBR). Given a reference region, the space is divided into 9 tiles using the MBR, and a target region can be in one or more of these tiles. 

When we say "region x is North of region y", it means that all of region x is in the North tile of region y. The North tile is the area above the MBR of region y. Similarly, when we say "region y is North of region z", it means that all of region y is in the North tile of region z.

Given these, where is region x in relation to region z?

Region y is entirely in the North tile of region z. The North tile of region z is the area above the MBR of region z. 

Now, region x is entirely in the North tile of region y. The North tile of region y is the area above the MBR of region y.

Since region y is entirely in the North tile of region z, the MBR of region y is entirely in the North tile of region z. Consequently, the North tile of region y is a subset of the area above the MBR of region z. This means that region x, which is entirely in the North tile of region y, is also entirely in the area above the MBR of region z.

Therefore, region x is entirely in the North tile of region z, which means region x is North of region z.

So, the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is North.

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself because I'm mixing notions from different formalizations of cardinal direction calculus. Let me stick to the basic and most common understanding of cardinal directions.

Let me rethink this from a simple cardinal directions perspective.

In cardinal directions, "North" means that one region is entirely above another region. The East-West relationship is not specified. Specifically:

- North: Entirely above the reference region.
- Northeast: Entirely above and entirely to the East of the reference region.
- Northwest: Entirely above and entirely to the West of the reference region.

Given that region x is North of region y, region x is entirely above region y. And given that region y is North of region z, region y is entirely above region z.

By transitivity, region x is entirely above region z. This means region x is in the North of region z. But since the North relation doesn't constrain the East-West relationship, region x can be directly North, Northeast, or Northwest of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Hmm, but I'm still uncertain. I've been going back and forth between different interpretations of North. Let me try yet again with a simple understanding.

In cardinal directions, "North" means that one region is entirely above another region. The East-West relationship is not constrained.

Given this, if region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely above region y. And if region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely above region z.

By transitivity, region x is entirely above region z. This means region x is North of region z.

But wait, I think I might be missing something. The East-West relationship between region x and region z is not constrained by the given conditions. This means that region x could be directly North, Northeast, or Northwest of region z.

Oh, I think I'm confusing myself because when I say "North", I'm thinking of "directly North", which is a more restrictive relation where the regions are aligned in the East-West direction. But in the general cardinal direction sense, "North" just means "entirely above", without any East-West constraint.

Actually, I think the confusion may be that there is a definitional issue. I think in general, North, Northeast, Northwest, etc. are mutually exclusive. So, for example, if a region is Northeast of another, it's not also considered North of it.

Let me clarify the definitions:

- North: Entirely above the reference region and overlapping in the East-West direction.
- Northeast: Entirely above and entirely to the East of the reference region.
- Northwest: Entirely above and entirely to the West of the reference region.

Given these definitions, if region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely above region y and overlaps with region y in the East-West direction. And if region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely above region z and overlaps with region z in the East-West direction.

Wait, when I say "overlaps in the East-West direction", I mean that the projection onto the East-West direction overlaps, not that the regions themselves overlap.

Ok, I think I need to clarify further. In the 2D plane, let's define directions in terms of bounding boxes:

- North: The bounding box of one region is entirely above the bounding box of the reference region, and the two bounding boxes overlap when projected onto the East-West axis.
- Northeast: The bounding box of one region is entirely above and entirely to the East of the bounding box of the reference region.
- Northwest: The bounding box of one region is entirely above and entirely to the West of the bounding box of the reference region.

Wait, these definitions still don't align with all common notions of cardinal directions. The issue is that in some contexts, "North" is used to mean "entirely above without any East-West constraint", while in other contexts, it's used to mean "entirely above and aligned in the East-West direction".

Let me re-think this from the CDC (Cardinal Direction Calculus) perspective, which is a more formal approach. In the CDC, a reference region divides the 2D space into 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the region itself O). Given this division, a region can be in one or more of these tiles.

In this context, when we say "region x is North of region y", it means that region x is entirely in the North tile of region y. Similarly, when we say "region y is North of region z", it means that region y is entirely in the North tile of region z.

Given these, the relation between region x and region z is determined by where the North tile of region y is in relation to region z. Specifically, if region y is entirely in the North tile of region z, then the North tile of region y is a subset of the tiles North, Northeast, and Northwest of region z. This means that region x, which is entirely in the North tile of region y, is also entirely in one of the tiles North, Northeast, or Northwest of region z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

But wait, I think I'm making this problem more complex than it needs to be, and I'm now having to consider more and more complex issues. Let me simplify.

Let's just use the standard interpretation of cardinal directions:

North: One region is entirely above another.
South: One region is entirely below another.
East: One region is entirely to the right of another.
West: One region is entirely to the left of another.

With this interpretation, if region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely above region y. And if region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely above region z.

By transitivity, region x is entirely above region z, which means region x is North of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is North.

Actually, no. I'm being too simple now. Let's consider more specific definitions of cardinal directions:

North: The bounding box of one region is entirely above the bounding box of the reference region, and the two bounding boxes overlap when projected onto the East-West axis.
Northeast: The bounding box of one region is entirely above and entirely to the East of the bounding box of the reference region.
Northwest: The bounding box of one region is entirely above and entirely to the West of the bounding box of the reference region.

(Similar definitions for the other cardinal directions.)

With these definitions, if region x is North of region y, then the bounding box of region x is entirely above the bounding box of region y, and the two bounding boxes overlap when projected onto the East-West axis. Similarly, if region y is North of region z, then the bounding box of region y is entirely above the bounding box of region z, and the two bounding boxes overlap when projected onto the East-West axis.

Given these, what can we say about the relation between region x and region z?

Well, the bounding box of region x is entirely above the bounding box of region y, and the bounding box of region y is entirely above the bounding box of region z. By transitivity, the bounding box of region x is entirely above the bounding box of region z.

But what about the East-West relationship? The bounding box of region x overlaps with the bounding box of region y when projected onto the East-West axis, and the bounding box of region y overlaps with the bounding box of region z when projected onto the East-West axis. But this doesn't directly tell us about the East-West relationship between the bounding boxes of region x and region z.

In fact, the bounding box of region x can be entirely to the East of the bounding box of region z, entirely to the West of it, or they can overlap when projected onto the East-West axis. These correspond to the relations Northeast, Northwest, and North, respectively.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Let me actually try to prove this with a more concrete example.

Let's set up the following:
- The bounding box of region z is the square from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- The bounding box of region y is the square from (1, 3) to (3, 5). This is North of region z because it's entirely above region z and they overlap when projected onto the East-West axis.

Now, let's consider three different positions for region x, all of which are North of region y:

1. The bounding box of region x is the square from (1.5, 6) to (2.5, 8). This is North of region y. In relation to region z, it's North because it's entirely above region z and they overlap when projected onto the East-West axis.

2. The bounding box of region x is the square from (4, 6) to (6, 8). This is North of region y. In relation to region z, it's Northeast because it's entirely above and entirely to the East of region z.

3. The bounding box of region x is the square from (-1, 6) to (1, 8). This is North of region y. In relation to region z, it's Northwest because it's entirely above and entirely to the West of region z.

These examples confirm that the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Ok, so to summarize:

If region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, then the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Intuitively, we know that x is North of y and y is North of z, which means that x is definitely above z. However, the East-West relationship between x and z is not fully constrained by the given conditions, which is why multiple relations are possible.

Actually, wait, I think I'm overcomplicating things. If "North" means directly to the North, with no East-West component, then "North of North" is just "North".

Actually, no. I think I'm confusing the issue, and I don't think the definitions are in fact fully standardized. Let me try to understand what North means in the context of the question.

The question is asking about the cardinal direction relations. In the cardinal direction system, the main directions are North, South, East, and West, and the intermediate directions are Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest.

I'll use the following definitions:

- North: One region is entirely above another.
- South: One region is entirely below another.
- East: One region is entirely to the right of another.
- West: One region is entirely to the left of another.
- Northeast: One region is entirely above and entirely to the right of another.
- Southeast: One region is entirely below and entirely to the right of another.
- Southwest: One region is entirely below and entirely to the left of another.
- Northwest: One region is entirely above and entirely to the left of another.

Given these definitions, if region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely above region y. And if region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely above region z.

By transitivity, region x is entirely above region z, which means region x is North of region z.

But that's just in terms of the North-South axis. What about the East-West axis?

The relation "North" doesn't constrain the East-West relationship. So, if region x is entirely above region z, the East-West relationship between region x and region z can be of three types:

1. Region x is directly above region z (they overlap when projected onto the East-West axis). In this case, region x is North of region z.
2. Region x is entirely to the right (East) of region z. In this case, region x is Northeast of region z.
3. Region x is entirely to the left (West) of region z. In this case, region x is Northwest of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Actually, I realized I'm overthinking. What the question is asking is simple. Let's try to understand the transitive behavior of the "North" relation.

If region x is North of region y, and region y is North of region z, then by transitivity, region x is North of region z. This is because "North" means "above", and if x is above y and y is above z, then x is above z.

But the question is asking for the possible cardinal direction relations, which might be a clue that there are multiple possibilities.

Again, let's use the basic definitions of cardinal directions:

- North: One region is entirely above another.
- Northeast: One region is entirely above and entirely to the right of another.
- Northwest: One region is entirely above and entirely to the left of another.

If region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely above region y. And if region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely above region z.

By transitivity, region x is entirely above region z. This means region x can be either North, Northeast, or Northwest of region z, depending on the East-West relationship between region x and region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Let me double-check this with a specific example:

Let's say:
- Region z is at (0, 0) with a certain extent.
- Region y is at (0, 5) with the same extent. This means y is North of z.
- Region x is at (0, 10) with the same extent. This means x is North of y.

In this case, region x is North of region z.

Now, let's slightly modify:
- Region z is at (0, 0) with a certain extent.
- Region y is at (0, 5) with the same extent. This means y is North of z.
- Region x is at (5, 10) with the same extent. This means x is Northeast of y. But this still satisfies the condition that x is North of y, since x is entirely above y.

In this modified case, region x is Northeast of region z.

Similarly, if region x is at (-5, 10), it's Northwest of y and, consequently, Northwest of z.

These examples confirm that the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Wait, let me double check. If region x is at (5, 10), I think it's Northeast of y, not North of y because x is both above and to the right of y. But the question specifies that region x is North of region y. So, if we're using the strict definition of "North" to mean "directly above without any East-West displacement", then x cannot be at (5, 10).

But this is where the definition of "North" becomes important. I've been oscillating between two interpretations:

1. North: One region is directly above another without any East-West displacement.
2. North: One region is entirely above another, without any constraint on the East-West relationship.

If we're using the first interpretation, then the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is just North.

If we're using the second interpretation, then the possible cardinal direction relations are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

I think the second interpretation is more in line with the common understanding of cardinal direction relations, but I want to be certain.

Oh, I'm overcomplicating this. It's clear from the question that we're using cardinal direction relations, not just the "North" relation. The question specifically asks for "cardinal direction relations," which encompasses all eight cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest).

So, if region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Oh, I think the key issue is that the questions asks about "North and North", meaning the relation that follows. So we've established that if x is North of y, and y is North of z, then x can be North, Northeast, or Northwest of z.

Actually, there's another possible reading, that North and North are just listed as examples of the cardinal direction relations, and the question is asking about the behavior of the cardinal direction relations in general. But let's focus on the interpretation I've been using, which is that the question is specifically about the "North" relation.

Let me see if I can understand the CDC (Cardinal Direction Calculus) more precisely to resolve any lingering doubts.

In the CDC, space is divided into nine tiles based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a reference region. These tiles are named North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and the region itself (O).

Now, in this calculus, when we say "region x is North of region y", it means that region x is entirely contained in the North tile of region y. Similarly, when we say "region y is North of region z", it means that region y is entirely contained in the North tile of region z.

Given these, where can region x be in relation to region z?

The North tile of region z is the area above the MBR of region z. Since region y is entirely within the North tile of region z, the MBR of region y is entirely in the North tile of region z.

Now, region x is entirely within the North tile of region y, which means it's entirely above the MBR of region y. Since the MBR of region y is entirely in the North tile of region z, region x is definitely entirely above the MBR of region z, which places it in the North tile of region z.

But in the East-West direction, the position of region x in relation to the MBR of region z is not fully constrained by the given conditions. Depending on this East-West relationship, region x can be entirely in the North tile of region z, entirely in the Northeast tile of region z, or entirely in the Northwest tile of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z in the CDC are: North (N), Northeast (NE), and Northwest (NW).

This is consistent with the understanding I've been developing.

So, my answer is: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Actually, I just had a moment of hesitation. Let me double-check with a specific scenario.

Let's define the regions:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (0, 5). This means y is North of z.
- x is at (10, 10). Is x North of y?

In the basic cardinal direction system, "North" means "entirely above". Since x is entirely above y, x is North of y. But x is also entirely to the right of y, which would make x Northeast of y.

But wait, the way I've been interpreting the cardinal direction relations, these relations are mutually exclusive. So if x is Northeast of y, it's not also North of y.

I think I've been mixing two interpretations:

1. In one interpretation, "North" means "entirely above without any East-West constraint". This is a more inclusive definition.
2. In the other interpretation, "North" means "entirely above and not entirely to the East or West". This is a more exclusive definition.

In the context of the question, I think the second interpretation is more in line with the standard understanding of cardinal directions. With this interpretation, if region x is North of region y, it means x is entirely above y and not entirely to the East or West of y. Similarly, if y is North of z, then y is entirely above z and not entirely to the East or West of z.

Given these constraints, what are the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z?

Well, x is entirely above y, and y is entirely above z, so x is entirely above z. This means x is either North, Northeast, or Northwest of z, depending on the East-West relationship.

But the fact that x is North of y means x is not entirely to the East or West of y. Similarly, y is not entirely to the East or West of z. This doesn't directly constrain the East-West relationship between x and z.

Let's consider an example:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (1, 5). Since y is directly above z (they overlap in the East-West direction), y is North of z.
- x is at (5, 10). Is x North of y?

In this case, x is entirely above y, but it's also entirely to the East of y. This would make x Northeast of y, not North of y. So, this scenario doesn't satisfy the given constraint that x is North of y.

Let's try another:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (1, 5). Since y is directly above z (they overlap in the East-West direction), y is North of z.
- x is at (1, 10). Since x is directly above y (they overlap in the East-West direction), x is North of y.

In this case, x is also directly above z (they overlap in the East-West direction), which means x is North of z.

But now, let's modify slightly:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (2, 5). Since y is directly above z (they overlap in the East-West direction), y is North of z.
- x is at (3, 10). Since x is not entirely to the East of y (they overlap in the East-West direction), x is North of y.

In this case, x is also directly above z (they overlap in the East-West direction), which means x is North of z.

Let's modify once more:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (3, 5). Since y is directly above z (they overlap in the East-West direction), y is North of z.
- x is at (5, 10). In this case, x is entirely to the East of y, which means x is Northeast of y, not North of y. So, this scenario doesn't satisfy the given constraint that x is North of y.

Actually, I'm finding I have to think very precisely. I think I'm overthinking and making the problem too complex.

Let's use the common understanding of cardinal directions:
- North (N): Entirely above.
- Northeast (NE): Entirely above and entirely to the right.
- Northwest (NW): Entirely above and entirely to the left.
- East (E): Entirely to the right.
- West (W): Entirely to the left.
- South (S): Entirely below.
- Southeast (SE): Entirely below and entirely to the right.
- Southwest (SW): Entirely below and entirely to the left.

With these definitions, if region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely above region y. And if region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely above region z.

By transitivity, region x is entirely above region z. This places region x in one of the "northern" tiles in relation to region z. Depending on the East-West relationship, region x can be North, Northeast, or Northwest of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Actually, I'm realizing I'm overthinking. The question asks for the "possible" relation, which suggests there are multiple possibilities. This is a strong hint that the answer is as I've been saying: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Let me check with one more example to be sure:

Let's say:
- z is at (0, 0) with a width of 1.
- y is at (0, 2) with a width of 1. Since y is directly above z, y is North of z.
- x is at (0, 4) with a width of 1. Since x is directly above y, x is North of y.

In this case, x is directly above z, which means x is North of z.

Now, let's modify:
- z is at (0, 0) with a width of 1.
- y is at (0, 2) with a width of 1. Since y is directly above z, y is North of z.
- x is at (2, 4) with a width of 1. In this case, x is entirely to the right of y, which means x is Northeast of y, not North of y. So, this scenario doesn't satisfy the given constraint that x is North of y.

Actually, the issue is that I've been defining North to mean "directly above". But in cardinal directions, North means "entirely above", without any constraint on the East-West relationship. Let me correct my understanding.

In cardinal directions:
- North: Entirely above (regardless of the East-West relationship).
- Northeast: Entirely above and entirely to the right.
- Northwest: Entirely above and entirely to the left.

With these definitions, if region x is North of region y, then region x is entirely above region y (regardless of the East-West relationship). And if region y is North of region z, then region y is entirely above region z (regardless of the East-West relationship).

Given these, if region x is entirely above region y and region y is entirely above region z, then region x is entirely above region z. But this doesn't constrain the East-West relationship between region x and region z.

Wait, I'm not sure I'm right. It sounds like I'm saying that the relation "North" is sort of like the union of "North", "Northeast", and "Northwest", which doesn't sound right.

Let me try to clarify the definitions once more.

In cardinal directions, the eight standard directions are:
- North (N): Directly above.
- Northeast (NE): Above and to the right.
- East (E): Directly to the right.
- Southeast (SE): Below and to the right.
- South (S): Directly below.
- Southwest (SW): Below and to the left.
- West (W): Directly to the left.
- Northwest (NW): Above and to the left.

With these definitions, if region x is North of region y, then region x is directly above region y. And if region y is North of region z, then region y is directly above region z.

Given these, if region x is directly above region y and region y is directly above region z, then region x is directly above region z (by transitivity). This means region x is North of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is just North.

But I have doubts about this interpretation. The question asks for the "possible" relations, suggesting there are multiple possibilities.

Actually, let me go back to the more formal definition of cardinal directions in the CDC. In this calculus, space is divided into nine tiles based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a reference region. These tiles are named North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and the region itself (O).

In this context, when we say "region x is North of region y", it means that region x is entirely in the North tile of region y. This does not preclude region x from also being in other tiles, like Northeast or Northwest. In other words, the cardinal direction relations in the CDC are not mutually exclusive.

Given this interpretation, if region x is in the North tile of region y, and region y is in the North tile of region z, then region x is entirely above region z. But the East-West relationship between region x and region z is not fully constrained by the given conditions.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Actually, I'm wondering if the question is not about the transitive behavior of the "North" relation, but about the possible combinations of relations when North is combined with North. In that case, it would be more appropriate to write the conclusion as "North", as that's the relation that follows from the combination of North and North.

But I keep going back to the wording. The question asks for the "possible" relations, which suggests there are multiple possibilities. This leads me to believe that the answer is indeed: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Let me check one more time with a different example:

Let's define the regions:
- Region z is at (0, 0) with a width of 2.
- Region y is at (1, 3) with a width of 2. Since y is directly above z and they overlap in the East-West direction, y is North of z.
- Region x is at (2, 6) with a width of 2. Since x is directly above y and they overlap in the East-West direction, x is North of y.

In this case, x is directly above z and they overlap in the East-West direction, which means x is North of z.

Let's modify slightly:
- Region z is at (0, 0) with a width of 2.
- Region y is at (1, 3) with a width of 2. Since y is directly above z and they overlap in the East-West direction, y is North of z.
- Region x is at (4, 6) with a width of 2. In this case, x is entirely to the right of y, which means x is Northeast of y, not North of y. So, this scenario doesn't satisfy the given constraint that x is North of y.

So, I'm beginning to convince myself that if region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, then the only possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is North.

Oh wait a second. The way I'm thinking about these regions may be wrong. I'm thinking of them as points or very small shapes, but they're regions, which can have extent. Let me try again with that in mind.

Let me try to make this concrete with regions:

- Region z is a square from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- Region y is a square from (1, 3) to (3, 5). Since y is entirely above z and they overlap when projected onto the East-West axis, y is North of z.
- Region x is a square from (2, 6) to (4, 8). Since x is entirely above y and they overlap when projected onto the East-West axis, x is North of y.

In this case, x is entirely above z and they overlap when projected onto the East-West axis, which means x is North of z.

Let's modify:
- Region z is a square from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- Region y is a square from (1, 3) to (3, 5). Since y is entirely above z and they overlap when projected onto the East-West axis, y is North of z.
- Region x is a square from (4, 6) to (6, 8). Here, x is entirely above and entirely to the right of y, which means x is Northeast of y, not North of y. So, this scenario doesn't satisfy the given constraint that x is North of y.

Ok, when I consider regions with spatial extent, it becomes clearer. If region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, then region x is most likely North of region z.

But wait, I just realized another potential definition of "North". In some contexts, "North" can mean "above without being entirely to the East or entirely to the West." This would mean that the region can span the East-West direction as long as a part of it is directly above the reference region.

Let me reconsider the CDC (Cardinal Direction Calculus) to get the correct understanding.

In the CDC, space is divided into nine tiles based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a reference region. These tiles are named North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and the region itself (O).

In this calculus, when we say "region x is North of region y", it means that region x is entirely in the North tile of region y. Similarly, when we say "region y is North of region z", it means that region y is entirely in the North tile of region z.

Given these, where can region x be in relation to region z?

The North tile of region z is the area above the MBR of region z. Since region y is entirely within the North tile of region z, the MBR of region y is entirely above the MBR of region z.

Now, region x is entirely within the North tile of region y, which means it's entirely above the MBR of region y. Since the MBR of region y is entirely above the MBR of region z, region x is definitely entirely above the MBR of region z, which places it in the North, Northeast, or Northwest tile of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z in the CDC are: North (N), Northeast (NE), and Northwest (NW).

Actually, let me double check if the CDC is precise enough that the relations are mutually exclusive, meaning that if a region is entirely in the North tile, it can't also be in the Northeast tile. I believe this is the case, as the tiles are defined to be non-overlapping.

Wait, I need to clarify something. The tiles North, Northeast, etc. are mutually exclusive. But when we say "region x is North of region y", it means that region x is entirely in the North tile of region y. However, region x can extend into multiple tiles, so it can be both North and Northeast of region y, for example.

So, when we say "region x is North of region y", it means that at least a part of region x is in the North tile of region y. And when we say "region y is North of region z", it means that at least a part of region y is in the North tile of region z.

Wait, I think I'm still a bit confused because region x can't be both "entirely in the North tile" and "extend into multiple tiles". I think the issue is with the definition of the Cardinal Direction Calculus. Let's look at the formal definition.

In the CDC, the relation is often represented by specifying which tiles of the reference region the target region intersects. For example, "region x is North of region y" would mean that region x intersects the North tile of region y and no other tile.

Given this, if region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, then region x intersects the North tile of region y and no other tile, and region y intersects the North tile of region z and no other tile.

Now, the North tile of region y is entirely above the MBR of region y. And the North tile of region z is entirely above the MBR of region z. Since region y is in the North tile of region z, the MBR of region y is entirely above the MBR of region z.

Given that region x is in the North tile of region y, region x is entirely above the MBR of region y. Since the MBR of region y is entirely above the MBR of region z, region x is entirely above the MBR of region z, which places it in the North, Northeast, or Northwest tile of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

I'm finding that I have to be very precise about the definitions to get this right. Let me try one more time.

In cardinal directions, when we say "region x is North of region y", it means that region x is entirely above region y. When we say "region y is North of region z", it means that region y is entirely above region z.

Given these, if region x is entirely above region y and region y is entirely above region z, then region x is entirely above region z, which means region x is North of region z.

But, and here's where I think I've been making a mistake, "North" doesn't mean "directly above in the East-West direction." It just means "entirely above." So, region x being North of region z doesn't constrain the East-West relationship between region x and region z.

Given that region x is entirely above region z, the East-West relationship between region x and region z can be of three types:

1. Region x is entirely to the right (East) of region z. In this case, region x is Northeast of region z.
2. Region x is entirely to the left (West) of region z. In this case, region x is Northwest of region z.
3. Region x is neither entirely to the right nor entirely to the left of region z (it overlaps with region z when projected onto the East-West axis). In this case, region x is North of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Alright, I think the answer is: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Actually, let me see if the "bounding box" is a clue. In spatial reasoning, the bounding box of a region is the smallest rectangle that contains the region with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The concept of a bounding box is also typically used in the CDC.

Actually, I think if "bounding box" is a possible answer, then I'll need a more precise definitions.

Let me revisit the CDC (Cardinal Direction Calculus). In the CDC, a reference region divides the 2D space into nine tiles using its minimum bounding rectangle (MBR): North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and the region itself (O).

In this context, when we say "region x is North of region y", it means that region x is entirely in the North tile of region y, meaning region x is entirely above the MBR of region y. Similarly, when we say "region y is North of region z", it means that region y is entirely in the North tile of region z, meaning region y is entirely above the MBR of region z.

Given these, what's the relation between region x and region z?

Since region y is entirely above the MBR of region z, the MBR of region y is entirely above the MBR of region z. And since region x is entirely above the MBR of region y, region x is entirely above the MBR of region z. This means region x is in one of the "northern" tiles of region z: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Let's try to make this more concrete.

Imagine region z is a square in the 2D plane. Its MBR is this square. The space around this MBR is divided into eight tiles: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Region y is entirely in the North tile of region z, which means region y is entirely above the MBR of region z. The MBR of region y is therefore entirely above the MBR of region z.

Now, the space around the MBR of region y is also divided into eight tiles. Region x is entirely in the North tile of region y, which means region x is entirely above the MBR of region y.

Given that the MBR of region y is entirely above the MBR of region z, and region x is entirely above the MBR of region y, region x is entirely above the MBR of region z. This places region x in one of the "northern" tiles of region z: North, Northeast, or Northwest.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

I don't see how "Bounding Box" would be a relation. It's just a tool for defining the tiles and the relations.

Ok, let me try to conclude. If region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, then the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Actually, if "Bounding Box" is a possible answer, then the question might be about which representation of cardinal direction relations is appropriate, rather than what specific relation holds. In that case, the answer would be "Bounding Box", indicating that the bounding box representation of cardinal direction relations is appropriate for this problem.

But I'd be surprised if this was the intent, and I'll stick with my earlier answer: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

However, just to be thorough, "Bounding Box" could also be a relation in a more abstract sense, such as "region x is in the bounding box of region z." But given the context of cardinal direction relations, this interpretation seems less likely.

Ok, I'm still confused by the inclusion of "Bounding Box". Let me re-read the problem statement.

"Let North and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

The problem is asking for the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z.

Based on the understanding of cardinal directions, the possible relations are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

I think I'm not seeing where "Bounding Box" could be an answer. Maybe "Bounding Box" is a specific cardinal direction relation in a frame of reference that I'm not familiar with, but that seems odd, especially given the usual eight cardinal directions.

Ok, I'll stick with North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Actually, I wonder if the question is about the composition of relations in a different setting, like the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) or the 9-Intersection Model (9IM). In those frameworks, "Bounding Box" could be a relation.

But given the explicit mention of "cardinal direction relations" and "North", I think the most straightforward interpretation is that the question is about the cardinal directions, and the answer is: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- North
- Northeast
- Northwest

Since x is North of y and y is North of z, region x must be above region z (in the northern direction). However, the east-west relationship between x and z is not constrained by the given information, which allows for these three possibilities.
