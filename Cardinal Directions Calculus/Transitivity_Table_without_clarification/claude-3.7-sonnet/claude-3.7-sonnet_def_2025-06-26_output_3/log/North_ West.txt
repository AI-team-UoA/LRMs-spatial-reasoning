PROMPT: Let North and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

This question is asking about spatial reasoning using cardinal direction relations. Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is West of region z

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

To visualize this:
- If x is North of y, then x is above y on a map.
- If y is West of z, then y is to the left of z on a map.

So we have:
```
    x
    |
    |
    y --- z
```

Where:
- x is directly above y
- z is directly to the right of y

Now, what is the relation between x and z?

From the diagram, x is North and West of z, which would make x Northwest of z.

But wait, I should be more careful. The cardinal direction relations could be interpreted in different ways, depending on whether we're using strict directions or regions.

Let me think about this more precisely. In cardinal direction reasoning, we typically use a model where each region is divided into 9 tiles (like a tic-tac-toe board): North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the central tile.

If x is North of y, it means x is entirely in the North region of y.
If y is West of z, it means y is entirely in the West region of z.

Now, let's determine where x is in relation to z.

Since x is North of y, and y is West of z, x must be in the Northwest, North, or Northeast region of z.

Actually, let me be even more precise. The question states "x is North of y" and "y is West of z". In standard cardinal direction reasoning:

- "x is North of y" means x is in the North region of y, which means x is above y.
- "y is West of z" means y is in the West region of z, which means y is to the left of z.

Given these, x could be:
1. Northwest of z (if x is directly above y and y is directly to the left of z)
2. North of z (if x is above z)
3. Northeast of z (if x extends far enough to the right)
4. West of z (if x extends far enough downward)

Actually, let me reconsider. I'm not being precise enough.

Let me consider the possible relative positions more systematically.

We know:
- x is North of y, which means x is above y.
- y is West of z, which means y is to the left of z.

Now, let's think about where x can be in relation to z:

1. If x is directly above y and y is directly to the left of z, then x would be Northwest of z.
2. If x extends rightward enough to be above z, then x would be North of z.
3. If x extends rightward beyond z, then parts of x would be Northeast of z.
4. If x extends downward enough to be to the left of z, then parts of x would be West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast
- West

Actually, I realize I need to be more careful. The question asks for "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" This means I need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations that could hold between x and z given the constraints.

Given that x is North of y and y is West of z, x must be in some position that's both North of y and in some relation to z. Let's enumerate all possible scenarios:

1. x is Northwest of z: This is definitely possible. If x is directly North of y and y is directly West of z, then x is Northwest of z.

2. x is North of z: This is possible if x extends rightward enough to be directly above z.

3. x is Northeast of z: This is possible if x extends far enough to the right of z.

4. x is West of z: This is possible if x extends downward enough to be directly to the left of z.

5. x is Southwest of z: This is not possible because x is North of y, so it can't be South of y, which means it can't be Southwest of z.

6. x is South of z: This is not possible for the same reason as above.

7. x is Southeast of z: This is not possible for the same reason as above.

8. x is East of z: This is possible if x extends far enough to the right and downward to be directly to the right of z.

Actually, I need to think more carefully about point 8. If x is North of y, it means x is above y. If x were to extend downward to be directly to the right of z, it would no longer be strictly North of y, but would have parts that are North, Northeast, or East of y. So, x can't be East of z if it's strictly North of y.

Let me rethink this.

If x is North of y, it means x is entirely above y.
If y is West of z, it means y is entirely to the left of z.

Given these constraints, x could be:

1. Northwest of z: If x is directly above y and doesn't extend rightward beyond z's western boundary.
2. North of z: If x extends rightward enough to be directly above z.
3. Northeast of z: If x extends rightward beyond z's eastern boundary.
4. West of z: If x extends downward enough to be directly to the left of z but still entirely above y.

I'm not sure if 4 is actually possible. Let me think...

If x is entirely above y (i.e., North of y), and y is entirely to the left of z (i.e., West of z), then can x be West of z? For x to be West of z, it needs to be entirely to the left of z. But given that y is already West of z, and x is North of y, it seems x would be Northwest of z, not just West.

Actually, let's be even more precise. Let's define the regions using a coordinate system. Let the center of region y be at the origin (0, 0). Let's use the coordinate system where positive y-axis is North, and positive x-axis is East.

Given:
- x is North of y, which means x is in the region where y-coordinate > 0 and x-coordinate can be any value.
- y is West of z, which means z is in the region where x-coordinate > 0 and y-coordinate can be any value.

So, z is somewhere in the right half-plane.
x is somewhere in the top half-plane.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. Northwest of z: This is possible when x is in the top-left quadrant from z's perspective.
2. North of z: This is possible when x is directly above z.
3. Northeast of z: This is possible when x is in the top-right quadrant from z's perspective.
4. West of z: This is possible when x is directly to the left of z.

Hmm, I'm having trouble visualizing this, so let me think in terms of regions in the Cartesian plane.

Let's consider the relation between two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):
- (x1, y1) is North of (x2, y2) if y1 > y2 and x1 = x2.
- (x1, y1) is Northeast of (x2, y2) if y1 > y2 and x1 > x2.
- (x1, y1) is East of (x2, y2) if y1 = y2 and x1 > x2.
- (x1, y1) is Southeast of (x2, y2) if y1 < y2 and x1 > x2.
- (x1, y1) is South of (x2, y2) if y1 < y2 and x1 = x2.
- (x1, y1) is Southwest of (x2, y2) if y1 < y2 and x1 < x2.
- (x1, y1) is West of (x2, y2) if y1 = y2 and x1 < x2.
- (x1, y1) is Northwest of (x2, y2) if y1 > y2 and x1 < x2.

Now, for regions, it gets more complex. However, using a simple model, let's say:
- Region A is North of Region B if all points in A are North of some point in B and all points in B are South of some point in A.
- Similar definitions apply for other cardinal directions.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is West of region z.

Using our coordinate system, and placing y at the origin, x is in the top half-plane and z is in the right half-plane.

For x to be Northwest of z, x needs to be to the left of z and above z, which is possible.
For x to be North of z, x needs to be directly above z, which is possible.
For x to be Northeast of z, x needs to be to the right of z and above z, which is possible.
For x to be West of z, x needs to be directly to the left of z, which means its y-coordinate range must overlap with z's. Given that x is North of y and y is at the origin, x must have y-coordinates > 0. For z, its y-coordinates can be any value. So, it's possible for x to be West of z if z's y-coordinates extend into the positive range.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast
- West

Actually, let me just consider some concrete examples:

1. Let y be a point at the origin (0, 0).
2. Let z be a point at (1, 0), which makes it East of y.
3. Let x be a point at (0, 1), which makes it North of y.

In this setup, x is at (0, 1) and z is at (1, 0). The relation between x and z is Northwest (x is to the left and above z).

Now, let's modify:
4. Let z be a point at (1, 2), which still makes it East of y.
5. Let x remain at (0, 1), which still makes it North of y.

In this setup, x is at (0, 1) and z is at (1, 2). The relation between x and z is Southwest (x is to the left and below z).

But wait, that contradicts my earlier analysis! Let me double-check.

If y is at (0, 0), z is at (1, 2), and x is at (0, 1), then:
- x is North of y: True, (0, 1) is directly above (0, 0).
- y is West of z: True, (0, 0) is directly to the left of (1, 2).
- x is Southwest of z: True, (0, 1) is to the left and below (1, 2).

So, x can be Southwest of z. Let me rethink the possible relations.

Actually, I think I was mixing up the cardinal direction definitions. Let me clarify again.

The usual cardinal direction relations in spatial reasoning are:
- A is North of B if all points in A have a y-coordinate greater than all points in B.
- A is East of B if all points in A have an x-coordinate greater than all points in B.
- A is South of B if all points in A have a y-coordinate less than all points in B.
- A is West of B if all points in A have an x-coordinate less than all points in B.
- A is Northeast of B if all points in A have both x and y coordinates greater than all points in B.
- And so on for the other diagonal directions.

Now, let's reconsider our problem.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y. This means all points in x have a y-coordinate greater than all points in y.
- Region y is West of region z. This means all points in y have an x-coordinate less than all points in z.

If y is at the origin, x is in the top half-plane and z is in the right half-plane.

Wait a minute, let's think about this from a different angle. I made a mistake. This is about cardinal direction relations for regions, not individual points.

For regions, the standard model is to use a 9-intersection model (like a tic-tac-toe board). The center cell is the "bounding box" of the reference region. The 8 cells around it represent the 8 cardinal and inter-cardinal directions.

Given this model:
- x is North of y means x is entirely in the northern cell of y's tic-tac-toe board.
- y is West of z means y is entirely in the western cell of z's tic-tac-toe board.

From this, we want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Actually, I'm not sure if we use the exact model I just described.

Let me approach this problem differently, using a more intuitive understanding.

Let's visualize regions x, y, and z on a 2D plane:

We are told:
- x is North of y (i.e., x is above y).
- y is West of z (i.e., y is to the left of z).

We want to know the possible relations between x and z.

Given the constraints, x could be:
1. Northwest of z (if x is directly above y, and y is directly to the left of z).
2. North of z (if x extends rightward enough to be directly above z).
3. Northeast of z (if x extends rightward beyond z).
4. West of z (if x extends downward enough to be directly to the left of z).
5. Southwest of z (if x and z are positioned appropriately).

Wait, let me more carefully think about the case of x being Southwest of z.

If x is North of y, it means x is above y. If y is West of z, it means y is to the left of z.

For x to be Southwest of z, x needs to be below and to the left of z. But if x is already above y, and y is to the left of z, it doesn't seem possible for x to be below z.

Let me visualize this.

For x to be Southwest of z, x has to be below and to the left of z. If y is to the left of z, and x is above y, then x is to the left of z and above y. This doesn't immediately tell us the relation between the y-coordinates of x and z. If z is positioned high enough, x could indeed be below z, making x Southwest of z.

Actually, I'm making this too complicated by considering x, y, and z as general regions. Let me simplify by considering them as points first, and then we can generalize.

Let's place y at the origin (0, 0).

If x is North of y, then x is at a point (a, b) where a can be any real number and b > 0.
If y is West of z, then z is at a point (c, d) where c > 0 and d can be any real number.

So, x is at (a, b) with b > 0, and z is at (c, d) with c > 0.

The cardinal direction relation between x and z is determined by the relative values of a and c, and b and d:

- If a < c and b > d, then x is Northwest of z.
- If a = c and b > d, then x is North of z.
- If a > c and b > d, then x is Northeast of z.
- If a < c and b = d, then x is West of z.
- If a = c and b = d, then x and z are at the same point (not a valid scenario given the constraints).
- If a > c and b = d, then x is East of z.
- If a < c and b < d, then x is Southwest of z.
- If a = c and b < d, then x is South of z.
- If a > c and b < d, then x is Southeast of z.

Given the constraints, x is at (a, b) with b > 0, and z is at (c, d) with c > 0. All of the above cardinal directions are possible, except for the case where x and z are at the same point.

For x to be Southwest of z, we need a < c and b < d. This is possible if d > b > 0, which means z is positioned higher than x.

Similarly, x can be South of z if a = c and b < d, which is possible if d > b > 0.

x can be Southeast of z if a > c and b < d, which is possible if a > c > 0 and d > b > 0.

x can be East of z if a > c and b = d, which is possible if a > c > 0 and b = d.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West

Actually, I'm still not sure. Let me create a concrete example for each of these to verify. I'll represent each region as a single point for simplicity.

1. Northwest: Let y be at (0, 0), z at (1, 0), and x at (0, 1). Then, x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is Northwest of z. ✓

2. North: Let y be at (0, 0), z at (1, 0), and x at (1, 1). Then, x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is North of z. ✓

3. Northeast: Let y be at (0, 0), z at (1, 0), and x at (2, 1). Then, x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is Northeast of z. ✓

4. East: Let y be at (0, 0), z at (1, 0), and x at (2, 0). Wait, this doesn't work because x isn't North of y. ✗

5. Southeast: Let y be at (0, 0), z at (1, 0), and x at (2, -1). This doesn't work because x isn't North of y. ✗

6. South: Let y be at (0, 0), z at (1, 0), and x at (1, -1). This doesn't work because x isn't North of y. ✗

7. Southwest: Let y be at (0, 0), z at (1, 0), and x at (0, -1). This doesn't work because x isn't North of y. ✗

8. West: Let y be at (0, 0), z at (1, 0), and x at (-1, 0). This doesn't work because x isn't North of y. ✗

Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the constraints more carefully.

Given:
- x is North of y. This means all points in x have a y-coordinate greater than all points in y.
- y is West of z. This means all points in y have an x-coordinate less than all points in z.

Let's set up a coordinate system. For simplicity, let's say the reference point (the bottom-left corner) of region y is at (0, 0), and y has a width of 1 and a height of 1. So, y is the unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).

If x is North of y, then all points in x have y-coordinates greater than 1. So, x is entirely in the region y > 1.

If y is West of z, then all points in z have x-coordinates greater than 1. So, z is entirely in the region x > 1.

Now, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z depend on the exact shapes and positions of x and z. Let's consider different scenarios.

If x is completely to the left of z (i.e., the maximum x-coordinate of x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z), then x is West of z.

If x is completely above z (i.e., the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z), then x is North of z.

If x is completely to the right of z (i.e., the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z), then x is East of z.

If x is completely below z (i.e., the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z), then x is South of z.

And there are also the mixed directions (Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast).

Let's check each possibility to see if it's feasible:

1. x is North of z: This is possible if x is entirely above z. ✓

2. x is East of z: This is possible if x is entirely to the right of z. But, given that x is North of y and y is West of z, this means x is in the region y > 1 and z is in the region x > 1. For x to be East of z, x would need to be even further to the right, which is possible. ✓

3. x is South of z: For x to be South of z, x would need to be below z. But x is North of y, so it's in the region y > 1. For x to be South of z, z would need to be even higher, which is possible given that z is in the region x > 1. ✓

4. x is West of z: For x to be West of z, x would need to be to the left of z. Given that z is in the region x > 1, any part of x with x-coordinates < 1 would be West of z. Since x is North of y, it's in the region y > 1, but its x-coordinates can be any value. So, x can be West of z. ✓

5. x is Northwest of z: This is possible if x is both to the left of and above z. ✓

6. x is Northeast of z: This is possible if x is both to the right of and above z. ✓

7. x is Southeast of z: This is possible if x is both to the right of and below z. As discussed in point 3, it's possible for x to be South of z, and as discussed in point 2, it's possible for x to be East of z. So, it's also possible for x to be Southeast of z. ✓

8. x is Southwest of z: This is possible if x is both to the left of and below z. As discussed in point 3, it's possible for x to be South of z, and as discussed in point 4, it's possible for x to be West of z. So, it's also possible for x to be Southwest of z. ✓

Actually, I'm being a bit imprecise. If we talk about regions, we need to say when a region is in a certain cardinal direction of another. So let me break it down.

In the context of regions, the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West, etc.) are defined using a 9-tile grid. The central tile (B) is the bounding box of the reference region, and the 8 tiles around it represent the 8 cardinal and inter-cardinal directions.

Given regions x, y, and z:
- x is North of y means x is entirely in the northern tile of y's grid.
- y is West of z means y is entirely in the western tile of z's grid.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

To visualize, if we set up a coordinate system with y's bounding box centered at the origin, and if x is North of y, then x is entirely in the region y > b/2, where b is the height of y's bounding box. Similarly, if y is West of z, then z is entirely in the region x > a/2, where a is the width of y's bounding box.

Actually, let me restart and make sure we're using the proper definition of the cardinal direction relations.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the relation between two regions is defined based on the projection of one region onto the coordinate axes of the other. If we have regions A and B, then:

- A is North of B if, when projecting onto the y-axis, the minimum y-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of B.
- A is South of B if, when projecting onto the y-axis, the maximum y-coordinate of A is less than the minimum y-coordinate of B.
- A is East of B if, when projecting onto the x-axis, the minimum x-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of B.
- A is West of B if, when projecting onto the x-axis, the maximum x-coordinate of A is less than the minimum x-coordinate of B.
- A is Northeast of B if A is both North of B and East of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is both South of B and East of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is both South of B and West of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North of B and West of B.

Now, given the constraints:
- x is North of y.
- y is West of z.

Let's set up a coordinate system where the bottom-left corner of y is at (0, 0). If y is a unit square, its corners are at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).

If x is North of y, then all points in x have y-coordinates greater than 1.
If y is West of z, then all points in z have x-coordinates greater than 1.

So, x is in the region y > 1, and z is in the region x > 1.

Let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z by considering different scenarios for the exact shapes and positions of x and z.

1. x is North of z: For this to be true, the minimum y-coordinate of x should be greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z. Since x is North of y, its y-coordinates are > 1. For x to be North of z, z's y-coordinates should be < some value c, where c is the minimum y-coordinate of x. This is possible, so x can be North of z. ✓

2. x is South of z: For this to be true, the maximum y-coordinate of x should be less than the minimum y-coordinate of z. Since x is North of y, its y-coordinates are > 1. For x to be South of z, z's y-coordinates should be > some value d, where d is the maximum y-coordinate of x. This is possible, so x can be South of z. ✓

3. x is East of z: For this to be true, the minimum x-coordinate of x should be greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z. Since z is East of y, its x-coordinates are > 1. For x to be East of z, x's x-coordinates should be > some value e, where e is the maximum x-coordinate of z. This is possible, so x can be East of z. ✓

4. x is West of z: For this to be true, the maximum x-coordinate of x should be less than the minimum x-coordinate of z. Since z is East of y, its x-coordinates are > 1. For x to be West of z, x's x-coordinates should be < some value f, where f is the minimum x-coordinate of z. Given that x is North of y, its x-coordinates can be any value, so x can be West of z. ✓

5. x is Northeast of z: This is possible if x is both North of z and East of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

6. x is Southeast of z: This is possible if x is both South of z and East of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

7. x is Southwest of z: This is possible if x is both South of z and West of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

8. x is Northwest of z: This is possible if x is both North of z and West of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

So, all cardinal and inter-cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z, except for the case where they overlap (which isn't a cardinal direction relation).

Let me make more concrete examples to verify this.

For simplicity, let's represent each region as a rectangle, and let's assume y is a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (0, 0).

1. x is North of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).
   - z: rectangle with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1).
   - x: rectangle with corners at (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3).
   x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is North of z. ✓

2. x is South of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).
   - z: rectangle with corners at (2, 3), (3, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4).
   - x: rectangle with corners at (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2.5), (3, 2.5).
   x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is South of z. ✓

3. x is East of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).
   - z: rectangle with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1).
   - x: rectangle with corners at (4, 2), (5, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3).
   x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is East of z. ✓

4. x is West of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).
   - z: rectangle with corners at (4, 0), (5, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1).
   - x: rectangle with corners at (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3).
   x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is West of z. ✓

5. x is Northeast of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).
   - z: rectangle with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1).
   - x: rectangle with corners at (4, 2), (5, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3).
   x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is Northeast of z. ✓

6. x is Southeast of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).
   - z: rectangle with corners at (2, 3), (3, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4).
   - x: rectangle with corners at (4, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2.5), (5, 2.5).
   x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is Southeast of z. ✓

7. x is Southwest of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).
   - z: rectangle with corners at (4, 3), (5, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4).
   - x: rectangle with corners at (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2.5), (3, 2.5).
   x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is Southwest of z. ✓

8. x is Northwest of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).
   - z: rectangle with corners at (4, 0), (5, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1).
   - x: rectangle with corners at (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3).
   x is North of y, y is West of z, and x is Northwest of z. ✓

Ok, at this point I'm quite sure that all 8 cardinal and inter-cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z, given the constraints.

So, the answer is: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

Actually, let me double-check this using a different approach. Let's set up a coordinate system with the bottom-left corner of y at (0, 0). Let's say y is a unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).

If y is West of z, then z is a region with x-coordinates > 1.
If x is North of y, then x is a region with y-coordinates > 1.

Let's visualize the possible positions of x and z in this setup. The y-axis is vertical, and the x-axis is horizontal. The region y is at the bottom-left.

```
y > 1 (x can be here)
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+
| y | z can be  |
+---+ here      +
```

I need to be more specific, especially when talking about "x is North of y" and "y is West of z." These are binary relations, and I need to be clear about what they mean.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the relation between two regions is defined as follows:

- A is North of B if, when projecting onto the y-axis, the minimum y-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of B.
- A is South of B if, when projecting onto the y-axis, the maximum y-coordinate of A is less than the minimum y-coordinate of B.
- A is East of B if, when projecting onto the x-axis, the minimum x-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of B.
- A is West of B if, when projecting onto the x-axis, the maximum x-coordinate of A is less than the minimum x-coordinate of B.
- A is Northeast of B if A is both North of B and East of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is both South of B and East of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is both South of B and West of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North of B and West of B.
- A is Equal to B if A and B have the same bounding box.
- A Contains B if B is contained within A.
- A is Contained by B if A is contained within B.
- A Overlaps B if A and B share some common interior, but neither is contained within the other.

Given these definitions, and the constraints:
- x is North of y.
- y is West of z.

Let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

First, let's clarify what the constraints mean:
- x is North of y: The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.
- y is West of z: The maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z.

Using our coordinate system with y as a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (0, 0), these constraints mean:
- min(y-coordinates of x) > 1 (since max(y-coordinates of y) = 1).
- min(x-coordinates of z) > 1 (since max(x-coordinates of y) = 1).

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

1. x is North of z: For this to be true, the minimum y-coordinate of x should be greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z. We know min(y-coordinates of x) > 1. For x to be North of z, we'd need max(y-coordinates of z) < min(y-coordinates of x). This is possible, so x can be North of z. ✓

2. x is South of z: For this to be true, the maximum y-coordinate of x should be less than the minimum y-coordinate of z. We know min(y-coordinates of x) > 1. For x to be South of z, we'd need min(y-coordinates of z) > max(y-coordinates of x). This is possible, so x can be South of z. ✓

3. x is East of z: For this to be true, the minimum x-coordinate of x should be greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z. We know min(x-coordinates of z) > 1. For x to be East of z, we'd need min(x-coordinates of x) > max(x-coordinates of z). This is possible, so x can be East of z. ✓

4. x is West of z: For this to be true, the maximum x-coordinate of x should be less than the minimum x-coordinate of z. We know min(x-coordinates of z) > 1. For x to be West of z, we'd need max(x-coordinates of x) < min(x-coordinates of z). This is possible, so x can be West of z. ✓

5. x is Northeast of z: This is possible if x is both North of z and East of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

6. x is Southeast of z: This is possible if x is both South of z and East of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

7. x is Southwest of z: This is possible if x is both South of z and West of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

8. x is Northwest of z: This is possible if x is both North of z and West of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

9. x is Equal to z: For this to be true, x and z would need to have the same bounding box. Given the constraints, this isn't possible because x and z are in different regions of the coordinate system. ✗

10. x Contains z: For this to be true, z would need to be completely contained within x. Given the constraints, this could be possible if x is large enough and positioned appropriately. ✓

11. x is Contained by z: For this to be true, x would need to be completely contained within z. Given the constraints, this could be possible if z is large enough and positioned appropriately. ✓

12. x Overlaps z: For this to be true, x and z would need to share some common interior, but neither should be contained within the other. Given the constraints, this could be possible if x and z are positioned appropriately. ✓

Actually, I think I'm being needlessly complex. The question asks for the possible cardinal direction relations. Based on the cardinal direction calculus, there are 8 possible cardinal direction relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Actually, let me one more time approach this problem using the defintion of the cardinal direction relation I mentioned earlier.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the relation between two regions is defined as follows:

- A is North of B if, when projecting onto the y-axis, the minimum y-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of B.
- A is South of B if, when projecting onto the y-axis, the maximum y-coordinate of A is less than the minimum y-coordinate of B.
- A is East of B if, when projecting onto the x-axis, the minimum x-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of B.
- A is West of B if, when projecting onto the x-axis, the maximum x-coordinate of A is less than the minimum x-coordinate of B.
- A is Northeast of B if A is both North of B and East of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is both South of B and East of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is both South of B and West of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North of B and West of B.

Given these definitions, and the constraints:
- x is North of y.
- y is West of z.

These constraints mean:
- min(y-coordinates of x) > max(y-coordinates of y).
- max(x-coordinates of y) < min(x-coordinates of z).

Using our coordinate system with y as a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (0, 0), these constraints mean:
- min(y-coordinates of x) > 1 (since max(y-coordinates of y) = 1).
- min(x-coordinates of z) > 1 (since max(x-coordinates of y) = 1).

In this setup, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

1. x is North of z: For this to be true, min(y-coordinates of x) > max(y-coordinates of z). We know min(y-coordinates of x) > 1. For x to be North of z, we'd need max(y-coordinates of z) < min(y-coordinates of x). This is possible, so x can be North of z. ✓

2. x is South of z: For this to be true, max(y-coordinates of x) < min(y-coordinates of z). We know min(y-coordinates of x) > 1. For x to be South of z, we'd need min(y-coordinates of z) > max(y-coordinates of x). This is possible, so x can be South of z. ✓

3. x is East of z: For this to be true, min(x-coordinates of x) > max(x-coordinates of z). We know min(x-coordinates of z) > 1. For x to be East of z, we'd need min(x-coordinates of x) > max(x-coordinates of z). This is possible, so x can be East of z. ✓

4. x is West of z: For this to be true, max(x-coordinates of x) < min(x-coordinates of z). We know min(x-coordinates of z) > 1. For x to be West of z, we'd need max(x-coordinates of x) < min(x-coordinates of z). This is possible, so x can be West of z. ✓

5. x is Northeast of z: This is possible if x is both North of z and East of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

6. x is Southeast of z: This is possible if x is both South of z and East of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

7. x is Southwest of z: This is possible if x is both South of z and West of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

8. x is Northwest of z: This is possible if x is both North of z and West of z, which we've determined are both possible. ✓

Actually, let me just create 8 examples to show that all cardinal directions are possible.

1. x is North of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).
   - z: rectangle with corners at (2, 0), (3, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1).
   - x: rectangle with corners at (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3).
   
   In this setup, y is West of z because max(x-coordinates of y) = 1 < min(x-coordinates of z) = 2.

   And x is Southeast of z because max(y-coordinates of x) = 2 < min(y-coordinates of z) = 3 and min(x-coordinates of x) = 4 > max(x-coordinates of z) = 3. ✓

7. x is Southwest of z:
   - y: unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).

   x is North of y because min(y-coordinates of x) = 2 > max(y-coordinates of y) = 1.
   And x is Northwest of z because min(y-coordinates of x) = 2 > max(y-coordinates of z) = 1 and max(x-coordinates of x) = 3 < min(x-coordinates of z) = 4. ✓

Actually, I'm still not 100% sure. Let me take an alternative approach by considering the constraints more visually.

Let's visualize the cardinal directions in a grid:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
W  | * | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

where "*" represents the reference region.

Given the constraints, y is in the W (West) direction of z, and x is in the N (North) direction of y.

If we draw out the grid and position y as the reference, it would look like:

```
NW | N (x) | NE
---+----+---
W  | y  | E (z)
---+----+---
SW | S  | SE
```

Now, if we try to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, we'd need to move z to the reference position. But the cardinal direction between x and z would depend on their exact positions.

OK, actually let me try with one final conceptualization. Crucially, the cardinal directions form a relation algebra, which means that if one region has a relation to a second, and the second has a relation to a third, we can do a "composition" of relations to figure out the possibilities for the relation between the first and the third. The composition of cardinal direction relations is actually well-studied.

According to the formal definition of the cardinal direction composition, if region A is North of region B, and region B is West of region C, then region A can be Northwest, North, or Northeast of region C. In other words, the composition of North and West gives {Northwest, North, Northeast}.

However, I'm not sure if this is the convention the problem is using.

Let me try to be concrete and think about this in terms of coordinate space. We have three regions x, y, and z.

Given:
- x is North of y.
- y is West of z.

Using the projection definitions I gave earlier, this means:
- min(y-coordinates of x) > max(y-coordinates of y).
- max(x-coordinates of y) < min(x-coordinates of z).

Based on the second constraint, we know that y is to the left of z. Based on the first constraint, we know that x is above y.

So, the x-axis position of x relative to z could be to the left, aligned, or to the right, and the y-axis position of x relative to z could be above, aligned, or below.

I'll explore each combination of x-axis and y-axis positions:

1. x is to the left of z and above z. This would make x Northwest of z. ✓
2. x is aligned with z and above z. This would make x North of z. ✓
3. x is to the right of z and above z. This would make x Northeast of z. ✓
4. x is to the left of z and aligned with z. This would make x West of z. ✓
5. x is aligned with z and aligned with z. This would make x and z the same, which doesn't fit the cardinal direction relations. ✗
6. x is to the right of z and aligned with z. This would make x East of z. ✓
7. x is to the left of z and below z. This would make x Southwest of z. ✓
8. x is aligned with z and below z. This would make x South of z. ✓
9. x is to the right of z and below z. This would make x Southeast of z. ✓

We need to check if any of these combinations is infeasible given our constraints.

The constraint "x is North of y" means x is above y. The constraint "y is West of z" means y is to the left of z.

From these, we can't deduce any constraints that would rule out any of the above combinations (except for case 5, which isn't a cardinal direction relation).

In other words, x could be Northwest, North, Northeast, West, East, Southwest, South, or Southeast of z. All 8 cardinal direction relations are possible.

Actually, let me one more time think about this conceptually. Let's use the notation N for North, S for South, E for East, W for West, NE for Northeast, SE for Southeast, SW for Southwest, and NW for Northwest.

Given:
- x is N of y.
- y is W of z.

We want to find the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z. This is essentially asking for the composition of N and W.

Instead of relying on the formal definition, let me just reason from the constraints.

If x is N of y, it means x is above y. If y is W of z, it means y is to the left of z.

Given these positions, x can be:
- NW of z (if x is to the left of z and above z).
- N of z (if x is directly above z).
- NE of z (if x is to the right of z and above z).
- W of z (if x is to the left of z and not above or below z).
- E of z (if x is to the right of z and not above or below z).
- SW of z (if x is to the left of z and below z).
- S of z (if x is directly below z).
- SE of z (if x is to the right of z and below z).

All 8 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z.

Actually, let me do a sanity check. How can x be South of z if x is North of y and y is West of z?

Let's visualize this. We'll place y at the origin (0, 0), and let z be at (1, 0). If x is North of y, it would be at (0, 1). In this setup, x is at (0, 1), y is at (0, 0), and z is at (1, 0). 

Is x North of y? Yes, x is at (0, 1) and y is at (0, 0), so x is above y.
Is y West of z? Yes, y is at (0, 0) and z is at (1, 0), so y is to the left of z.
Is x South of z? No, x is at (0, 1) and z is at (1, 0), so x is Northwest of z.

Let me try to set up a scenario where x is South of z.

We'll place y at the origin (0, 0), and let z be at (1, 2). If x is North of y, it would be at (0, 1). In this setup, x is at (0, 1), y is at (0, 0), and z is at (1, 2).

Is x North of y? Yes, x is at (0, 1) and y is at (0, 0), so x is above y.
Is y West of z? Yes, y is at (0, 0) and z is at (1, 2), so y is to the left of z.
Is x South of z? Yes, x is at (0, 1) and z is at (1, 2), so x is to the left and below z, making it Southwest of z.

Actually, that's not right. If x is to the left and below z, it's Southwest of z, not South of z. For x to be South of z, it would need to be directly below z.

Let me try again. We'll place y at the origin (0, 0), and let z be at (0, 2). If x is North of y, it would be at (0, 1). In this setup, x is at (0, 1), y is at (0, 0), and z is at (0, 2).

Is x North of y? Yes, x is at (0, 1) and y is at (0, 0), so x is above y.
Is y West of z? No, y is at (0, 0) and z is at (0, 2), so y is South of z, not West of z.

Let's try once more. We'll place y at the origin (0, 0), and let z be at (1, 2). If x is North of y, it would be at (1, 1). In this setup, x is at (1, 1), y is at (0, 0), and z is at (1, 2).

Is x North of y? Well, x is at (1, 1) and y is at (0, 0), so x is to the right and above y, making it Northeast of y, not strictly North of y.

I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think about this in terms of constraints again. I have already given multiple valid examples of the 8 cardinal direction relations, so I'm pretty confident that they are all possible.

But let me double-check by considering the case of x being South of z.

If x is South of z, then x is below z. If x is North of y, then x is above y. If y is West of z, then y is to the left of z.

Let's place y at the origin, and consider the case where y is a unit square with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1). If x is North of y, then x is entirely above y, meaning its y-coordinates are all greater than 1. If y is West of z, then z is entirely to the right of y, meaning its x-coordinates are all greater than 1.

Now, for x to be South of z, x would need to be entirely below z. This means the maximum y-coordinate of x should be less than the minimum y-coordinate of z. We know that min(y-coordinates of x) > 1. For x to be South of z, we'd need min(y-coordinates of z) > max(y-coordinates of x). This is possible if z is positioned high enough.

For example, let z be a rectangle with corners at (2, 3), (3, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4). Let x be a rectangle with corners at (2, 1.5), (3, 1.5), (2, 2), and (3, 2).

In this setup, y is West of z because max(x-coordinates of y) = 1 < min(x-coordinates of z) = 2. x is North of y because min(y-coordinates of x) = 1.5 > max(y-coordinates of y) = 1. And x is South of z because max(y-coordinates of x) = 2 < min(y-coordinates of z) = 3.

OK, let's go with our conclusion that all 8 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z.

So the possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

Let me also sanity-check our conclusion the relation algebra. The composition of cardinal direction relations have been studied, and it's known that N • W = {NW, N, NE}, which means if region A is North of region B, and region B is West of region C, then region A can be Northwest, North, or Northeast of region C.

But this doesn't align with our conclusion. Let me step back.

Actually, we need to be precise about what we mean by the cardinal direction relations. I earlier defined cardinal directions using the projection method, but that's not the only model. 

Another way to define cardinal directions is using the "cone-based" model. In the cone-based model, the cardinal directions are defined as follows:

- A is North of B if every point in A has a y-coordinate greater than the northernmost y-coordinate of B.
- A is South of B if every point in A has a y-coordinate less than the southernmost y-coordinate of B.
- A is East of B if every point in A has an x-coordinate greater than the easternmost x-coordinate of B.
- A is West of B if every point in A has an x-coordinate less than the westernmost x-coordinate of B.
- A is Northeast of B if A is North of B and East of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is South of B and East of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is South of B and West of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is North of B and West of B.

Using the cone-based model, the composition of cardinal directions gives different results. In particular, N • W = {NW, N, NE}.

Actually, I earlier also defined directions using the projection-based model, but with a strict definition, meaning one region is completely to the north (or to the east, etc.) of the other. I think that definition the problem is using the weaker version of the projection model, where "x is North of y" means every point in x is at least as north as the northernmost point in y.

Now, let me step back and revisit the problem. The question asks for the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is North of y and y is West of z.

Actually let me just use the cone-based model I just mentioned, given its simplicity.

Using this model, if x is North of y, it means every point in x has a y-coordinate greater than the northernmost y-coordinate of y. If y is West of z, it means every point in y has an x-coordinate less than the westernmost x-coordinate of z.

Now, if we try to find the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, we need to consider the relative positions of x and z.

In the cone-based model, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, given that x is North of y and y is West of z, are: Northwest, North, and Northeast. 

This is because x being North of y constraints x to be in the northern cone of y. Similarly, y being West of z constraints y to be in the western cone of z. Given these constraints, x can only be in the northwest, north, or northeast cone of z.

Actually, actually let me just go back to the projection-based model and the definition I gave earlier. 

The projection-based model, as I described earlier, defines cardinal directions as follows:
- A is North of B if, when projecting onto the y-axis, the minimum y-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of B.
- A is South of B if, when projecting onto the y-axis, the maximum y-coordinate of A is less than the minimum y-coordinate of B.
- A is East of B if, when projecting onto the x-axis, the minimum x-coordinate of A is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of B.
- A is West of B if, when projecting onto the x-axis, the maximum x-coordinate of A is less than the minimum x-coordinate of B.
- A is Northeast of B if A is both North of B and East of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is both South of B and East of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is both South of B and West of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North of B and West of B.

Ok, in the cone-based model that I mentioned I see that North + West = {Northwest, North, Northeast}. But in the projection-based model that I just quoted, North + West = the whole set of cardinal direction relations. Let's assume the problem is using the projection-based model.

Actually, I'm not convinced about the cone-based model. Let me reason about this problem one more time, starting from the definitions.

In the context of the projection-based model, we have the following:

- A is North of B if min(y-coordinates of A) > max(y-coordinates of B).
- A is South of B if max(y-coordinates of A) < min(y-coordinates of B).
- A is East of B if min(x-coordinates of A) > max(x-coordinates of B).
- A is West of B if max(x-coordinates of A) < min(x-coordinates of B).
- A is Northeast of B if A is both North of B and East of B.
- A is Southeast of B if A is both South of B and East of
