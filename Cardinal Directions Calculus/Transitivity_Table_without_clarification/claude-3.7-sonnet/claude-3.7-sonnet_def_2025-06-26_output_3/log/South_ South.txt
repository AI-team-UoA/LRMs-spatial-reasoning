PROMPT: Let  South and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's establish the cardinal directions first. We have North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and possibly Bounding Box.

Now, the problem states:
- Region x is South of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

I need to determine the possible relation(s) between region x and region z.

If x is South of y, it means x is located below y in a map.
If y is South of z, it means y is located below z in a map.

So, if x is below y and y is below z, then x is definitely below z. This means x is South of z.

Are there any other possible relations? Let's think about it.

If we visualize this on a coordinate system with North pointing upwards (positive y-axis), South pointing downwards (negative y-axis), East pointing to the right (positive x-axis), and West pointing to the left (negative x-axis):

- If x is South of y, then x has a lower y-coordinate than y.
- If y is South of z, then y has a lower y-coordinate than z.
- It follows that x has a lower y-coordinate than z, which means x is South of z.

However, I'm realizing that the "South" relation doesn't specify anything about the x-coordinates. So, there are several possibilities:

1. x and z could be aligned along the y-axis, which would make x directly South of z.
2. x could be to the right of z (higher x-coordinate), which would make x Southeast of z.
3. x could be to the left of z (lower x-coordinate), which would make x Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

Wait, I need to be more careful. The problem specifies that the relation is "South" and not "South of". Let me reconsider.

Actually, "South" and "South of" should be equivalent in this context. "South" or "South of" both refer to the cardinal direction relation where one region is directly below another.

Actually, let me be more precise about the cardinal direction relations:

For any two regions A and B:
- A is North of B if all points in A are above all points in B.
- A is Northeast of B if all points in A are above and to the right of all points in B.
- A is East of B if all points in A are to the right of all points in B.
- A is Southeast of B if all points in A are below and to the right of all points in B.
- A is South of B if all points in A are below all points in B.
- A is Southwest of B if all points in A are below and to the left of all points in B.
- A is West of B if all points in A are to the left of all points in B.
- A is Northwest of B if all points in A are above and to the left of all points in B.
- A is bounded by B if A is completely contained within B.

Wait, I might be making an error in my understanding. Let me think step by step.

If region x is South of region y, it doesn't necessarily mean that all points in x are below all points in y. It generally means that the center or reference point of x is to the south of the center or reference point of y.

Let's reconsider with a more general interpretation:

If the center of x is South of the center of y, and the center of y is South of the center of z, then the center of x is South of the center of z.

But cardinal direction relations can be more complex, especially if we consider the shapes and extents of the regions.

Let me make another attempt. Cardinal direction relations like "South" are usually derived from the relative positions of the bounding boxes of the regions or the centers of the regions.

Based on the transitivity of the South relation:
If x is South of y and y is South of z, then x is South of z.

But considering the broader implications, x could potentially be Southeast, South, or Southwest of z, depending on the exact positions and shapes of the regions.

But since we're dealing with cardinal direction relations explicitly, and the only relation mentioned is "South", I should stick to the formal transitivity rule:

If x is South of y and y is South of z, then x is South of z.

Actually, I need to be a bit more careful. While the South relation is transitive, it doesn't exclude other relations. Let me draw a simple diagram to clarify.

Suppose:
```
    z
   /
  y
 /
x
```

In this diagram, x is South of y, and y is South of z. But because of the diagonal arrangement, x is not directly South of z; it's Southwest of z.

Or consider:
```
z
 \
  y
   \
    x
```

Here, x is South of y, and y is South of z. But x is Southeast of z.

So, based on these examples, if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x could be Southwest, South, or Southeast of z, depending on the exact positions.

Actually, I think I need to be even more precise. Let's consider the strict definitions of the cardinal directions in a qualitative spatial reasoning context.

For any two regions A and B:
- A is North of B if all points in A are above all points in B.
- A is South of B if all points in A are below all points in B.
- A is East of B if all points in A are to the right of all points in B.
- A is West of B if all points in A are to the left of all points in B.
- The composite directions (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest) are combinations of the primary directions.

Now, if region x is strictly South of region y (all points in x are below all points in y) and region y is strictly South of region z (all points in y are below all points in z), then by transitivity, all points in x are below all points in z. This means x is strictly South of z.

But, as the question asks for "possible" relations, I should consider other factors. For instance, if the regions have different horizontal extents or if they are not perfectly aligned, then x might be South, Southeast, or Southwest of z.

Let's actually draw this out and see what the possibilities are:

Scenario 1:
```
    z
    |
    y
    |
    x
```
Here, x is directly South of z.

Scenario 2:
```
z
 \
  y
   \
    x
```
Here, x is Southeast of z.

Scenario 3:
```
    z
   /
  y
 /
x
```
Here, x is Southwest of z.

So, based on these examples, if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x could be Southwest, South, or Southeast of z, depending on the exact positions and extents of the regions.

Actually, let me try to be even more precise. In qualitative spatial reasoning with cardinal directions, there's a distinction between the strict interpretation and the cone-based interpretation:

1. Strict Interpretation: A region is South of another if it is directly below, with no horizontal offset.
2. Cone-based Interpretation: A region is South of another if it is generally below, allowing for some horizontal offset.

For the strict interpretation, if x is strictly South of y and y is strictly South of z, then x is strictly South of z.

For the cone-based interpretation, if x is South of y (in a cone extending south from y) and y is South of z (in a cone extending south from z), then x could be in a cone extending Southwest, South, or Southeast from z.

I think the cone-based interpretation is more general and aligns with the question's intent, especially since it asks for "possible" relations.

Given the cone-based interpretation, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

Actually, I'm not sure if the cone-based interpretation is what's intended here. If we're strictly talking about the transitivity of the South relation in a formal spatial reasoning context, then:

If x is South of y and y is South of z, then x is South of z.

But, as I've shown, depending on the exact positions and extents of the regions, x could be Southwest, South, or Southeast of z.

OK, let me re-read the original problem again:

"Let South and South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is South of region y and region y is South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Hmmm, the problem mentions "South and South". This is a bit confusing. Let me assume there's a bit of a typo, and it means "Let South be a cardinal direction relation."

Given the emphasis on "possible" relations and the general nature of the cardinal direction relations, I think the correct answer is that if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x could be Southwest, South, or Southeast of z.

Actually, the more I think about it, the more I lean towards the interpretation that the cardinal direction relations are strict, meaning x is directly South of y and y is directly South of z. In this case, by transitivity, x is directly South of z.

But the use of "possible" in the question makes me think that the problem is asking about the general case, not just the strict transitive case.

Actually, I realized I might be confusing things a bit. Let me try a more mathematical approach. If we represent regions in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system, we can say:

- Region A is South of region B if the northernmost point of A is south of the southernmost point of B. Or in other words, the y-coordinates of all points in A are less than the y-coordinates of all points in B.

- Similarly, region A is East of region B if the westernmost point of A is east of the easternmost point of B. Or in other words, the x-coordinates of all points in A are greater than the x-coordinates of all points in B.

Using these definitions:

If x is South of y, then the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y.
If y is South of z, then the northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z.
By transitivity, the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, which means x is South of z.

But the above only guarantees that x is South of z. It doesn't say anything about the East-West relationship between x and z. Depending on the exact positions, x could be Southwest, South, or Southeast of z.

Actually, I need to be careful with this interpretation. The original problem doesn't specify that the only relation is "South". It asks for the possible relations given that x is South of y and y is South of z.

Given this, the possible relations between x and z are:
- South (if x is directly below z)
- Southeast (if x is below and to the right of z)
- Southwest (if x is below and to the left of z)

Actually, let me consider one more approach to be sure. In the literature on qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction relations are often defined using the 9-intersection model, which gives rise to 9 relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and "Bounding box" (or "Equal" or "Contains" or "Inside").

Using this model, if x is South of y and y is South of z, then by transitivity, x is South of z. However, this doesn't exclude the possibility that x might be Southeast or Southwest of z, depending on the exact positions and extents of the regions.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

I think this is the most accurate answer given the context and the mathematical definitions of cardinal direction relations.

However, the original problem states:

"Let South and South be cardinal direction relations."

This is a bit strange. It might be a typo or it might be indicating something specific about the problem. If it's a typo, then the analysis above still holds.

Wait, I think I understand the problem better now. The original statement says:

"Let South and South be cardinal direction relations."

This seems to be emphasizing that the relation is specifically "South" and not any other cardinal direction. Given this strict interpretation, if x is strictly South of y and y is strictly South of z, then by transitivity, x is strictly South of z.

However, the question still asks for "possible" relations, which makes me think it's asking about the general case.

On second thought, if we go with the strict interpretation and assume that the only relation mentioned is "South" and not any other cardinal direction, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is "South".

Actually, let's consider a counterexample to see if "South" is the only possible relation.

Suppose region z is at coordinates (0, 2), region y is at coordinates (1, 1), and region x is at coordinates (2, 0). Clearly, x is South of y (because x has a lower y-coordinate than y) and y is South of z (because y has a lower y-coordinate than z). But x is not directly South of z; it's Southeast of z.

This counterexample demonstrates that if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x might not be directly South of z; it could be Southeast or Southwest of z. Actually, let me double check my reasoning.

I said that x is South of y, and that's true because x is at coordinates (2, 0) and y is at coordinates (1, 1), so x has a lower y-coordinate than y. But actually, x is also East of y because x has a higher x-coordinate than y.

So x is Southeast of y, not strictly South of y. This counterexample doesn't work because it doesn't satisfy the conditions of the problem. Let me try again.

Suppose region z is at coordinates (0, 2), region y is at coordinates (0, 1), and region x is at coordinates (1, 0). Clearly, x is South of y (because x has a lower y-coordinate than y) and y is South of z (because y has a lower y-coordinate than z).

Wait, again, x is actually Southeast of y, not strictly South of y.

Let me try once more. Suppose region z is at coordinates (1, 3), region y is at coordinates (1, 2), and region x is at coordinates (1, 1). Now, x is strictly South of y and y is strictly South of z. In this case, x is also strictly South of z.

I think the issue is that if x is strictly South of y and y is strictly South of z, then by the definition of the South relation, x is strictly South of z. There's no way for x to be Southeast or Southwest of z unless x is not strictly South of y or y is not strictly South of z.

So, given the strict interpretation and the conditions of the problem, the only possible relation between region x and region z is "South".

Actually, let me reconsider the premises more carefully.

"Let South and South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is South of region y and region y is South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

I think the redundancy in "Let South and South be cardinal direction relations" might be a typo, or it might be emphasizing that we're talking about the strict South relation.

Given the strict interpretation, if region x is strictly South of region y and region y is strictly South of region z, then region x is strictly South of region z. There's no way for x to be Southeast or Southwest of z under these conditions.

So, the answer is that the only possible relation between region x and region z is "South".

Actually, I think I need to be even more careful with the definition of "South" in this context.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, the "South" relation typically means that the northernmost point of one region is south of the southernmost point of the other region.

Given this definition:

If x is South of y, then the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y.
If y is South of z, then the northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z.
By transitivity, the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, which means x is South of z.

But this doesn't exclude the possibility that x might also have points that are to the east or west of z. In other words, x could be strictly South of z, or it could be Southeast or Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

Let's try to visualize this with a diagram:

```
    z
    |
    y
    |
    x
```
Here, x is strictly South of z.

```
z
|
y
 \
  x
```
Here, x is Southeast of z, but it's still South of y and y is South of z.

```
    z
    |
    y
   /
  x
```
Here, x is Southwest of z, but it's still South of y and y is South of z.

These diagrams show that if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x could be South, Southeast, or Southwest of z.

Actually, let me double check my reasoning again. To do this, let me create more specific examples with actual spatial regions.

Let the regions be:
z = the area bounded by the square with coordinates (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4).
y = the area bounded by the square with coordinates (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2).
x = the area bounded by the square with coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (0, 0).

In this case, x is strictly South of y and y is strictly South of z. And x is also strictly South of z.

Now, let's modify x to be:
x = the area bounded by the square with coordinates (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (1, 0).

In this case, x is still South of y (because the northernmost point of x is still south of the southernmost point of y). And y is still South of z. But now, x is not strictly South of z; it's Southeast of z.

Similarly, if we were to move x to the left:
x = the area bounded by the square with coordinates (-1, -1), (0, -1), (0, 0), (-1, 0).

In this case, x is still South of y and y is still South of z. But now, x is Southwest of z.

These examples confirm that if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x could be South, Southeast, or Southwest of z, depending on the exact positions and extents of the regions.

Actually, I'm a bit concerned with my reasoning above. Let me be careful with the definition of "South" again. If x is South of y, and there's no overlap in their y-coordinates, this doesn't say anything about their x-coordinates. Indeed, x can overlap with y in the x-direction, or it can be to the east or west of y.

Similarly, if y is South of z, and there's no overlap in their y-coordinates, this doesn't say anything about their x-coordinates.

So, if x is South of y and y is South of z, then by transitivity, the y-coordinates of x are less than the y-coordinates of z. But the x-coordinates of x and z can be related in various ways: x can overlap with z in the x-direction, or x can be to the east or west of z.

Given this, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South (if x overlaps with z in the x-direction)
- Southeast (if x is to the east of z)
- Southwest (if x is to the west of z)

Wait, I realized I actually was confused above. Let me simplify and then state the result correctly.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, if region A is "South" of region B, it means that the northernmost point of A is south of the southernmost point of B. In other words, all points in A have y-coordinates less than all points in B.

Now, given:
- Region x is South of region y, meaning all points in x have y-coordinates less than all points in y.
- Region y is South of region z, meaning all points in y have y-coordinates less than all points in z.

By transitivity, all points in x have y-coordinates less than all points in z, which means x is South of z.

But this doesn't say anything about the x-coordinates of the regions. Depending on the exact positions:
- If all points in x have x-coordinates equal to all points in z (or they overlap in the x-direction), then x is strictly South of z.
- If all points in x have x-coordinates greater than all points in z, then x is Southeast of z.
- If all points in x have x-coordinates less than all points in z, then x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

Let me try one more time with a diagram to make this clear:

```
   z
   |
   y
   |
   x
```
Here, x is strictly South of z.

```
z
 \
  y
   \
    x
```
Here, x is Southeast of z, but it's still South of y and y is South of z.

```
    z
   /
  y
 /
x
```
Here, x is Southwest of z, but it's still South of y and y is South of z.

I think this reasoning is correct, and the answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

Hmm, actually, let me consider the STRICT notion of South again. I've been using South to mean "below", but if we think of South as a strict cardinal direction (meaning no east-west component), then if x is strictly South of y and y is strictly South of z, then x is strictly South of z.

But I realize that the "strict" definition in qualitative spatial reasoning typically refers to the requirement that the regions don't overlap in the direction of interest. For instance, if A is strictly South of B, then all points in A have y-coordinates less than all points in B.

But my point was to check that, if I want A to be DIRECTLY South from B, then A and B should have the same x-coordinate. But this isn't how cardinal direction relations are typically used.

Let me try to be exact by checking what they mean in terms of qualitative spatial reasoning: 

1. Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC): In CDC, the 9 basic relations are N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and EQ/O (equal or overlap). If we say A is South of B, it means all points in A are below all points in B, regardless of their east-west relationship. Etc.

2. Rectangle Algebra (RA): In RA, we have 13 basic relations for each dimension (x and y). For the y-dimension, the relations can be described as A <_y B (A is below B), A =_y B (A and B have the same y-coordinates), etc. If we say A is South of B, it means A <_y B, regardless of their relationship in the x-dimension.

3. Region Connection Calculus with Cardinal Directions (RCC-CD): This combines RCC with cardinal directions. If we say A is South of B, it means all points in A are below all points in B, regardless of their east-west relationship.

Based on these formalisms, if x is South of y and y is South of z, then by transitivity, x is South of z. But the east-west relationship between x and z can vary. Depending on the exact positions:
- If x is directly below z, then x is strictly South of z.
- If x is below and to the right of z, then x is Southeast of z.
- If x is below and to the left of z, then x is Southwest of z.

Let's verify with a specific example:

Suppose we have regions z, y, and x with the following coordinates:
z: (3, 6) to (5, 8)
y: (2, 3) to (4, 5)
x: (1, 0) to (3, 2)

In this case, x is South of y (all points in x are below all points in y), and y is South of z (all points in y are below all points in z). But x is not directly South of z; it's Southwest of z.

If we change the coordinates of x to:
x: (4, 0) to (6, 2)

Now, x is still South of y, and y is still South of z. But x is now Southeast of z.

If we change the coordinates of x again to:
x: (3, 0) to (5, 2)

Now, x is still South of y, and y is still South of z. And x is now directly South of z.

These examples confirm that if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x could be South, Southeast, or Southwest of z, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

So, I think the answer is South, Southeast, or Southwest.

Actually, let me consider one more definition of "South" to make sure I'm being precise. In some formulations of cardinal direction relations, the "South" relation is defined as follows:

Region A is South of region B if the centroid or reference point of A is south of the centroid or reference point of B.

Using this definition:

If the centroid of x is South of the centroid of y, and the centroid of y is South of the centroid of z, then by transitivity, the centroid of x is South of the centroid of z. But the centroid of x could be directly South, Southeast, or Southwest of the centroid of z, depending on the exact positions of the centroids.

So, even with this definition, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

Let me make one more pass through the reasoning to make sure I'm being precise.

The cardinal direction relation "South" typically means that a region is below another region. In terms of coordinates, if region A is South of region B, then all points in A have y-coordinates less than all points in B.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y, meaning all points in x have y-coordinates less than all points in y.
- Region y is South of region z, meaning all points in y have y-coordinates less than all points in z.

By transitivity, all points in x have y-coordinates less than all points in z, which means x is South of z in the y-dimension.

But the definition of "South" doesn't say anything about the x-dimension. Depending on the exact positions of the regions in the x-dimension:
- If the x-coordinates of x overlap with the x-coordinates of z (neither strictly to the east nor strictly to the west), then x is strictly South of z.
- If all points in x have x-coordinates greater than all points in z, then x is Southeast of z.
- If all points in x have x-coordinates less than all points in z, then x is Southwest of z.

Now, the question asks for "possible" relations. Given the above reasoning, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

OK, let's try one more thought experiment.

Imagine region z as a small circle at the center of a Cartesian coordinate system.

Imagine region y as a region below z (i.e., South of z).

Now, imagine region x as a region below y (i.e., South of y).

Given this setup, x is South of y and y is South of z. But depending on the exact position of x in the x-dimension, x could be strictly South of z, or it could be Southeast or Southwest of z.

Again, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

Hmm, actually let me again check the statement of the problem in case there's something in the language I'm missing. 

"Let South and South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is South of region y and region y is South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Given the emphasis on "South and South", I'm wondering if the problem is asking about the composition of the South relation with itself. In qualitative spatial reasoning, the composition of relations is a common topic.

If we denote the "South" relation as S, then the problem might be asking for the result of the composition S ∘ S.

Based on the definition of composition, if xSy and ySz (x is South of y and y is South of z), then the relation between x and z is given by the composition S ∘ S.

Given the reasoning above, if x is South of y and y is South of z, then x could be strictly South of z, or it could be Southeast or Southwest of z.

So, the composition S ∘ S = {S, SE, SW}.

That is, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

Alright, I think I've reasoned through this thoroughly, and the answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

Hmm, the only remaining doubt I have is whether "South and South" might be referring to something specific in the context of this problem. But lacking any further context, I'm going with the interpretation that it's asking about the composition of the South relation with itself.

Given that, the answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest
