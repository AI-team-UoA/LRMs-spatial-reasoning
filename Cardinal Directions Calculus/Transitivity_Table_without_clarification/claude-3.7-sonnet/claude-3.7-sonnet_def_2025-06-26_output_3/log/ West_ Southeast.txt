PROMPT: Let  West and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about this carefully. 

We have:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Southeast of region z

We need to find the possible relation(s) between region x and region z.

Let me use a coordinate system to analyze this. Let's say:
- North corresponds to the positive y-axis
- East corresponds to the positive x-axis
- South corresponds to the negative y-axis
- West corresponds to the negative x-axis

If region x is West of region y, then x is to the left of y on the x-axis. In other words, x has a smaller x-coordinate than y.

If region y is Southeast of region z, then y is below and to the right of z. In other words, y has a larger x-coordinate than z, and a smaller y-coordinate than z.

So we have:
- x_x < y_x (x is to the west of y)
- y_x > z_x (y is to the east of z)
- y_y < z_y (y is to the south of z)

Where x_x represents the x-coordinate of region x, and so on.

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z. We know:
- x_x < y_x (from the first condition)
- y_x > z_x (from the second condition)

These don't directly tell us the relation between x_x and z_x. There are three possibilities:
1. x_x < z_x
2. x_x = z_x
3. x_x > z_x

Similarly, we don't have direct information about the relation between x_y and z_y. There are three possibilities:
1. x_y < z_y
2. x_y = z_y
3. x_y > z_y

Let's check which combinations of these possibilities are consistent with the given constraints.

From x_x < y_x and y_x > z_x, we can't directly infer whether x_x is less than, equal to, or greater than z_x. 

Let's think about this geometrically. If y is Southeast of z, then z is Northwest of y. And if x is West of y, then y is East of x. 

Hmm, let me try another approach. Let's use a specific example to gain intuition.

Suppose we have the following coordinates:
- z: (0, 0)
- y: (1, -1) [y is Southeast of z]
- x: (-1, -1) [x is West of y]

In this case, x is Southwest of z.

Let's try another example:
- z: (0, 0)
- y: (2, -1) [y is Southeast of z]
- x: (0, -1) [x is West of y]

In this case, x is South of z.

Let's try one more:
- z: (0, 0)
- y: (1, -2) [y is Southeast of z]
- x: (-1, -2) [x is West of y]

In this case, x is Southwest of z.

It seems like the relation between x and z could be South, Southwest, or possibly others. Let me try to be more systematic.

If y is Southeast of z, it means y is in the fourth quadrant with respect to z (assuming z is at the origin). And if x is West of y, it means x has a smaller x-coordinate than y, but the y-coordinate can be the same.

Given that y is Southeast of z, we know:
- y_x > z_x
- y_y < z_y

And given that x is West of y, we know:
- x_x < y_x

Combining these, we get:
- x_x < y_x and y_x > z_x, which doesn't directly tell us the relation between x_x and z_x.
- y_y < z_y, but we don't know the relation between x_y and y_y, so we can't say much about the relation between x_y and z_y.

So the possible relations between x and z could include:
- Southwest (if x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y)
- South (if x_x = z_x and x_y < z_y)
- West (if x_x < z_x and x_y = z_y)
- Northwest (if x_x < z_x and x_y > z_y)
- Bounding Box (if none of the above cardinal directions apply)

Actually, wait. I think I've been making this too complicated. The constraint that "x is West of y" only restricts the x-coordinate, not the y-coordinate. Similarly, "y is Southeast of z" places constraints on both the x and y coordinates.

Let's simplify:

If y is Southeast of z, then:
- y_x > z_x
- y_y < z_y

If x is West of y, then:
- x_x < y_x

Combining these:
- x_x < y_x and y_x > z_x

This tells us that there's no direct constraint on the relationship between x_x and z_x. So x could be to the east, west, or at the same longitude as z.

As for the y-coordinate, we know y_y < z_y, but there's no direct constraint on x_y in relation to y_y or z_y. So x could be to the north, south, or at the same latitude as z.

Given these, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
- Bounding Box

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let's be more precise.

Given:
- x is West of y: This means x_x < y_x, but doesn't constrain the y-coordinate.
- y is Southeast of z: This means y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y.

Let's consider the constraints on the x-coordinate of x with respect to z:
- x_x < y_x (from the first condition)
- y_x > z_x (from the second condition)

These don't give us a direct relationship between x_x and z_x. There are three possibilities:
1. x_x < z_x: x is to the west of z.
2. x_x = z_x: x is at the same longitude as z.
3. x_x > z_x: x is to the east of z.

Now, let's consider the constraints on the y-coordinate of x with respect to z:
- No direct constraint from the first condition.
- y_y < z_y (from the second condition)

Since we don't have a direct constraint on x_y from the given conditions, there are three possibilities:
1. x_y < z_y: x is to the south of z.
2. x_y = z_y: x is at the same latitude as z.
3. x_y > z_y: x is to the north of z.

Combining these, we get 3 * 3 = 9 possible relations between x and z:
- North (if x_x = z_x and x_y > z_y)
- Northeast (if x_x > z_x and x_y > z_y)
- East (if x_x > z_x and x_y = z_y)
- Southeast (if x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y)
- South (if x_x = z_x and x_y < z_y)
- Southwest (if x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y)
- West (if x_x < z_x and x_y = z_y)
- Northwest (if x_x < z_x and x_y > z_y)
- Bounding Box (if none of the above cardinal directions apply)

Actually, I realize I should be more careful about the definition of the cardinal directions here. Let me re-examine.

"West" relation means x is directly to the west of y, which means x_x < y_x and x_y = y_y.
"Southeast" relation means y is directly to the southeast of z, which means y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y.

Given:
- x is West of y: This means x_x < y_x and x_y = y_y.
- y is Southeast of z: This means y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y.

So, we have:
- x_x < y_x (from the first condition)
- y_x > z_x (from the second condition)
- x_y = y_y (from the first condition)
- y_y < z_y (from the second condition)

From the third and fourth points, we can deduce:
- x_y < z_y

From the first and second points, we can't directly infer the relation between x_x and z_x. There are three possibilities:
1. x_x < z_x: x is to the west of z.
2. x_x = z_x: x is at the same longitude as z.
3. x_x > z_x: x is to the east of z.

Combining this with the constraint that x_y < z_y, we get the following possible relations between x and z:
- Southeast (if x_x > z_x and x_y < z_y)
- South (if x_x = z_x and x_y < z_y)
- Southwest (if x_x < z_x and x_y < z_y)

Actually wait. I think the definitions I provided for cardinal directions might not be accurate for regions. Let me reconsider.

For region x to be West of region y, it means the entirety of region x is to the west of the entirety of region y. This means the easternmost point of x is to the west of the westernmost point of y. Mathematically, we have max(x_x) < min(y_x) and there's no constraint on the y-coordinates.

Similarly, for region y to be Southeast of region z, it means the entirety of region y is to the southeast of the entirety of region z. This means the northernmost point of y is to the south of the southernmost point of z, and the westernmost point of y is to the east of the easternmost point of z. Mathematically, we have max(y_y) < min(z_y) and min(y_x) > max(z_x).

Wait, I don't think I'm using the right approach. Let's think of the cardinal direction relations in a more qualitative way. 

For region x to be West of region y, it means that if you stand in region y and face west, you'll be facing region x.

For region y to be Southeast of region z, it means that if you stand in region z and face southeast, you'll be facing region y.

Now, if we want to determine the possible relations between region x and region z, we need to consider the combined effect of these two movements.

From z, we move southeast to reach y. Then, from y, we move west to reach x. The combined movement from z to x depends on the relative distances and directions of these individual movements.

Let's visualize this on a compass. From z, we move southeast (which is a combination of south and east). Then, from y, we move west (which is opposite to east). 

The south component of the first movement isn't negated by the second movement, so x is definitely to the south of z. But the east component of the first movement might be partially or completely negated by the west movement in the second step. Depending on the distances, x could be to the east, west, or at the same longitude as z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southeast (if the east component of the first movement is larger than the west component of the second movement)
- South (if the east component of the first movement is equal to the west component of the second movement)
- Southwest (if the east component of the first movement is smaller than the west component of the second movement)

Wait, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's use a simple geometric approach.

If y is Southeast of z, then from the perspective of z, y is in the southeast direction. Similarly, if x is West of y, then from the perspective of y, x is in the west direction.

To determine the direction of x from the perspective of z, we need to consider the relative positions.

Southeast is a combination of South and East. West is directly opposite to East. So, if we move southeast from z to y and then west from y to x, the net movement from z to x has a South component (from the Southeast movement) and either an East, West, or no East-West component, depending on the relative distances.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southeast (if the East component of the Southeast movement is larger than the West movement)
- South (if the East component of the Southeast movement is equal to the West movement)
- Southwest (if the East component of the Southeast movement is smaller than the West movement)

Let me try a visualization. Imagining z at the center, y in the southeast direction, and x to the west of y, I see the following:

```
      N
      |
W ----- E
      |
      S
```

- z is at the center.
- y is in the Southeast direction from z.
- x is to the West of y.

Hmm, actually, I think the clearest approach is to use coordinate geometry. Let's make this concrete.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Then:
- y is Southeast of z, so y is in the fourth quadrant. Let's say y is at (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0.
- x is West of y, so x is to the west of y. Let's say x is at (a - c, -b) where c > 0.

Now, the relation between x and z depends on the relationship between a and c:
- If a > c, then x is at (some positive value, -b), which is Southeast of z.
- If a = c, then x is at (0, -b), which is South of z.
- If a < c, then x is at (some negative value, -b), which is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southeast (if a > c)
- South (if a = c)
- Southwest (if a < c)

This confirms our earlier conclusion.

Actually, given that this is a question about cardinal direction relations, I think the above conclusion is correct. But let me double-check by using the formal definitions of cardinal directions.

In the cardinal direction framework, we define directions as:
- North: (0, 1)
- Northeast: (1, 1)
- East: (1, 0)
- Southeast: (1, -1)
- South: (0, -1)
- Southwest: (-1, -1)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northwest: (-1, 1)

Now, if region y is Southeast of region z, then the vector from z to y is in the direction (1, -1). And if region x is West of region y, then the vector from y to x is in the direction (-1, 0).

The vector from z to x is the sum of the vector from z to y and the vector from y to x. That is:
Vector(z to x) = Vector(z to y) + Vector(y to x) = (1, -1) + (-1, 0) = (0, -1)

This corresponds to the South direction. So, according to this calculation, the relation between x and z is South.

Wait, actually the relation isn't that specific. Let's be more precise.

The vector from z to y is some scalar multiple of (1, -1), let's say k * (1, -1) where k > 0. And the vector from y to x is some scalar multiple of (-1, 0), let's say l * (-1, 0) where l > 0.

The vector from z to x is:
Vector(z to x) = k * (1, -1) + l * (-1, 0) = (k - l, -k)

The direction of this vector depends on the relationship between k and l:
- If k > l, then the vector is (some positive value, -k), which is in the Southeast direction.
- If k = l, then the vector is (0, -k), which is in the South direction.
- If k < l, then the vector is (some negative value, -k), which is in the Southwest direction.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest

Actually, I think I'm making this too complicated and making math errors, which makes me second-guess myself. Let me simplify.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0).
If y is Southeast of z, then y is in the fourth quadrant, so its coordinates are (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0.
If x is West of y, then x is at (a - c, -b) where c > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we compare the coordinates of x with those of z:
- If a - c > 0, then x is to the East of z. Since x is also to the South of z, the relation is Southeast.
- If a - c = 0, then x is neither to the East nor West of z. Since x is to the South of z, the relation is South.
- If a - c < 0, then x is to the West of z. Since x is also to the South of z, the relation is Southwest.

Since c > 0 and there's no constraint on the relationship between a and c, all three scenarios are possible. So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest

This confirms our earlier conclusion.

Actually, to double-check, let me concretely try coordinates.

First Scenario (Southeast):
- z: (0, 0)
- y: (3, -2) [y is Southeast of z]
- x: (1, -2) [x is West of y]

In this case, x is Southeast of z.

Second Scenario (South):
- z: (0, 0)
- y: (2, -2) [y is Southeast of z]
- x: (0, -2) [x is West of y]

In this case, x is South of z.

Third Scenario (Southwest):
- z: (0, 0)
- y: (1, -2) [y is Southeast of z]
- x: (-1, -2) [x is West of y]

In this case, x is Southwest of z.

I believe the answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: Southeast, South, Southwest.

Actually, I want to do one more check of my reasoning. I'll use a matrix-based approach to represent the composition of cardinal direction relations.

Let's define the cardinal directions as:
- N: North
- NE: Northeast
- E: East
- SE: Southeast
- S: South
- SW: Southwest
- W: West
- NW: Northwest

The composition of two cardinal directions can be represented as a matrix. Let's consider the composition of "West" and "Southeast".

If y is Southeast of z, then the direction from z to y is Southeast. And if x is West of y, then the direction from y to x is West.

The composition of these two directions gives the possible directions from z to x. Let's check a composition table for "Southeast" and "West":

SE ∘ W = ?

Based on the geometric reasoning we've been doing, the answer should be:
SE ∘ W = {SE, S, SW}

Let me see if this is consistent with a standard composition table for cardinal directions.

Actually, I don't have access to a standard composition table at the moment, but we can derive it from the coordinate-based reasoning we've been using.

Let's define the directions in terms of coordinates:
- N: (0, 1)
- NE: (1, 1)
- E: (1, 0)
- SE: (1, -1)
- S: (0, -1)
- SW: (-1, -1)
- W: (-1, 0)
- NW: (-1, 1)

Now, to find SE ∘ W, we add the vectors (1, -1) and (-1, 0) to get (0, -1), which corresponds to S. However, this is assuming that the distances are the same, which might not be the case. The general case is (k - l, -k), where k and l are positive scalars, and the direction depends on the relationship between k and l, as we worked out earlier.

So, the composition SE ∘ W gives the possible directions {SE, S, SW} from z to x, depending on the relative distances.

This confirms our answer: The possible relations between x and z are Southeast, South, and Southwest.

In conclusion, if region x is West of region y and region y is Southeast of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Actually, I think I should double-check this once more. Let me re-visualize with directions.

Let's say:
- z is at position (0, 0).
- y is Southeast of z, so y is at position (a, -b) for some positive a and b.
- x is West of y, so x is at position (a-c, -b) for some positive c.

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

I'll consider a few cases:
1. If a > c, then x is at (a-c, -b) where a-c > 0. This means x is to the East and South of z, making the relation Southeast.
2. If a = c, then x is at (0, -b). This means x is directly South of z.
3. If a < c, then x is at (a-c, -b) where a-c < 0. This means x is to the West and South of z, making the relation Southwest.

Since all of these cases are possible (depending on the values of a and c), the possible relations between x and z are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

So, the answer is Southeast, South, Southwest.

Actually, to be fully confident, let's make sure I haven't made any other errors.

Let's start with cardinal direction relations. I'll use the standard convention:
- N: North
- NE: Northeast
- E: East
- SE: Southeast
- S: South
- SW: Southwest
- W: West
- NW: Northwest

If region y is Southeast of region z, then y is in the Southeast direction from z. This means y is both East and South of z.

If region x is West of region y, then x is in the West direction from y. This means x is directly West of y.

To determine the relation between x and z, I need to combine these two relations.

Since y is East of z and x is West of y, the East-West component can vary. Depending on the relative distances, x can be East of z, West of z, or directly in line with z (i.e., neither East nor West).

Since y is South of z and x is at the same latitude as y, x is also South of z.

Combining these:
- If x is East of z and South of z, the relation is Southeast.
- If x is neither East nor West of z and is South of z, the relation is South.
- If x is West of z and South of z, the relation is Southwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Actually, one last thing to check.

Let's check that Southeast and West are actually basic cardinal directions. 

There are eight basic cardinal directions:
North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW).

So Southeast and West are basic cardinal directions. 

We are asked to find the possible relations between regions x and z, knowing that x is West of y and y is Southeast of z.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. If y is Southeast of z, then y is in the Southeast direction from z. This means y is both East and South of z.
2. If x is West of y, then x is in the West direction from y. This means x is directly West of y (same latitude, just a different longitude).
3. The East-West component of the relation between x and z depends on the relative distances of y from z and x from y.
4. But we know for sure that x is South of z, since y is South of z and x is at the same latitude as y.
5. So, the possible relations between x and z are:
   - Southeast (if x is East of z and South of z)
   - South (if x is neither East nor West of z and is South of z)
   - Southwest (if x is West of z and South of z)

So my final answer is: Southeast, South, Southwest.

Let me double-check my solution by thinking about the geometry. 

Southeast means the angle is 135 degrees from the positive y-axis, moving clockwise.
West means the angle is 270 degrees from the positive y-axis, moving clockwise.

Southeast corresponds to the vector (1, -1) and West corresponds to the vector (-1, 0).

Let's say the vector from z to y is SE. Then, the vector from y to x is W. The net vector from z to x is the vector sum, SE + W = (1, -1) + (-1, 0) = (0, -1), which is S.

But, of course, the vectors may not have the same magnitude. Let's say:
- Vector from z to y is a*SE = (a, -a) for a > 0
- Vector from y to x is b*W = (-b, 0) for b > 0

Then, the net vector from z to x is (a-b, -a).

Let's analyze the direction of this vector:
- If a > b, then the vector is (a-b, -a) where a-b > 0. This means the direction is between East and South, which is Southeast.
- If a = b, then the vector is (0, -a). This is the South direction.
- If a < b, then the vector is (a-b, -a) where a-b < 0. This means the direction is between West and South, which is Southwest.

So, the possible directions from z to x are Southeast, South, and Southwest. Thus the possible relations between region x and region z are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

So the answer is: Southeast, South, Southwest.

On second thought, I think I've overthinking this. Let's go back to the basics of cardinal directions.

Cardinal directions between regions depend on the relative positions of the regions.

Let's place z at the origin for reference. 

If y is Southeast of z, then y is in the Southeast quadrant relative to z. 

If x is West of y, then x is directly to the West of y. This means x has the same y-coordinate as y, but its x-coordinate is less.

Let's denote the coordinates as:
- z: (0, 0)
- y: (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0
- x: (a-c, -b) where c > 0

The relation between x and z depends on the relation between a and c:
- If a > c, then x is at (a-c, -b) where a-c > 0. This puts x in the Southeast quadrant relative to z.
- If a = c, then x is at (0, -b). This puts x directly South of z.
- If a < c, then x is at (a-c, -b) where a-c < 0. This puts x in the Southwest quadrant relative to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Alternatively, we can think of it in terms of vectors.
The vector from z to y is in the Southeast direction, say (a, -b) for a, b > 0.
The vector from y to x is in the West direction, say (-c, 0) for c > 0.
The net vector from z to x is (a-c, -b).

Analyzing the direction of this vector:
- If a > c, the vector is in the Southeast direction.
- If a = c, the vector is in the South direction.
- If a < c, the vector is in the Southwest direction.

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

In conclusion, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Actually, I realized that I should concretely think in terms of the given question and the given cardinal direction relations. Let me do one more check.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Southeast of region z

We need to find the possible relation(s) between region x and region z.

"West" means a negative x-coordinate relative to the reference.
"Southeast" means a positive x-coordinate and a negative y-coordinate relative to the reference.

So:
- If y is Southeast of z, then y has a positive x-coordinate and a negative y-coordinate relative to z.
- If x is West of y, then x has a negative x-coordinate relative to y (and is at the same y-coordinate).

Now, let's compute the coordinates of x relative to z.
If y's coordinates relative to z are (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0, and x's coordinates relative to y are (-c, 0) where c > 0, then x's coordinates relative to z are (a-c, -b).

The relation between x and z is determined by the signs of a-c and -b:
- -b is always negative, which means x is always South of z.
- a-c can be positive, zero, or negative, depending on the relationship between a and c.

This leads to the following possible relations:
- If a > c, then a-c > 0, and the relation is Southeast.
- If a = c, then a-c = 0, and the relation is South.
- If a < c, then a-c < 0, and the relation is Southwest.

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

I believe my answer is correct.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
