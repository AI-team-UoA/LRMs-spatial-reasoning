PROMPT: Let  East and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

We need to find all possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use a coordinate system where:
- North means increasing y-coordinate
- East means increasing x-coordinate
- South means decreasing y-coordinate
- West means decreasing x-coordinate

So:
- Northeast means increasing both x and y coordinates
- Southeast means increasing x, decreasing y
- Southwest means decreasing x, decreasing y
- Northwest means decreasing x, increasing y

Now, if region x is East of region y, then x has a higher x-coordinate than y, but they have the same y-coordinate.

If region y is Southwest of region z, then y has a lower x-coordinate than z, and y has a lower y-coordinate than z.

Let's call the coordinates:
- x: (x₁, x₂)
- y: (y₁, y₂)
- z: (z₁, z₂)

From the given relations:
- x is East of y means: x₁ > y₁ and x₂ = y₂
- y is Southwest of z means: y₁ < z₁ and y₂ < z₂

Now, to compare x and z:
- For the x-coordinate: x₁ > y₁ and y₁ < z₁. This doesn't tell us directly how x₁ compares with z₁. It could be x₁ < z₁, x₁ = z₁, or x₁ > z₁.
- For the y-coordinate: x₂ = y₂ and y₂ < z₂. This means x₂ < z₂.

So, region x has a y-coordinate that is less than the y-coordinate of region z. This means x is South of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

For the x-coordinate, there are three possibilities:
1. x₁ < z₁: Then x is Southwest of z.
2. x₁ = z₁: Then x is directly South of z.
3. x₁ > z₁: Then x is Southeast of z.

Actually, let's draw this out more concretely with a picture. Let's say z is at the origin, so z = (0, 0). 

Since y is Southwest of z, y has coordinates y = (-a, -b) for some positive values a and b.

Now, since x is East of y, x has the same y-coordinate but a higher x-coordinate. So x = (-a + c, -b) for some positive value c.

Now, let's compare x and z:
- The x-coordinate of x is -a + c, and the x-coordinate of z is 0. Depending on the values of a and c, -a + c could be less than, equal to, or greater than 0.
- The y-coordinate of x is -b, which is less than the y-coordinate of z, which is 0.

So, depending on the relationship between -a + c and 0, x could be Southwest of z, directly South of z, or Southeast of z.

Wait, I think there's a misconception in my work above. When I say region x is East of region y, I don't mean that they have the exact same y-coordinate. Rather, it means that the centroid of region x is generally to the East of the centroid of region y. Hm, I'm realizing that cardinal directions can be defined in different ways for regions, and it's not specified in the problem.

Let me re-approach this. I'll use the following understanding of cardinal directions between regions:
- Region A is North of Region B if every point in A has a higher y-coordinate than every point in B.
- Region A is East of Region B if every point in A has a higher x-coordinate than every point in B.
- Similar definitions for South and West.
- The other directions (Northeast, Southeast, etc.) are combinations of these.

With this understanding:
- If region x is East of region y, then every point in x has a higher x-coordinate than every point in y. But there's no constraint on the y-coordinates.
- If region y is Southwest of region z, then every point in y has a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than every point in z.

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z:
- For the x-coordinate: All points in x have a higher x-coordinate than all points in y, and all points in y have a lower x-coordinate than all points in z. By transitivity, all points in x should have a higher x-coordinate than all points in z. Wait, that doesn't seem right...

Actually, I think I misunderstood the nature of cardinal direction relations. Let's reconsider. For example, maybe East doesn't mean the entire region is to the east of the other region. Let's consider a different interpretation.

Actually, I just made an error in my logic above. Let me try again with the same definitions.

If region x is East of region y, then every point in x is to the east of every point in y.
If region y is Southwest of region z, then every point in y is to the southwest of every point in z.

So, we can say:
- For every point px in x and every point py in y: px is East of py.
- For every point py in y and every point pz in z: py is Southwest of pz.

Now, for every point px in x and every point pz in z:
- px is East of some point py in y.
- py is Southwest of pz.

This means px has a higher x-coordinate than py, and py has a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than pz.

So, for the x-coordinate: px_x > py_x and py_x < pz_x. This doesn't directly tell us the relation between px_x and pz_x. It could be px_x < pz_x, px_x = pz_x, or px_x > pz_x.

For the y-coordinate: There's no direct constraint between px_y and py_y based on the East relation, but py_y < pz_y because py is Southwest of pz.

Hmm, this is still not giving me a clear relation between x and z.

Actually, let's consider a concrete example to understand this better.

Let's place region z at coordinates (3, 3). 
Since region y is Southwest of z, it could be at coordinates (1, 1).
Since region x is East of y, it could be at coordinates (4, 1).

Comparing x and z:
- x has an x-coordinate of 4, which is greater than the x-coordinate of z (3). So x is East of z in terms of the x-coordinate.
- x has a y-coordinate of 1, which is less than the y-coordinate of z (3). So x is South of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Combining these, x is Southeast of z in this example.

But, I realize that different coordinates could lead to different relations. Let me try another example.

Let's place region z at coordinates (3, 3).
Since region y is Southwest of z, it could be at coordinates (1, 1).
Since region x is East of y, it could also be at coordinates (3, 1).

Comparing x and z:
- x has an x-coordinate of 3, which is the same as the x-coordinate of z (3). So x is neither East nor West of z in terms of the x-coordinate.
- x has a y-coordinate of 1, which is less than the y-coordinate of z (3). So x is South of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Combining these, x is directly South of z in this example.

Let's try one more example.

Let's place region z at coordinates (3, 3).
Since region y is Southwest of z, it could be at coordinates (1, 1).
Since region x is East of y, it could also be at coordinates (2, 1).

Comparing x and z:
- x has an x-coordinate of 2, which is less than the x-coordinate of z (3). So x is West of z in terms of the x-coordinate.
- x has a y-coordinate of 1, which is less than the y-coordinate of z (3). So x is South of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Combining these, x is Southwest of z in this example.

So, based on these examples, it seems that region x could be Southwest, South, or Southeast of region z.

But wait, my thinking above assumes that regions are just points. But the question uses the term "region", so these are likely areas with some spatial extent.

Actually, I think we can still reason about cardinal directions between regions using the centroids (or representative points) of the regions. So, using the same logic as above, the possible relations between region x and region z would be Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Actually, let's review the definition of the cardinal direction relations more carefully. In the context of spatial reasoning with regions, the cardinal direction relations typically mean:

- A is North of B if all points in A are above all points in B.
- A is East of B if all points in A are to the right of all points in B.
- A is South of B if all points in A are below all points in B.
- A is West of B if all points in A are to the left of all points in B.
- A is Northeast of B if all points in A are both above and to the right of all points in B.
- And so on.

When we have:
- x is East of y
- y is Southwest of z

We know that all points in x are to the right of all points in y, and all points in y are both to the left and below all points in z.

For the x-coordinate: All points in x are to the right of all points in y, and all points in y are to the left of all points in z. This doesn't tell us directly whether all points in x are to the left or to the right of all points in z. It could go either way.

For the y-coordinate: All points in y are below all points in z. But we don't know the y-relation between x and y. 

So, from the given relations, we can't directly determine the cardinal relation between x and z without more information.

Actually, let me revisit the definitions again. I feel like I might be missing something.

In qualitative spatial reasoning with cardinal directions, the relation "A is East of B" typically means that the centroid (or representative point) of A is to the east of the centroid of B, or alternatively, that all points in A are to the east of all points in B. For simplicity and clarity, let me stick with the latter definition.

Given:
- region x is East of region y: All points in x have a higher x-coordinate than all points in y.
- region y is Southwest of region z: All points in y have a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than all points in z.

Transitivity for the x-coordinate:
- All points in x have a higher x-coordinate than all points in y.
- All points in y have a lower x-coordinate than all points in z.
These don't provide a direct relation between the x-coordinates of points in x and points in z.

For the y-coordinate:
- All points in y have a lower y-coordinate than all points in z.
But we don't have a direct relation between the y-coordinates of points in x and points in y or z.

So, from the given relations, we can't directly determine the cardinal relation between x and z using this approach.

Hmm, let's try a slightly different approach. Instead of considering all possible regions, let me consider specific cases to see what relations are possible.

Let's place region z around coordinates (5, 5).
Since region y is Southwest of z, it could be around coordinates (3, 3).
Since region x is East of y, it could be around coordinates (6, 3).

In this case, comparing x and z, x is Southeast of z.

Let's try another example:
Region z is around (5, 5).
Region y is around (3, 3).
Region x is around (4, 3).

In this case, x is South of z.

Let's try one more:
Region z is around (5, 5).
Region y is around (3, 3).
Region x is around (1, 3).

Hmm, in this case, it doesn't satisfy the condition that x is East of y. So this is not a valid example.

Let's try a different one:
Region z is around (5, 5).
Region y is around (3, 3).
Region x is around (7, 3).

In this case, x is Southeast of z.

Another attempt:
Region z is around (5, 5).
Region y is around (3, 3).
Region x is around (3, 4).

Hmm, in this case, it doesn't satisfy the condition that x is East of y. So this is not a valid example.

I think I may have been overthinking this. Let me go back to basics. 

- "East" means the x-coordinate increases.
- "West" means the x-coordinate decreases.
- "North" means the y-coordinate increases.
- "South" means the y-coordinate decreases.

So:
- "x is East of y" means the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y, and the y-coordinates are the same.
- "y is Southwest of z" means both the x and y coordinates of y are less than the x and y coordinates of z, respectively.

Given:
- x is East of y: (x₁, x₂) = (y₁ + a, y₂) for some positive a.
- y is Southwest of z: (y₁, y₂) = (z₁ - b, z₂ - c) for some positive b and c.

Substituting:
(x₁, x₂) = ((z₁ - b) + a, z₂ - c) = (z₁ - b + a, z₂ - c)

Now, comparing x and z:
- For the x-coordinate: x₁ = z₁ - b + a. Depending on the values of a and b, x₁ could be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁.
- For the y-coordinate: x₂ = z₂ - c, which is less than z₂.

So, the possible relations are:
1. If a < b, then x₁ < z₁, and x is Southwest of z.
2. If a = b, then x₁ = z₁, and x is South of z.
3. If a > b, then x₁ > z₁, and x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Actually, let me double-check this by plugging in concrete values.

Let's place z at (5, 5).
If y is Southwest of z, it could be at (3, 3).
If x is East of y, it could be at (5, 3).

Comparing x and z:
- x has the same x-coordinate as z (5), but a lower y-coordinate (3 compared to 5). So, x is South of z.

Another example:
z at (5, 5).
y is Southwest of z, so y is at (3, 3).
x is East of y, so x is at (6, 3).

Comparing x and z:
- x has a higher x-coordinate than z (6 compared to 5), but a lower y-coordinate (3 compared to 5). So, x is Southeast of z.

One more example:
z at (5, 5).
y is Southwest of z, so y is at (2, 3).
x is East of y, so x is at (4, 3).

Comparing x and z:
- x has a lower x-coordinate than z (4 compared to 5), but a lower y-coordinate (3 compared to 5). So, x is Southwest of z.

These examples confirm that the possible relations are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

However, I've been treating the relations as if they're between points, which may not be the most accurate representation for regions. Let's reconsider using a more rigorous approach for regions.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal directions between regions can be defined using various formalisms. One common formalism is the Minimal Bounding Rectangle (MBR) approach, where regions are abstracted as rectangles.

But since the problem is asking about the general relation, I'll stick with the centroid-based approach, where the cardinal direction relation between two regions is determined by the cardinal direction between their centroids.

Using this approach, if the centroid of region x is East of the centroid of region y, then x is East of y. Similarly, if the centroid of region y is Southwest of the centroid of region z, then y is Southwest of z.

From these, we want to determine the possible cardinal directions between the centroid of region x and the centroid of region z.

Let's denote the centroids as:
- cx for region x: (cx₁, cx₂)
- cy for region y: (cy₁, cy₂)
- cz for region z: (cz₁, cz₂)

Given:
- x is East of y: cx₁ > cy₁, no constraint on cx₂ vs cy₂.
- y is Southwest of z: cy₁ < cz₁ and cy₂ < cz₂.

Transitivity for the x-coordinate:
- cx₁ > cy₁ and cy₁ < cz₁. This doesn't directly give us a relation between cx₁ and cz₁.

For the y-coordinate:
- cy₂ < cz₂. But we don't have a direct relation between cx₂ and cy₂ or cz₂.

So, from the centroid approach, we also can't directly determine the relation between x and z without more information.

Actually, I think I may have misinterpreted the East and Southwest relations. Let me redefine them:

- A is East of B if the centroid of A is directly to the right of the centroid of B (i.e., same y-coordinate but greater x-coordinate).
- A is Southwest of B if the centroid of A is to the left and below the centroid of B.

Given:
- x is East of y: cx₁ > cy₁ and cx₂ = cy₂.
- y is Southwest of z: cy₁ < cz₁ and cy₂ < cz₂.

From these, we can derive:
- cx₁ > cy₁ (from x is East of y)
- cy₁ < cz₁ (from y is Southwest of z)
- cx₂ = cy₂ (from x is East of y)
- cy₂ < cz₂ (from y is Southwest of z)

Combining:
- cx₂ = cy₂ < cz₂, so cx₂ < cz₂.

This means the centroid of x is below the centroid of z, which corresponds to the South direction.

For the x-coordinate:
- cx₁ > cy₁ and cy₁ < cz₁. This doesn't directly tell us how cx₁ compares with cz₁.

So, depending on how cx₁ compares with cz₁:
- If cx₁ < cz₁, then x is Southwest of z.
- If cx₁ = cz₁, then x is directly South of z.
- If cx₁ > cz₁, then x is Southeast of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Actually, I think my approach is correct. With the standard definition of cardinal directions:
- East means the centroid is directly to the right (same y-coordinate but greater x-coordinate)
- Southwest means the centroid is to the left and below

And from the given:
- x is East of y: cx₁ > cy₁ and cx₂ = cy₂
- y is Southwest of z: cy₁ < cz₁ and cy₂ < cz₂

I deduced that cx₂ = cy₂ < cz₂, so cx₂ < cz₂, which means the centroid of x is below the centroid of z. This corresponds to the South direction.

And for the x-coordinate, depending on how cx₁ compares with cz₁, the relation can be Southwest, South, or Southeast.

So, to reiterate, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Actually, let me just make sure I'm understanding the cardinal direction relations correctly. Let me define the standard eight cardinal directions:

1. North: (0, +1) - Directly above
2. Northeast: (+1, +1) - Above and to the right
3. East: (+1, 0) - Directly to the right
4. Southeast: (+1, -1) - Below and to the right
5. South: (0, -1) - Directly below
6. Southwest: (-1, -1) - Below and to the left
7. West: (-1, 0) - Directly to the left
8. Northwest: (-1, +1) - Above and to the left

Given:
- x is East of y: This means the centroid of x is directly to the right of the centroid of y. So cx₁ > cy₁ and cx₂ = cy₂.
- y is Southwest of z: This means the centroid of y is below and to the left of the centroid of z. So cy₁ < cz₁ and cy₂ < cz₂.

Using these, we can deduce:
- cx₂ = cy₂ (from x is East of y)
- cy₂ < cz₂ (from y is Southwest of z)
- Combining these, we get cx₂ < cz₂

This means the centroid of x is below the centroid of z in terms of y-coordinate. 

For the x-coordinate:
- cx₁ > cy₁ (from x is East of y)
- cy₁ < cz₁ (from y is Southwest of z)
- From these, we can't directly infer the relation between cx₁ and cz₁. Depending on the specific values, cx₁ could be less than, equal to, or greater than cz₁.

So, based on these deductions, the possible relations between x and z are:
- If cx₁ < cz₁, then x is Southwest of z.
- If cx₁ = cz₁, then x is directly South of z.
- If cx₁ > cz₁, then x is Southeast of z.

Hence, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Actually, let me illustrate this with some numerical examples to make sure.

Example 1:
- z at (5, 5)
- y at (3, 3) (which is Southwest of z)
- x at (6, 3) (which is East of y)

Comparing x and z:
- x is at (6, 3) and z is at (5, 5)
- 6 > 5, so x is East of z in terms of x-coordinate
- 3 < 5, so x is South of z in terms of y-coordinate
- Combining these, x is Southeast of z

Example 2:
- z at (5, 5)
- y at (3, 3) (which is Southwest of z)
- x at (5, 3) (which is East of y)

Comparing x and z:
- x is at (5, 3) and z is at (5, 5)
- 5 = 5, so x is neither East nor West of z in terms of x-coordinate
- 3 < 5, so x is South of z in terms of y-coordinate
- Combining these, x is South of z

Example 3:
- z at (5, 5)
- y at (3, 3) (which is Southwest of z)
- x at (4, 3) (which is East of y)

Comparing x and z:
- x is at (4, 3) and z is at (5, 5)
- 4 < 5, so x is West of z in terms of x-coordinate
- 3 < 5, so x is South of z in terms of y-coordinate
- Combining these, x is Southwest of z

These examples confirm that the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Therefore, the answer is: Southwest, South, Southeast.

Actully, let me go one level deeper and ensure I'm understanding the problem correctly. The problem is asking about cardinal direction relations between regions. There are a few formalisms to reason about cardinal directions between regions, like the cone-based, projection-based, or MBR (Minimal Bounding Rectangle) approach. 

However, for simplicity, I'm considering cardinal directions between centroids of regions, which is a common approach. The centroid of a region is a point that represents the "center" of the region.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: The centroid of x is directly to the right of the centroid of y. So, the x-coordinate of the centroid of x is greater than the x-coordinate of the centroid of y, and their y-coordinates are the same.
- Region y is Southwest of region z: The centroid of y is below and to the left of the centroid of z. So, both the x and y coordinates of the centroid of y are less than the corresponding coordinates of the centroid of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- The y-coordinate of the centroid of x is the same as the y-coordinate of the centroid of y.
- The y-coordinate of the centroid of y is less than the y-coordinate of the centroid of z.
- So, the y-coordinate of the centroid of x is less than the y-coordinate of the centroid of z. This means x is South of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- The x-coordinate of the centroid of x is greater than the x-coordinate of the centroid of y.
- The x-coordinate of the centroid of y is less than the x-coordinate of the centroid of z.
- From these, we can't directly determine the relationship between the x-coordinate of the centroid of x and the x-coordinate of the centroid of z. Depending on the specific values, the x-coordinate of the centroid of x could be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinate of the centroid of z.

Based on the above, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest: If the x-coordinate of the centroid of x is less than the x-coordinate of the centroid of z.
- South: If the x-coordinate of the centroid of x is equal to the x-coordinate of the centroid of z.
- Southeast: If the x-coordinate of the centroid of x is greater than the x-coordinate of the centroid of z.

So, the possible relations are Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Let me just do a quick sanity check, since I've been going back and forth a lot. 

Let's use the notation:
- (x₁, x₂) for the centroid of region x
- (y₁, y₂) for the centroid of region y
- (z₁, z₂) for the centroid of region z

Given:
- x is East of y: x₁ > y₁ and x₂ = y₂
- y is Southwest of z: y₁ < z₁ and y₂ < z₂

Deductions:
- From x₂ = y₂ and y₂ < z₂, we get x₂ < z₂. So, x is South of z in terms of the y-coordinate.
- For the x-coordinate, we have x₁ > y₁ and y₁ < z₁. The relationship between x₁ and z₁ depends on the specific values.

Possible relations:
1. If x₁ < z₁, then x is Southwest of z.
2. If x₁ = z₁, then x is South of z.
3. If x₁ > z₁, then x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually, before I finalize my answer, let me define the relations using the projection-based model, which is commonly used in qualitative spatial reasoning.

In the projection-based model, the relation between two regions is determined by projecting them onto the x and y axes and comparing these projections.

Given:
- x is East of y: The x-projection of x is entirely to the right of the x-projection of y, and the y-projections overlap.
- y is Southwest of z: The x-projection of y is entirely to the left of the x-projection of z, and the y-projection of y is entirely below the y-projection of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- The x-projection of x is entirely to the right of the x-projection of y. The x-projection of y is entirely to the left of the x-projection of z. From transitivity, we can't determine the exact relation between the x-projections of x and z without more information.

- The y-projection of x overlaps with the y-projection of y. The y-projection of y is entirely below the y-projection of z. From these, we can infer that the y-projection of x is not entirely above the y-projection of z. But we can't determine with certainty if the y-projections overlap or if the y-projection of x is entirely below the y-projection of z.

Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z include South, Southeast, Southwest, and potentially even East, West, or the Bounding Box relation.

Actually, I think this is getting a bit convoluted and I'm introducing complications that might not be intended by the problem. Let's go back to the centroid-based approach, which is simpler and aligns with the standard understanding of cardinal directions.

Using the centroid-based approach, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually let's do this with a simpler approach. Let's consider the problem in terms of direction vectors.

- East corresponds to the vector (1, 0).
- Southwest corresponds to the vector (-1, -1).

When we move from region y to region x, we go East, which is a movement in the direction (1, 0).
When we move from region z to region y, we go Southwest, which is a movement in the direction (-1, -1).

To get from region z to region x, we first move from z to y, and then from y to x. So, the overall movement is the vector sum of Southwest and East, which is (-1, -1) + (1, 0) = (0, -1). This corresponds to the direction South.

Wait, I'm doing it the wrong way. Let's redo it.

When we move from region y to region x, we go East, which is a movement in the direction (1, 0).
When we move from region z to region y, we go Southwest, which is a movement in the direction (-1, -1).

But the question asks about the relation from x to z, not from z to x. If y is Southwest of z, then z is Northeast of y. So, when we move from region y to region z, we go Northeast, which is a movement in the direction (1, 1).

Now, to get from region x to region z, we first move from x to y (which is West, or the direction (-1, 0)), and then from y to z (which is Northeast, or the direction (1, 1)). So, the overall movement is the vector sum of West and Northeast, which is (-1, 0) + (1, 1) = (0, 1). This corresponds to the direction North.

Hmm, that can't be right. Let me re-understand the problem.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z.

What is the cardinal relation between region x and region z?

Let's denote the positions of the regions as x, y, and z. We have:
- x = y + (a, 0) for some a > 0 (because x is East of y)
- y = z + (-b, -c) for some b, c > 0 (because y is Southwest of z)

Combining these:
x = z + (-b, -c) + (a, 0) = z + (a - b, -c)

Now, depending on the values of a and b:
- If a < b, then x is to the west (and south) of z, which would make x Southwest of z.
- If a = b, then x is directly south of z, which would make x South of z.
- If a > b, then x is to the east (and south) of z, which would make x Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Ok, I think the overall reasoning is solid, so I'll settle on Southwest, South, or Southeast as the possible relations between x and z.

I should double-check by considering a general case: 

Let z be at position (z₁, z₂).
Since y is Southwest of z, y is at (z₁ - b, z₂ - c) for some b, c > 0.
Since x is East of y, x is at (z₁ - b + a, z₂ - c) for some a > 0.

Comparing the positions of x and z:
- The x-coordinate of x is z₁ - b + a, and the x-coordinate of z is z₁. The difference is a - b, which can be positive, zero, or negative.
- The y-coordinate of x is z₂ - c, and the y-coordinate of z is z₂. The difference is -c, which is negative.

So, the y-coordinate of x is always less than the y-coordinate of z, which corresponds to the South direction. For the x-coordinate, the relation can be East, neutral, or West, depending on the values of a and b.

Combining these:
- If a < b, then x is Southwest of z.
- If a = b, then x is South of z.
