PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

In this problem, we have:
- Region x is Southwest of region y
- Region y is East of region z

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let's analyze this step by step using coordinate reasoning.

If region x is Southwest of region y, then x is both South and West of y. This means:
- x has a lower latitude than y (South direction)
- x has a lower longitude than y (West direction)

If region y is East of region z, then:
- y has a higher longitude than z (East direction)
- y's latitude could be the same as z (purely East)

Now, to determine the relation between x and z:

For longitude:
- x has lower longitude than y (x is West of y)
- y has higher longitude than z (y is East of z)
- Therefore, we can't determine for sure whether x is East, West, or at the same longitude as z.

For latitude:
- x has lower latitude than y (x is South of y)
- y and z could have the same latitude (if y is purely East of z)
- This means x must be South of z or potentially Southwest, Southeast, or South.

Wait, let me rethink this. I made an error in my reasoning.

If region y is East of region z, then:
- y has a higher longitude than z
- y and z have approximately the same latitude (since the relation is purely East)

If region x is Southwest of region y, then:
- x has a lower longitude than y
- x has a lower latitude than y

Now to determine the relation between x and z:

For longitude:
- x has lower longitude than y
- y has higher longitude than z
- From these two facts, we can't directly determine the longitude relationship between x and z. x could be East, West, or at the same longitude as z.

For latitude:
- x has lower latitude than y
- y has approximately the same latitude as z
- Therefore, x must have a lower latitude than z, which means x is South of z in terms of latitude.

So, combining these:
1. If x has a higher longitude than z, x would be Southeast of z
2. If x has a lower longitude than z, x would be Southwest of z
3. If x has the same longitude as z, x would be directly South of z

Actually, I think I'm still making an error in my reasoning about the possible longitude relationship between x and z.

Let me draw this out more carefully:

If y is East of z:
- y's longitude > z's longitude
- y's latitude ≈ z's latitude

If x is Southwest of y:
- x's longitude < y's longitude
- x's latitude < y's latitude

Now for the relationship between x and z:

For longitude:
- x's longitude < y's longitude (from x is Southwest of y)
- y's longitude > z's longitude (from y is East of z)

This gives us:
x's longitude < y's longitude > z's longitude

From this, we can't directly determine whether x's longitude is greater than, less than, or equal to z's longitude. All three possibilities exist:
1. x's longitude < z's longitude
2. x's longitude = z's longitude
3. x's longitude > z's longitude

For latitude:
- x's latitude < y's latitude (from x is Southwest of y)
- y's latitude ≈ z's latitude (from y is East of z)

This gives us:
x's latitude < y's latitude ≈ z's latitude

Which means:
x's latitude < z's latitude

So, x is South of z in terms of latitude.

Combining the longitude and latitude possibilities:
1. If x's longitude < z's longitude, then x is Southwest of z
2. If x's longitude = z's longitude, then x is South of z
3. If x's longitude > z's longitude, then x is Southeast of z

Actually, I realize I'm making an error in my reasoning. Let's be more precise about the cardinal direction relations.

When we say "y is East of z", we mean that y is entirely to the east of z. Similarly, when we say "x is Southwest of y", we mean that x is entirely to the southwest of y.

Let's use bounding boxes to represent the regions and their relations:

If y is East of z:
- The westernmost point of y is east of the easternmost point of z
- The bounding boxes of y and z might overlap in the north-south direction

If x is Southwest of y:
- The easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y
- The northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of y

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:

For longitude:
- The easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y (from x is Southwest of y)
- The westernmost point of y is east of the easternmost point of z (from y is East of z)

This gives us:
easternmost point of x < westernmost point of y < easternmost point of z

From this, we can conclude that the easternmost point of x is west of the easternmost point of z. But we can't determine the exact relationship between the westernmost point of x and the westernmost point of z. 

Let me take a step back and think more carefully.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The cardinal direction relations are typically defined based on the centroids of the regions, not the bounding boxes (though bounding boxes can be used for visualization).

If y is East of z, then the centroid of y is to the east of the centroid of z.
If x is Southwest of y, then the centroid of x is to the southwest of the centroid of y.

Let's denote the coordinates of the centroids as (x_x, y_x), (x_y, y_y), and (x_z, y_z) for regions x, y, and z, respectively.

Given:
- x is Southwest of y: x_x < x_y and y_x < y_y
- y is East of z: x_y > x_z and y_y ≈ y_z

We can derive:
- x_x < x_y (from x is Southwest of y)
- x_y > x_z (from y is East of z)

But from these, we can't directly determine the relationship between x_x and x_z. 

- y_x < y_y (from x is Southwest of y)
- y_y ≈ y_z (from y is East of z)

Which gives us: y_x < y_z

This means x is to the south of z, but we're unsure about the east-west relationship.

But I've overlooked something: the transitivity of the longitude relationship.

From:
- x_x < x_y (from x is Southwest of y)
- x_y > x_z (from y is East of z)

We can't directly determine the relationship between x_x and x_z. It could be x_x < x_z, x_x = x_z, or x_x > x_z.

So, combining the latitude and longitude inferences:
1. If x_x < x_z, then x is Southwest of z
2. If x_x = x_z, then x is South of z
3. If x_x > x_z, then x is Southeast of z

Hmm, this doesn't seem correct either, given the definitions of Southwest and East. Let me reconsider.

The issue is that cardinal direction relations like "Southwest" or "East" don't necessarily mean the regions are far apart or don't overlap. They describe the relative positions of the regions.

In the context of the question, when it says "x is Southwest of y", it means the centroid of x is to the southwest of the centroid of y. Similarly, "y is East of z" means the centroid of y is to the east of the centroid of z.

Let's denote the coordinates of the centroids as (x_x, y_x), (x_y, y_y), and (x_z, y_z) for regions x, y, and z, respectively.

Given:
- x is Southwest of y: x_x < x_y and y_x < y_y
- y is East of z: x_y > x_z and y_y = y_z (since "East" implies no change in the north-south direction)

We can derive:
- x_x < x_y (from x is Southwest of y)
- x_y > x_z (from y is East of z)

But from these, we can't directly determine the relationship between x_x and x_z. It could be x_x < x_z, x_x = x_z, or x_x > x_z.

- y_x < y_y (from x is Southwest of y)
- y_y = y_z (from y is East of z)

Which gives us: y_x < y_z

This means x is to the south of z, but we're unsure about the east-west relationship.

Actually, let's reconsider the cardinal direction relations in 2D space.

If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then:
- y is to the east of z, so y is at (a, 0) for some a > 0.
- x is to the southwest of y, so x is at (a-b, -c) for some b, c > 0.

Now, the relation between x and z (which is at (0, 0)) depends on the relative values of a and b:
1. If a > b, then x is at (a-b, -c) with a-b > 0, which means x is to the southeast of z.
2. If a = b, then x is at (0, -c), which means x is directly south of z.
3. If a < b, then x is at (a-b, -c) with a-b < 0, which means x is to the southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: South, Southeast, or Southwest.

Ok, one more time. 

Let's define the cardinal directions in terms of coordinates, placing Z at the origin (0, 0):

- Z is at (0, 0)
- Y is East of Z, so Y is at (a, 0) for some a > 0
- X is Southwest of Y, so X is at (a-b, -c) for some b, c > 0, with b > 0 and c > 0 (since X is both west and south of Y)

Now, the relation between X and Z depends on the value of a-b:
1. If a > b, then X is at (a-b, -c) with a-b > 0, which means X is to the east of Z. Combined with X being south of Z, the relation is "Southeast".
2. If a = b, then X is at (0, -c), which means X is directly south of Z. The relation is "South".
3. If a < b, then X is at (a-b, -c) with a-b < 0, which means X is to the west of Z. Combined with X being south of Z, the relation is "Southwest".

So, the possible relations between X and Z are: South, Southeast, or Southwest.

Actually, let me re-frame the problem once more. 

Cardinal directions in this context refer to the relative positions of regions based on their centroids. 

If we use a Cartesian coordinate system with positive x-axis pointing east and positive y-axis pointing north:

- "East" means a higher x-coordinate and roughly the same y-coordinate.
- "Southwest" means a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate.

Given:
- X is Southwest of Y: X's centroid has both a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than Y's centroid.
- Y is East of Z: Y's centroid has a higher x-coordinate than Z's centroid, and roughly the same y-coordinate.

Let's denote the coordinates of the centroids as (x_X, y_X), (x_Y, y_Y), and (x_Z, y_Z) for regions X, Y, and Z, respectively.

From the given relations:
- x_X < x_Y and y_X < y_Y (X is Southwest of Y)
- x_Y > x_Z and y_Y ≈ y_Z (Y is East of Z)

From these, we can derive:
- y_X < y_Y ≈ y_Z, which implies y_X < y_Z. This means X is to the south of Z.
- For the east-west relation, we have x_X < x_Y and x_Y > x_Z. From these, we can't directly determine the relationship between x_X and x_Z.

So, in terms of the east-west relation between X and Z:
1. If x_X < x_Z, then X is to the west of Z. Combined with X being south of Z, the relation is "Southwest".
2. If x_X = x_Z, then X is neither east nor west of Z. Combined with X being south of Z, the relation is "South".
3. If x_X > x_Z, then X is to the east of Z. Combined with X being south of Z, the relation is "Southeast".

OK, maybe I shouldn't have gotten into the analytical weeds so much.

Let's just think through the problem from scratch. We want to determine the relation between X and Z, given:
- X is Southwest of Y
- Y is East of Z

The Southwest direction is a combination of South and West. The East direction is, well, East.

For the north-south component:
- X is South of Y (from "Southwest")
- Y has the same north-south position as Z (from "East")
- Therefore, X is South of Z.

For the east-west component:
- X is West of Y (from "Southwest")
- Y is East of Z (given)
- We can't determine for sure the east-west relation between X and Z.

Let's go back to the geographic intuition. If Y is East of Z, it means Y is directly to the east of Z. And if X is Southwest of Y, it means X is to the southwest of Y. The situation could look like this:

Z --- Y
     /
    /
   X

But it could also look like:

    Z --- Y
         /
        /
       X

Or even:

        Z --- Y
             /
            /
           X

In the first scenario, X is Southwest of Z. In the second, X is South of Z. In the third, X is Southeast of Z.

This confirms our analytical reasoning. The possible relations between X and Z are:
1. Southwest
2. South
3. Southeast

OK, one more time, from the top. 

Given:
- Region X is Southwest of region Y
- Region Y is East of region Z

What is the cardinal direction relation between regions X and Z?

First, let's understand what these cardinal direction relations mean in terms of relative positions:
- "Southwest" means a position that is both South and West.
- "East" means a position that is directly to the East.

I'll place Z at the origin (0, 0) and determine the positions of Y and X based on the given relations.

Since Y is East of Z, Y's position can be represented as (a, 0) for some a > 0.

Since X is Southwest of Y, X's position can be represented as (a-b, -c) for some b, c > 0, where b represents the westward displacement from Y and c represents the southward displacement.

Now, the relation between X and Z depends on the value of a-b, which is the difference between the eastward displacement of Y from Z and the westward displacement of X from Y:
1. If a > b, then X is at (a-b, -c) with a-b > 0, which means X is to the east of Z. Combined with X being south of Z, the relation is "Southeast".
2. If a = b, then X is at (0, -c), which means X is directly south of Z. The relation is "South".
3. If a < b, then X is at (a-b, -c) with a-b < 0, which means X is to the west of Z. Combined with X being south of Z, the relation is "Southwest".

So, the possible relations between X and Z are: South, Southeast, or Southwest.

Actually, let me try a different approach by thinking in terms of the regions and their boundaries. 

Given:
- Region X is Southwest of region Y
- Region Y is East of region Z

Based on the standard interpretation of cardinal direction relations:
- "Y is East of Z" means the entirety of region Y is to the east of region Z. There's no overlap in the east-west dimension.
- "X is Southwest of Y" means the entirety of region X is to the southwest of region Y. There's no overlap in either the east-west or north-south dimensions.

I think this is where I went wrong before. Let me reconsider.

Since "Y is East of Z" means Y is entirely to the east of Z, it tells us that the westernmost point of Y is to the east of the easternmost point of Z. In terms of the x-coordinates (assuming positive x points eastward):
min(x_Y) > max(x_Z)

Similarly, "X is Southwest of Y" means X is entirely to the southwest of Y. In terms of coordinates:
max(x_X) < min(x_Y) (X is to the west of Y)
max(y_X) < min(y_Y) (X is to the south of Y)

Now, to determine the relation between X and Z, we consider:
- For the east-west relation, we have max(x_X) < min(x_Y) and min(x_Y) > max(x_Z). This doesn't give us a clear relationship between max(x_X) and max(x_Z), or between min(x_X) and min(x_Z). X could be entirely to the west of Z, entirely to the east of Z, or there could be some overlap in the east-west dimension.
- For the north-south relation, we have max(y_X) < min(y_Y). Since "Y is East of Z" doesn't impose a clear constraint on the north-south relation between Y and Z, we can't directly determine the north-south relation between X and Z.

Actually, wait. I think I had an incorrect impression that East-West relations strictly constrain regions to have no overlaps in the respective dimensions. But these cardinal direction relations are really just a way to specify the general direction from one region to another.

Let's reframe the problem. Cardinal directions like "Southwest" and "East" are qualitative ways to describe the relative positions of regions.

Let's denote the centroids of the regions as CX, CY, and CZ. Given:
- CX is Southwest of CY: CX is both to the south and to the west of CY.
- CY is East of CZ: CY is to the east of CZ, with no significant northward or southward displacement.

For the relation between CX and CZ:
- Given CX is to the south of CY, and CY is at roughly the same latitude as CZ, it follows that CX is to the south of CZ.
- For the east-west relation, given CX is to the west of CY, and CY is to the east of CZ, we can't directly determine the east-west relation between CX and CZ.

So, the possible relations between X and Z, considering the north-south and east-west components:
1. Southwest (if CX is to the west of CZ)
2. South (if CX is neither significantly to the east nor to the west of CZ)
3. Southeast (if CX is to the east of CZ)

I think this is the correct reasoning.

Actually, let me re-do my analysis, and this time let's use a more formal model. 

When we say "region X is Southwest of region Y", we mean that the centroid of X is Southwest of the centroid of Y. Similarly, "region Y is East of region Z" means the centroid of Y is East of the centroid of Z.

Let's define a 2D coordinate system where the positive x-axis points East and the positive y-axis points North. The centroids of the three regions can be denoted as (x_X, y_X), (x_Y, y_Y), and (x_Z, y_Z).

Given the relations:
- X is Southwest of Y: This means x_X < x_Y and y_X < y_Y.
- Y is East of Z: This means x_Y > x_Z and y_Y ≈ y_Z (since "East" implies no significant northward or southward displacement).

From these, we can derive:
- y_X < y_Y ≈ y_Z, which implies y_X < y_Z. This means X is to the South of Z.
- x_X < x_Y and x_Y > x_Z. From these, we can't directly determine the relation between x_X and x_Z.

So, the possible east-west relationships between X and Z are:
1. X is to the west of Z (x_X < x_Z)
2. X is to the east of Z (x_X > x_Z)
3. X is neither significantly to the east nor to the west of Z (x_X ≈ x_Z)

Combining these with the north-south relationship (X is to the south of Z), the possible cardinal direction relations between X and Z are:
1. Southwest (if X is to the west of Z)
2. South (if X is neither significantly to the east nor to the west of Z)
3. Southeast (if X is to the east of Z)

So, the possible relations between X and Z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

OK, let's simplify the problem. 

We have two relations:
- Region X is Southwest of region Y.
- Region Y is East of region Z.

Now, we want to find the possible relations between region X and region Z.

From "X is Southwest of Y", we know that X is both South and West of Y.
From "Y is East of Z", we know that Y is East of Z, with no significant northward or southward displacement.

For the north-south component:
- X is South of Y.
- Y is at the same latitude as Z (neither North nor South).
- Therefore, X is South of Z.

For the east-west component:
- X is West of Y.
- Y is East of Z.
- But from these, we can't determine for sure the east-west relation between X and Z. X could be West, East, or at the same longitude as Z.

Combining the north-south and east-west components, the possible relations between X and Z are:
1. Southwest (if X is West of Z)
2. South (if X is at the same longitude as Z)
3. Southeast (if X is East of Z)

So, the possible relations between X and Z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Actually, let me check if we're forgetting any other possibilities.

The 8 primary cardinal directions are:
- North (N)
- Northeast (NE)
- East (E)
- Southeast (SE)
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- West (W)
- Northwest (NW)

We know that:
- X is Southwest of Y.
- Y is East of Z.

First, let's figure out the possible angles from Z to X:

Z -> Y is East, which is 0 degrees.
Y -> X is Southwest, which is 225 degrees.

Now I need to figure out the possible angles from Z to X. But instead, I should think in terms of coordinates, as we did above.

Actually, let's use a slightly different approach here.

We have three regions: X, Y, and Z. I'll define a coordinate system with the positive x-axis pointing East and the positive y-axis pointing North. For simplicity, I'll denote the centroid of each region as its point location.

Given:
- Region X is Southwest of region Y: X has a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than Y.
- Region Y is East of region Z: Y has a higher x-coordinate than Z, and the same y-coordinate.

Let's say, without loss of generality, that Z is at the origin: Z = (0, 0).
Since Y is East of Z, Y is at (a, 0) for some a > 0.
Since X is Southwest of Y, X is at (a-b, -c) for some b > 0 and c > 0.

Now, the relation between X and Z depends on the values of a and b:
1. If a > b, then X is at (a-b, -c) with a-b > 0, which means X is to the East of Z.
2. If a = b, then X is at (0, -c), which means X is directly South of Z.
3. If a < b, then X is at (a-b, -c) with a-b < 0, which means X is to the West of Z.

Since X is always South of Z (due to the -c term), the possible relations between X and Z are:
1. Southeast (if a > b)
2. South (if a = b)
3. Southwest (if a < b)

The answer is South, Southwest, or Southeast.

Actually, let me double-check this, because I've approached this problem in a variety of ways and have had different answers. Let me prove it with a different approach.

Let's define three points: X, Y, and Z. 

Given that X is Southwest of Y, we have:
X.x < Y.x (X is to the west of Y)
X.y < Y.y (X is to the south of Y)

Given that Y is East of Z, we have:
Y.x > Z.x (Y is to the east of Z)
Y.y = Z.y (Y is at the same latitude as Z)

From these, we can derive:
X.y < Y.y = Z.y, which means X.y < Z.y. This tells us that X is to the south of Z.

For the east-west relation between X and Z, we have:
X.x < Y.x and Y.x > Z.x. From these, we can't directly determine the relation between X.x and Z.x. It could be X.x < Z.x, X.x = Z.x, or X.x > Z.x.

So, the possible relations between X and Z are:
1. Southwest (if X.x < Z.x)
2. South (if X.x = Z.x)
3. Southeast (if X.x > Z.x)

I keep coming to the same conclusion. So I'm confident that the answer is:

The possible relations between region X and region Z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Actually, let me explicitly construct examples of each case to verify my answer:

1. Southwest case:
Let Z = (0, 0), Y = (1, 0), and X = (-1, -1).
X is Southwest of Y because X.x < Y.x and X.y < Y.y.
Y is East of Z because Y.x > Z.x and Y.y = Z.y.
X is Southwest of Z because X.x < Z.x and X.y < Z.y.

2. South case:
Let Z = (0, 0), Y = (1, 0), and X = (0, -1).
X is Southwest of Y because X.x < Y.x and X.y < Y.y.
Y is East of Z because Y.x > Z.x and Y.y = Z.y.
X is South of Z because X.x = Z.x and X.y < Z.y.

3. Southeast case:
Let Z = (0, 0), Y = (2, 0), and X = (1, -1).
X is Southwest of Y because X.x < Y.x and X.y < Y.y.
Y is East of Z because Y.x > Z.x and Y.y = Z.y.
X is Southeast of Z because X.x > Z.x and X.y < Z.y.

The three examples I've constructed demonstrate that X can be Southwest, South, or Southeast of Z, while still maintaining the given relations that X is Southwest of Y and Y is East of Z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region X and region Z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Actually, let me think critically one more time to see if there's any other possibilities.

I'm thinking about additional possibilities, such as:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- West
- Northwest
- Bounding Box

Let's systematically check if any of these could be the relation between X and Z.

1. North:
If X is North of Z, then X.y > Z.y. But we've established that X.y < Z.y, so this is not possible.

2. Northeast:
If X is Northeast of Z, then X.x > Z.x and X.y > Z.y. But since X.y < Z.y, this is not possible.

3. East:
If X is East of Z, then X.x > Z.x and X.y = Z.y. But since X.y < Z.y, this is not possible.

4. West:
If X is West of Z, then X.x < Z.x and X.y = Z.y. But since X.y < Z.y, this is not possible.

5. Northwest:
If X is Northwest of Z, then X.x < Z.x and X.y > Z.y. But since X.y < Z.y, this is not possible.

6. Bounding Box:
If there's a bounding box relation, it would mean that one region encloses the other. This doesn't seem to be a cardinal direction relation in the traditional sense, so I'll set this aside.

After checking all the other possibilities, I can confirm that the only valid relations between X and Z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Therefore, the possible relations between region X and region Z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

OK, one more attempt just to be clear.

Region X is Southwest of region Y:
- In terms of cardinal directions, "Southwest" means X is both to the south and to the west of Y.
- In terms of coordinates, if we use a system with the positive x-axis pointing East and the positive y-axis pointing North, then X has both a lower x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate than Y.

Region Y is East of region Z:
- In terms of cardinal directions, "East" means Y is directly to the east of Z.
- In terms of coordinates, Y has a higher x-coordinate than Z, and the same y-coordinate.

From these, we can derive:
- X has a lower y-coordinate than Y, and Y has the same y-coordinate as Z. Therefore, X has a lower y-coordinate than Z, which means X is to the south of Z.
- X has a lower x-coordinate than Y, and Y has a higher x-coordinate than Z. From these, we can't directly determine the relation between the x-coordinates of X and Z. It could be X.x < Z.x, X.x = Z.x, or X.x > Z.x.

Considering all the valid cardinal directions, and based on the y-coordinate (X is to the south of Z) and the possible x-coordinate relationships, the possible relations between X and Z are:
1. Southwest (if X.x < Z.x)
2. South (if X.x = Z.x)
3. Southeast (if X.x > Z.x)

So, the possible relations between region X and region Z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Let me check the answer one more time:

Given:
- Region X is Southwest of region Y
- Region Y is East of region Z

If we look at this geometrically:
- The fact that X is Southwest of Y means that X is in the southwest quadrant relative to Y
- The fact that Y is East of Z means that Y is to the east of Z

Now, to determine the possible relationships between X and Z:

The North-South relation is clear: Since X is to the south of Y, and Y is at the same latitude as Z, X must be to the south of Z.

For the East-West relation:
- X is to the west of Y
- Y is to the east of Z

But these don't directly tell us the East-West relation between X and Z. X could be to the west of Z, to the east of Z, or at the same longitude as Z.

So, the possible relations between X and Z are:
1. Southwest (if X is to the west of Z)
2. South (if X is at the same longitude as Z)
3. Southeast (if X is to the east of Z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region X and region Z are: South, Southwest, or Southeast.

Let me again be systematic about this.

Given:
- Region X is Southwest of region Y
- Region Y is East of region Z

Let's denote the centroids of the regions by the same letter: X, Y, and Z.

From the given relations:
- X is Southwest of Y: This means that X is both to the south and to the west of Y.
  In coordinates: X.x < Y.x and X.y < Y.y.
- Y is East of Z: This means that Y is to the east of Z, with no significant northward or southward displacement.
  In coordinates: Y.x > Z.x and Y.y ≈ Z.y.

From these, we can derive:
- X.y < Y.y ≈ Z.y, which implies X.y < Z.y. This means X is to the south of Z.
- X.x < Y.x and Y.x > Z.x. From these, we can't directly determine the relation between X.x and Z.x.

So, the possible East-West relationships between X and Z are:
1. X is to the west of Z (X.x < Z.x)
2. X is to the east of Z (X.x > Z.x)
3. X is neither to the east nor to the west of Z (X.x ≈ Z.x)

Combining these with the North-South relationship (X is to the south of Z), the possible cardinal direction relations between X and Z are:
1. Southwest (if X is to the west of Z)
2. South (if X is neither to the east nor to the west of Z)
3. Southeast (if X is to the east of Z)

Let me construct examples to verify:

1. Southwest case:
Let Z = (0, 0), Y = (2, 0), and X = (1, -1).
X is Southwest of Y because X.x < Y.x and X.y < Y.y.
Y is East of Z because Y.x > Z.x and Y.y = Z.y.
X is Southwest of Z because X.x > Z.x and X.y < Z.y.

Wait, that's not right. X is not Southwest of Z in this example, because X.x > Z.x. Let me re-do this.

1. Southwest case:
Let Z = (0, 0), Y = (1, 0), and X = (-1, -1).
X is Southwest of Y because X.x < Y.x and X.y < Y.y.
Y is East of Z because Y.x > Z.x and Y.y = Z.y.
X is Southwest of Z because X.x < Z.x and X.y < Z.y.

2. South case:
Let Z = (0, 0), Y = (1, 0), and X = (0, -1).
X is Southwest of Y because X.x < Y.x and X.y < Y.y.
Y is East of Z because Y.x > Z.x and Y.y = Z.y.
X is South of Z because X.x = Z.x and X.y < Z.y.

3. Southeast case:
Let Z = (0, 0), Y = (2, 0), and X = (1, -1).
X is Southwest of Y because X.x < Y.x and X.y < Y.y.
Y is East of Z because Y.x > Z.x and Y.y = Z.y.
X is Southeast of Z because X.x > Z.x and X.y < Z.y.

These examples demonstrate that X can be Southwest, South, or Southeast of Z, while still maintaining the given relations that X is Southwest of Y and Y is East of Z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region X and region Z are Southwest, South, or Southeast.

Actually, let me properly go through each possible cardinal direction relation.

1. North:
For X to be North of Z, X.y would need to be greater than Z.y. However, we've established that X.y < Z.y, so this is not possible.

2. Northeast:
For X to be Northeast of Z, X.x would need to be greater than Z.x and X.y would need to be greater than Z.y. However, since X.y < Z.y, this is not possible.

3. East:
For X to be East of Z, X.x would need to be greater than Z.x and X.y would need to be equal to Z.y. However, since X.y < Z.y, this is not possible.

4. Southeast:
For X to be Southeast of Z, X.x would need to be greater than Z.x and X.y would need to be less than Z.y. We've established that X.y < Z.y, and X.x could be greater than Z.x. So, Southeast is a possible relation.

5. South:
For X to be South of Z, X.x would need to be equal to Z.x and X.y would need to be less than Z.y. We've established that X.y < Z.y, and X.x could be equal to Z.x. So, South is a possible relation.

6. Southwest:
For X to be Southwest of Z, X.x would need to be less than Z.x and X.y would need to be less than Z.y. We've established that X.y < Z.y, and X.x could be less than Z.x. So, Southwest is a possible relation.

7. West:
For X to be West of Z, X.x would need to be less than Z.x and X.y would need to be equal to Z.y. However, since X.y < Z.y, this is not possible.

8. Northwest:
For X to be Northwest of Z, X.x would need to be less than Z.x and X.y would need to be greater than Z.y. However, since X.y < Z.y, this is not possible.

9. Bounding Box:
This relation doesn't fit into the traditional cardinal direction framework, so we won't consider it.

From this analysis, the only possible relations between X and Z are:
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest

I've been going around in circles, but I'm confident in my answer.
the possible relations between X and Z are Southeast, South, and Southwest.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- South
- Southeast
- Southwest
