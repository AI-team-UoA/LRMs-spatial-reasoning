PROMPT: Let  East and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

In this problem we are given:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is North of region z

And we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's visualize this situation. We can represent the cardinal directions in a grid:

NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | C | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE

Where C would represent the "center" position.

Now, we're told that x is East of y. So if y is at position C, then x is at position E.
And we're told that y is North of z. So if z is at position C, then y is at position N.

But we need to combine these. If z is at position C, then y is at position N, and x is East of y, so x is at position NE.

So, if we take z as our reference point (at position C), then y is North of z, and x is Northeast of z.

Therefore, the possible relation between x and z is: Northeast.

Wait, I need to double-check this. 

Let's think about this differently. Let's define a coordinate system with z at the origin (0, 0).
- y is North of z, so y might be at coordinates (0, 1).
- x is East of y, so x might be at coordinates (1, 1).

So relative to z, x is at position (1, 1), which is indeed Northeast.

But wait, I need to consider all possibilities. The problem says "x is East of y" and "y is North of z", but it doesn't give precise coordinates.

"East" means the x-coordinate increases, and "North" means the y-coordinate increases.

So if z is at (0, 0):
- y could be at (0, a) for any a > 0 (y is North of z)
- x could be at (b, a) for any b > 0 (x is East of y)

So, relative to z, x is at position (b, a) where a > 0 and b > 0. This corresponds to the Northeast direction.

Actually, let me double-check this by considering specific examples. 

Let's say z is at (0, 0).
- y could be at (0, 1) because y is North of z.
- x could be at (1, 1) because x is East of y.

So, relative to z, x is at (1, 1), which is Northeast.

But what if y is at (0, 2)?
- Then x could be at (1, 2) because x is East of y.
- Relative to z, x is at (1, 2), which is still Northeast.

And what if y is at (0, 1) but x is farther East, like at (3, 1)?
- Relative to z, x is at (3, 1), which is still Northeast.

So it seems consistent that if x is East of y and y is North of z, then x is Northeast of z.

Actually, wait. Let's be more careful about what "East" and "North" mean in this context. 

"East" typically means the x-coordinate is greater, but the y-coordinate can be the same. So if y is at (0, 1), then x can be at (1, 1), but it could also be at (1, 0) or (1, 2).

Let's consider these cases:
- If y is at (0, 1) and x is at (1, 1), then relative to z, x is at (1, 1), which is Northeast.
- If y is at (0, 1) and x is at (1, 0), then relative to z, x is at (1, 0), which is East.
- If y is at (0, 1) and x is at (1, 2), then relative to z, x is at (1, 2), which is Northeast.

So the possible relations between x and z could be either East or Northeast.

Wait, I missed something. If y is North of z, it doesn't mean y is directly North of z. It could be Northwest or Northeast of z, as long as it's northwards.

So let's reconsider. If z is at (0, 0):
- y could be at (a, b) where b > 0 (y is North of z). This includes points like (0, 1), (1, 1), (-1, 1), etc.
- x could be at (a+c, b) for any c > 0 (x is East of y).

Now let's see the possible positions of x relative to z:

If y is at (0, b) for b > 0 (directly North of z):
- x is at (c, b) for c > 0.
- Relative to z, x is at (c, b), which is Northeast.

If y is at (a, b) for a > 0 and b > 0 (Northeast of z):
- x is at (a+c, b) for c > 0.
- Relative to z, x is at (a+c, b), which is also Northeast.

If y is at (a, b) for a < 0 and b > 0 (Northwest of z):
- x is at (a+c, b) for c > 0.
- If a+c > 0, then relative to z, x is at (a+c, b), which is Northeast.
- If a+c = 0, then relative to z, x is at (0, b), which is North.
- If a+c < 0 but |a+c| < |a|, then relative to z, x is still Northwest, but closer to the North.
- If a+c < 0 and |a+c| >= |a|, then relative to z, x is still Northwest.

So the possible relations between x and z could be: Northeast, North, or Northwest.

Let's double-check this with specific examples.

Let's say z is at (0, 0).

Case 1: y is directly North of z, e.g., at (0, 1).
- x is East of y, so x could be at (1, 1).
- Relative to z, x is at (1, 1), which is Northeast.
This gives us the relation: Northeast.

Case 2: y is Northeast of z, e.g., at (1, 1).
- x is East of y, so x could be at (2, 1).
- Relative to z, x is at (2, 1), which is still Northeast.
This gives us the relation: Northeast.

Case 3: y is Northwest of z, e.g., at (-1, 1).
- x is East of y, so x could be at (0, 1) (if it's just a bit East of y).
- Relative to z, x is at (0, 1), which is North.
This gives us the relation: North.

Case 4: y is Northwest of z, e.g., at (-2, 1).
- x is East of y, so x could be at (-1, 1) (if it's just a bit East of y).
- Relative to z, x is at (-1, 1), which is Northwest.
This gives us the relation: Northwest.

Hmm, I've now convinced myself that x could be Northeast, North, or Northwest of z. Let me verify with a diagram.

Let's represent our space as a grid:

```
  -2 -1  0  1  2
2  .  .  .  .  .
1  y  .  .  x  .
0  .  .  z  .  .
```

Here, z is at (0, 0), y is at (-2, 1), and x is at (1, 1).
- y is indeed North of z (it's Northwest to be precise).
- x is indeed East of y.
- Relative to z, x is at (1, 1), which is Northeast.

So, given y is at (-2, 1) and x is East of y, x could be at (-1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), etc. These positions would make x Northwest, North, and Northeast of z, respectively.

Actually, let me back up a little bit. Let's think again about what "East" and "North" actually mean in this context.

East: Imagine you're standing at point y facing East. All the points in front of you are considered East of y.

North: Imagine you're standing at point z facing North. All the points in front of you are considered North of z.

Now, the problem states:
- x is East of y
- y is North of z

If we're thinking about regions, I believe we need to think about relative directions like this:
- If y is North of z, it means y has a higher y-coordinate than z.
- If x is East of y, it means x has a higher x-coordinate than y.

So if z is at (0, 0):
- y is somewhere in the Northern half-plane, which means its coordinates are (any, positive).
- x is somewhere to the East of y, which means its coordinates are (y's x-coordinate + positive, y's y-coordinate).

Let's consider a few scenarios:

1. y is directly North of z, at (0, 1).
   - x is East of y, so it's at (positive, 1).
   - Relative to z, x is at (positive, 1), which is Northeast.

2. y is Northeast of z, at (1, 1).
   - x is East of y, so it's at (1+positive, 1).
   - Relative to z, x is at (1+positive, 1), which is still Northeast.

3. y is Northwest of z, at (-1, 1).
   - x is East of y, so it's at (-1+positive, 1).
   - If the positive value is less than 1, e.g., x is at (-0.5, 1), then relative to z, x is still Northwest.
   - If the positive value is exactly 1, e.g., x is at (0, 1), then relative to z, x is directly North.
   - If the positive value is greater than 1, e.g., x is at (0.5, 1), then relative to z, x is Northeast.

So, from these scenarios, x could be Northwest, North, or Northeast of z.

Actually, I want to be very careful here, and to really think in terms of regions rather than points. What I've said above is correct, but I want to be clear about the definition.

In the cardinal direction system:
- East: Points with a higher x-coordinate.
- North: Points with a higher y-coordinate.
- Northeast: Points with both a higher x-coordinate and a higher y-coordinate.
- Northwest: Points with a lower x-coordinate but a higher y-coordinate.
- And so on.

So, for regions:
- Region y is North of region z means that for any point in y, its y-coordinate is greater than any point in z.
- Region x is East of region y means that for any point in x, its x-coordinate is greater than any point in y.

Now, let's revisit the problem. If x is East of y and y is North of z, then where is x relative to z?

Let's denote the x and y coordinates of a point in region x as (x_x, x_y), and similarly for regions y and z.

Given:
- Region y is North of region z: For all points, y_y > z_y.
- Region x is East of region y: For all points, x_x > y_x.

We want to determine the relationship between regions x and z.

For all points in x and z:
- x_x > y_x (since x is East of y)
- y_y > z_y (since y is North of z)

But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between x_x and z_x, or between x_y and z_y. We need more information to determine the relationship between x and z.

Wait, let's approach this differently. Let's consider the region y as the intersection of two half-planes:
- y is North of z: y is in the half-plane above z.
- x is East of y: x is in the half-plane to the right of y.

Given these constraints, x is in the half-plane to the right of y, and y is in the half-plane above z. This means x is in a region that's both to the right of y and above z.

Actually, no, that's not correct. "x is East of y" means x is to the right of y, but it doesn't mean x is above z. We don't know the vertical relationship between x and y.

Let's be careful here:
- y is North of z: All points in y have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z.
- x is East of y: All points in x have a higher x-coordinate than all points in y.

We can deduce that all points in x have a higher x-coordinate than all points in y, and all points in y have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z. 

But we can't directly compare the y-coordinates of x and z, or the x-coordinates of x and z.

Actually, I'm being imprecise again. Let me be more specific about cardinal direction relations.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, we often use a model where the space is divided into nine tiles based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a reference region.

If region z is the reference region, its MBR divides the space into nine tiles: Northwest, North, Northeast, West, the region itself, East, Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Given the constraints:
- y is North of z: All of region y is contained in the North tile of z.
- x is East of y: All of region x is contained in the East tile of y.

Now, if y is in the North tile of z, and x is in the East tile of y, where is x relative to z? It depends on the exact positioning.

Let's consider some specific examples:
1. If y is entirely in the North tile of z and is aligned with z in the east-west direction, then x (being East of y) would be in the Northeast tile of z.
2. If y is entirely in the North tile of z but is to the east of z, then x (being East of y) would still be in the Northeast tile of z.
3. If y is entirely in the North tile of z but is to the west of z, then x (being East of y) could be in the North, Northeast, or even the Northwest tile of z, depending on how far east x is compared to how far west y is.

Actually, wait, I think I'm confusing myself. I'm going to simplify and think purely in terms of regions without using tiles.

Let's define the cardinal direction relations for regions:
- Region A is North of region B if all points in A have a higher y-coordinate than all points in B.
- Region A is East of region B if all points in A have a higher x-coordinate than all points in B.
- Region A is Northeast of region B if all points in A have both a higher x-coordinate and a higher y-coordinate than all points in B.
- And so on.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: All points in x have a higher x-coordinate than all points in y.
- Region y is North of region z: All points in y have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z.

Let's denote the coordinates of a point in region x as (x_x, x_y), and similarly for regions y and z.

So, we have:
- x_x > y_x for all points in x and y.
- y_y > z_y for all points in y and z.

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x_x and z_x, or between x_y and z_y. 

Actually, let's reflect on the definition of cardinal directions in a bit more detail. 

For regions, the cardinal direction relation is often determined using a reference axis (e.g., the center of a region, or the range of coordinates of a region).

Let's represent the ranges of coordinates for the regions:
- x: [x_min_x, x_max_x] in the x-direction, [x_min_y, x_max_y] in the y-direction.
- y: [y_min_x, y_max_x] in the x-direction, [y_min_y, y_max_y] in the y-direction.
- z: [z_min_x, z_max_x] in the x-direction, [z_min_y, z_max_y] in the y-direction.

For "Region x is East of region y", we have:
- x_min_x > y_max_x: The minimum x-coordinate of region x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of region y.

For "Region y is North of region z", we have:
- y_min_y > z_max_y: The minimum y-coordinate of region y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of region z.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

Given:
- x_min_x > y_max_x
- y_min_y > z_max_y

We need to determine the relationship between:
- x_min_x and z_max_x
- x_min_y and z_max_y

From x_min_x > y_max_x, we can't directly infer anything about x_min_x vs. z_max_x, unless we have a relationship between y_max_x and z_max_x.

Similarly, from y_min_y > z_max_y, we can't directly infer anything about x_min_y vs. z_max_y, unless we have a relationship between x_min_y and y_min_y.

But we don't have these additional relationships from the given information.

So, just from the given that "x is East of y" and "y is North of z", we can't definitely determine the cardinal direction relation between x and z.

Actually, I think I'm getting confused by trying to be too detailed. Let's simplify and focus on the main constraints.

Let's go back to the basic definitions:
- Region x is East of region y means that x is to the right of y.
- Region y is North of region z means that y is above z.

If y is above z, and x is to the right of y, where is x relative to z? It would be diagonally up and to the right, which corresponds to Northeast.

Actually, wait. Let's go back even further to just using points.

Let's define points p_x, p_y, and p_z within regions x, y, and z, respectively.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y, which means p_x is to the right of p_y. So p_x has a larger x-coordinate than p_y.
- Region y is North of region z, which means p_y is above p_z. So p_y has a larger y-coordinate than p_z.

Now, where is p_x relative to p_z?
- p_x has a larger x-coordinate than p_y, and p_y can have any x-coordinate relative to p_z.
- p_y has a larger y-coordinate than p_z, and p_x can have any y-coordinate relative to p_y.

This means:
- p_x can have a larger x-coordinate than p_z (if p_y's x-coordinate is greater than or equal to p_z's) or a smaller x-coordinate than p_z (if p_y's x-coordinate is less than p_z's and p_x's x-coordinate, though greater than p_y's, is still less than p_z's).
- p_x can have a larger y-coordinate than p_z (if p_x's y-coordinate is greater than or equal to p_y's) or a smaller y-coordinate than p_z (if p_x's y-coordinate is less than p_y's and also less than p_z's).

So, p_x could be in various directions relative to p_z: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, etc.

Hmm, I think I've been approaching this wrong. I'm going to take another approach.

I'll simplify and think about the problem in the following way:

Given three regions x, y, and z, and two cardinal direction relations:
- x is East of y
- y is North of z

We want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

The constraints tell us the following about the relative positions of the regions:
- Region x is positioned to the east (or right) of region y.
- Region y is positioned to the north (or above) of region z.

Now, to determine the possible positions of x relative to z, we need to consider all possible positions of y.

Let's consider the extreme cases:
1. If y is directly north of z (aligned in the east-west direction), then x (being east of y) would be northeast of z.
2. If y is northeast of z, then x (being east of y) would also be northeast of z.
3. If y is northwest of z, then x (being east of y) could be:
   - Northwest of z (if x is just slightly east of y but still to the west of z)
   - North of z (if x is east of y and aligned with z in the east-west direction)
   - Northeast of z (if x is further east of y, such that it's to the east of z)

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be: Northwest, North, or Northeast.

I'm going to come back to this again, in a slightly different way of conceptualizing the situation.

Instead of thinking about regions, I'll think about the position of x, y, and z as single points, and then see if the logic extends to regions.

Let's define a coordinate system with z at the origin (0, 0).
- y is North of z, so y is at (a, b) where b > 0. This could be (-1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), etc.
- x is East of y, so x is at (a+c, b+d) where c > 0. Here, d can be any value (positive, negative, or zero).

Now, let's determine the possible positions of x relative to z:
- x's x-coordinate (a+c) can be less than, equal to, or greater than 0, depending on the values of a and c.
- x's y-coordinate (b+d) can be less than, equal to, or greater than 0, depending on the values of b and d. But since b > 0, for x's y-coordinate to be less than or equal to 0, d would need to be negative with a large enough magnitude.

Now, let's think of each cardinal direction as a quadrant or a boundary:
- North: Points with a positive y-coordinate and a zero x-coordinate.
- Northeast: Points with a positive x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate.
- East: Points with a positive x-coordinate and a zero y-coordinate.
- Southeast: Points with a positive x-coordinate and a negative y-coordinate.
- South: Points with a negative y-coordinate and a zero x-coordinate.
- Southwest: Points with a negative x-coordinate and a negative y-coordinate.
- West: Points with a negative x-coordinate and a zero y-coordinate.
- Northwest: Points with a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate.

Given the constraints, x's position relative to z could be:
- Northeast: If a+c > 0 and b+d > 0.
- North: If a+c = 0 and b+d > 0.
- Northwest: If a+c < 0 and b+d > 0.
- East: If a+c > 0 and b+d = 0.
- West: If a+c < 0 and b+d = 0.
- Southeast: If a+c > 0 and b+d < 0.
- South: If a+c = 0 and b+d < 0.
- Southwest: If a+c < 0 and b+d < 0.

But wait, we know that y's y-coordinate (b) is positive. And x is East of y, which means its y-coordinate can be any value relative to y. This means x's y-coordinate (b+d) can be any value. But for it to be negative or zero, d would need to be negative with a large enough magnitude.

Similarly, y's x-coordinate (a) can be any value. And x is East of y, which means its x-coordinate is greater than y's. This means x's x-coordinate (a+c) can be any value greater than a. If a is a large negative number, even with c > 0, a+c could still be negative.

Hmm, I'm still feeling a bit uncertain. Let me take a step back.

Actually, I'm going to make an assumption, which might clarify things. Let's assume that the cardinal direction relations are based on the centers of the regions. This means:
- Region x is East of region y if the center of x is to the right of the center of y.
- Region y is North of region z if the center of y is above the center of z.

With this assumption, the problem simplifies:
- If the center of y is above the center of z, and the center of x is to the right of the center of y, where is the center of x relative to the center of z?

Let's use a coordinate system. Let the center of z be at (0, 0).

The constraint "y is North of z" means the center of y is at (a, b) where b > 0. Here, a can be any value.

The constraint "x is East of y" means the center of x is at (a+c, b+d) where c > 0. Here, d can be any value.

Now, the direction of x relative to z depends on the values of a+c and b+d:
- If a+c > 0 and b+d > 0, then x is Northeast of z.
- If a+c = 0 and b+d > 0, then x is North of z.
- If a+c < 0 and b+d > 0, then x is Northwest of z.
- If a+c > 0 and b+d = 0, then x is East of z.
- If a+c < 0 and b+d = 0, then x is West of z.
- If a+c > 0 and b+d < 0, then x is Southeast of z.
- If a+c = 0 and b+d < 0, then x is South of z.
- If a+c < 0 and b+d < 0, then x is Southwest of z.

But we know that b > 0 (since y is North of z), and d can be any value. For b+d to be zero or negative, d would need to be a large negative value. Similarly, for a+c to be zero or negative, a would need to be a large negative value (since c > 0).

Are such values for a and d possible given the constraints? Let's see:
- The constraint "y is North of z" only tells us that b > 0. It doesn't constrain a.
- The constraint "x is East of y" only tells us that c > 0. It doesn't constrain d.

So, the center of x relative to the center of z could be in any of the eight cardinal directions, depending on the values of a and d.

Actually, with the constraints:
- b > 0 (since y is North of z)
- c > 0 (since x is East of y)

And knowing that d can be any value, for b+d to be zero or negative, d would need to be negative with a magnitude greater than or equal to b. This gives us d ≤ -b.

But, is there a constraint on d? The constraint "x is East of y" tells us about the east-west positioning but doesn't directly constrain the north-south positioning. So, d could be any value, including values that make b+d zero or negative.

And, as a can be any value, a+c could be positive, zero, or negative, even with c > 0.

So, the center of x relative to the center of z could be in any of the eight cardinal directions or on the exact boundaries.

Actually, wait. I was jumping too much between conceptualizations, and I'm a bit confused now. Let me simplify and be precise.

Let's define the cardinal directions for a point relative to another:
- A point p is East of another point q if p's x-coordinate is greater than q's x-coordinate, and their y-coordinates are the same.
- A point p is North of another point q if p's y-coordinate is greater than q's y-coordinate, and their x-coordinates are the same.
- A point p is Northeast of another point q if p's x-coordinate is greater than q's x-coordinate, and p's y-coordinate is greater than q's y-coordinate.
- And so on.

For regions, a common approach is to define the cardinal direction relations based on the centers of the regions or some other reference point (like the boundary). Let's assume it's based on the centers.

So, "region x is East of region y" means that the center of x is directly to the right of the center of y. And "region y is North of region z" means that the center of y is directly above the center of z.

Now, let's place the center of z at the origin (0, 0).

The constraint "y is North of z" means the center of y is at (0, b) where b > 0.

The constraint "x is East of y" means the center of x is at (c, b) where c > 0.

So, the center of x is at (c, b) relative to the center of z, where c > 0 and b > 0. This corresponds to the Northeast direction.

Therefore, region x is Northeast of region z.

Hmm, but wait. I'm not sure if the cardinal direction relations for regions are as strict as I've defined them for points. Let's reconsider.

For regions, the cardinal direction relations might be a bit more relaxed:
- Region x is East of region y might mean that every point in x is to the right of every point in y, not necessarily directly to the right.
- Region y is North of region z might mean that every point in y is above every point in z, not necessarily directly above.

With this interpretation, if we again place the center of z at the origin (0, 0):

The constraint "y is North of z" means the center of y is at (a, b) where b > 0. Here, a can be any value.

The constraint "x is East of y" means the center of x is at (a+c, b+d) where c > 0. Here, d can be any value.

Now, the direction of x relative to z depends on the values of a+c and b+d:
- If a+c > 0 and b+d > 0, then x is Northeast of z.
- If a+c = 0 and b+d > 0, then x is North of z.
- If a+c < 0 and b+d > 0, then x is Northwest of z.
- If a+c > 0 and b+d = 0, then x is East of z.
- ... (and so on)

But with the constraints:
- b > 0 (since y is North of z)
- c > 0 (since x is East of y)

And considering that a and d can be any values, the possible directions for x relative to z are:
- Northeast, North, Northwest, East, West, Southeast, South, Southwest.

Now, I'm a bit confused. Let me take a more structured approach.

Actually, I think a clearer approach is to test specific cases. The question asks for the possible relationships between region x and region z. We're given the following constraints:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is North of region z

I'll test various positions for y and x to determine all the possible relationships.

1. Suppose y is directly North of z, meaning horizontally aligned.
   - If x is directly East of y, then x is to the Northeast of z.
   - If x is Northeast of y, then x is also to the Northeast of z.
   - If x is Southeast of y, then x could be East of z (if x's latitude is the same as z's) or Northeast of z (if x's latitude is above z's) or Southeast of z (if x's latitude is below z's).
   So, possible relationships in this case: Northeast, East, Southeast.

2. Suppose y is to the Northeast of z.
   - If x is directly East of y, then x is also to the Northeast of z.
   - If x is Northeast of y, then x is also to the Northeast of z.
   - If x is Southeast of y, then x could be East of z (if x's latitude is the same as z's) or Northeast of z (if x's latitude is above z's) or Southeast of z (if x's latitude is below z's).
   So, possible relationships in this case: Northeast, East, Southeast.

3. Suppose y is to the Northwest of z.
   - If x is directly East of y, then x could be North of z (if x's longitude is the same as z's) or Northeast of z (if x's longitude is east of z's) or Northwest of z (if x's longitude is west of z's).
   - If x is Northeast of y, then x could be North of z (if x's longitude is the same as z's) or Northeast of z (if x's longitude is east of z's).
   - If x is Southeast of y, then x could be East of z (if x's latitude is the same as z's) or Northeast of z (if x's latitude is above z's and longitude is east of z's) or Northwest of z (if x's longitude is west of z's) or North of z (if x's longitude is the same as z's and latitude is above z's).
   So, possible relationships in this case: Northeast, North, Northwest, East.

Hmm, I'm getting a lot of possible relationships. Let me take a step back and be even more systematic.

Actually, let's place the center of z at the origin (0, 0).

The constraint "y is North of z" means the center of y is at (a, b) where b > 0. The value of a can be negative (y is to the Northwest of z), zero (y is directly North of z), or positive (y is to the Northeast of z).

The constraint "x is East of y" means the center of x is at (a+c, b+d) where c > 0. The value of d can be negative (x is to the Southeast of y), zero (x is directly East of y), or positive (x is to the Northeast of y).

Now, to determine the direction of x relative to z, we need to compare (a+c, b+d) with (0, 0):
- If a+c > 0 and b+d > 0, then x is to the Northeast of z.
- If a+c = 0 and b+d > 0, then x is directly North of z.
- If a+c < 0 and b+d > 0, then x is to the Northwest of z.
- If a+c > 0 and b+d = 0, then x is directly East of z.
- If a+c < 0 and b+d = 0, then x is directly West of z.
- If a+c > 0 and b+d < 0, then x is to the Southeast of z.
- If a+c = 0 and b+d < 0, then x is directly South of z.
- If a+c < 0 and b+d < 0, then x is to the Southwest of z.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
- b > 0 (since y is North of z)
- c > 0 (since x is East of y)

For a+c to be zero or negative, a would need to be negative with a magnitude greater than or equal to c. This means a ≤ -c.

For b+d to be zero or negative, d would need to be negative with a magnitude greater than or equal to b. This means d ≤ -b.

Are there any constraints on a and d from the given information? Not directly. The constraint "y is North of z" tells us that b > 0 but doesn't say anything about a. Similarly, the constraint "x is East of y" tells us that c > 0 but doesn't say anything about d.

So, the possible directions for x relative to z could be:
1. Northeast: if a+c > 0 and b+d > 0.
2. North: if a+c = 0 and b+d > 0, which is possible if a = -c.
3. Northwest: if a+c < 0 and b+d > 0, which is possible if a < -c.
4. East: if a+c > 0 and b+d = 0, which is possible if d = -b.
5. West: if a+c < 0 and b+d = 0, which is possible if a < -c and d = -b.
6. Southeast: if a+c > 0 and b+d < 0, which is possible if d < -b.
7. South: if a+c = 0 and b+d < 0, which is possible if a = -c and d < -b.
8. Southwest: if a+c < 0 and b+d < 0, which is possible if a < -c and d < -b.

So, it seems like all eight cardinal directions are possible for x relative to z.

That doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider the constraints and think more carefully.

Actually, wait, I need to be more precise about the definition of cardinal directions. When I say "x is East of y", it doesn't mean that x can be Southeast or Northeast of y. It means that x is directly East of y. Same for "y is North of z" - it means y is directly North of z, not Northeast or Northwest.

I'm getting confused about the definitions I'm using. In the spatial reasoning context, "East" and "North" are cardinal directions. In a strict sense, these refer to the principal directions, and not the combinations. So, "East" means directly to the right, not to the right and up (which would be "Northeast") or to the right and down (which would be "Southeast"). Similarly, "North" means directly up, not up and to the right (which would be "Northeast") or up and to the left (which would be "Northwest").

Given these definitions:
- "Region x is East of region y" means the center of x is directly to the right of the center of y, with no vertical offset.
- "Region y is North of region z" means the center of y is directly above the center of z, with no horizontal offset.

With these definitions, if the center of z is at (0, 0), then the center of y is at (0, b) for some b > 0, and the center of x is at (c, b) for some c > 0.

So, the center of x is at (c, b) relative to the center of z, where c > 0 and b > 0. This corresponds to the Northeast direction.

Therefore, the relationship between region x and region z is Northeast.

Wait, I'm not sure if I'm using the correct definitions. Let me try to see if the problem provides any clues about how to interpret the cardinal directions.

The problem statement says: "Let East and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is East of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

It specifically refers to East and North as "cardinal direction relations". This suggests that we should interpret them as the principal cardinal directions, not their combinations. In the strict interpretation of cardinal directions:
- "East" means directly to the right.
- "North" means directly up.
- "Northeast" means diagonally up and to the right.
- And so on.

Now, the problem asks for the "possible relations" between x and z. This implies that the relation between x and z might not be unique, and there could be multiple possible relations.

Actually, let me draw some diagrams to ensure I'm reasoning correctly. I'll use the centers of the regions for this (but the reasoning will be similar for other approaches).

Suppose the center of z is at (0, 0).

Scenario 1:
- The center of y is at (0, 1) (directly North of z).
- The center of x is at (1, 1) (directly East of y).
In this case, x is Northeast of z.

Scenario 2:
- The center of y is at (1, 1) (to the Northeast of z).
- The center of x is at (2, 1) (directly East of y).
In this case, x is still to the Northeast of z.

Scenario 3:
- The center of y is at (-1, 1) (to the Northwest of z).
- The center of x is at (0, 1) (directly East of y).
In this case, x is directly North of z.

Scenario 4:
- The center of y is at (-2, 1) (to the Northwest of z).
- The center of x is at (-1, 1) (directly East of y).
In this case, x is to the Northwest of z.

Wait, I've been switching between two interpretations of "East" and "North", which is causing my confusion. Let me clarify.

The cardinal directions are:
1. North (N): Directly upward from a reference point.
2. Northeast (NE): Diagonally upward and to the right from a reference point.
3. East (E): Directly to the right from a reference point.
4. Southeast (SE): Diagonally downward and to the right from a reference point.
5. South (S): Directly downward from a reference point.
6. Southwest (SW): Diagonally downward and to the left from a reference point.
7. West (W): Directly to the left from a reference point.
8. Northwest (NW): Diagonally upward and to the left from a reference point.

For points, these directions are straightforward. For example, point A is East of point B if A is directly to the right of B.

For regions, it's a bit more complex. We could define it using the center of the region, the entire region, or some other metric. I think the problem intends us to use the center of the region.

OK, actually I need to think about this in terms of geometric constraints and the possible positions.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

Assuming we use the centers of the regions for the cardinal directions, we can represent these constraints as:
- The center of x is directly to the right of the center of y (East).
- The center of y is directly above the center of z (North).

Using a coordinate system with the center of z at (0, 0):
- The center of y is at (0, b) for some b > 0.
- The center of x is at (c, b) for some c > 0.

Now, where is the center of x relative to the center of z? It's at (c, b) where c > 0 and b > 0. This corresponds to the Northeast direction.

So, the relationship between region x and region z is Northeast.

Actually, wait, I was too strict in my interpretation of "East" and "North".

In cardinal direction calculus, "East" doesn't necessarily mean "directly to the right with no vertical offset." It means "the x-coordinate is greater." Similarly, "North" means "the y-coordinate is greater." With this interpretation, there's more flexibility in the possible positions.

Let me revisit the problem with this wider interpretation.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

With the revised interpretation:
- The center of x has a larger x-coordinate than the center of y (East).
- The center of y has a larger y-coordinate than the center of z (North).

Using a coordinate system with the center of z at (0, 0):
- The center of y is at (a, b) where b > 0. Here, a can be any value.
- The center of x is at (a+c, b+d) where c > 0. Here, d can be any value.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we need to compare (a+c, b+d) with (0, 0).

Let's go case by case:
1. If a > 0, then a+c > 0 (since c > 0). This means x is to the right of z. If b+d > 0, then x is to the northeast of z. If b+d = 0, then x is directly to the east of z. If b+d < 0, then x is to the southeast of z.
2. If a = 0, then a+c > 0 (since c > 0). Again, x is to the right of z. The same analysis as in case 1 applies.
3. If a < 0, then a+c could be positive, zero, or negative, depending on the relative magnitudes of |a| and c. If a+c > 0, x is to the right of z. If a+c = 0, x is vertically aligned with z. If a+c < 0, x is to the left of z.

Now, considering the constraint b > 0 (since y is North of z) and the fact that d can be any value, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- Northeast: If a+c > 0 and b+d > 0.
- East: If a+c > 0 and b+d = 0.
- Southeast: If a+c > 0 and b+d < 0.
- North: If a+c = 0 and b+d > 0.
- South: If a+c = 0 and b+d < 0.
- Northwest: If a+c < 0 and b+d > 0.
- West: If a+c < 0 and b+d = 0.
- Southwest: If a+c < 0 and b+d < 0.

But wait, from the given constraints, are all these possibilities truly valid? Let's double-check.

For a+c to be zero, we need a = -c. Since c > 0, this means a < 0. For a+c to be negative, we need a < -c, which also means a < 0. So, a would need to be negative in these cases.

For b+d to be zero, we need d = -b. Since b > 0, this means d < 0. For b+d to be negative, we need d < -b, which also means d < 0. So, d would need to be negative in these cases.

These values are possible, as the constraints don't place direct restrictions on a or d. So, all the eight cardinal directions are possible.

OK, actually, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the problem statement and interpret it as simply as possible. I think it's about cardinal direction calculus where "East" means "to the right of" and "North" means "above", without being overly strict. However, it's also likely talking about cardinal direction relations for regions, so I should think in terms of regions rather than just points. Also, the problem asks for the possible relationships, which means there might be multiple answers.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

I'll interpret this as: The entire region x is to the right of region y, and the entire region y is above region z.

What are the possible relations between x and z? 

Let's place region z at the origin of our coordinate system.

If the entire region y is above region z, then y's coordinates might be (ranging from northwest to northeast): (-a, b), (0, b), (a, b) for some a, b > 0.

If the entire region x is to the right of region y, then x's coordinates might be (ranging from southeast to northeast): (-a+c, b-d), (-a+c, b), (-a+c, b+d), (c, b-d), (c, b), (c, b+d), (a+c, b-d), (a+c, b), (a+c, b+d) for some c, d > 0.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z by comparing x's coordinates with (0, 0).

For x to be to the right of z, we need -a+c > 0, or c > 0, or a+c > 0. This is possible for all values of a and c where c > 0.

For x to be above z, we need b-d > 0, or b > 0, or b+d > 0. This is possible for all values of b and d where b > d (if d > 0) or b > 0 (if d <= 0).

For x to be to the left of z, we need -a+c < 0, which means c < a. This is possible if a is positive and a > c.

For x to be below z, we need b-d < 0, which means d > b. This is possible if d is positive and d > b.

So, x could be:
- Northeast of z: If x is both to the right of and above z.
- East of z: If x is to the right of z and at the same level as z.
- Southeast of z: If x is to the right of z and below z.
- North of z: If x is above z and at the same longitude as z.
- South of z: If x is below z and at the same longitude as z.
- Northwest of z: If x is to the left of z and above z.
- West of z: If x is to the left of z and at the same level as z.
- Southwest of z: If x is to the left of z and below z.

So, all eight cardinal directions seem possible.

Alright, I think I've been approaching this problem in an overly complex manner. Let me simplify and just focus on the specific constraints and what they imply about the relative positioning of the regions.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

What are the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z?

We know that y is North of z, which means y is above z, possibly to the left, directly above, or to the right. And x is East of y, which means x is to the right of y, possibly above, at the same level, or below.

Let's consider various scenarios:

1. If y is directly above z, and x is directly to the right of y, then x is to the Northeast of z.
2. If y is to the Northeast of z, and x is directly to the right of y, then x is still to the Northeast of z.
3. If y is to the Northwest of z, and x is directly to the right of y, then x could be:
   - To the North of z if x and z are vertically aligned.
   - To the Northeast of z if x is to the right of z.
   - To the Northwest of z if x is to the left of z.

These are the three possible relationships: Northeast, North, and Northwest.

Actually, I think that's the right answer. I was overthinking, and didn't carefully interpret the directions "East" and "North".

Let me verify with simple geometric reasoning.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

This means:
- The entire region x is to the right of region y.
- The entire region y is above region z.

Now, region x is to the right of region y, and region y is above region z. Where can region x be relative to region z?

1. If region y is directly above region z, then region x is to the Northeast of region z.
2. If region y is to the Northeast of region z, then region x is even further to the Northeast of region z.
3. If region y is to the Northwest of region z:
   - If region x is far enough to the right to be directly above region z, then region x is to the North of region z.
   - If region x is not that far to the right, then region x is to the Northwest of region z.
   - If region x is far enough to the right to be to the right of region z, then region x is to the Northeast of region z.

So, the possible relationships between region x and region z are: Northeast, North, and Northwest.

I think that's the right answer, considering the common interpretation of "East" and "North" as cardinal direction relations. The three possible relationships are: Northeast, North, and Northwest.

Actually, one slight variation that could be possible. In spatial calculus, the term "East" can have different meanings depending on the context. It could mean "completely to the right of", or it could allow for overlap in the y-direction. Similarly, "North" could mean "completely above", or it could allow for overlap in the x-direction. The second case gives more flexibility in the relative positioning.

However, for the purpose of this problem, I'll assume the standard, strict interpretations, giving the three possible relationships: Northeast, North, and Northwest.

Alright, I'll restate the problem just to make sure I'm understanding the constraints correctly:

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

What are the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z?

The fact that y is North of z means that every point in y has a higher y-coordinate than every point in z. The fact that x is East of y means that every point in x has a higher x-coordinate than every point in y.

The question asks for the "possible" relations, implying that there might be multiple possibilities, not just one unique relation.

To determine the possible relations, we need to consider different relative positions of the regions. 

Here's the key insight: If y is entirely to the North of z (i.e., all points in y have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z), and x is entirely to the East of y (i.e., all points in x have a higher x-coordinate than all points in y), then all points in x have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z. So, x is definitely North of z in terms of the y-coordinate.

But for the x-coordinate, the relationship between x and z depends on the relative positions of y and z in the x-dimension. If y is to the East of z, then x is definitely to the East of z. If y is to the West of z, then x could be to the West, aligned with, or to the East of z, depending on how far East x is of y.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Northwest: If x is to the West of z and to the North of z.
- North: If x is aligned with z in the x-dimension and to the North of z.
- Northeast: If x is to the East of z and to the North of z.

Wait, let me double-check the assertion that "all points in x have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z." We know that all points in y have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z (since y is North of z). But that doesn't necessarily mean all points in x have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z. The constraint "x is East of y" only tells us about the x-coordinate, not the y-coordinate.

However, to be East of y, the x-coordinates of all points in x must be larger than the x-coordinates of all points in y. But this doesn't constrain the y-coordinates.

For x to be East of y, the minimum x-coordinate of x must be greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y. This means they don't overlap in the x-dimension. But there's no constraint on the y-coordinates. The region x could be higher, at the same level, or lower than region y in terms of the y-coordinate.

Let's visualize, Let's say z is at the origin (0, 0) and has a certain extent in both x and y directions. Suppose y is entirely to the North of z, which means its y-coordinates are all greater than those of z. The x-coordinates of y could be to the left of, aligned with, or to the right of z.

Now, let's say x is entirely to the East of y, which means its x-coordinates are all greater than those of y. The y-coordinates of x could be above, at the same level, or below y.

Combining these, the region x could be:
- Northeast of z: If x is to the right of and above z.
- East of z: If x is to the right of and at the same level as z.
- Southeast of z: If x is to the right of and below z.
- North of z: If x is aligned with z in the x-dimension and above z.
- South of z: If x is aligned with z in the x-dimension and below z.
- Northwest of z: If x is to the left of z and above z.
- West of z: If x is to the left of z and at the same level as z.
- Southwest of z: If x is to the left of z and below z.

That gives all eight cardinal directions.

But wait, I'm still missing some constraints. If y is entirely to the North of z and x is entirely to the East of y, what's the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z?

Let's define the y-coordinate ranges:
- z: [z_min_y, z_max_y]
- y: [y_min_y, y_max_y], where y_min_y > z_max_y (since y is North of z)
- x: [x_min_y, x_max_y]

The constraint "x is East of y" doesn't place any restriction on the relationship between x's y-coordinates and z's y-coordinates.

So, x_min_y can be less than, equal to, or greater than z_max_y. This means x could be above, at the same level, or below z in terms of the y-coordinate.

Likewise, there's no constraint on the relationship between x's x-coordinates and z's x-coordinates, except through their relationship with y.

Let's define the x-coordinate ranges:
- z: [z_min_x, z_max_x]
- y: [y_min_x, y_max_x]
- x: [x_min_x, x_max_x], where x_min_x > y_max_x (since x is East of y)

The relationship between z_max_x and y_min_x can be anything. So, y could be to the left of, aligned with, or to the right of z in terms of the x-coordinate.

And given x_min_x > y_max_x, if y_min_x > z_max_x (i.e., y is to the right of z), then x is definitely to the right of z. But if y_max_x < z_min_x (i.e., y is to the left of z), then x could be to the left of, aligned with, or to the right of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are all eight: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Hmm, it doesn't sound right to me that all eight directions are possible. Let me start over and try to set up this problem carefully. I'm going to use reasoning about constraints on the coordinates.

Let's denote the coordinates of any point in region r as (r_x, r_y).

The given constraints are:
1. Region x is East of region y: For all points in x and all points in y, x_x > y_x.
2. Region y is North of region z: For all points in y and all points in z, y_y > z_y.

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z, which means we need to find the possible relationships between x_x and z_x, and between x_y and z_y.

From constraint 2, we know that y_y > z_y, but we don't have a direct relationship between x_y and z_y. However, the fact that x is East of y (constraint 1) doesn't constrain the y-coordinates. So, x_y could be less than, equal to, or greater than z_y.

From constraint 1, we know that x_x > y_x, but we don't have a direct relationship between x_x and z_x. However, from the fact that y is North of z (constraint 2), we know that y_x could be less than, equal to, or greater than z_x, since the North relation only constrains the y-coordinates.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. If y_x > z_x (y is to the right of z in the x-dimension), then x_x > y_x > z_x. So, x is to the right of z.
2. If y_x = z_x (y is aligned with z in the x-dimension), then x_x > y_x = z_x. So, x is to the right of z.
3. If y_x < z_x (y is to the left of z in the x-dimension), then x_x > y_x. But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x_x and z_x. x_x could be less than, equal to, or greater than z_x, depending on the exact values.

So, in terms of the x-coordinates, x could be to the left of, aligned with, or to the right of z.

Similarly, for the y-coordinates, x could be below, at the same level, or above z.

Combining these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be any of the eight directions, or even the bounding box relationship (if x overlaps with z).

Wait, that doesn't make sense. "x is East of y" means x is to the right of y, which means all points in x have a higher x-coordinate than all points in y. And "y is North of z" means y is above z, which means all points in y have a higher y-coordinate than all points in z. These are strict constraints, not loose interpretations.

Let me think through this carefully. We have:
- For all points in x and all points in y, x_x > y_x (x is East of y).
- For all points in y and all points in z, y_y > z_y (y is North of z).

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

For the x-coordinates:
- We know x_x > y_x.
- The relationship between y_x and z_x is unconstrained, since the North direction only constrains the y-coordinates.
- So, y_x could be greater than, equal to, or less than z_x.
- If y_x > z_x, then x_x > y_x > z_x, which means x is to the right of z.
- If y_x = z_x, then x_x > y_x = z_x, which also means x is to the right of z.
- If y_x < z_x, then the relationship between x_x and z_x is unclear. x_x could be greater than, equal to, or less than z_x, depending on the exact values.

For the y-coordinates:
- We know y_y > z_y.
- The relationship between x_y and y_y is unconstrained, since the East direction only constrains the x-coordinates.
- So, x_y could be greater than, equal to, or less than y_y.
- If x_y > y_y, then x_y > y_y > z_y, which means x is above z.
- If x_y = y_y, then x_y = y_y > z_y, which also means x is above z.
- If x_y < y_y, then the relationship between x_y and z_y is unclear. x_y could be greater than, equal to, or less than z_y, depending on the exact values.

Combining these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Northeast: If x is to the right of and above z.
- East: If x is to the right of and at the same level as z.
- Southeast: If x is to the right of and below z.
- North: If x is aligned with z in the x-dimension and above z.
- South: If x is aligned with z in the x-dimension and below z.
- Northwest: If x is to the left of z and above z.
- West: If x is to the left of z and at the same level as z.
- Southwest: If x is to the left of z and below z.
- Bounding Box: If x overlaps with z.

Actually, that's not right. If x and z overlap, they can't have a cardinal direction relation, so I'm not sure where I got "Bounding Box" from.

OK, I realize what I want to do. I need to find which of the eight cardinal direction relations can possibly hold between regions x and z, given the constraints.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

We want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z. I'll again define that the possible cardinal direction relations are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Given the constraint "y is North of z," we know that every point in y has a higher y-coordinate than every point in z. Given the constraint "x is East of y," we know that every point in x has a higher x-coordinate than every point in y.

Let me reason through the possibilities step by step.

For the y-coordinates:
- Given y_y > z_y, and the relationship between x_y and y_y is unconstrained.
- If x_y > y_y, then x_y > y_y > z_y, which means x is above z.
- If x_y = y_y, then x_y = y_y > z_y, which also means x is above z.
- If x_y < y_y, we need to compare x_y with z_y. If x_y > z_y, then x is still above z. If x_y = z_y, then x is at the same level as z. If x_y < z_y, then x is below z.

For the x-coordinates:
- Given x_x > y_x, and the relationship between y_x and z_x is unconstrained.
- If y_x > z_x, then x_x > y_x > z_x, which means x is to the right of z.
- If y_x = z_x, then x_x > y_x = z_x, which also means x is to the right of z.
- If y_x < z_x, we need to compare x_x with z_x. If x_x > z_x, then x is to the right of z. If x_x = z_x, then x is aligned with z in the x-dimension. If x_x < z_x,
