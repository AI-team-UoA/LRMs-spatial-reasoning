PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's use $N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B$ to denote the cardinal direction relations North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box, respectively.

We're given that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, and $y$ is $S$ of $z$. We need to find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$.

Let's use the cardinal direction calculus to reason about this. First, we need to understand what it means for region $x$ to be $NE$ of region $y$. It means that $x$ is to the north and east of $y$. Similarly, $y$ is to the south of $z$ means that $y$ is to the south of $z$.

To visualize this, we can think about the relative positions of the regions. If $y$ is to the south of $z$, then $z$ is to the north of $y$. And if $x$ is to the northeast of $y$, then $x$ is to the north and east of $y$.

So we have: 
- $z$ is to the north of $y$
- $x$ is to the north and east of $y$

Now, to find the relation between $x$ and $z$, we need to consider their relative positions. 

Given that both $x$ and $z$ are to the north of $y$, their north-south relationship is unclear. $x$ could be to the north of $z$, to the south of $z$, or at the same latitude as $z$.

However, we know that $x$ is to the east of $y$. Since we don't have any information about the east-west relationship between $y$ and $z$, we can't determine the east-west relationship between $x$ and $z$ either. $x$ could be to the east of $z$, to the west of $z$, or at the same longitude as $z$.

Let's think about the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ based on the given information:

1. If $x$ is to the north of $z$ and to the east of $z$, then $x$ is $NE$ of $z$.
2. If $x$ is to the north of $z$ and at the same longitude as $z$, then $x$ is $N$ of $z$.
3. If $x$ is to the north of $z$ and to the west of $z$, then $x$ is $NW$ of $z$.
4. If $x$ is at the same latitude as $z$ and to the east of $z$, then $x$ is $E$ of $z$.
5. If $x$ is at the same latitude and longitude as $z$, then $x$ is equal to $z$ (or could be considered as $B$ if $z$ is contained within $x$).
6. If $x$ is at the same latitude as $z$ and to the west of $z$, then $x$ is $W$ of $z$.
7. If $x$ is to the south of $z$ and to the east of $z$, then $x$ is $SE$ of $z$.
8. If $x$ is to the south of $z$ and at the same longitude as $z$, then $x$ is $S$ of $z$.
9. If $x$ is to the south of $z$ and to the west of $z$, then $x$ is $SW$ of $z$.

But wait, there's a problem with this analysis. I've been considering all possibilities without taking into account the specific relationship between $x$ and $y$, and between $y$ and $z$. Let me reconsider.

We know that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, which means $x$ is to the north and east of $y$. We also know that $y$ is $S$ of $z$, which means $y$ is to the south of $z$, or equivalently, $z$ is to the north of $y$.

Let's use a coordinate system to reason about this. We can place $y$ at the origin (0, 0). Then, since $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, we have $x$ in the quadrant with positive x and positive y coordinates. And since $z$ is to the north of $y$, we have $z$ in the half-plane with positive y coordinates.

But the east-west relationship between $z$ and $y$ is not specified. $z$ could be to the east of $y$, to the west of $y$, or at the same longitude as $y$.

Now, to determine the relationship between $x$ and $z$, we need to consider their relative positions.

1. If $z$ is to the north and west of $y$, then it's possible for $x$ to be $NE$ of $z$, $E$ of $z$, or $SE$ of $z$, depending on the exact positions of $x$ and $z$.
2. If $z$ is directly to the north of $y$, then $x$ is $E$ of $z$.
3. If $z$ is to the north and east of $y$, then $x$ could be $E$ of $z$, $SE$ of $z$, or $S$ of $z$, again depending on the exact positions.

Wait, I realize I made a mistake in my reasoning again. Let me approach this problem differently.

Let's consider a spatial reference system where the directions North, South, East, and West are represented as the positive y-axis, negative y-axis, positive x-axis, and negative x-axis, respectively. Let's suppose $y$ is at the origin (0, 0).

Given that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, we have $x$ somewhere in the first quadrant (positive x, positive y). Let's say $x$ is at the point $(a, b)$ where $a > 0$ and $b > 0$.

Given that $y$ is $S$ of $z$, we have $z$ somewhere in the upper half-plane (any x, positive y). Let's say $z$ is at the point $(c, d)$ where $d > 0$ (no constraint on $c$).

Now, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $z$, which depends on the relative values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.

To determine the cardinal direction of $x$ relative to $z$, we need to compare the coordinates of $x$ and $z$:
- If $a > c$ and $b > d$, then $x$ is $NE$ of $z$.
- If $a = c$ and $b > d$, then $x$ is $N$ of $z$.
- If $a < c$ and $b > d$, then $x$ is $NW$ of $z$.
- If $a > c$ and $b = d$, then $x$ is $E$ of $z$.
- If $a = c$ and $b = d$, then $x$ is at the same location as $z$.
- If $a < c$ and $b = d$, then $x$ is $W$ of $z$.
- If $a > c$ and $b < d$, then $x$ is $SE$ of $z$.
- If $a = c$ and $b < d$, then $x$ is $S$ of $z$.
- If $a < c$ and $b < d$, then $x$ is $SW$ of $z$.

We know that $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ (since $x$ is $NE$ of $y$), and $d > 0$ (since $z$ is $N$ of $y$). But we don't have any constraint on $c$, and we don't have any direct relationship between $a$ and $c$, or between $b$ and $d$.

However, we can use the constraints we do have to eliminate some possibilities:

Given that $a > 0$ and there's no constraint on $c$, it's possible for $a$ to be greater than, equal to, or less than $c$. Similarly, given that $b > 0$ and $d > 0$, it's possible for $b$ to be greater than, equal to, or less than $d$.

So, without any additional information, $x$ could be in any of the nine possible relations with $z$: $N$, $NE$, $E$, $SE$, $S$, $SW$, $W$, $NW$, or at the same location as $z$.

Actually, that can't be right. Let me reconsider the problem with a clearer spatial model.

We have three regions: $x$, $y$, and $z$. We know that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, and $y$ is $S$ of $z$. We need to find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$.

Let's represent the position of a region by the coordinates of its centroid. If region $a$ is at position $(a_x, a_y)$ and region $b$ is at position $(b_x, b_y)$, then the cardinal direction of $a$ relative to $b$ is determined by the relative values of $a_x$ and $b_x$, and $a_y$ and $b_y$.

For example, if $a_x > b_x$ and $a_y > b_y$, then $a$ is $NE$ of $b$.

Given that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, we have $x_x > y_x$ and $x_y > y_y$.

Given that $y$ is $S$ of $z$, we have $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$.

Now, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $z$, which depends on the relative values of $x_x$, $x_y$, $z_x$, and $z_y$.

From the given constraints, we have:
- $x_x > y_x$ (from $x$ is $NE$ of $y$)
- $x_y > y_y$ (from $x$ is $NE$ of $y$)
- $y_y < z_y$ (from $y$ is $S$ of $z$)
- $y_x = z_x$ (from $y$ is $S$ of $z$)

From these, we can derive:
- $x_x > z_x$ (since $x_x > y_x$ and $y_x = z_x$)

But we can't determine the relationship between $x_y$ and $z_y$ from the given constraints. We only know that $x_y > y_y$ and $y_y < z_y$, but we can't deduce whether $x_y > z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y < z_y$.

If $x_y > z_y$, then $x$ is $NE$ of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$).
If $x_y = z_y$, then $x$ is $E$ of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$).
If $x_y < z_y$, then $x$ is $SE$ of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$).

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are $NE$, $E$, or $SE$.

Actually, I've been thinking about this wrong.  The problem is that I've been assuming that a cardinal direction relation like $S$ means that $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$. But that's not correct.

In cardinal direction calculus, the relation $S$ means that the region is in the South (i.e., below) the reference region, not necessarily directly below it. Similarly, $NE$ means the region is in the Northeast (i.e., above and to the right) of the reference region.

Let's use a different approach. We can divide the space around a region into nine tiles based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the region: $NW$, $N$, $NE$, $W$, $B$ (for Bounding Box, representing the MBR itself), $E$, $SW$, $S$, and $SE$.

Given that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, we have $x$ in the $NE$ tile of $y$.
Given that $y$ is $S$ of $z$, we have $y$ in the $S$ tile of $z$.

Now, to find the relationship between $x$ and $z$, we need to consider the relative positions of the tiles.

If $y$ is in the $S$ tile of $z$, then $z$ is in the $N$ tile of $y$. The $NE$ tile of $y$ could overlap with various tiles of $z$, depending on the exact positions and sizes of the regions.

I think we need to be more precise in how we're thinking about this problem. Let's use a different approach.

Actually, I think I have been making things too complicated. This is a question about the composition of cardinal direction relations.

We are given that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, and $y$ is $S$ of $z$. We want to find the composition of these relations to determine the relationship between $x$ and $z$.

Let's denote the composition of relations $R_1$ and $R_2$ as $R_1 \circ R_2$. Then, we're looking for $NE \circ S$.

We need to find all possible cardinal direction relations $R$ such that if $x$ is $R$ of $z$, then there exists a region $y$ such that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$ and $y$ is $S$ of $z$.

Actually, on a second thought, I'm going to simplify even further. I'm going to use some diagrams to help us reason through the problem.

Let's consider a scenario where we have three regions: $x$, $y$, and $z$. We're told that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$ and $y$ is $S$ of $z$.

If $y$ is $S$ of $z$, then $y$ is to the south of $z$. If we consider a coordinate system where north corresponds to the positive y-axis and east corresponds to the positive x-axis, then $y$ has a smaller y-coordinate than $z$. But the x-coordinates of $y$ and $z$ could be in any relation to each other. So, $y$ could be directly to the south of $z$ (same x-coordinate), or it could be to the southwest or southeast of $z$.

Now, if $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, then $x$ is to the northeast of $y$. In our coordinate system, this means that $x$ has a larger x-coordinate and a larger y-coordinate than $y$.

To find the relation between $x$ and $z$, we need to compare their coordinates. We know that $x$ has a larger x-coordinate than $y$, but we don't know how the x-coordinates of $y$ and $z$ relate to each other. Similarly, we know that $x$ has a larger y-coordinate than $y$, and $y$ has a smaller y-coordinate than $z$, but we don't know how the y-coordinates of $x$ and $z$ relate to each other.

Let's consider the three cases for the x-coordinates of $y$ and $z$:

1. If the x-coordinate of $y$ is less than the x-coordinate of $z$, then the x-coordinate of $x$ could be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinate of $z$.
2. If the x-coordinate of $y$ is equal to the x-coordinate of $z$, then the x-coordinate of $x$ is greater than the x-coordinate of $z$.
3. If the x-coordinate of $y$ is greater than the x-coordinate of $z$, then the x-coordinate of $x$ is greater than the x-coordinate of $z$.

For the y-coordinates, we know that the y-coordinate of $y$ is less than the y-coordinate of $z$, and the y-coordinate of $x$ is greater than the y-coordinate of $y$. But we don't know how the y-coordinates of $x$ and $z$ relate to each other.

Let's denote the x-coordinate of region $r$ as $r_x$ and the y-coordinate as $r_y$.

We have:
- $x_x > y_x$ (from $x$ is $NE$ of $y$)
- $x_y > y_y$ (from $x$ is $NE$ of $y$)
- $y_y < z_y$ (from $y$ is $S$ of $z$)

For the x-coordinates, we have three cases:
1. $y_x < z_x$
2. $y_x = z_x$
3. $y_x > z_x$

For the y-coordinates, we know that $y_y < z_y$, but we don't know how $x_y$ and $z_y$ relate to each other.
We have three cases:
1. $x_y < z_y$
2. $x_y = z_y$
3. $x_y > z_y$

Combining the cases for x-coordinates and y-coordinates, we have nine possibilities for the relation between $x$ and $z$:

1. $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$: $x$ is $SW$ of $z$.
2. $x_x = z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$: $x$ is $S$ of $z$.
3. $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$: $x$ is $SE$ of $z$.
4. $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$: $x$ is $W$ of $z$.
5. $x_x = z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$: $x$ is at the same location as $z$.
6. $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$: $x$ is $E$ of $z$.
7. $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$: $x$ is $NW$ of $z$.
8. $x_x = z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$: $x$ is $N$ of $z$.
9. $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$: $x$ is $NE$ of $z$.

But we need to check which of these are actually possible given the constraints:
- $x_x > y_x$ (from $x$ is $NE$ of $y$)
- $x_y > y_y$ (from $x$ is $NE$ of $y$)
- $y_y < z_y$ (from $y$ is $S$ of $z$)

Case 1: $y_x < z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$.
We know that $x_x > y_x$ and $y_x < z_x$, but we can't determine whether $x_x < z_x$, $x_x = z_x$, or $x_x > z_x$. And we know that $x_y > y_y$ and $y_y < z_y$, but again, we can't determine whether $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.
So, case 1 is possible.

Hmm, this is still getting complicated, and I worry that I'm being too verbose and not being precise.

Actually, I'm going to try once more with a more direct approach.

We have three regions: $x$, $y$, and $z$. We know that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, and $y$ is $S$ of $z$. We need to find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$.

Here, I'll use the nine-tile representation for cardinal directions. For a region $a$ and a reference region $b$, the cardinal direction of $a$ relative to $b$ is determined by the tile of $b$ that contains the centroid of $a$.

Given that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, the centroid of $x$ is in the $NE$ tile of $y$.
Given that $y$ is $S$ of $z$, the centroid of $y$ is in the $S$ tile of $z$.

Let's use a coordinate system where the centroid of $y$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$. Then the centroid of $x$ is in the first quadrant (positive x, positive y), and the centroid of $z$ is in the upper half-plane (any x, positive y).

If we denote the coordinates of the centroid of region $r$ as $(r_x, r_y)$, then we have:
- $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$ (from $x$ is $NE$ of $y$)
- $z_y > 0$ (from $y$ is $S$ of $z$)

But we don't have any constraint on $z_x$, and we don't have any direct relationship between $x_y$ and $z_y$, or between $x_x$ and $z_x$.

Let's consider the different possibilities for the relation between $x$ and $z$, based on the relative values of $x_x$ and $z_x$, and $x_y$ and $z_y$:

1. If $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$, then $x$ is $NE$ of $z$.
2. If $x_x = z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$, then $x$ is $N$ of $z$.
3. If $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$, then $x$ is $NW$ of $z$.
4. If $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$, then $x$ is $E$ of $z$.
5. If $x_x = z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$, then $x$ is at the same location as $z$.
6. If $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$, then $x$ is $W$ of $z$.
7. If $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$, then $x$ is $SE$ of $z$.
8. If $x_x = z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$, then $x$ is $S$ of $z$.
9. If $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$, then $x$ is $SW$ of $z$.

Given the constraints $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$ and $z_y > 0$, all of these cases are possible, depending on the values of $z_x$ and the relative values of $x_y$ and $z_y$.

Wait, actually I have a better way of analyzing this problem by using a concrete example.

Let's consider specific positions for the regions:
- Let's say $y$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$.
- Since $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, let's say $x$ is at $(2, 2)$.
- Since $y$ is $S$ of $z$, let's say $z$ is at $(0, 3)$.

In this example, we can compute the relationship between $x$ and $z$:
- $x_x = 2 > 0 = z_x$, so $x$ is to the east of $z$.
- $x_y = 2 < 3 = z_y$, so $x$ is to the south of $z$.

Therefore, $x$ is $SE$ of $z$.

But we can choose different positions for the regions that satisfy the given constraints. For example:
- Let $y$ be at the origin $(0, 0)$.
- Let $x$ be at $(2, 2)$ (still $NE$ of $y$).
- Let $z$ be at $(3, 1)$ (still $y$ is $S$ of $z$).

In this example, the relationship between $x$ and $z$ is:
- $x_x = 2 < 3 = z_x$, so $x$ is to the west of $z$.
- $x_y = 2 > 1 = z_y$, so $x$ is to the north of $z$.

Therefore, $x$ is $NW$ of $z$.

Actually, let's define our coordinate system so that region $y$ is at the origin, region $z$ is at $(z_x, z_y)$, and region $x$ is at $(x_x, x_y)$.

Since region $x$ is $NE$ of $y$, we have $x_x > 0$ and $x_y > 0$.

Since $y$ is $S$ of $z$, we have $0 < z_y$ (the y-coordinate of $y$ is less than the y-coordinate of $z$). We don't have any constraint on $z_x$.

Now, to determine the relationship between $x$ and $z$, we need to compare their coordinates:
- For the x-coordinates, we need to compare $x_x$ and $z_x$. Since $x_x > 0$, but we don't have any constraint on $z_x$, we can have $x_x < z_x$, $x_x = z_x$, or $x_x > z_x$.
- For the y-coordinates, we need to compare $x_y$ and $z_y$. We know that $x_y > 0$ and $z_y > 0$, but we don't have any direct relationship between $x_y$ and $z_y$. So, we can have $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.

Combining these, we have nine possible relationships between $x$ and $z$, corresponding to the nine cardinal directions.

But wait, as I was just thinking, we're told that region $y$ is South of region $z$. Since South is a specific direction, it means that $y$ and $z$ have the same x-coordinate, but $y$ has a smaller y-coordinate. So, in our coordinate system, we have $z_x = 0$ and $z_y > 0$.

Now, to determine the relationship between $x$ and $z$, we need to compare their coordinates:
- For the x-coordinates, we compare $x_x$ and $z_x$. Since $x_x > 0$ and $z_x = 0$, we have $x_x > z_x$.
- For the y-coordinates, we compare $x_y$ and $z_y$. We know that $x_y > 0$ and $z_y > 0$, but we don't have any direct relationship between $x_y$ and $z_y$. So, we can have $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.

Combining these, we have three possible relationships between $x$ and $z$:
1. If $x_y < z_y$, then $x$ is $SE$ of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$).
2. If $x_y = z_y$, then $x$ is $E$ of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$).
3. If $x_y > z_y$, then $x$ is $NE$ of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$).

Actually, the problem is that I think I'm using a different cardinal direction calculus than the one that is intended. So let me think about this more carefully. In the standard cardinal direction calculus, the relations North, South, East, and West do not necessarily mean "directly north", "directly south", etc. Instead, they refer to half-planes. For example, "North" means "above", "South" means "below", "East" means "to the right", and "West" means "to the left". And when we have a relation like "Northeast", it means "above and to the right".

But actually I think I've been using the right model. The issue is that I was thinking South must mean "directly south", but it can also mean any point in the southern half-plane.

Let's define the cardinal directions in terms of half-planes:
- $N(y, z)$ if and only if $y_y > z_y$
- $S(y, z)$ if and only if $y_y < z_y$
- $E(y, z)$ if and only if $y_x > z_x$
- $W(y, z)$ if and only if $y_x < z_x$
- $NE(y, z)$ if and only if $y_y > z_y$ and $y_x > z_x$
- $NW(y, z)$ if and only if $y_y > z_y$ and $y_x < z_x$
- $SE(y, z)$ if and only if $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x > z_x$
- $SW(y, z)$ if and only if $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x < z_x$
- $B(y, z)$ if and only if $y_y = z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$

Given that $NE(x, y)$, we have $x_y > y_y$ and $x_x > y_x$.
Given that $S(y, z)$, we have $y_y < z_y$.

Now, to determine the relationship between $x$ and $z$, we need to compare their coordinates:
- For the y-coordinates, we have $x_y > y_y$ and $y_y < z_y$. If $y_y$ is much less than $z_y$, then $x_y$ could be less than $z_y$ (i.e., $x_y < z_y$), equal to $z_y$ (i.e., $x_y = z_y$), or greater than $z_y$ (i.e., $x_y > z_y$). So, in terms of the north-south relationship, $x$ could be to the south of $z$, at the same latitude as $z$, or to the north of $z$.
- For the x-coordinates, we have $x_x > y_x$. But we don't have any relation between $y_x$ and $z_x$. So, in terms of the east-west relationship, $x$ could be to the west of $z$ (if $y_x$ is much less than $z_x$ and $x_x < z_x$), at the same longitude as $z$ (if $x_x = z_x$), or to the east of $z$ (if $x_x > z_x$).

Combining these, $x$ could be in any of the nine cardinal directions relative to $z$: $N$, $NE$, $E$, $SE$, $S$, $SW$, $W$, $NW$, or at the same location as $z$.

Actually, let me be more careful about the relation $S(y, z)$. It's natural to interpret that as "below". So actually $S(y, z)$ means $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$. That is, $y$ is directly below $z$, not just in the southern half-plane.

With this interpretation, we have:
- $NE(x, y)$ means $x_y > y_y$ and $x_x > y_x$
- $S(y, z)$ means $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$

From these, we can derive:
- $x_y > y_y$ (from $NE(x, y)$)
- $x_x > y_x$ (from $NE(x, y)$)
- $y_y < z_y$ (from $S(y, z)$)
- $y_x = z_x$ (from $S(y, z)$)

From $x_x > y_x$ and $y_x = z_x$, we get $x_x > z_x$.

From $x_y > y_y$ and $y_y < z_y$, we can't determine the relationship between $x_y$ and $z_y$ without knowing the exact values. It could be $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. If $x_y < z_y$, then $x$ is $SE$ of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$).
2. If $x_y = z_y$, then $x$ is $E$ of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$).
3. If $x_y > z_y$, then $x$ is $NE$ of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$).

Given the nature of the problem, I believe this interpretation is the most appropriate. So I'll say the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are: $NE$, $E$, and $SE$.

Actually now I'm going to try to find a reference for the cardinal direction calculus to make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly.

Ok, in the Cardinal Direction Calculus, a direction relation is defined as one of the 9 relations: $N$, $NE$, $E$, $SE$, $S$, $SW$, $W$, $NW$, and $B$ (for "bounding box", which means "same location").

Given that $x$ is $NE$ of $y$ and $y$ is $S$ of $z$, we need to find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$.

Let's define the cardinal directions in terms of the positions of the centroids of the regions:
- $N(a, b)$: The centroid of $a$ is to the north of the centroid of $b$.
- $S(a, b)$: The centroid of $a$ is to the south of the centroid of $b$.
- $E(a, b)$: The centroid of $a$ is to the east of the centroid of $b$.
- $W(a, b)$: The centroid of $a$ is to the west of the centroid of $b$.
- $NE(a, b)$: The centroid of $a$ is to the northeast of the centroid of $b$.
- $SE(a, b)$: The centroid of $a$ is to the southeast of the centroid of $b$.
- $SW(a, b)$: The centroid of $a$ is to the southwest of the centroid of $b$.
- $NW(a, b)$: The centroid of $a$ is to the northwest of the centroid of $b$.
- $B(a, b)$: The centroids of $a$ and $b$ are at the same location.

Let's use a coordinate system where the centroid of region $y$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$. The cardinal directions can then be defined in terms of the coordinates of the centroids:
- $N(a, b)$: $a_y > b_y$ and $a_x = b_x$
- $S(a, b)$: $a_y < b_y$ and $a_x = b_x$
- $E(a, b)$: $a_x > b_x$ and $a_y = b_y$
- $W(a, b)$: $a_x < b_x$ and $a_y = b_y$
- $NE(a, b)$: $a_y > b_y$ and $a_x > b_x$
- $SE(a, b)$: $a_y < b_y$ and $a_x > b_x$
- $SW(a, b)$: $a_y < b_y$ and $a_x < b_x$
- $NW(a, b)$: $a_y > b_y$ and $a_x < b_x$
- $B(a, b)$: $a_y = b_y$ and $a_x = b_x$

Given that $NE(x, y)$, we have $x_y > 0$ and $x_x > 0$.
Given that $S(y, z)$, we have $0 < z_y$ and $0 = z_x$.

From these, we can derive:
- $x_x > 0 = z_x$, so $x_x > z_x$.
- We don't know the relationship between $x_y$ and $z_y$ without knowing the exact values. It could be $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. If $x_y < z_y$, then $SE(x, z)$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$).
2. If $x_y = z_y$, then $E(x, z)$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$).
3. If $x_y > z_y$, then $NE(x, z)$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$).

Actually, I'm not sure if I'm using the right cardinal direction calculus, because I haven't found a canonical definition. Let me try once more with a fresh interpretation.

In the cardinal direction calculus, directions are often represented using a "projection-based" method. Let's define the cardinal directions in terms of the centroids of the regions. We can use the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions to determine the cardinal directions.

Given region $b$, we can extend the sides of its MBR to divide the plane into 9 regions (or tiles): $NW$, $N$, $NE$, $W$, $B$ (the MBR itself), $E$, $SW$, $S$, and $SE$.

For another region $a$, we determine its cardinal direction relative to $b$ based on which of these 9 regions contains the centroid of $a$.

If $NE(x, y)$, then the centroid of $x$ is in the $NE$ tile of $y$.
If $S(y, z)$, then the centroid of $y$ is in the $S$ tile of $z$.

To find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$, we need to consider where the centroid of $x$ could be relative to the tiles of $z$.

Let's denote the centroid of region $r$ as $(r_x, r_y)$.

If the centroid of $y$ is in the $S$ tile of $z$, then $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$.
If the centroid of $x$ is in the $NE$ tile of $y$, then $x_y > y_y$ and $x_x > y_x$.

From these, we can deduce:
- $x_x > y_x = z_x$, so $x_x > z_x$.
- $x_y > y_y$ and $y_y < z_y$, but we can't determine the relationship between $x_y$ and $z_y$ without knowing the exact values. It could be $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. If $x_y < z_y$, then $x$ is in the $SE$ tile of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$).
2. If $x_y = z_y$, then $x$ is in the $E$ tile of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$).
3. If $x_y > z_y$, then $x$ is in the $NE$ tile of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$).

Therefore, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are $NE$, $E$, and $SE$.

To double check: Let's try a concrete example. Let's say $y$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$, $z$ is at $(0, 2)$ (so $y$ is $S$ of $z$), and $x$ is at $(1, 1)$ (so $x$ is $NE$ of $y$).

Now, to determine the relationship between $x$ and $z$, we compare their coordinates:
- $x_x = 1 > 0 = z_x$, so $x$ is to the east of $z$.
- $x_y = 1 < 2 = z_y$, so $x$ is to the south of $z$.

Therefore, $x$ is $SE$ of $z$.

Let's try another example. Let's say $y$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$, $z$ is at $(0, 1)$ (so $y$ is $S$ of $z$), and $x$ is at $(1, 2)$ (so $x$ is $NE$ of $y$).

Now, to determine the relationship between $x$ and $z$, we compare their coordinates:
- $x_x = 1 > 0 = z_x$, so $x$ is to the east of $z$.
- $x_y = 2 > 1 = z_y$, so $x$ is to the north of $z$.

Therefore, $x$ is $NE$ of $z$.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are $NE$, $E$, and $SE$, as I had determined.

Actually, I'm still a bit unsure about the interpretation of the cardinal directions in the question, so let me try to understand it more clearly.

In the cardinal direction calculus, we can represent directions using a "projection-based" method. For a region $b$, we can extend the sides of its minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) to divide the plane into 9 tiles: $NW$, $N$, $NE$, $W$, $B$ (the MBR itself), $E$, $SW$, $S$, and $SE$.

For another region $a$, we determine its cardinal direction relative to $b$ based on which of these 9 tiles contains the centroid of $a$.

For the question, let's use this interpretation:
- $NE(x, y)$ means the centroid of $x$ is in the $NE$ tile of $y$.
- $S(y, z)$ means the centroid of $y$ is in the $S$ tile of $z$.

Let's denote the centroid of region $r$ as $(r_x, r_y)$.

If the centroid of $y$ is in the $S$ tile of $z$, then $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$.
If the centroid of $x$ is in the $NE$ tile of $y$, then $x_y > y_y$ and $x_x > y_x$.

From these, we can deduce:
- $x_x > y_x = z_x$, so $x_x > z_x$.
- $x_y > y_y$ and $y_y < z_y$, but we can't determine the relationship between $x_y$ and $z_y$ without knowing the exact values. It could be $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. If $x_y < z_y$, then $x$ is in the $SE$ tile of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$).
2. If $x_y = z_y$, then $x$ is in the $E$ tile of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$).
3. If $x_y > z_y$, then $x$ is in the $NE$ tile of $z$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$).

Therefore, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are $NE$, $E$, and $SE$.

Is the above interpretation of the cardinal directions in the question correct? If not, I would need a clearer definition to proceed.

Actually, I think the above interpretation is correct. In cardinal direction calculus, the relation $S(a, b)$ means that the centroid of $a$ is in the $S$ tile of $b$, which means $a_y < b_y$ and $a_x = b_x$.

So the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are $NE$, $E$, and $SE$.

Actually, let's check once more. In the cardinal direction calculus, when we say $S(a, b)$, it means that the centroid of $a$ is in the $S$ (South) tile of $b$. The South tile of $b$ is defined as the region where the y-coordinate is less than the y-coordinate of the centroid of $b$, but the x-coordinate is within the x-range of the MBR of $b$.

If the centroid of $b$ is at $(b_x, b_y)$, then the $S$ tile of $b$ includes all points $(x, y)$ such that $y < b_y$ and $b_x - w_b/2 \leq x \leq b_x + w_b/2$, where $w_b$ is the width of the MBR of $b$.

But for simplicity, let's assume that the MBRs of the regions are single points (i.e., the regions are points). Then, $S(a, b)$ means that the centroid of $a$ is directly below the centroid of $b$, i.e., $a_y < b_y$ and $a_x = b_x$.

The question is, given that $NE(x, y)$ (i.e., $x_y > y_y$ and $x_x > y_x$) and $S(y, z)$ (i.e., $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$), what is the relation between $x$ and $z$?

We can deduce:
- $x_x > y_x = z_x$, so $x_x > z_x$.
- $x_y > y_y$ and $y_y < z_y$, but without knowing the exact values, we can't determine whether $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. If $x_y < z_y$, then $SE(x, z)$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$).
2. If $x_y = z_y$, then $E(x, z)$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$).
3. If $x_y > z_y$, then $NE(x, z)$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$).

Therefore, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are $NE$, $E$, and $SE$.

I believe this is the correct interpretation and the correct answer.

Actually, there's one thing I haven't considered. Let's interpret cardinal direction relations in the context of region connection calculus (RCC). In this context, a relation like $S(a, b)$ would mean that every point in region $a$ is to the south of every point in region $b$. That would indeed constrain the y-coordinates, but it might not constrain the x-coordinates as I have been assuming.

Let me re-examine the question with this interpretation.

OK so we have that every point in region $y$ is to the south of every point in region $z$. This constrains the y-coordinates such that the maximum y-coordinate of $y$ is less than the minimum y-coordinate of $z$. 

And we have that every point in region $x$ is to the northeast of every point in region $y$. This constrains the coordinates such that the minimum x-coordinate of $x$ is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of $y$, and the minimum y-coordinate of $x$ is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of $y$.

Let's denote the minimum and maximum coordinates of region $r$ as $(r_{x_{\min}}, r_{y_{\min}})$ and $(r_{x_{\max}}, r_{y_{\max}})$, respectively.

From $S(y, z)$, we have $y_{y_{\max}} < z_{y_{\min}}$.
From $NE(x, y)$, we have $x_{x_{\min}} > y_{x_{\max}}$ and $x_{y_{\min}} > y_{y_{\max}}$.

From these, we can deduce $x_{y_{\min}} > y_{y_{\max}} > z_{y_{\min}}$. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider.

From $S(y, z)$, we have $y_{y_{\max}} < z_{y_{\min}}$.
From $NE(x, y)$, we have $x_{x_{\min}} > y_{x_{\max}}$ and $x_{y_{\min}} > y_{y_{\max}}$.

From these, we can deduce $x_{y_{\min}} > y_{y_{\max}}$ and $y_{y_{\max}} < z_{y_{\min}}$, so $x_{y_{\min}} < z_{y_{\min}}$. But that can't be right either.

Let me reconsider the interpretation of cardinal directions in the context of the question.

I think I'm overthinking this. Let's use the standard interpretation of cardinal directions.

If $S(y, z)$, then the centroid of $y$ is to the south of the centroid of $z$, i.e., $y_y < z_y$. The x-coordinates are not constrained, so we can have $y_x < z_x$, $y_x = z_x$, or $y_x > z_x$.

If $NE(x, y)$, then the centroid of $x$ is to the northeast of the centroid of $y$, i.e., $x_y > y_y$ and $x_x > y_x$.

Given these, what's the relationship between $x$ and $z$?

We know that $x_y > y_y$ and $y_y < z_y$, but we can't determine the relationship between $x_y$ and $z_y$ without knowing the exact values. It could be $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.

Similarly, we know that $x_x > y_x$, but we don't know the relationship between $y_x$ and $z_x$. So, we can't determine the relationship between $x_x$ and $z_x$ without knowing the exact values. It could be $x_x < z_x$, $x_x = z_x$, or $x_x > z_x$.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are all nine cardinal directions: $N$, $NE$, $E$, $SE$, $S$, $SW$, $W$, $NW$, and $B$.

Actually, we can eliminate $B$ because if $x_y = z_y$ and $x_x = z_x$, then $x$ and $z$ are at the same location. But we know that $x$ is distinct from $z$, so this case is not possible.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are: $N$, $NE$, $E$, $SE$, $S$, $SW$, $W$, and $NW$.

Hmm I think I got confused because there can be different interpretations of cardinal directions. Let me try to be clear in my interpretation.

Cardinal directions in the context of the question refer to the direction of the centroid of one region relative to the centroid of another region. For instance, $NE(x, y)$ means that the centroid of $x$ is to the northeast of the centroid of $y$, i.e., $x_y > y_y$ and $x_x > y_x$.

But what does $S(y, z)$ mean exactly? Does it mean that the centroid of $y$ is directly to the south of the centroid of $z$ (i.e., $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$), or does it just mean that the centroid of $y$ is to the south of the centroid of $z$ (i.e., $y_y < z_y$, with no constraint on the x-coordinates)?

I think the intended interpretation is the former, which means $S(y, z)$ implies $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$.

Wait, let me look back at the question to see if there's any hint of the intended interpretation.

OK the problem says "Let  Northeast and  South be cardinal direction relations". This suggests that the cardinal direction relations are these very specific directions, rather than half-planes. So I think the right interpretation is that $S(y, z)$ means the centroid of $y$ is directly to the south of the centroid of $z$, i.e., $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$.

With this interpretation, if $NE(x, y)$ (i.e., $x_y > y_y$ and $x_x > y_x$) and $S(y, z)$ (i.e., $y_y < z_y$ and $y_x = z_x$), then what is the relationship between $x$ and $z$?

We can deduce:
- $x_x > y_x = z_x$, so $x_x > z_x$.
- $x_y > y_y$ and $y_y < z_y$, but without knowing the exact values, we can't determine whether $x_y < z_y$, $x_y = z_y$, or $x_y > z_y$.

So, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
1. If $x_y < z_y$, then $SE(x, z)$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$).
2. If $x_y = z_y$, then $E(x, z)$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$).
3. If $x_y > z_y$, then $NE(x, z)$ (since $x_x > z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$).

Therefore, the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are $NE$, $E$, and $SE$.

To verify, let's try a few concrete examples:

Example 1: Let $y$ be at the origin $(0, 0)$, $z$ be at $(0, 2)$ (so $y$ is directly south of $z$), and $x$ be at $(1, 1)$ (so $x$ is northeast of $y$).
Relationship between $x$ and $z$: $x_x = 1 > 0 = z_x$ and $x_y = 1 < 2 = z_y$, so $x$ is southeast of $z$.

Example 2: Let $y$ be at the origin $(0, 0)$, $z$ be at $(0, 1)$ (so $y$ is directly south of $z$), and $x$ be at $(1, 1)$ (so $x$ is northeast of $y$).
Relationship between $x$ and $z$: $x_x = 1 > 0 = z_x$ and $x_y = 1 = 1 = z_y$, so $x$ is east of $z$.

Example 3: Let $y$ be at the origin $(0, 0)$, $z$ be at $(0, 1)$ (so $y$ is directly south of $z$), and $x$ be at $(1, 2)$ (so $x$ is northeast of $y$).
Relationship between $x$ and $z$: $x_x = 1 > 0 = z_x$ and $x_y = 2 > 1 = z_y$, so $x$ is northeast of $z$.

These examples confirm our analysis: the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are $NE$, $E$, and $SE$.

So, the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$ could be: Northeast, East, or Southeast.

Actually, let me try to just double check this by trying the question myself.

Let's go back to the problem statement. We are given that the region $x$ is Northeast of region $y$, and region $y$ is South of region $z$. We need to find the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$.

Northeast means "above and to the right". South means "below". If $y$ is below $z$, then $z$ is above $y$. If $x$ is above and to the right of $y$, then $x$ is above and to the right of a region that is below $z$. So $x$ is to the right of $z$ for sure (i.e., East), but it could be above, below, or at the same height as $z$. 

So the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
- Northeast (above and to the right)
- East (to the right, same height)
- Southeast (below and to the right)

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

Northeast
East
Southeast

These are the only possible relations because:
- We know x is Northeast of y (x is above and to the right of y)
- We know y is South of z (y is directly below z)

When we combine these facts:
- x must be to the East of z (since x is to the right of y, and y is directly below z)
- The vertical relationship between x and z is variable:
  * x could be above z (Northeast)
  * x could be at the same level as z (East)
  * x could be below z (Southeast)
