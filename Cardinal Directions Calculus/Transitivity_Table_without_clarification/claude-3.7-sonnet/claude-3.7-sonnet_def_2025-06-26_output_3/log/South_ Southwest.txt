PROMPT: Let  South and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step.

We know that:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

We need to determine what cardinal direction relation(s) could hold between region x and region z.

Let's use a coordinate system where North is the positive y-direction and East is the positive x-direction. In this system:
- South means moving in the negative y-direction
- East means moving in the positive x-direction
- West means moving in the negative x-direction
- Southwest means moving in both the negative y-direction and negative x-direction

If region x is South of region y, that means x has the same x-coordinate as y, but a lower y-coordinate.
If region y is Southwest of region z, that means y has a lower x-coordinate than z and a lower y-coordinate than z.

Let's say:
- z is at position (0, 0)
- y is at position (-a, -b) for some positive a and b, since y is Southwest of z
- x is at position (-a, -b-c) for some positive c, since x is South of y

So z is at (0, 0), y is at (-a, -b), and x is at (-a, -b-c).

Now, what is the relationship from x to z?
From x to z, we move:
- In the x-direction: from -a to 0, which is +a (moving East)
- In the y-direction: from -b-c to 0, which is +b+c (moving North)

So we're moving Northeast from x to z, which means z is Northeast of x.

Alternatively, we can say x is Southwest of z.

Let me double-check this with a different approach.

If we go from z to y, we move Southwest.
If we go from y to x, we move South.

So to go from z to x, we first move Southwest and then South. This combined movement is generally in the South-Southwest direction. So x would be South-Southwest of z, or equivalently, z would be North-Northeast of x.

Actually, "South-Southwest" isn't one of our cardinal directions. Let me be more precise.

From z to y:
- Move West and South

From y to x:
- Move South only

So from z to x:
- Move West and South (from z to y)
- Move South (from y to x)

This is a move West and South, which corresponds to a direction somewhere between South and Southwest.

Given our cardinal direction options, x could be South of z or Southwest of z, depending on the specific values of a, b, and c.

Actually, let me be even more precise. Let's use actual coordinates:

- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, -1) (Southwest of z)
- If x is South of y, then x is at (-1, -2)

From x to z, we move:
- In the x-direction: from -1 to 0, which is +1 (moving East)
- In the y-direction: from -2 to 0, which is +2 (moving North)

So z is Northeast of x, or equivalently, x is Southwest of z.

Let's try another example:

- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-3, -1) (Southwest of z, but more West than South)
- If x is South of y, then x is at (-3, -2)

From x to z, we move:
- In the x-direction: from -3 to 0, which is +3 (moving East)
- In the y-direction: from -2 to 0, which is +2 (moving North)

Again, z is Northeast of x, or x is Southwest of z.

Let's try one more example:

- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, -3) (Southwest of z, but more South than West)
- If x is South of y, then x is at (-1, -4)

From x to z, we move:
- In the x-direction: from -1 to 0, which is +1 (moving East)
- In the y-direction: from -4 to 0, which is +4 (moving North)

Once again, z is Northeast of x, or x is Southwest of z.

It seems like the relationship is consistently that x is Southwest of z, or z is Northeast of x.

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. Let me refactor.

We know that:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

The way I've been thinking about it, it's as if y is the origin, and we're positioning x and z relative to y. But that's not correct. I should place z at the origin, and determine where x and y are.

Let's correctly solve this.

If z is at the origin (0, 0):
- If y is Southwest of z, then y could be at position (-a, -b) for some positive a and b.
- If x is South of y, then x is at position (-a, -b-c) for some positive c.

Now, what is the relationship from x to z?
From x to z, we move:
- In the x-direction: from -a to 0, which is +a (moving East)
- In the y-direction: from -b-c to 0, which is +b+c (moving North)

So we're moving Northeast from x to z, which means z is Northeast of x, or equivalently, x is Southwest of z.

So the relation between x and z is that x is Southwest of z.

Actually, let's double-check with a few specific examples.

Example 1:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, -1) (Southwest of z)
- x is at (-1, -2) (South of y)

From x to z:
- x-direction: -1 to 0 = +1 (East)
- y-direction: -2 to 0 = +2 (North)
So z is Northeast of x, or x is Southwest of z.

Example 2:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-3, -1) (Southwest of z, more West than South)
- x is at (-3, -2) (South of y)

From x to z:
- x-direction: -3 to 0 = +3 (East)
- y-direction: -2 to 0 = +2 (North)
So z is Northeast of x, or x is Southwest of z.

Example 3:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, -3) (Southwest of z, more South than West)
- x is at (-1, -4) (South of y)

From x to z:
- x-direction: -1 to 0 = +1 (East)
- y-direction: -4 to 0 = +4 (North)
So z is Northeast of x, or x is Southwest of z.

Wait, I'm being too restrictive in my examples. Let me consider some edge cases.

Edge Case 1: y is directly West of z (no South component).
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, 0) (West of z)
- x is at (-1, -1) (South of y)

From x to z:
- x-direction: -1 to 0 = +1 (East)
- y-direction: -1 to 0 = +1 (North)
So z is Northeast of x, or x is Southwest of z.

Edge Case 2: y is directly South of z (no West component).
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (0, -1) (South of z)
- x is at (0, -2) (South of y)

From x to z:
- x-direction: 0 to 0 = 0 (no East/West movement)
- y-direction: -2 to 0 = +2 (North)
So z is North of x, or x is South of z.

Actually, I got confused. I made a mistake in edge case 1. If y is directly West of z, then y is not Southwest of z. Let me start fresh.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

Let's use a coordinate system:
- z is at (0, 0)
- Since y is Southwest of z, y is at (-a, -b) for some positive a and b.
- Since x is South of y, x is at (-a, -b-c) for some positive c.

Now, to determine the relation from x to z, we calculate the movement from x to z:
- x-direction: -a to 0 = +a (East)
- y-direction: -b-c to 0 = +b+c (North)

This means z is Northeast of x, or equivalently, x is Southwest of z.

Let's verify with a special case where the West component of the Southwest relation is minimal:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-0.001, -1) (Almost directly South of z, but with a tiny West component)
- x is at (-0.001, -2) (South of y)

From x to z:
- x-direction: -0.001 to 0 = +0.001 (very slightly East)
- y-direction: -2 to 0 = +2 (North)

Here, z is still Northeast of x, but it's very close to being directly North of x.

Actually, I made a mistake in saying "Since y is Southwest of z, y is at (-a, -b) for some positive a and b." The mistake is that we are given a cardinal relation "Southwest", which means South AND West, not a continuous direction. So we need to consider the different interpretations of what it means for y to be "Southwest" of z.

In a cardinal direction framework, if y is Southwest of z, it means y is both South of z and West of z. This means y is in the region that is both South of z and West of z.

Let's reconsider. Let's set up z at (0, 0).

For y to be Southwest of z, y could be anywhere in the region where x < 0 and y < 0. For simplicity, let's say y is at (-a, -b) for some positive a and b.

Now, for x to be South of y, x should be at the same East-West position as y, but further South. So x is at (-a, -b-c) for some positive c.

From x to z, we move:
- East by distance a
- North by distance b+c

This means z is Northeast of x, or x is Southwest of z.

But wait, I need to reconsider my interpretation. In cardinal direction relations, "South" doesn't just mean "directly South," but rather "in the South region." Similarly, "Southwest" means "in the Southwest region."

Alright, I'll use a different approach. Let's think of the space as divided into 8 regions around a central point, corresponding to the 8 cardinal directions. For a point p, let's denote the region that is, say, South of p, as S(p).

Given:
- x is in S(y), meaning x is South of y.
- y is in SW(z), meaning y is Southwest of z.

Now, we want to determine what region(s) x could be in with respect to z, i.e., what are the possible regions for x in relation to z?

If y is in SW(z), then y is both South of z and West of z. This means y is in S(z) and y is in W(z).

Now, if x is in S(y), then x is South of y. Given that y is already South of z, x is even further South of z. So, x is definitely in S(z).

But what about the East-West relation of x with respect to z?
y is West of z. And if x is South of y, then x has the same East-West position as y. So, x is also West of z.

So, x is both South of z and West of z, which means x is Southwest of z.

Hmm, let's be careful here. In the strict cardinal direction relations, to say that x is South of y doesn't necessarily mean they have the same East-West position. It means x is in the South region of y.

Actually, let's go back to the coordinate system interpretation, but be careful about the interpretation of cardinal direction relations.

For cardinal direction relations, we often use a grid division, where the space around a region is divided into 9 areas: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the region itself.

For a pair of regions, if one is in the "South" of the other, it means it's entirely within the South area of the other (not necessarily directly below).

With this in mind, given that x is South of y, x is entirely within the South area of y, which typically means x's northernmost points are still South of y's southernmost points.

And, if y is Southwest of z, y is entirely within the Southwest area of z.

Let's visualize this: (using 'z', 'y', and 'x' to represent the three regions)

```
    N
  W z E
    S
     \
      \
       SW
        \
         \
          y
          |
          |
          S
          |
          |
          x
```

If y is in the Southwest area of z, and x is in the South area of y, then x is either in the South or Southwest area of z, depending on the specific locations of x, y, and z.

Let's consider possible configurations.

Case 1: y is directly Southwest of z (at a 45-degree angle), and x is directly South of y.
In this case, x would be Southwest of z.

Case 2: y is mostly South and slightly West of z, and x is directly South of y.
In this case, x would be South or Southwest of z, depending on how far South y is compared to how far West it is.

Case 3: y is mostly West and slightly South of z, and x is directly South of y.
In this case, x would be Southwest of z.

Hmm, this gets tricky. Let's try to visualize it with some rough coordinates.

z is at (0, 0).
y, being Southwest of z, is at some coordinate (-a, -b) where a and b are positive. This means y is a units to the West of z and b units to the South of z.

Now, if x is South of y, x's coordinate would be (-a, -b-c) for some positive c. This means x is c units to the South of y.

From this coordinate, we can determine the cardinal direction from x to z:
- x needs to move a units East to align with z's East-West position.
- x needs to move (b+c) units North to align with z's North-South position.

If a and (b+c) are equal, then z is Northeast of x, or x is Southwest of z.
If a < (b+c), then z is more North than East of x, but still in the Northeast quadrant.
If a > (b+c), then z is more East than North of x, but still in the Northeast quadrant.

Wait, I'm thinking about it too narrowly. In all of these cases, z is Northeast of x and x is Southwest of z.

So, the relation between x and z is that x is Southwest of z.

Ahh, okay let me try reasoning about this differently.

Consider that we can pick arbitrary positions for the regions, as long as they satisfy the given relations.

Given:
- x is South of y: This means x is directly South of y, or x is in the region that is considered South of y.
- y is Southwest of z: This means y is both South of z and West of z.

Let's consider various configurations:

Configuration 1: Imagine placing z, then placing y Southwest of z, and then placing x South of y.
In this configuration, x would be Southwest of z. Why? Because x is South of y, and y is already Southwest of z, so x is even further South than y, and on the same West position as y (or at least, in the West region with respect to z).

Are there any other possible configurations? Let's think...

I think the issue is with how strictly we interpret "South" and "Southwest." Let's consider the case where:
- y is strictly Southwest of z, meaning it's exactly in the Southwest direction.
- x is strictly South of y, meaning it's exactly in the South direction.

In such a case, x would be in a South-Southwest direction from z, which is somewhere between South and Southwest. But when categorizing into the 8 cardinal directions, it would fall into the Southwest category.

Let's verify:
- z is at (0, 0).
- y is at (-1, -1) (strictly Southwest of z).
- x is at (-1, -2) (strictly South of y).

To go from x to z, we move 1 unit East and 2 units North. This is Northeast, but with a stronger North component. Correspondingly, from z to x, we move Southwest, but with a stronger South component.

But wait, I'm overthinking this. We're simply asked for the cardinal direction relation between x and z based on the cardinal direction relations we know. This should be one of the 8 standard directions.

Given that:
- x is South of y
- y is Southwest of z

If we compose these relations, we get that x is South of (something that is Southwest of z). This composition places x in the Southwest region with respect to z. So, x is Southwest of z.

Actually, let me reconsider my approach once more. 

Let's set up a simple coordinate system with z at the origin, (0, 0).

For y to be Southwest of z, y must be in the 3rd quadrant, where both coordinates are negative. So, y could be at position (-a, -b) for some positive values a and b.

Now, for x to be South of y, x should be at position (-a, -b-c) for some positive value c.

So, we have:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (-a, -b)
- x at (-a, -b-c)

To determine the cardinal direction relation from x to z, we find the relative position of z from x. That is, we calculate the vector from x to z: (0-(-a), 0-(-b-c)) = (a, b+c).

This vector points a units East and (b+c) units North. This places z in the Northeast region with respect to x, which means x is in the Southwest region with respect to z.

Thus, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is that x is Southwest of z.

But this makes me pause. If we're only considering the standard 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW), then the answer is "Southwest" (of z).

However, if we're allowing for more nuanced directions or considering a continuous spectrum, then the precise direction would depend on the values of a, b, and c. For instance, if a is very small compared to (b+c), then x would be almost due South of z (with a slight westward bias). Conversely, if (b+c) is very small compared to a, then x would be almost due West of z (with a slight southward bias).

Given that the question asks for possible relations, and we're considering cardinal directions, the answer is that x is Southwest of z.

Actually, there's something important that I think I've been overlooking. The cardinal direction relations involve regions, not points. Regions have a spatial extent, and when we say one region is South of another, it doesn't mean a point in the first region is directly South of a point in the second.

Let's clarify the meaning of cardinal direction relations between regions. If region A is South of region B, it means the entire region A is South of the entire region B. Similarly, if region A is Southwest of region B, it means the entire region A is both South and West of the entire region B.

Now, given the conditions:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

The entire region y is both South and West of the entire region z. The entire region x is South of the entire region y.

Since x is South of y, and y is already South of z, it follows that x is also South of z. Additionally, since y is West of z, and x is South of y, x is also in the West region with respect to z. This places x in the Southwest region with respect to z.

So, the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is that x is Southwest of z.

Mmm, let me try a more methodical approach. Let's treat cardinal directions as strict regions rather than vectors or angles.

Consider the 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) as regions, as shown in the following diagram (assuming z is at the center):

```
    NW  |  N  |  NE
--------|-----|--------
    W   |  z  |  E
--------|-----|--------
    SW  |  S  |  SE
```

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

If y is in the SW region of z, then y is in both the S region and the W region of z. If x is in the S region of y, then x is in the S region of the S region of z, which is still in the S region of z. Also, if y is in the W region of z, and x is in the S region of y, then x is still in the W region of z.

So, x is in both the S region and the W region of z, which means x is in the SW region of z.

Thus, the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is that x is Southwest of z.

Hang on. Let me reconsider this. The problem is asking what are the possible relations between region x and region z. The operative word here is "possible", suggesting there might be multiple correct answers.

I'll reason through it using the diagram again. If y is in the SW region of z, and x is in the S region of y, then x is South of the entire region y. But y itself is a region in the SW of z. 

I'm having trouble with this. Let me try something else.

Let's say z is at the origin, (0, 0). The Southwest region relative to z, i.e., SW(z), is the third quadrant, where both x and y coordinates are negative.

If y is in SW(z), then y is in the third quadrant relative to z. This means y has coordinates (-a, -b) for some positive a and b.

Now, if x is South of y, then x is in the region S(y), which means x has coordinates (-a-d, -b-c) for some non-negative d and some positive c (since South means y-coordinate decreases). It can't be directly South if we're dealing with regions, but I'll use d = 0 for simplicity in this analysis. So, x has coordinates (-a, -b-c).

To determine the cardinal direction relation from x to z, we find the relative position of z from x. That is, we calculate the vector from x to z: (0-(-a), 0-(-b-c)) = (a, b+c).

This vector points a units East and (b+c) units North. This places z in the Northeast region with respect to x, which means x is in the Southwest region with respect to z.

So, the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is that x is Southwest of z.

But wait, I'm still considering regions to have a single point representation. 

Let me approach it from a different angle. The definition for cardinal direction relations between regions, like "South", involves considering what's called a "bounding box" or "minimum bounding rectangle" (MBR). A bounding box for a region is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the region and has edges parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given two regions A and B, the cardinal direction relation from A to B is determined by comparing the bounding boxes of A and B. For instance, if the northernmost point of A's bounding box is South of the southernmost point of B's bounding box, then A is South of B. Similarly, for A to be Southwest of B, the northernmost point of A's bounding box should be South of the southernmost point of B's bounding box, AND the easternmost point of A's bounding box should be West of the westernmost point of B's bounding box.

So, if the bounding box of region y is entirely Southwest of the bounding box of region z, and the bounding box of region x is entirely South of the bounding box of region y, then the bounding box of region x is definitely Southwest of the bounding box of region z. This means region x is Southwest of region z.

But again, I'm not thinking of any other alternatives here.

Actually, let's try a simple visualization. Let's say z is a square at the origin. Then, by definition, y is entirely in the Southwest region of z, and x is entirely in the South region of y. This places x entirely in the Southwest region of z, because it's both South of z and West of z.

I think the issue is that I'm overthinking this. The question is asking for the possible relations between region x and region z, and based on the given conditions, the only relation that fits is that region x is Southwest of region z.

So, the answer is that region x is Southwest of region z.

Actually, there's one more way I want to check. 

Let me approach this using a more formal composition of relations. 

In qualitative spatial reasoning with cardinal directions, we often use a composition table to determine the result of compounding two relations. Let's see what the composition of "South" and "Southwest" yields.

If x is South of y, and y is Southwest of z, then we're composing the relations S and SW. This composition is typically defined as S◦SW, where ◦ is the composition operator.

I don't have the exact composition table for cardinal directions, but I'll work it out logically. 

If y is SW of z, then y is both S of z and W of z. So, we have two paths to analyze:

1. x is S of y, and y is S of z. By transitivity, x is S of z.
2. x is S of y, and y is W of z. In this case, x is S of (something W of z), which places x in the SW region relative to z.

Combining these, if x is S of (something S of z and W of z), then x is both S of z and W of z. This means x is SW of z.

So, the composition S◦SW yields SW, which means region x is Southwest of region z.

This confirms our answer: region x is Southwest of region z.

Wait, am I being limiting in my thinking? Let me reconsider.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

I'm concluding that region x is Southwest of region z. But are there any other possible relations?

Let's consider an extreme case: y is almost directly West of z (with a tiny South component), and x is far South of y. In this case, x would be SW of z, but it would be much more South than West. In the context of cardinal directions, we'd still categorize it as SW, even though it's "more South" than a typical SW.

Similarly, if y is almost directly South of z (with a tiny West component), and x is far South of y, then x would be SW of z, but it would be much more South than West.

But regardless, in all of these cases, x is still in the SW region relative to z. The cardinal direction relation doesn't change; it's still SW.

So, the answer remains: region x is Southwest of region z.

Actually let me re-analyze by considering the types of relations between regions. When we talk about cardinal directions between regions, there's a distinction to be made:

1. **Weak Direction Relation**: In this case, there's overlap in one of the coordinates. For instance, if regions A and B have overlapping x-ranges, but A is entirely above B, then A is (weakly) North of B.
2. **Strong Direction Relation**: Both coordinates have a strict order. For instance, if region A is entirely to the northeast of region B (with no overlap in x or y ranges), then A is (strongly) Northeast of B.

In the given problem, if we interpret the relations as strong ones, then:
- Region x is (strongly) South of region y: This means there's no overlap in the y-coordinates, and x is below y. The x-coordinates could potentially overlap.
- Region y is (strongly) Southwest of region z: This means there's no overlap in either the x or y coordinates, and y is to the left and below z.

Given these interpretations, x is definitely South of z (because y is South of z, and x is South of y). And y is West of z. 

Now, the tricky part is determining if x is West of z. Given that y is West of z, and x is South of y, we can't automatically say that x is West of z. It depends on the specific shapes and positions of these regions.

If the westernmost point of x is to the east of the easternmost point of z, then x is not West of z. In such a case, x would be South of z, but not SW of z.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
1. South (if x extends eastward enough to have some part directly South of z)
2. Southwest (if x is entirely to the West of z)

Actually I think I'm overthinking this. I should go for a simple and direct approach. Let me try to think more clear.

Let's set up a coordinate system with the cardinal directions, where North is the positive y-direction and East is the positive x-direction.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

1. If y is Southwest of z, it means y has coordinates to the South and West of z. This places y in the third quadrant relative to z, with coordinates (-a, -b) for some positive a and b.
2. If x is South of y, it means x has coordinates to the South of y, with no East or West bias. This places x at coordinates (-a, -b-c) for some positive c.

To determine the cardinal direction relation from x to z, we compute the vector from x to z: (0-(-a), 0-(-b-c)) = (a, b+c).

This vector points a units East and (b+c) units North. This places z in the Northeast region with respect to x, which means x is in the Southwest region with respect to z.

OK, so the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, let me reconsider the problem. I think the issue is that cardinal direction relations can be ambiguous when we're dealing with regions and not points.

For example, let's consider a case where:
- z is a region around the origin, (0, 0).
- y is a region whose northeasternmost point is at (-1, -1) and extends southwestwards. Clearly, y is entirely in the Southwest region of z.
- x is a region whose northernmost point is at the same y-coordinate as the southernmost point of y, and x extends southwards and possibly eastwards.

In this case, x would be South of y. But the relationship between x and z depends on how far east x extends. If x extends eastwards beyond the westernmost point of z, then x would not be entirely in the West region of z. This means x would not be Southwest of z. Instead, there would be a part of x that's South of z (but not West), making the relationship "South".

On the other hand, if x doesn't extend that far east, then x would be entirely in the Southwest region of z, making the relationship "Southwest".

Actually, wait, let me clarify my understanding of qualitative spatial reasoning.

The RCC8 (Region Connection Calculus) is a formalism for qualitative spatial reasoning with regions. It has 8 basic relations: DC (disconnected), EC (externally connected), PO (partially overlapping), TPP (tangential proper part), NTPP (non-tangential proper part), TPPi (inverse of TPP), NTPPi (inverse of NTPP), and EQ (equal).

Separate from this, there are formalisms for reasoning about cardinal directions. One common approach is the 9-intersection model, which divides the space into 9 regions (8 cardinal directions plus the region itself). Another approach is to use bounding boxes.

If the question is about cardinal directions, and we're using the 9-intersection model, then the relationship between regions x and z can be one of: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box (meaning one region contains the other or they overlap).

Given the problem statement:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

Let's analyze:

1. If y is Southwest of z, it means the entire region y is in the Southwest region of z.
2. If x is South of y, it means the entire region x is in the South region of y.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to consider the relative positions. 

Given that y is entirely in the Southwest region of z, y is both South of z and West of z. Since x is South of y, and y is already South of z, x is even further South of z. So, x is definitely South of z.

But is x West of z? That depends on the relative sizes and exact positions of the regions. If y is very close to the "due West" direction from z, and x is far South of y, then x might not be entirely in the West region of z. In such a case, x would be South of z, but not Southwest.

Hmm, but how likely is it that x could be South of z, but not Southwest? Given that y is Southwest of z, and x is South of y, x is positioned based on y's location, which is already in the Southwest of z. It seems more likely that x would also be in the Southwest of z. But without more specific details, we can't rule out the possibility that x is just South of z.

Actually, I've been a bit too indecisive. Let me return to a strict interpretation of the cardinal direction relations.

From the conditions "Region x is South of region y" and "Region y is Southwest of region z", using the composition of cardinal direction relations, the relation between region x and region z is Southwest. This is because if y is Southwest of z, and x is South of y, then x is Southwest of z.

So, the answer is that region x is Southwest of region z.

Actually I can see why it's confusing. Since we are not told that the cardinals are the only option, we could be asked for every sort of relation, like distances and whatnot. But we are only asked for the cardinal direction relation.

Wait, I'm going to do this problem once more. This time I won't get lost in the weeds.

We are given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

We want to determine the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z. We have cardinal directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

From the constraint "Region y is Southwest of region z", we know that region y is in the Southwest cardinal direction with respect to region z. This means y is both to the south of z and to the west of z. 

From the constraint "Region x is South of region y", we know that region x is in the South cardinal direction with respect to region y. This means x is to the south of y.

Now, let's determine the cardinal direction of x with respect to z.

Since y is to the south of z, and x is to the south of y, it follows that x is even further south of z. So, x is definitely to the south of z.

Since y is to the west of z, and x is to the south of y, x is still to the west of z. So, x is also to the west of z.

If x is both to the south of z and to the west of z, then the cardinal direction of x with respect to z is Southwest.

Therefore, the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

However, let me double-check by considering a geometric perspective. Let's set up a Cartesian coordinate system where the cardinal directions align with the standard orientation (North is the positive y-direction, East is the positive x-direction).

If z is at the origin, (0, 0), and y is Southwest of z, then y has coordinates (-a, -b) for some positive a and b. If x is South of y, then x has coordinates (-a, -b-c) for some positive c.

From these coordinates, we determine that:
- x is c+b units to the south of z.
- x is a units to the west of z.

This confirms that x is Southwest of z.

So, again, the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

Actually, I have overanalyzed this problem and made it more complex than necessary.

Let me approach it from first principles. Cardinal direction relations divide the space around a region into 8 sectors, named after the 8 compass points: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Now, let's consider the conditions:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

When we say "y is Southwest of z," we mean y is in the Southwest sector relative to z. And when we say "x is South of y," we mean x is in the South sector relative to y.

To determine the relation between x and z, we need to trace the path from z to x, going through y:
1. From z to y, the direction is Southwest.
2. From y to x, the direction is South.

The composition of these two directions gives us the direction from z to x, which is still Southwest. This is because if you go Southwest and then South, you're effectively moving in a South-Southwest direction, which in the 8-direction model is still Southwest.

Therefore, the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

Actually, let me try to think again. I think the question is asking for the possible relations between region x and region z. "Possible" suggests that there might be multiple answers, depending on specific configurations that still satisfy the given constraints.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

Let me consider some possible configurations.

Configuration 1: Imagine z as a small square at the origin. y is a square entirely in the Southwest sector of z. x is a square entirely in the South sector of y. In this case, x is entirely in the Southwest sector of z. The relation is Southwest.

Configuration 2: Imagine z as a wide rectangle spanning the x-axis. y is a square in the Southwest sector of z. x is a very wide rectangle in the South sector of y, extending far to the East, so much so that a part of x is directly South of z (and not West of z). In this case, the relation between x and z is not strictly Southwest, but rather a mix of South and Southwest. 

Actually, I think I got caught up in the same issue I've been facing. Let's revisit the definition of cardinal direction relations.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, when we say "region A is South of region B", we typically mean the entire region A is in the South sector of region B. It doesn't mean parts of A are in the South sector of B.

Given this definition, if the entire region y is in the Southwest sector of region z, and the entire region x is in the South sector of region y, then the entire region x is in the Southwest sector of region z. This means the relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

But if I'm thinking of a weaker definition where a region can have parts in different sectors, the problem becomes more complex. Under such a definition, if y is entirely in the Southwest sector of z, and x is entirely in the South sector of y, then x can be in both the South and Southwest sectors of z, depending on the specific shapes and positions of these regions.

I'm overthinking. Let's follow the strict definition of cardinal direction relations: If region A is in direction X with respect to region B, then the entire region A is in that direction. With this, if the entire region y is Southwest of region z, and the entire region x is South of region y, then the entire region x is Southwest of region z.

Therefore, the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

OK, so I decided that the possible relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, let's double-check this with a different approach.

Let's consider 3 points to represent the centers of the 3 regions: point x in region x, point y in region y, and point z in region z.

Given that region x is South of region y, point x is directly South of point y. And given that region y is Southwest of region z, point y is Southwest of point z.

Now, to determine the direction from point x to point z, or equivalently, from point z to point x:
- Going from point z to point y, we move Southwest.
- Going from point y to point x, we move South.

Combining these, going from point z to point x, we first move Southwest and then South. This is still a move in the Southwest direction, just with a stronger South component.

Therefore, the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is Southwest.

That's our answer.

Alright, let's wrap up. I've considered this problem from various angles, and the consistent conclusion is that the cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is Southwest. This comes from tracing the path from z to x, going through y, and combining the Southwest direction from z to y with the South direction from y to x.

The answer is: Southwest.

Actually, one more time. This time I will be very brief.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

Since y is Southwest of z, and x is South of y, x is positioned based on y's location, which is already in the Southwest of z. This places x even further South, and still to the West, relative to z.

In the framework of the 8 cardinal directions, this means x is in the Southwest sector of z. Therefore, region x is Southwest of region z.

The answer is: Southwest.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine what relation(s) could exist between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

Let me analyze this step by step:

If y is Southwest of z, then y is both South of z and West of z.
If x is South of y, then x is even further South than y.

Since y is already West of z, and x is directly South of y (with no East/West movement), x remains in the Western half of the coordinate system relative to z.

Therefore, x is both:
- South of z (because y is South of z, and x is South of y)
- West of z (because y is West of z, and x is South of y with no East/West shift)

When a region is both South and West of another region, it is Southwest of that region.

The answer is: Southwest
