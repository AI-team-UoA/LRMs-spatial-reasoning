PROMPT: Let  South and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let me reason through this problem step by step. 

We have three regions: x, y, and z. We're given that:
- x is South of y
- y is East of z

And we need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Let's think about this in terms of coordinate systems. If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then:
- Since y is East of z, y would be at some position (a, 0) where a > 0
- Since x is South of y, x would be at some position (a, -b) where b > 0

So if z is at (0, 0) and x is at (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0, what is the cardinal direction relation from z to x?

Well, x is to the East and South of z. This means x is in the Southeast direction from z. Alternatively, z is in the Northwest direction from x.

But wait, let me double-check by exploring more specific cases.

Case 1: If y is directly East of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is Southeast of z.

For example, if:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (3, 0) (directly East of z)
- x is at (3, -2) (directly South of y)

Then x is Southeast of z.

Case 2: Let's say y is not directly East of z, but somewhat Northeast of z, and x is directly South of y.

For example, if:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (3, 1) (Northeast of z)
- x is at (3, -1) (directly South of y)

Now, where is x relative to z? x is at (3, -1), which is still Southeast of z.

Case 3: Let's say y is not directly East of z, but somewhat Southeast of z, and x is directly South of y.

For example, if:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (3, -1) (Southeast of z)
- x is at (3, -3) (directly South of y)

Now, where is x relative to z? x is at (3, -3), which is still Southeast of z.

So, it seems like in all these cases, x is Southeast of z.

But actually, I think I need to be more careful here. The cardinal direction relations "East" and "South" in the context of regions might mean different things. 

In the strict sense of cardinal directions, "East" means directly to the east (along the same latitude), and "South" means directly to the south (along the same longitude). 

But in the context of regions, "East" might mean "somewhere to the east", which could include Northeast or Southeast. Similarly, "South" might include Southwest or Southeast.

Let's reconsider:

If y is East of z, it could be at any position where the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z. Similarly, if x is South of y, it could be at any position where the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of y.

Given these, let's explore the possible positions of x relative to z:

Definitely, x can be Southeast of z, as we've already seen.

But could x be directly South of z? Let's see:
- If y is directly East of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is Southeast of z, not directly South.
- If y is Northeast of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is East or Southeast of z, not directly South.
- If y is Southeast of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is Southeast of z, not directly South.

It seems like x cannot be directly South of z in any of these cases.

Could x be Southwest of z? Let's see:
- If y is directly East of z, and x is Southwest of y, then x could be South or Southwest of z.
- If y is Northeast of z, and x is Southwest of y, then x could be South or Southwest of z, or even directly East or Southeast.
- If y is Southeast of z, and x is Southwest of y, then x is still Southeast of z.

Actually, it is possible for x to be Southwest of z in some cases. But this is assuming x can be Southwest of y while still satisfying the condition "x is South of y". If "South" is interpreted strictly, then x would have to be directly below y, which means it couldn't be Southwest of y.

Let's go with the interpretation that "South" means "directly South" and "East" means "directly East". In that case:
- y is directly East of z, meaning y has the same y-coordinate as z but a greater x-coordinate.
- x is directly South of y, meaning x has the same x-coordinate as y but a smaller y-coordinate.

With this interpretation, x is Southeast of z.

But if we allow for a broader interpretation, where "South" and "East" can include diagonal directions, then the possible relations between x and z become more varied.

Actually, let's try a more direct approach. Given the available cardinal direction relations (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box), let's analyze each one to see if it's possible for x to have that relation with z:

1. North: Can x be North of z?
   - y is East of z
   - x is South of y
   No, x cannot be North of z.

2. Northeast: Can x be Northeast of z?
   - y is East of z
   - x is South of y
   It's possible if x is still to the north of z despite being south of y. This can happen if y is far to the northeast of z and x is just slightly south of y.

3. Southeast: Can x be Southeast of z?
   - y is East of z
   - x is South of y
   Yes, this is definitely possible, as we've seen.

4. South: Can x be directly South of z?
   - y is East of z
   - x is South of y
   It's possible if x is directly below z, which can happen if y is southeast of z and x is southwest of y (but still south).

5. East: Can x be directly East of z?
   - y is East of z
   - x is South of y
   It's possible if x is directly to the east of z, which can happen if y is northeast of z and x is directly below y but still east of z.

6. Northwest: Can x be Northwest of z?
   - y is East of z
   - x is South of y
   No, this is not possible. If y is to the east of z and x is to the south of y, x cannot be to the northwest of z.

7. West: Can x be directly West of z?
   - y is East of z
   - x is South of y
   No, this is not possible. If y is to the east of z and x is to the south of y, x cannot be to the west of z.

8. Southwest: Can x be Southwest of z?
   - y is East of z
   - x is South of y
   It's possible if x is to the southwest of z, which can happen if y is just slightly east of z and x is far to the south and west of y.

9. Bounding Box: I'm not entirely sure what this means in the context of cardinal directions, but if it means that x encompasses or is encompassed by z, then it's not directly given by the conditions.

Wait, I think I'm being too permissive here. Let me reconsider the strict definition of cardinal directions.

If "South" means strictly "directly South", then x has the same x-coordinate as y but a smaller y-coordinate. If "East" means strictly "directly East", then y has the same y-coordinate as z but a greater x-coordinate.

Given these, x would have a greater x-coordinate than z (because it's the same as y's, which is greater than z's) and a smaller y-coordinate than z (because it's smaller than y's, which is the same as z's). This places x Southeast of z.

But now I'm confusing myself. Let me simplify and draw out coordinates:

- z: (0, 0)
- y: (a, 0) where a > 0 (directly East of z)
- x: (a, -b) where b > 0 (directly South of y)

In this case, x is Southeast of z.

Now, let's consider a more general case where "East" and "South" don't necessarily mean "directly East" and "directly South":

- z: (0, 0)
- y: could be anywhere in the Northeastern, Eastern, or Southeastern quadrant relative to z
- x: could be anywhere in the Southwestern, Southern, or Southeastern quadrant relative to y

With this broader interpretation, x could be in various positions relative to z. But we can narrow it down by considering that x is to the south of y, and y is to the east of z. This means x is generally in the right and/or bottom part of the coordinate system relative to z.

Actually, the problem statement says "x is South of y and y is East of z", which can be interpreted in the cardinal direction sense. In this case, the relation between x and z could be Southeast.

But if "South" and "East" are interpreted in a more general way, then the relation between x and z could be any of: Southeast, South, East, or Southwest, or even Northeast in some cases.

Actually, I realize that this problem is asking about cardinal directions, which are specific directions on a compass: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest. So I should use the cardinal direction interpretation.

Given that "x is South of y and y is East of z", and interpreting these in the cardinal direction sense, the relation between x and z could be:

1. Southeast: If y is East of z and x is South of y, then x is Southeast of z.
2. South: If y is East of z but very close to being directly East, and x is South of y but very far to the west, then x could be South of z.
3. East: If y is East of z but very far to the north, and x is South of y but still north of z, then x could be East of z.
4. Southwest: This is not possible, since if y is East of z, x cannot be west of z by just being south of y.
5. Northeast: This is not possible for the same reason.

Wait, I'm still confused. Let me try a different approach. In the context of cardinal directions, "South" and "East" are relative terms. 

If x is South of y, it means x is in the direction of South from y. If y is East of z, it means y is in the direction of East from z.

So, from z's perspective, y is to the East. And from y's perspective, x is to the South.

Now, what is the direction of x from z's perspective?

Let's consider some cases:

1. If y is directly East of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is Southeast of z.
2. If y is slightly Northeast of z, and x is directly South of y, then x could be East of z.
3. If y is slightly Southeast of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is Southeast of z.

Now, let's be more precise. Let's say we have a coordinate system where North is the positive y-axis and East is the positive x-axis.

- If y is East of z, then y's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate.
- If x is South of y, then x's y-coordinate is less than y's y-coordinate.

Now, to determine the cardinal direction of x from z, we need to compare their coordinates:

- If x's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate and x's y-coordinate is less than z's y-coordinate, then x is Southeast of z.
- If x's x-coordinate is equal to z's x-coordinate and x's y-coordinate is less than z's y-coordinate, then x is South of z.
- If x's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate and x's y-coordinate is equal to z's y-coordinate, then x is East of z.

Given that y is East of z and x is South of y, we can say that x's x-coordinate is likely greater than z's x-coordinate (because x's x-coordinate is the same as y's, which is greater than z's). And x's y-coordinate is likely less than z's y-coordinate (because x's y-coordinate is less than y's, which is the same as z's).

This would place x in the Southeast direction from z. But this is assuming that "East" and "South" are interpreted as "directly East" and "directly South".

Let's take a step back. The problem involves cardinal direction relations between regions, not just points. Cardinal direction relations between regions are typically defined using a combination of projection, distance, and other factors. 

But at a high level, if region A is South of region B, it means region A is in the southern direction from region B. Similarly, if region B is East of region C, it means region B is in the eastern direction from region C.

So, we know that region x is in the southern direction from region y, and region y is in the eastern direction from region z. What does this tell us about the direction of region x from region z?

Given that y is to the east of z and x is to the south of y, x is generally in the southeastern quadrant relative to z. But depending on the specific positions and sizes of the regions, x could also be:

- South of z (if x extends far enough west)
- East of z (if x extends far enough north)
- Southeast of z (the most general case)

But without more specific information about the positions and sizes of the regions, it's hard to be more precise.

OK, I think I understand the problem now. The problem is asking about the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is South of y and y is East of z.

The possible relations are:
1. Southeast: This is the most general case, as we've discussed.
2. South: This is possible if x is directly below z.
3. East: This is possible if x is directly to the right of z.

But I'm having a hard time seeing how x could be directly South of z, given that y is East of z. If y is directly East of z, then y is to the right of z. If x is directly South of y, then x is below y. So x would be below and to the right of z, which is Southeast, not directly South.

Similarly, I'm having a hard time seeing how x could be directly East of z, given that y is East of z and x is South of y. If x is below y, and y is to the right of z, then x is below and to the right of z, which is Southeast, not directly East.

Actually, wait, I think I'm being too restrictive in my reasoning. Let's try to visualize this in a different way.

Given that "region x is South of region y", it means that all of region x is to the south of all of region y. Similarly, given that "region y is East of region z", it means that all of region y is to the east of all of region z.

With this understanding, where can region x be relative to region z?

Let's think about it step by step:

1. If region y is entirely to the east of region z, then region y is somewhere to the right of region z.

2. If region x is entirely to the south of region y, then region x is somewhere below region y.

Given these, region x is somewhere below and to the right of region z, which is the Southeast direction. But could it be directly South or directly East?

For region x to be directly South of region z, all of region x would need to be directly below all of region z. But since region y is entirely to the east of region z, and region x is entirely to the south of region y, region x is not just below region z but also to the east. So, region x cannot be directly South of region z.

For region x to be directly East of region z, all of region x would need to be directly to the right of all of region z. But since region x is entirely to the south of region y, and region y is entirely to the east of region z, region x is not just to the right of region z but also below. So, region x cannot be directly East of region z.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is Southeast.

Wait, I'm being too restrictive again. I need to rethink this from the definition of cardinal direction relations.

Cardinal directions North, Northeast, East, etc. are defined based on where one region is relative to another. For instance, region A is North of region B if all of region A is in the northern half-plane defined by region B.

Now, let's apply this to our problem:

- Region y is East of region z: This means all of region y is in the eastern half-plane defined by region z.
- Region x is South of region y: This means all of region x is in the southern half-plane defined by region y.

Given these, where can region x be relative to region z?

If all of region y is to the east of region z, and all of region x is to the south of region y, then region x is in the southeastern quadrant relative to region z. But depending on the specific positions of the regions, region x could also be:

- Directly South of region z: This is possible if region x is positioned in such a way that all of it is in the southern half-plane defined by region z, but not all of it is in the eastern half-plane.

- Directly East of region z: This is possible if region x is positioned in such a way that all of it is in the eastern half-plane defined by region z, but not all of it is in the southern half-plane.

- Southeast of region z: This is possible if region x is positioned in such a way that all of it is in both the southern and eastern half-planes defined by region z.

OK, I think I understand the problem now. The problem is asking about the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is South of y and y is East of z. 

Actually, to be more precise about the definitions, I recall from a course in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning that the cardinal direction relations between regions can be defined using the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given two regions A and B, we can determine the cardinal direction relation from B to A by extending the sides of B's MBR to infinity, dividing the plane into 9 regions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Same), and then checking which of these regions contain A. The cardinal direction is determined by the set of regions that contain A. If the intersection of A and B is not empty, there would also be a "Same" relation.

In the context of our problem, we have:

- Region y is East of region z: This means region y is entirely in the eastern region defined by the extended sides of region z's MBR.
- Region x is South of region y: This means region x is entirely in the southern region defined by the extended sides of region y's MBR.

Given these, let's determine the possible cardinal direction relations from region z to region x.

First, let's establish a coordinate system where region z's MBR is centered at the origin (0, 0).

Since region y is East of region z, region y's MBR is entirely to the right of the y-axis.

Since region x is South of region y, region x's MBR is entirely below the x-axis defined by the bottom edge of region y's MBR.

This positions region x in the bottom-right quadrant relative to region z, which corresponds to the Southeast direction. But depending on the specific positions of the regions, region x could also be:

- Directly South of region z: This is possible if region x's MBR is positioned in such a way that it's entirely below the x-axis defined by the bottom edge of region z's MBR, but not entirely to the right of the y-axis defined by the right edge of region z's MBR.

Actually, wait. So we have region z's bounding box, and it's centered at the origin (0, 0). We know that region y is East of region z, meaning that all of region y is to the east (right) of region z's right edge. So all of region y is to the right of region z's bounding box. And we know that region x is South of region y. Let's say the bottom edge of region y is at y = k, for some value k. Then all of region x is below y = k. But if y is to the east of z, then the bottom-left corner of y's bounding box must be to the right of the right edge of z's bounding box. So the bottom-left corner of y's bounding box is at some point (m, k), where m is the x-coordinate of the right edge of z's bounding box. So, all of y is to the right of x = m, and all of x is below y = k. So, all of x is to the right of x = m and below y = k. So all of x is to the southeast of the top-right corner of z's bounding box. And some of x might be directly east of region z (if x is above z's bottom edge), and some of x might be directly south of region z (if x is to the left of z's right edge). But we're being asked about cardinal direction relations for regions. So we're being asked which cardinal directions could describe the relation between regions x and z.

Actually, no, I think I need to brush up on the definition of cardinal direction relations between regions. Let me review this again...

Ah, I think I know what's happening. In the context of cardinal direction relations, there are several formalisms. Let me try again with a more suitable one.

Let's introduce the cone-based (or projection-based) method for determining cardinal direction relations. In this method, we use the centroid of a region as a reference point. From this point, we construct cones (or projections) in each of the 8 cardinal directions. When comparing two regions, we determine which cone(s) from the first region's centroid the second region falls into.

In the context of our problem, we have:

- Region y is East of region z: This means that, from the centroid of region z, region y falls entirely within the cone corresponding to the East direction.
- Region x is South of region y: This means that, from the centroid of region y, region x falls entirely within the cone corresponding to the South direction.

Given these, where can region x be from the centroid of region z?

To answer this, we need to determine which cone(s) from the centroid of region z region x falls into.

If region y is East of region z, then the centroid of region y is in the East direction from the centroid of region z. If region x is South of region y, then the centroid of region x is in the South direction from the centroid of region y.

But actually, I think I am getting confused by all of these different formal definitions. Let me return to the informal understanding of cardinal directions.

In the context of cardinal directions, "North" means up, "East" means right, "South" means down, and "West" means left. "Northeast" means up and right, "Southeast" means down and right, "Southwest" means down and left, and "Northwest" means up and left.

Given that region y is East of region z, it means region y is to the right of region z. Given that region x is South of region y, it means region x is below region y.

So, if region y is to the right of region z, and region x is below region y, then region x is below and to the right of region z, which is the Southeast direction. But this doesn't consider the actual sizes and shapes of the regions. Depending on these, region x could also be:

- South of region z: This is possible if region x is entirely below region z but some parts of region x are not to the right of region z.
- East of region z: This is possible if region x is entirely to the right of region z but some parts of region x are not below region z.
- Southeast of region z: This is possible if region x is entirely below and to the right of region z.

OK, I think it's simpler to reason in terms of half-planes. 

In the context of cardinal direction relations, we can define direction relations using half-planes. For example, region A is North of region B if all of region A is in the northern half-plane defined by the southern boundary of region B.

Given:
- Region y is East of region z: This means all of region y is in the eastern half-plane defined by the eastern boundary of region z.
- Region x is South of region y: This means all of region x is in the southern half-plane defined by the southern boundary of region y.

Where can region x be relative to region z?

If all of region y is to the east of region z, and all of region x is to the south of region y, then region x is in the southeastern quadrant relative to region z. But depending on the specific positions and extents of the regions, region x could also be:

- South of region z: This is possible if all of region x is in the southern half-plane defined by the southern boundary of region z.
- East of region z: This is possible if all of region x is in the eastern half-plane defined by the eastern boundary of region z.
- Southeast of region z: This is possible if all of region x is in both the southern half-plane defined by the southern boundary of region z and the eastern half-plane defined by the eastern boundary of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are South, East, and Southeast.

Wait, let me check if South and East are really possible. 

For region x to be South of region z, all of region x must be in the southern half-plane defined by the southern boundary of region z. Given that region y is East of region z and region x is South of region y, can region x be entirely south of region z?

If region y is entirely to the east of region z, and region x is entirely to the south of region y, then the western boundary of region y is to the east of the eastern boundary of region z. And the northern boundary of region x is to the south of the southern boundary of region y.

This means that region x is not just to the south of region y but is also to the east of region z. So, region x is in the southeastern quadrant relative to region z. This includes the possibility of region x being directly South of region z or directly East of region z, as long as it's also to the east of region z and to the south of region y, respectively.

OK, I need to reflect more on these "half-planes" that I've defined. 

Let's say the southern boundary of region z is given by the line y = s_z. Then, for a region to be South of region z, all of the region must be below the line y = s_z.

Similarly, let's say the eastern boundary of region z is given by the line x = e_z. Then, for a region to be East of region z, all of the region must be to the right of the line x = e_z.

Now, let's define the boundaries for region y. Since region y is East of region z, the western boundary of region y is to the right of the eastern boundary of region z. Let's say the western boundary of region y is given by the line x = w_y, and the southern boundary of region y is given by the line y = s_y. Since region y is East of region z, we have w_y > e_z.

Now, for region x, since it's South of region y, the northern boundary of region x is below the southern boundary of region y. Let's say the northern boundary of region x is given by the line y = n_x. Since region x is South of region y, we have n_x < s_y.

So, where can region x be relative to region z?

For region x to be South of region z, all of region x must be below the line y = s_z. That is, the northern boundary of region x must be below the southern boundary of region z: n_x < s_z. But we only know that n_x < s_y, and we don't have a direct comparison between s_y and s_z. So, region x may or may not be South of region z.

For region x to be East of region z, all of region x must be to the right of the line x = e_z. But we only know that region y is to the right of the line x = e_z, and region x is to the south of region y. Without additional constraints, region x may or may not be East of region z.

For region x to be Southeast of region z, all of region x must be below the line y = s_z and to the right of the line x = e_z. As we've seen, without additional constraints, region x may or may not be Southeast of region z.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's simplify and think about this in a more general way.

Given that region y is East of region z, region y is in the eastern half-plane relative to region z. And given that region x is South of region y, region x is in the southern half-plane relative to region y.

Now, let's determine the possible positions of region x relative to region z.

For simplicity, let's consider a case where all three regions are squares. I think this will help clarify the situation.

Suppose region z is a square with its center at the origin (0, 0). Given that region y is East of region z, let's place region y to the right of region z, say with its center at (3, 0). And given that region x is South of region y, let's place region x below region y, say with its center at (3, -3).

In this configuration, where is region x relative to region z? It's to the right and below region z, which is the Southeast direction.

Now, let's see if we can reposition region x to be directly South of region z while still being South of region y. For region x to be directly South of region z, its center would need to be below region z, say at (0, -3). But then region x would not be South of region y as required. It would be Southwest of region y.

Similarly, can we reposition region x to be directly East of region z? For region x to be directly East of region z, its center would need to be to the right of region z, say at (3, 0). But then region x would not be South of region y as required. It would be at the same level as region y.

Let's try to create more intricate cases by manipulating the regions' shapes.

Suppose region z is a horizontally stretched rectangle, region y is a square to the right of region z, and region x is a square below region y. In this configuration, region x is Southeast of region z.

Now, let's make region z a vertically stretched rectangle. Region y is a square to the right of region z, and region x is a square below region y. In this configuration, region x could be directly East of region z if the southern boundary of region z is below the southern boundary of region y.

Let's try another case. Suppose region z is a square, region y is a horizontally stretched rectangle to the right of region z, and region x is a vertically stretched rectangle below region y. In this configuration, region x could be directly South of region z if the western boundary of region x is to the left of the western boundary of region z and the eastern boundary of region x is to the right of the eastern boundary of region z.

So, depending on the shapes and positions of the regions, region x could be South, East, or Southeast of region z. Actually, let's try to confirm the South and East relations. For South, let's see if I can make a drawing with z, y, and x such that x is south of z. Region z looks like

```
+-+
|z|
+-+
```

And y is to the east of z:

```
+-+    +-+
|z|    |y|
+-+    +-+
```

And x is to the south of y:

```
+-+    +-+
|z|    |y|
+-+    +-+
       +-+
       |x|
       +-+
```

In this case, x is to the southeast of z. But let's stretch x:

```
+-+    +-+
|z|    |y|
+-+    +-+
    +-----+
    |  x  |
    +-----+
```

In this case, x is still to the southeast of z. If we stretch x even more:

```
+-+    +-+
|z|    |y|
+-+    +-+
+--------+
|    x   |

```

Now x is below z, so x is to the south of z. But x is also to the east of z, so x is to the southeast of z, not directly south. For x to be directly south of z, it would need to be directly below z with no eastward displacement.

What if we move x to the left?

```
+-+    +-+
|z|    |y|
+-+    +-+
+--+
| x|
+--+
```

But this doesn't work because now x is not to the south of y. It's to the southwest of y.

I think I'm not being careful enough. Let's be more explicit about the boundaries of the regions.

Let's say:
- The northern boundary of region z is at y = z_n
- The southern boundary of region z is at y = z_s
- The eastern boundary of region z is at x = z_e
- The western boundary of region z is at x = z_w
- Similarly for regions y and x.

Given that region y is East of region z, we have y_w > z_e. This means the western boundary of region y is to the east of the eastern boundary of region z.

Given that region x is South of region y, we have x_n < y_s. This means the northern boundary of region x is to the south of the southern boundary of region y.

Now, for region x to be South of region z, we need x_n < z_s. This means the northern boundary of region x must be to the south of the southern boundary of region z.

Is this guaranteed given the constraints? Not necessarily. We know x_n < y_s, but we don't have a direct comparison between y_s and z_s. If y_s < z_s, then x_n < y_s < z_s, and region x is South of region z. But if y_s > z_s, then x_n could be greater than z_s, in which case region x is not directly South of region z.

Similarly, for region x to be East of region z, we need x_w > z_e. Is this guaranteed given the constraints? Not necessarily. We know y_w > z_e, but we don't have a direct constraint on x_w relative to z_e or y_w. If x_w > z_e, then region x is East of region z. But if x_w < z_e, then region x is not directly East of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are South, East, and Southeast, depending on the specific configurations of the regions.

Actually, I think x can also be directly Southwest of z. Since y is East of z, we only know that y_w > z_e, which means all of y is to the right of the eastern boundary of z. And given that x is South of y, we know that x_n < y_s, which means all of x is below the southern boundary of y. But there's no constraint on the horizontal extent of region x relative to region z. So, region x could be positioned such that it's to the west of region z while still being to the south of region y. This would make region x Southwest of region z.

Actually, wait. I made an error. If region x is to the west of region z, it's definitely not to the east of region y. So, region x cannot be Southwest of region z.

Actually, let's see if I can draw a picture here. 

Let z be at the origin:

```
+---+
| z |
+---+
```

And y is to the east of z:

```
+---+       +---+
| z |       | y |
+---+       +---+
```

And x is to the south of y:

```
+---+       +---+
| z |       | y |
+---+       +---+
            +---+
            | x |
            +---+
```

In this case, x is to the southeast of z. But can x be directly south of z? Let's see:

```
+---+       +---+
| z |       | y |
+---+       +---+
+---+       +---+
| x |       | x |
+---+-------+---+
```

Now, x is below z, so it's to the south of z. But x is also to the east of z, so it's to the southeast of z, not directly south. For x to be directly south of z, it would need to be directly below z with no eastward displacement. But that's not possible given the constraints.

But maybe we're getting confused by the way I'm drawing these pictures.

Let's change perspective. Let me draw this in a coordinate system. North corresponds to the positive y-axis, East corresponds to the positive x-axis.

Suppose z's center is at the origin (0, 0), and z extends 1 unit in each direction. So z is the square from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).

y is East of z, so y's center is at some point (a, 0) where a > 2. Let's say a = 3, so y is the square from (2, -1) to (4, 1).

x is South of y, so x's center is at some point (3, -b) where b > 2. Let's say b = 3, so x is the square from (2, -4) to (4, -2).

In this configuration, where is x relative to z? x is to the right and below z, which is the Southeast direction.

But can we reposition x to be directly South of z while still being South of y? For x to be directly South of z, its center would need to be at some point (0, -b) where b > 2. But then x would be to the west of y, not directly below it, so it wouldn't be South of y as required.

Can we reposition y and x such that x is East of z? For x to be East of z, its center would need to be at some point (a, 0) where a > 2. But then x wouldn't be South of y as required.

Let's try one more approach. If y is East of z, it means the western boundary of y is to the east of the eastern boundary of z. Given the constraint that y is East of z, y can be anywhere in the eastern half-plane defined by the eastern boundary of z.

Similarly, if x is South of y, it means the northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of y. Given the constraint that x is South of y, x can be anywhere in the southern half-plane defined by the southern boundary of y.

Given these, where can x be relative to z?

If y is anywhere in the eastern half-plane defined by the eastern boundary of z, and x is anywhere in the southern half-plane defined by the southern boundary of y, then x is in the southeastern quadrant relative to z. But this doesn't preclude x from being directly South of z or directly East of z.

For x to be directly South of z, all of x must be below the southern boundary of z and not entirely to the east or west of z. Is this possible given the constraints? If y is directly East of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is Southeast of z, not directly South. But if y is positioned more to the northeast or southeast of z, then there's a possibility that x could be positioned such that it's directly South of z.

Similarly, for x to be directly East of z, all of x must be to the east of the eastern boundary of z and not entirely above or below z. If y is directly East of z, and x is directly South of y, then x is Southeast of z, not directly East. But again, depending on the positions of y and x, there might be cases where x is directly East of z.

OK, let's really try to check whether x can be South of z. Let's simplify. Let z be a square with upper-left corner at (-1, 1) and lower-right corner at (1, -1). So the southern boundary of z is at y = -1.

Now, y is East of z, which means the western boundary of y is to the east of the eastern boundary of z. So the western boundary of y is at x > 1. Let's say the western boundary of y is at x = 2. And say y is a square with width 2, so the eastern boundary of y is at x = 4. Let's say the southern boundary of y is at y = -1 (same as z). Now the region y is the square with upper-left corner at (2, 1) and lower-right corner at (4, -1).

Now, x is South of y, which means the northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of y. So the northern boundary of x is at y < -1. Let's say the northern boundary of x is at y = -2. And let's say x is a wide rectangle that extends from x = 0 to x = 4, and from y = -2 to y = -3. So the region x is the rectangle with upper-left corner at (0, -2) and lower-right corner at (4, -3).

In this configuration, is x South of z? Well, the northern boundary of x is at y = -2, which is below the southern boundary of z at y = -1. And x extends from x = 0 to x = 4, which overlaps with z's extent from x = -1 to x = 1. So x is below z, which means x is South of z.

But is x also East of z? The western boundary of x is at x = 0, which is not to the east of the eastern boundary of z at x = 1. So x is not directly East of z.

Is x Southeast of z? For x to be Southeast of z, all of x would need to be to the east of the eastern boundary of z and to the south of the southern boundary of z. But as we've seen, part of x is not to the east of the eastern boundary of z. So x is not directly Southeast of z.

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself again. Let's try the cones method. In the cones method, we extend rays from the centroid of a region in the 8 cardinal directions. Then, a region A is North of region B if all of region A is in the North cone from the centroid of region B, and similarly for other directions.

Given this, if the centroid of y is in the East cone from the centroid of z, and the centroid of x is in the South cone from the centroid of y, then where is the centroid of x relative to the centroid of z?

If the centroid of y is to the east of the centroid of z, and the centroid of x is to the south of the centroid of y, then the centroid of x is to the southeast of the centroid of z. But this doesn't tell us the directional relation between regions x and z, just the relation between their centroids.

OK, the cones method is not particularly helpful here. Let's try using the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs).

In the MBR method, we determine the cardinal direction relation between two regions by comparing their MBRs. If all of region A's MBR is to the north of region B's MBR, then region A is North of region B, and similarly for other directions.

Given that region y's MBR is East of region z's MBR, and region x's MBR is South of region y's MBR, where is region x's MBR relative to region z's MBR?

If region y's MBR is entirely to the east of region z's MBR, and region x's MBR is entirely to the south of region y's MBR, then region x's MBR is to the southeast of region z's MBR. But can region x's MBR be directly South of region z's MBR?

For region x's MBR to be directly South of region z's MBR, the eastern boundary of region x's MBR would need to be to the east of the eastern boundary of region z's MBR, and the western boundary of region x's MBR would need to be to the west of the western boundary of region z's MBR. Is this possible given the constraints?

If region y's MBR is entirely to the east of region z's MBR, then the western boundary of region y's MBR is to the east of the eastern boundary of region z's MBR. If region x's MBR is entirely to the south of region y's MBR, then the northern boundary of region x's MBR is to the south of the southern boundary of region y's MBR. But these constraints don't restrict the western boundary of region x's MBR. So, region x's MBR could be positioned such that its western boundary is to the west of the western boundary of region z's MBR, in which case region x's MBR is not directly East of region z's MBR.

But this doesn't guarantee that region x's MBR is directly South of region z's MBR. For that, we also need the eastern boundary of region x's MBR to be to the east of the eastern boundary of region z's MBR. And the northern boundary of region x's MBR needs to be to the south of the southern boundary of region z's MBR.

Actually, let's draw this to clarity. Let z be a square with upper-left corner at (-1, 1) and lower-right corner at (1, -1). So the MBR of z is the square from (-1, 1) to (1, -1).

y is East of z, which means the MBR of y is entirely to the east of the MBR of z. So the western boundary of y's MBR is at x > 1. Let's say the MBR of y is the square from (2, 1) to (4, -1).

x is South of y, which means the MBR of x is entirely to the south of the MBR of y. So the northern boundary of x's MBR is at y < -1. Let's say the MBR of x is the rectangle from (0, -2) to (4, -3).

Now, let's determine the cardinal direction relation between x and z. For x to be South of z, the MBR of x would need to be directly below the MBR of z. The northern boundary of x's MBR is at y = -2, which is below the southern boundary of z's MBR at y = -1. The western boundary of x's MBR is at x = 0, which is to the east of the western boundary of z's MBR at x = -1. The eastern boundary of x's MBR is at x = 4, which is to the east of the eastern boundary of z's MBR at x = 1. So, the MBR of x is not directly below the MBR of z. It's to the southeast of the MBR of z.

Let's try to create a configuration where x is directly South of z. For x to be directly South of z, the MBR of x would need to be directly below the MBR of z. This means the western boundary of x's MBR would need to be to the west of the western boundary of z's MBR, and the eastern boundary of x's MBR would need to be to the east of the eastern boundary of z's MBR.

Given that y is East of z, the western boundary of y's MBR is to the east of the eastern boundary of z's MBR. And given that x is South of y, the northern boundary of x's MBR is to the south of the southern boundary of y's MBR. But these constraints don't restrict the western boundary of x's MBR. So, x's MBR could extend far to the west, such that its western boundary is to the west of the western boundary of z's MBR.

Let's redraw this. Let z be a square with MBR from (-1, 1) to (1, -1). Let y be a square with MBR from (2, 1) to (4, -1). Let x be a rectangle with MBR from (-2, -2) to (4, -3).

Now, is x South of z? The northern boundary of x's MBR is at y = -2, which is below the southern boundary of z's MBR at y = -1. The western boundary of x's MBR is at x = -2, which is to the west of the western boundary of z's MBR at x = -1. The eastern boundary of x's MBR is at x = 4, which is to the east of the eastern boundary of z's MBR at x = 1. So, the MBR of x is directly below the MBR of z, which means x is South of z.

But wait, I think I don't understand the question correctly. I keep going back and forth on what the cardinal directions should be. Let me restart.

In the cones model of cardinal directions: 
- Region A is N of region B if all of A is in the northern cone from B's centroid.
- Region A is NE of region B if all of A is in the northeastern cone from B's centroid.
- And so on for the other directions.

In the projection model (or MBR model):
- The MBR of a region defines 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and O, the interior of the MBR).
- Region A is in direction D from region B if all of A is in the tile corresponding to direction D from the MBR of B.

In the cardinal algebra model (which I think is the most general):
- The cardinal direction from region B to region A is the set of basic cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, O) such that A has a non-empty intersection with the corresponding tile from the MBR of B.

In the question, we're told that region x is South of region y and region y is East of region z. We're asked to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given these, I've been trying to determine the possible cardinal direction relations from region z to region x. But perhaps I should be determining the possible cardinal direction relations from region x to region z, which would be the inverse of the relations from region z to region x.

Actually, I think the way the question is phrased, we're being asked about the relations from region z to region x. So I was on the right track.

OK, let's try to use the cardinal algebra model, which is the most general.

Given:
- Region y is East of region z: This means all of region y is in the Eastern tile defined by the MBR of region z.
- Region x is South of region y: This means all of region x is in the Southern tile defined by the MBR of region y.

Where can region x be relative to region z? In other words, which of the 9 tiles defined by the MBR of region z can region x intersect with?

Let's reason about this tile by tile:

1. Northern (N) tile: Region x cannot be in the Northern tile of region z, because region x is South of region y, and region y is East of region z. This places region x in the Southeastern quadrant relative to region z, not in the Northern tile.

2. Northwestern (NW) tile: By the same reasoning, region x cannot be in the Northwestern tile of region z.

3. Northeastern (NE) tile: By the same reasoning, region x cannot be in the Northeastern tile of region z.

4. Western (W) tile: Region x cannot be in the Western tile of region z, because region y is East of region z, and region x is South of region y. This places region x in the Southeastern quadrant relative to region z, not in the Western tile.

5. Interior (O) tile: Region x cannot be in the Interior tile of region z, because region y is East of region z, and region x is South of region y. This places region x outside of region z.

6. Northwestern (NW) tile: I already checked this; region x cannot be in the Northwestern tile of region z.

7. Southwestern (SW) tile: Region x might be in the Southwestern tile of region z. This is possible if region y is to the east of region z, and region x is to the south of region y and extends far enough west to be in the Southwestern tile of region z. But that would place at least part of region x to the west of region y, which contradicts the constraint that region x is South of region y.

OK I think I misunderstand something. Let me reconsider what it means for "region x is South of region y".

Here's my understanding: "region x is South of region y" means that all of region x is to the south of all of region y. In terms of the MBR model, it means that the northern boundary of region x's MBR is to the south of the southern boundary of region y's MBR.

Let's continue:

7. Southwestern (SW) tile: For region x to be in the Southwestern tile of region z, region x must be to the south and west of region z. Given that region y is East of region z, and region x is South of region y, is it possible for region x to be to the west of region z? No, because if region y is to the east of region z, and region x is to the south of region y, then region x is to the east and south of region z, not to the west.

Actually, I think my reasoning is not accurate. Let's be careful about what the constraints tell us. Really, I think I need to be more careful about what it means for "region y is East of region z". Actually, let's not use the cone model, the MBR model, or the cardinal algebra model. Let's go back to basics.

In the context of cardinal directions, "region A is East of region B" means that region A is to the right of region B on a map. Similarly, "region A is South of region B" means that region A is below region B on a map.

Given these definitions, let's reason about the problem. We know that region y is to the right of region z on a map, and region x is below region y on a map. So, where is region x relative to region z on a map?

If region y is to the right of region z, and region x is below region y, then region x is below and to the right of region z, which is the Southeast direction.

But wait, that's not entirely accurate. The fact that region x is below region y doesn't constrain the horizontal position of region x relative to region z. Region x could be directly below region z (South), to the right of region z (East), or below and to the right of region z (Southeast), all while still being below region y.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are South, East, and Southeast.

Actually, let's think about this a bit differently. I'm going to try to set up some regions and see which of the cardinal directions work out. Specifically, I want to check if South and East are truly possible relations.

I'm going to use a slightly different interpretation. "Region y is East of region z" means that for every point in region y and every point in region z, the point in region y is to the east of the point in region z. In other words, the westernmost point of region y is to the east of the easternmost point of region z. Similarly, "region x is South of region y" means that the northernmost point of region x is to the south of the southernmost point of region y.

Given these interpretations, let's check if region x can be South of region z. For region x to be South of region z, the northernmost point of region x must be to the south of the southernmost point of region z. But we only know that the northernmost point of region x is to the south of the southernmost point of region y, and the westernmost point of region y is to the east of the easternmost point of region z. Without additional constraints, region x may or may not be South of region z.

But let's see if I can create a valid example where x is South of z. Let z be a square at the origin:

```
+---+
| z |
+---+
```

Let y be a square to the east of z:

```
+---+       +---+
| z |       | y |
+---+       +---+
```

Let x be a wide rectangle that extends from the west of z to the east of y, but is below both z and y:

```
+---+       +---+
| z |       | y |
+---+       +---+
+-----------------+
|        x        |
+-----------------+
```

In this configuration, y is East of z and x is South of y. And x is also South of z, not Southeast. So, South is a possible relation.

Now, let's see if I can create a valid example where x is East of z. Let z be a tall rectangle, y be a square to the east of z but at the top, and x be a square to the east of z but below y:

```
+---+
| z |    +---+
|   |    | y |
|   |    +---+
|   |    +---+
|   |    | x |
+---+    +---+
```

In this configuration, y is East of z and x is South of y. And x is also East of z, not Southeast. So, East is a possible relation.

Since I've shown that South and East are both possible relations, and Southeast is also possible (as we've seen earlier), the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are South, East, and Southeast.

Actually, I suspect the question has a specific definition of cardinal direction in mind, but I'm unsure which formalism it's referring to. In the absence of a specific formalism, I'll go with the general interpretation I've been using.

But wait, if the direction references are "South" and "East", then the formalism might be the projection-based model (or MBR model). In this model, "region A is South of region B" means all of region A is in the Southern tile defined by the MBR of region B, and similarly for other directions.

Given this formalism, let's re-evaluate the problem.

In the MBR model, the 2D space is divided into 9 tiles based on the MBR of a reference region: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and O (the interior). A region is said to be in direction D from the reference region if it's entirely contained in the tile corresponding to direction D.

Given:
- Region y is East of region z: This means all of region y is in the Eastern tile defined by the MBR of region z.
- Region x is South of region y: This means all of region x is in the Southern tile defined by the MBR of region y.

Now, I'll check which of the 9 tiles defined by the MBR of region z can contain region x.

1. Northern (N) tile: Region x cannot be in the Northern tile of region z, because region x is South of region y, and region y is East of region z. This places region x in the Southeastern quadrant relative to region z, not in the Northern tile.

2. Northeastern (NE) tile: By the same reasoning, region x cannot be in the Northeastern tile of region z.

3. Northwestern (NW) tile: By the same reasoning, region x cannot be in the Northwestern tile of region z.

4. Western (W) tile: Region x cannot be in the Western tile of region z, because region y is East of region z, and region x is South of region y. This places region x in the Southeastern quadrant relative to region z, not in the Western tile.

5. Interior (O) tile: Region x cannot be in the Interior tile of region z, because region y is East of region z, and region x is South of region y. This places region x outside of region z.

6. Southwestern (SW) tile: For region x to be in the Southwestern tile of region z, region x must be to the south and west of region z. But if region y is to the east of region z, and region x is to the south of region y, then region x is to the east and south of region z, not to the west. So, region x cannot be in the Southwestern tile of region z.

7. Eastern (E) tile: Region x can be in the Eastern tile of region z if it's to the east of region z and not entirely to the south of region z. This is possible if region y is to the east of region z and more to the north, and region x is to the south of region y but still to the east of region z.

8. Southeastern (SE) tile: Region x can be in the Southeastern tile of region z if it's to the east and south of region z. This is definitely possible given the constraints.

9. Southern (S) tile: Region x can be in the Southern tile of region z if it's directly below region z. This is possible if region y is to the east of region z, and region x is to the south of region y and extends far enough west to be directly below region z.

So, in the MBR model, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are East, Southeast, and South.

I think I've checked this from a few different angles now, so the answer is that region x can be South, East, or Southeast of region z.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the possible spatial relationships between regions x, y, and z based on the given cardinal direction relations.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is East of region z

I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Since y is East of z, region y is located to the right of region z.
Since x is South of y, region x is located below region y.

From these constraints, I can determine the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. Southeast: This is the most general case. If x is below y, and y is to the right of z, then x would be below and to the right of z, which is Southeast.

2. South: This is possible if region x extends far enough west to be directly below region z, while still remaining south of region y.

3. East: This is possible if region x is positioned such that it's directly to the east of region z while still being south of region y.

The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: South, East, and Southeast.
