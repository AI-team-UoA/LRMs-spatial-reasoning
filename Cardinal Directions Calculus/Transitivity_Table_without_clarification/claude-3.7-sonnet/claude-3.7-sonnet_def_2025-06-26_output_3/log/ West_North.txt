PROMPT: Let  West and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

This question is asking about the composition of cardinal direction relations. Let me think step by step.

We are given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is North of region z

We need to find: What are the possible relations between region x and region z?

Let me visualize this on a coordinate system:
- If region y is North of region z, then y is above z on a map.
- If region x is West of region y, then x is to the left of y on a map.

So, if z is at some position, then y is above z, and x is to the left of y.

Let's set up a simple coordinate system where:
- North means increasing y-coordinate
- West means decreasing x-coordinate

If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then:
- y is North of z, so y is at (0, y_coord) where y_coord > 0
- x is West of y, so x is at (x_coord, y_coord) where x_coord < 0

So x is at a position (x_coord, y_coord) where x_coord < 0 and y_coord > 0 relative to z.

In cardinal directions, this would place x in the Northwest of z.

However, I should check if there are other possible relations based on how these cardinal direction relations are defined. Sometimes these relations are defined based on minimum bounding rectangles or other approaches.

Given the basic definition of cardinal directions:
- North: higher latitude, same longitude
- West: same latitude, lower longitude
- Northwest: higher latitude, lower longitude

If y is strictly North of z (higher latitude, same longitude), and x is strictly West of y (same latitude, lower longitude), then x would be at a higher latitude and lower longitude compared to z, which is Northwest.

But if we consider more general definitions of cardinal directions (like bounding boxes or cones), then other relations might be possible.

Let me reconsider with a more general approach using bounding boxes:

If we use bounding boxes to define cardinal directions:
- y being North of z means that y's bounding box is entirely above z's bounding box.
- x being West of y means that x's bounding box is entirely to the left of y's bounding box.

Given these constraints, x's bounding box would be to the left of y's and y's would be above z's. This means x's bounding box would be to the left and potentially above z's.

In terms of cardinal directions, x could be:
- Northwest of z (if x's bounding box is both to the left and above z's)
- West of z (if x's bounding box is directly to the left of z's)

But actually, I'm not sure we can say for sure that x is above z just from the given information. Let me think about this more carefully.

If y is North of z, y's latitude is higher than z's.
If x is West of y, x's longitude is less than y's, but their latitudes could be the same or different.

So x's latitude relative to z is not determined solely by the given relations. x could be at the same latitude as z, above z, or even below z, depending on how x's latitude compares to y's.

Given these considerations, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Northwest (if x is also above z)
- West (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest (if x is below z)

Actually, I need to be careful here. The question is about the composition of the relations West and North in a spatial reasoning context. 

Let me approach this from a different angle using a qualitative spatial reasoning framework. In the cardinal direction calculus, if we compose two basic cardinal direction relations, we get a set of possible basic relations.

For the composition of West and North, we need to consider all possible positions of x relative to z, given that x is West of y and y is North of z.

If y is North of z, then y is above z on the map. The possible positions for x, given that it's West of y, would include positions to the left of y. These positions can be:
- Northwest of z (if x is to the left and above z)
- West of z (if x is directly to the left of z)
- Southwest of z (if x is to the left and below z)

But actually, if y is directly North of z, and x is directly West of y, then x would be Northwest of z. But if we allow for broader interpretations of the relations West and North (like "at least partially west" or "at least partially north"), then the set of possible relations between x and z becomes larger.

Let me try to be more precise. If we use the basic cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) and we're composing W and N, the question is about W ○ N (where ○ is the composition operator).

According to the cardinal direction calculus:
W ○ N = {NW, W, SW}

This means if region x is West of region y and region y is North of region z, then region x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of region z.

Let's double-check this with a simple example:
- If z is at (0, 0)
- If y is North of z, y could be at (0, 1)
- If x is West of y, x could be at (-1, 1)

In this case, x is at (-1, 1) relative to z, which is Northwest of z.

But we could also have:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (0, 1)
- x at (-1, 0)

In this case, x is at (-1, 0) relative to z, which is West of z.

And lastly:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (0, 1)
- x at (-1, -1)

In this case, x is at (-1, -1) relative to z, which is Southwest of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, or Southwest.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider this.

If y is North of z, then y's latitude is greater than z's, but their longitudes are the same.
If x is West of y, then x's longitude is less than y's, but their latitudes are the same.

So if:
- z is at (lon_z, lat_z)
- y is at (lon_z, lat_y) where lat_y > lat_z (since y is North of z)
- x is at (lon_x, lat_y) where lon_x < lon_z (since x is West of y)

Then x is at (lon_x, lat_y) relative to z, where lon_x < lon_z and lat_y > lat_z. This places x in the Northwest quadrant relative to z.

So, if we're strictly interpreting "West" and "North" to mean the basic cardinal directions (and not, for instance, "at least partially west" or "at least partially north"), then the only possible relation between x and z would be Northwest.

However, in the context of the question, it's possible that the cardinal direction relations are defined more broadly or using different conventions. If that's the case, then we would need to revisit our analysis.

Actually, I see the issue in my earlier reasoning. I was confusing the definitions of the cardinal directions. Let me clarify:

- North (N): higher latitude, same longitude.
- West (W): same latitude, lower longitude.
- Northwest (NW): higher latitude, lower longitude.
- Northeast (NE): higher latitude, higher longitude.
- South (S): lower latitude, same longitude.
- East (E): same latitude, higher longitude.
- Southeast (SE): lower latitude, higher longitude.
- Southwest (SW): lower latitude, lower longitude.

Let's reapply these definitions to our scenario:

If region y is North of region z, then y has a higher latitude than z but the same longitude.
If region x is West of region y, then x has the same latitude as y but a lower longitude.

If we place z at coordinates (lon_z, lat_z), then:
- y would be at (lon_z, lat_y) where lat_y > lat_z.
- x would be at (lon_x, lat_y) where lon_x < lon_z.

Comparing x and z, x has a lower longitude (lon_x < lon_z) and a higher latitude (lat_y > lat_z) than z, which corresponds to the Northwest direction.

Therefore, based on the strict definitions of the cardinal directions, the only possible relation between x and z would be Northwest.

However, I want to be super sure about this, especially considering the context of the question. Let me visualize this once more to confirm.

We have:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (0, 1) (North of z)
- x at (-1, 1) (West of y)

x is at position (-1, 1) relative to z. This is in the Northwest direction.

But wait, what if y is not directly North of z, but rather Northeast? And what if x is not directly West of y, but rather Southwest? Then the relation between x and z could be different.

But the question specifies that y is North of z and x is West of y, so we should use the basic cardinal directions as defined.

Given the strict definitions of North and West, the only possible relation between x and z would be Northwest.

Actually, I need to ensure that I'm understanding the question correctly. The question is asking for the composition of cardinal direction relations West and North, specifically West(x, y) and North(y, z), and asking for the possible relations between x and z.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, composition tables often indicate the possible outcomes when composing two relations. For cardinal directions, if we compose West (x, y) and North (y, z), we want to determine all possible relations between x and z.

Let's try another approach with a graphical representation.

If z is at the origin:
- The North region of z is the area directly above z.
- The West region of any point is the area directly to the left of that point.

If y is in the North region of z, and x is in the West region of y, then x can only be in the Northwest region of z.

But let's double-check by considering all possible positions of y and x:

1. If y is directly North of z, and x is directly West of y, then x is Northwest of z.
2. Are there any other positions for y that satisfy y being North of z? Not if we use the strict definition of North. Similarly, there are no other positions for x that satisfy x being West of y under the strict definition of West.

Therefore, under the strict definitions of cardinal directions, the only possible relation between x and z is Northwest.

But if we move away from the strict point-based definition and consider region-based definitions, things get more complex. In a region-based approach, the exact relation can depend on the shapes and sizes of the regions.

For example, if region y is North of region z (i.e., y's bounding box is entirely above z's bounding box), and region x is West of region y (i.e., x's bounding box is entirely to the left of y's bounding box), then the exact relation between x and z depends on the vertical extent of x relative to z.

- If x's vertical extent is entirely above z, then x is Northwest of z.
- If x's vertical extent partially overlaps with z's vertical extent, then x is both Northwest and West of z.
- If x's vertical extent is entirely within z's vertical extent, then x is West of z.
- If x's vertical extent partially overlaps with z's vertical extent, but extends below z, then x is both West and Southwest of z.
- If x's vertical extent is entirely below z, then x is Southwest of z.

So, in a region-based approach, the possible relations between x and z could be Northwest, West, Southwest, or some combination of these.

But again, it really depends on how the cardinal directions are defined in the context of the question.

Actually, I think I've been going back and forth a bit too much. Let me try to clarify:

In a point-based approach (where regions are represented by single points), if y is North of z and x is West of y, then x is Northwest of z.

In a region-based approach (where regions have extent), the relation between x and z depends on the exact shapes and positions of the regions. If we consider bounding boxes and the strict definitions of cardinal directions (where North means "entirely above" and West means "entirely to the left"), then the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, or Southwest, depending on the vertical extent of x relative to z.

But wait, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let's get back to the original definitions of cardinal directions:

- y is North of z if y's latitude is greater than z's, but their longitudes are the same.
- x is West of y if x's longitude is less than y's, but their latitudes are the same.

With these definitions, the possible position of x relative to z is:
- x's longitude is less than z's (since x is West of y and y's longitude is the same as z's).
- x's latitude is the same as y's, and y's latitude is greater than z's. So, x's latitude is greater than z's.

This places x in the Northwest quadrant relative to z. Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

This is the case if we're using the point-based interpretation of cardinal directions. In a region-based interpretation, as I discussed earlier, the possible relations could include Northwest, West, or Southwest, depending on the vertical extent of x relative to z.

But actually, based on our definitions, we wouldn't know the exact relation between y and z – we just know that y is to the north of z. Similarly, we know that x is to the west of y. So x is to the west of a point that is to the north of z. I think it's not possible to determine the exact relation between x and z given only the information that y is North of z and x is West of y. The possible relations could include Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, I realized that the main problem I need to consider is that cardinal direction relations are defined over regions, not just points. So when we say y is North of z, it means that the entire region y is to the north of the entire region z. Similarly, x is West of y means the entire region x is to the west of the entire region y.

Let's use a more precise definition: region A is North of region B if for every point a in A and every point b in B, a has a higher latitude than b. Similarly, region A is West of region B if for every point a in A and every point b in B, a has a lower longitude than b.

Now, given that y is North of z and x is West of y, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

For every point z' in z, there's a point y' in y such that y' has a higher latitude than z'. Also, for every point y' in y, there's a point x' in x such that x' has a lower longitude than y'.

So, for every point z' in z, there's a point x' in x such that x' has a lower longitude than y' (which is a point in y), and y' has a higher latitude than z'. But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between x' and z' in terms of latitude.

What we know for sure is that x' has a lower longitude than z'. For the latitude, it depends on the specific regions. If region x has a latitude range that overlaps with the latitude range of region z, then x' could have a latitude that's higher, the same, or lower than z'.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be Northwest, West, or Southwest, depending on the specific regions involved.

Actually, you know what? I'm getting confused by conflating different models of cardinal directions. Let me just answer this based on the standard composition table for the cardinal direction calculus:

If region x is West of region y (i.e., W(x, y)) and region y is North of region z (i.e., N(y, z)), then the possible relations between x and z are given by the composition W ○ N.

According to the standard composition table for the cardinal direction calculus, W ○ N = {NW, W, SW}.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

To visualize this, imagine a scenario where z is at the center, y is directly North of z, and x is directly West of y. In this case, x would be Northwest of z.

Now, imagine that x's vertical extent is large, such that it extends both above and below z. In this case, x would be both Northwest and West of z.

Finally, imagine that x's vertical extent is such that it's entirely below z. In this case, x would be Southwest of z.

So, depending on the specific regions involved, the relation between x and z could be Northwest, West, or Southwest, or some combination of these.

In many qualitative spatial reasoning frameworks, it's more convenient to consider a single relation. In those cases, the composition W ○ N would result in a disjunction of the basic relations NW, W, and SW, indicating that the actual relation is one of these, but we don't know which one without more information.

But I'm still going back and forth. Let's settle this:

In the point-based cardinal direction calculus, where regions are approximated by their centroids:
- If the centroid of y is North of the centroid of z, and the centroid of x is West of the centroid of y, then the centroid of x is Northwest of the centroid of z.

In the region-based cardinal direction calculus, where regions have extent:
- If the entire region y is to the north of the entire region z, and the entire region x is to the west of the entire region y, then the relation between x and z depends on the vertical extents of x and z. The possible relations are Northwest, West, or Southwest, or some combination of these.

Given the context of the question, it's asking about the general composition of cardinal direction relations, so the correct answer would be the region-based interpretation, where the possible relations are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

I'm pretty confident in this answer. It's based on the standard composition table for the cardinal direction calculus, which has been widely studied in qualitative spatial reasoning.

Wait, maybe I'm over-complicating things. If we stick to the basic cardinal direction relations and their composition, then if y is North of z and x is West of y, then the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

This is because the latitude of x is the same as the latitude of y (since x is West of y), and the latitude of y is higher than the latitude of z (since y is North of z). So, the latitude of x is higher than the latitude of z. Additionally, the longitude of x is lower than the longitude of y (since x is West of y), and the longitude of y is the same as the longitude of z (since y is North of z). So, the longitude of x is lower than the longitude of z.

This places x in the Northwest quadrant relative to z. Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Actually, I think I'm correct this time. Let's reason through it once more.
- z is at (lon_z, lat_z)
- y is at (lon_z, lat_y) where lat_y > lat_z, but lon_y = lon_z (because y is North of z)
- x is at (lon_x, lat_y) where lon_x < lon_y = lon_z, but lat_x = lat_y (because x is West of y)

So, the relative position of x to z is (lon_x, lat_y) where lon_x < lon_z and lat_y > lat_z. This corresponds to the Northwest direction.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Actually, I think the region-based approach I was discussing earlier doesn't directly apply here. That's more relevant for the Rectangle Algebra or the RCC (Region Connection Calculus) combined with cardinal directions.

For the basic cardinal direction calculus, the relation between x and z given that y is North of z and x is West of y would be Northwest.

But wait, let me do a quick check: If we're using the 9-intersection model for cardinal directions (which divides space into 9 tiles: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and an EQual relation for the same tile), then the composition of W and N would be NW. This is because:
- y is in the N tile of z
- x is in the W tile of y
- This places x in the NW tile of z

But if we're allowing for more general relations (like "partially north" or "partially west"), then the composition could result in multiple possible relations.

I think the answer depends on the specific model of cardinal directions being used. For the basic 9-intersection model, the relation between x and z would be Northwest. But for other models, it could be different.

Actually, let me reason once more. I've been thinking about this only terms of points, but the problem is asking about regions. So we need to think about the cardinal directions in a region-based way.

For regions, we define the cardinal directions based on the relative positions of the regions. For instance, region A is North of region B if A is above B on the map. Similarly, A is West of B if A is to the left of B on the map.

In the context of the problem, if region y is North of region z, then y is above z on the map. If region x is West of region y, then x is to the left of y on the map.

Now, what can we say about the relation between x and z? Well, x is to the left of y, and y is above z. This places x in the upper-left quadrant relative to z, which corresponds to the Northwest direction.

But actually, let me think about this in terms of what I know. Are we dealing with a 4-direction model (North, South, East, West) or an 8-direction model (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest)?

If we're using a 4-direction model, then the relation between x and z could be North or West, or possibly neither.

If we're using an 8-direction model, then the relation between x and z would be Northwest.

Since the problem is asking about cardinal direction relations, and it listed North and West as examples, I'm guessing it's using a 4-direction or 8-direction model.

Okay, let me try one more time. I'm going to use a region-based approach with the 8-direction model (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

If region y is North of region z, it means that y is in the North tile of z. If region x is West of region y, it means that x is in the West tile of y.

Now, given these constraints, where can x be relative to z? Let's visualize this:
- If z is at the center, the North tile is directly above z.
- If y is in the North tile of z, and x is in the West tile of y, then x is to the left of a region that's above z.

This places x in the Northwest tile of z. Therefore, the relation between x and z would be Northwest.

Wait, I think I missed something. Let me visualize this with a more concrete example:
- Let's place z at the coordinates (0, 0).
- If y is North of z, then y's coordinates could be (0, 1).
- If x is West of y, then x's coordinates could be (-1, 1).

If we check the relation between x and z, x is at (-1, 1) relative to z, which is in the Northwest direction.

But I've been reasoning with a very strict definitions of West and North. What if North means "not South" and West means "not East"? This wouldn't change our answer, but I'm trying to find all possible edge cases to make sure my answer is correct.

Actually, I'm not sure if I'm overcomplicating this problem. Let's just check the standard composition table for the cardinal direction calculus.

For the 8-direction model, the composition of West and North is Northwest.

For the 9-direction model (including the EQual relation), the composition of West and North is also Northwest.

But I'm still not 100% sure because there's also region-based frameworks like the Rectangle Algebra or the RCC8+directions, where the composition would result in a disjunction of possible relations.

Let me once more go through the step-by-step reasoning, using the regions model.

Given:
- Region y is North of region z.
- Region x is West of region y.

If I'm being logical, y is North of z means that the latitude of y is greater than the latitude of z. Similarly, x is West of y means that the longitude of x is less than the longitude of y. So, the position of x relative to z is: longitude less than z, latitude greater than z, which is Northwest.

So, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Let's try a different approach. Let's imagine a grid:

```
|---|---|---|
| x |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|   | y |   |
|---|---|---|
|   |   | z |
|---|---|---|
```

In this grid, y is North of z, and x is West of y. As we can see, x is Northwest of z.

But let's make the regions larger. For example, x might span multiple grid cells:

```
|---|---|---|
| x | x |   |
|---|---|---|
| x | y |   |
|---|---|---|
|   |   | z |
|---|---|---|
```

In this case, x is both Northwest and West of z.

Or maybe x spans multiple grid cells in a different way:

```
|---|---|---|
| x |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| x | y |   |
|---|---|---|
| x |   | z |
|---|---|---|
```

In this case, x is Northwest, West, and Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be Northwest, West, or Southwest, or some combination of these.

Actually, I think I need to be precise about what the problem is asking for. The question asks for the relation between x and z given that y is North of z and x is West of y.

In the context of qualitative spatial reasoning, the composition of relations West(x, y) and North(y, z) gives the possible relations between x and z, which can be Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Checking once more, I think Northwest, West, or Southwest are the possible relations between x and z given the constraints, because in cardinal directions, relations West and North compose to produce NW/W/SW, meaning any of these relations are possible based solely on the information provided. 

Therefore, the answer is:
Northwest, West, or Southwest

ANSWER:

Northwest, West, or Southwest
