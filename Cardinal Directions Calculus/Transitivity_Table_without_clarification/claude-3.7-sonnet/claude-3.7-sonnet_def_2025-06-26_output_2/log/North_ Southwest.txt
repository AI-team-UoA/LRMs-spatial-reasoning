PROMPT: Let North and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's consider the relations between regions:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Cardinal direction relations describe the relative positions of regions in terms of the eight compass directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) plus possibly Bounding Box (when one region contains the other).

Let me reason about this step by step:

If x is North of y, then y is South of x.
If y is Southwest of z, then z is Northeast of y.

So we have:
- x is North of y
- z is Northeast of y

Now, to find the relation between x and z, I need to consider their relative positions.

Let me visualize this on a coordinate system, where North is the positive y-direction and East is the positive x-direction:

- If x is North of y, then x has a higher y-coordinate than y, but the same x-coordinate (or a range of x-coordinates that overlaps with y's).
- If z is Northeast of y, then z has a higher y-coordinate and a higher x-coordinate than y.

So, both x and z are at a higher y-coordinate than y, but z is also to the east of y while x is directly north.

Given this arrangement, what are the possible relations between x and z?

x could be:
1. Northwest of z: This happens if x is sufficiently far to the west compared to z.
2. North of z: This happens if x is directly north of z.
3. Northeast of z: This happens if x is to the east of z.
4. West of z: This happens if x and z have the same y-coordinate, but x is to the west of z.
5. Bounding Box (containing z): This is theoretically possible if x is a large region that contains z.
6. East of z: This happens if x and z have the same y-coordinate, but x is to the east of z.

Actually, let me reconsider the constraints more carefully. If y is southwest of z, that means z is to the northeast of y. And if x is north of y, x is above y. So x must be above (north of) y, and z must be above and to the right (northeast) of y.

Given these constraints, can x be to the east of z? No, because if x is directly north of y, and z is northeast of y, then z must be to the east of x. So x cannot be to the east of z.

Similarly, x cannot be to the northeast of z, because if x is north of y and z is northeast of y, then z must be to the east of x, which means x is to the west of z (not northeast).

Let's revise the possible relations:
1. Northwest of z: This happens if x is sufficiently far to the west compared to z.
2. North of z: This happens if x is directly north of z.
3. West of z: This happens if x and z have the same y-coordinate, but x is to the west of z.
4. Bounding Box (containing z): This is theoretically possible if x is a large region that contains z.

Actually, can x be at the same y-coordinate as z? If x is North of y, and z is Northeast of y, then both x and z are at a higher y-coordinate than y. However, z could be at an even higher y-coordinate than x, or they could be at the same y-coordinate, or x could be at a higher y-coordinate than z. So, x could be North, Northwest, or West of z, depending on their relative positions.

Hmm, I think I need to think more carefully. The cardinal direction relations I'm referring to divide the plane into 9 regions based on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. Let me analyze this more systematically:

Let's denote the minimum bounding rectangle of a region r as MBR(r).

If x is North of y, then MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), with some x-coordinate overlap.
If y is Southwest of z, then MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z), with no overlap.

Now, consider the possible relationships between MBR(x) and MBR(z):

1. If MBR(x) is entirely to the left of MBR(z), then x is West of z.
2. If MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(z) in the x-coordinate, and MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(z), then x is North of z.
3. If MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(z) in the x-coordinate, and MBR(z) is entirely above MBR(x), then x is South of z.
4. If MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(z) in the x-coordinate, and there's overlap in the y-coordinate as well, then the relationship could be Bounding Box (if one contains the other) or more complex.
5. If MBR(x) is entirely to the left and above MBR(z), then x is Northwest of z.
6. If MBR(x) is entirely to the left and below MBR(z), then x is Southwest of z.
7. If MBR(x) is entirely to the right and above MBR(z), then x is Northeast of z.
8. If MBR(x) is entirely to the right and below MBR(z), then x is Southeast of z.
9. If MBR(x) is entirely to the right of MBR(z), then x is East of z.

Given the constraints (x is North of y, y is Southwest of z), which of these relations are possible between x and z?

If y is Southwest of z, then MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z).
If x is North of y, then MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y).

Since MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z), and MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), there are a few possibilities for the relationship between MBR(x) and MBR(z):

1. MBR(x) could be entirely to the left of MBR(z), in which case x is West of z.
2. MBR(x) could overlap with MBR(z) in the x-coordinate, and MBR(x) could be entirely above MBR(z), in which case x is North of z.
3. MBR(x) could overlap with MBR(z) in the x-coordinate, and MBR(z) could be entirely above MBR(x), in which case x is South of z.
4. MBR(x) could overlap with MBR(z) in both coordinates, leading to a Bounding Box relationship or a more complex one.
5. MBR(x) could be entirely to the left and above MBR(z), in which case x is Northwest of z.
6. MBR(x) could be entirely to the left and below MBR(z), in which case x is Southwest of z.
7. MBR(x) could be entirely to the right and above MBR(z), in which case x is Northeast of z.
8. MBR(x) could be entirely to the right and below MBR(z), in which case x is Southeast of z.
9. MBR(x) could be entirely to the right of MBR(z), in which case x is East of z.

But given the constraints, not all of these are possible. For instance, if MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z), and MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), then MBR(x) cannot be entirely below MBR(z). So, x cannot be South, Southeast, or Southwest of z.

Similarly, if MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z), and MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y) in the x-coordinate, then MBR(x) might not be entirely to the right of MBR(z). So, x might not be East of z.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating things. I'm reinterpreting things again with a focus on constraints we know:

1. x is North of y: This means x is above y (higher on the y-axis) with some overlap in the x-axis. So, the x-coordinate range of x has some overlap with the x-coordinate range of y.
2. y is Southwest of z: This means y is below and to the left of z. There's no overlap in the x-axis or the y-axis. The x-coordinate range of y is entirely to the left of the x-coordinate range of z, and the y-coordinate range of y is entirely below the y-coordinate range of z.

Given these, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

Since y is entirely to the left of z (on the x-axis), and x overlaps with y (on the x-axis), x could be to the left of z, overlap with z, or be to the right of z on the x-axis.

On the y-axis, since y is entirely below z, and x is entirely above y, x could be below z, at the same level as z, or above z.

Combining these possibilities, and using the cardinal direction relations:

1. If x is to the left of and below z, then x is Southwest of z. But we just established that x is entirely above y, and y is entirely below z. Since MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z) on the y-axis, and MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y) on the y-axis, MBR(x) and MBR(z) must have a relation on the y-axis. They either overlap, or one is entirely above the other. This means x cannot be Southwest of z.

2. If x is to the left of and at the same level as z, then x is West of z. This is possible.

3. If x is to the left of and above z, then x is Northwest of z. This is possible.

4. If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is below z on the y-axis, then x is South of z. This would mean that MBR(x) is entirely below MBR(z). But, as established, MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z). Therefore, it's not possible for MBR(x) to be entirely below MBR(z). So, x cannot be South of z.

5. If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and overlaps with z on the y-axis (or one contains the other), then the relation is Bounding Box. This is possible.

6. If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is entirely above z on the y-axis, then x is North of z. This is possible.

7. If x is to the right of z on the x-axis and below z on the y-axis, then x is Southeast of z. This, similar to point 4, would mean MBR(x) is entirely below MBR(z), which is not possible given the constraints. So, x cannot be Southeast of z.

8. If x is to the right of z on the x-axis and at the same level as z on the y-axis, then x is East of z. This is possible.

9. If x is to the right of z on the x-axis and above z on the y-axis, then x is Northeast of z. This is possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, Bounding Box, North, East, and Northeast.

Let me double-check the case of x being East of z. If y is Southwest of z, then y is to the left of z. If x is North of y, then x overlaps with y on the x-axis. But this doesn't necessarily mean that x also overlaps with z on the x-axis. It's possible that x is entirely to the left of z, in which case x cannot be East of z.

However, it's also possible that the x-coordinate range of x extends further to the right than the x-coordinate range of y. In this case, x could potentially be to the right of z, making it East of z.

Actually, let me be even more precise.

If we represent the MBR of region r by [r_left, r_right, r_bottom, r_top], then:

x is North of y means:
- x_bottom >= y_top (x is entirely above y on the y-axis)
- x_left < y_right and x_right > y_left (x and y overlap on the x-axis)

y is Southwest of z means:
- y_right <= z_left (y is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis)
- y_top <= z_bottom (y is entirely below z on the y-axis)

Given these constraints, we can deduce:
- Since x_bottom >= y_top and y_top <= z_bottom, we have x_bottom >= z_bottom. This means that x is either entirely above z on the y-axis or they overlap.
- Since y_right <= z_left and x_left < y_right, we have x_left < z_left. This means that x starts to the left of z on the x-axis. But we don't know if x extends beyond z to the right.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. If x_right <= z_left (x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis) and x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z on the y-axis), then x is Northwest of z.
2. If x_right <= z_left (x is entirely to the left of z on the x-axis) and x_bottom < z_top and x_top > z_bottom (x and z overlap on the y-axis), then x is West of z.
3. If x_right > z_left and x_left < z_right (x and z overlap on the x-axis) and x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z on the y-axis), then x is North of z.
4. If x_right > z_left and x_left < z_right (x and z overlap on the x-axis) and x_bottom < z_top and x_top > z_bottom (x and z overlap on the y-axis), then the relation is Bounding Box (or more complex, depending on the exact shapes).
5. If x_left >= z_right (x is entirely to the right of z on the x-axis) and x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z on the y-axis), then x is Northeast of z.
6. If x_left >= z_right (x is entirely to the right of z on the x-axis) and x_bottom < z_top and x_top > z_bottom (x and z overlap on the y-axis), then x is East of z.

Now, the constraint x_left < z_left (which we deduced earlier) means that x cannot be entirely to the right of z on the x-axis. So, cases 5 and 6 are not possible. Therefore, x cannot be Northeast or East of z.

The possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, North, and Bounding Box.

Hang on, I think I've been overcomplicating, so let me try another approach.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, the eight directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) define the relative position of one region with respect to another.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's visualize this:

```
    x
    |
    y
   /
  z
```

In this diagram, x is above y, and z is above and to the right of y.

From this, I can see that x is to the left of z (or possibly overlapping). And since both x and z are above y, their vertical relationship could vary: x could be above z, at the same level, or below z.

So, considering cardinal directions, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is to the left and above z)
- West (if x is to the left and at the same level as z)
- Southwest (if x is to the left and below z)

However, there's an additional consideration. Given that y is Southwest of z, y is below and to the left of z. If x is North of y, then x is above y. This means that x must be above the bottom of z. So, x cannot be entirely below z, which rules out the Southwest relation.

But now I'm starting to think the other way again. If y is at the southwest corner of z, and x is directly north of y, then x might be directly west of z.

Ok, I am overthinking this problem. Let's try one more time:

Let's define a Cartesian coordinate system. For simplicity, I'll represent the regions as points, understanding that in reality, they are areas.

If y is Southwest of z, then y is below and to the left of z. Let's say z is at (0, 0), then y might be at (-1, -1).

If x is North of y, then x is directly above y. So, if y is at (-1, -1), then x might be at (-1, 0) or (-1, 1) or any point directly above y.

Now, what's the relation between x and z?

z is at (0, 0) and x is at (-1, 0) or (-1, 1) or any point with x-coordinate -1 and y-coordinate >= 0.

If x is at (-1, 0), then x is directly to the left of z, which makes x West of z.
If x is at (-1, 1) or any point with y-coordinate > 0, then x is to the left and above z, which makes x Northwest of z.
If x is at (-1, y) where y < 0, then x is to the left and below z, which makes x Southwest of z. But this isn't possible because x is North of y, and y is already Southwest of z, so x can't be below z.

But I realize regions aren't just single points. Let's consider the regions as minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs). 

If y is Southwest of z, then MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z).
If x is North of y, then MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y).

Given these, MBR(x) must start to the left of MBR(z) (because MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z) and MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y) on the x-axis). But MBR(x) could potentially extend to the right and overlap with or go beyond MBR(z).

On the y-axis, MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z). This means MBR(x) could be below, overlap with, or be above MBR(z) on the y-axis.

Combining these, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. If MBR(x) is entirely to the left of MBR(z) and entirely above MBR(z), then x is Northwest of z.
2. If MBR(x) is entirely to the left of MBR(z) and overlaps with MBR(z) on the y-axis, then x is West of z.
3. If MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(z) on the x-axis and is entirely above MBR(z), then x is North of z.
4. If MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(z) on both axes, then the relation is Bounding Box (or more complex, depending on the exact shapes).

Given our initial constraints (x is North of y, y is Southwest of z), MBR(x) can't be entirely to the right of MBR(z) (which would make x East of z) or entirely below MBR(z) (which would make x South of z). Therefore, x can't be Northeast, East, Southeast, South, or Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, North, and Bounding Box.

Wait, I just realized I should be more careful.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

If y is Southwest of z, that means y is below and to the left of z, with no overlap in either axis.

If x is North of y, then x is above y, with some overlap in the x-axis.

So, MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z).

From this, I can deduce:
- Since MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z), there's no constraint that says MBR(x) must be below, at the same level, or above MBR(z) on the y-axis. It could be any of these.
- Since MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z), and MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y) on the x-axis, MBR(x) must at least partially be to the left of MBR(z). But MBR(x) could also extend to the right and overlap with or go beyond MBR(z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. If MBR(x) is entirely to the left of MBR(z) and entirely above MBR(z), then x is Northwest of z.
2. If MBR(x) is entirely to the left of MBR(z) and overlaps with MBR(z) on the y-axis, then x is West of z.
3. If MBR(x) is entirely to the left of MBR(z) and entirely below MBR(z), then x is Southwest of z. However, since MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z), MBR(x) and MBR(z) must have a relationship on the y-axis. Basically given x_bottom >= y_top and y_top <= z_bottom, we get x_bottom >= z_bottom. So x is either at the same level as z or above it on the y-axis, ruling out x being Southwest of z.
4. If MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(z) on the x-axis and is entirely above MBR(z), then x is North of z.
5. If MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(z) on the x-axis and overlaps with MBR(z) on the y-axis, then the relation is Bounding Box (or more complex, depending on the exact shapes).
6. If MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(z) on the x-axis and is entirely below MBR(z), then x is South of z. But, similar to the Southwest case, this is ruled out.
7. If MBR(x) is entirely to the right of MBR(z) and entirely above MBR(z), then x is Northeast of z. But given that MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y) on the x-axis, and MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z), it's not possible for MBR(x) to be entirely to the right of MBR(z). So, x cannot be Northeast of z.
8. If MBR(x) is entirely to the right of MBR(z) and overlaps with MBR(z) on the y-axis, then x is East of z. But, similar to the Northeast case, this is ruled out.
9. If MBR(x) is entirely to the right of MBR(z) and entirely below MBR(z), then x is Southeast of z. But, similar to the East and Southwest cases, this is ruled out.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, North, and Bounding Box.

Let me verify the bounding box case. The Bounding Box relation typically means one region contains the other. Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

If x is North of y, then MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y).
If y is Southwest of z, then MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z).

For x to contain z (or vice versa), they would need to overlap on both the x and y axes. 

Given that MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z), it's not clear if MBR(x) and MBR(z) have any relationship on the y-axis. Similarly, given that MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z), and MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y) on the x-axis, it's not clear if MBR(x) and MBR(z) have any relationship on the x-axis.

Actually, no. Let's say MBR(y) is [y_left, y_right, y_bottom, y_top], MBR(z) is [z_left, z_right, z_bottom, z_top], and MBR(x) is [x_left, x_right, x_bottom, x_top]. 

Given that y is Southwest of z, we have y_right <= z_left (they don't overlap on the x-axis) and y_top <= z_bottom (they don't overlap on the y-axis).

Given that x is North of y, we have x_bottom >= y_top (x is entirely above y on the y-axis) and x_left < y_right and x_right > y_left (x and y overlap on the x-axis).

For x to contain z, we'd need:
- x_left <= z_left (x extends at least as far to the left as z)
- x_right >= z_right (x extends at least as far to the right as z)
- x_bottom <= z_bottom (x extends at least as far below as z)
- x_top >= z_top (x extends at least as far above as z)

But given that x_bottom >= y_top and y_top <= z_bottom, we have x_bottom >= z_bottom. This contradicts the requirement for x to contain z (which would need x_bottom <= z_bottom). So, x cannot contain z.

For z to contain x, we'd need:
- z_left <= x_left
- z_right >= x_right
- z_bottom <= x_bottom
- z_top >= x_top

Given that y_right <= z_left and x_left < y_right, we have x_left < z_left. This contradicts the requirement for z to contain x (which would need z_left <= x_left). So, z cannot contain x.

Since neither x can contain z nor z can contain x, the Bounding Box relation is not possible between x and z.

I was initially a bit confused because "Bounding Box" isn't typically a cardinal direction relation. The standard cardinal direction relations are North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest. "Bounding Box" might refer to a different type of spatial relation, indicating containment or partial overlap.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, if two regions overlap in both the x and y axes but neither contains the other, it's a more complex relation than just one of the eight cardinal directions.

But, let's revisit the Bounding Box definition:

Let's say Bounding Box means that the two regions overlap significantly, beyond the typical cardinal direction relations.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

I've already established that x is North, Northwest, or West of z. For a Bounding Box relation to also be possible, x and z would need to overlap in both the x and y axes.

On the y-axis, we know that MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z). This doesn't put any constraint on the relationship between MBR(x) and MBR(z) on the y-axis. They could overlap.

On the x-axis, we know that MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z), and MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y) on the x-axis. This means MBR(x) starts to the left of MBR(z), but it could potentially extend to the right and overlap with MBR(z).

So, a Bounding Box relation (or significant overlap) between x and z is theoretically possible.

But, the standard cardinal direction relations don't have a "Bounding Box" category. So, I think I've been overthinking this problem.

Let's simplify and summarize:

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is to the left and above z)
- West (if x is to the left and at the same level as z)
- North (if x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is above z)

But I've been overthinking this. I'd better double-check everything.

If y is Southwest of z, then y is below and to the left of z. If x is North of y, then x is above y with some overlap on the x-axis.

Let's reason about the possible locations of x relative to z:

1. x could be to the left of z on the x-axis. Given that y is to the left of z and x overlaps with y on the x-axis, this is a possibility.
2. x could overlap with z on the x-axis. Since the exact extents of x on the x-axis are not specified, only that it overlaps with y, this is also a possibility.
3. x could be entirely to the right of z on the x-axis. Since y is entirely to the left of z, and x overlaps with y on the x-axis, x must start to the left of z. So, x can't be entirely to the right of z.

On the y-axis:
1. x could be below z. But given that x is above y and y is below z, the relative positions of x and z on the y-axis aren't constrained directly.
2. x could be at the same level as z on the y-axis. This is possible.
3. x could be above z on the y-axis. This is possible.

Combining these possibilities:

1. If x is to the left of z on the x-axis and below z on the y-axis, then x is Southwest of z. But, I argued earlier that this isn't possible because x is above y and y is below z. Let me rethink this:
   - If y is Southwest of z, then y_top <= z_bottom (y is entirely below z).
   - If x is North of y, then x_bottom >= y_top (x is entirely above y).
   - Combining these, we get x_bottom >= z_bottom, which means x can't be entirely below z. So, x can't be Southwest of z.

2. If x is to the left of z on the x-axis and at the same level as z on the y-axis, then x is West of z. This is possible.

3. If x is to the left of z on the x-axis and above z on the y-axis, then x is Northwest of z. This is possible.

4. If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is below z on the y-axis, then x is South of z. But, as we established earlier, x can't be entirely below z. So, x can't be South of z.

5. If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is at the same level as z on the y-axis, then the relation could be described as "Equal" or perhaps "Bounding Box" in some contexts. But, this doesn't fit into the standard cardinal direction relations. Since we're focusing on cardinal directions, I'll exclude this.

6. If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is above z on the y-axis, then x is North of z. This is possible.

7. If x is to the right of z on the x-axis and below z on the y-axis, then x is Southeast of z. But, as established earlier, x can't be entirely to the right of z or entirely below z. So, x can't be Southeast of z.

8. If x is to the right of z on the x-axis and at the same level as z on the y-axis, then x is East of z. But, as established earlier, x can't be entirely to the right of z. So, x can't be East of z.

9. If x is to the right of z on the x-axis and above z on the y-axis, then x is Northeast of z. But, as established earlier, x can't be entirely to the right of z. So, x can't be Northeast of z.

Based on the above, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, and North.

Hold on, do we need to include the Bounding Box relation? Actually, upon more careful consideration, the Bounding Box relation is a special type of spatial relation that indicates one region is inside or partially inside another, or vice versa. It's not one of the eight cardinal direction relations.

So, the answer is that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, and North.

Actually, let me be more systematic to think the Bounding Box situation through.

If we define the Cardinal Direction Relation model based on the 9-intersection model, then we have the following relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

Let's systematically analyze the possibilities:

1. North (N): x is above z with some overlap on the x-axis. This is possible, as I've reasoned above.
2. Northeast (NE): x is above and to the right of z. But, given that y is to the left of z and x overlaps with y on the x-axis, x must start to the left of z. So, x can't be entirely to the right of z. Hence, x can't be Northeast of z.
3. East (E): x is to the right of z with some overlap on the y-axis. As established, x can't be entirely to the right of z. So, x can't be East of z.
4. Southeast (SE): x is below and to the right of z. But, x can't be entirely to the right of z or entirely below z. So, x can't be Southeast of z.
5. South (S): x is below z with some overlap on the x-axis. But, as established, x can't be entirely below z. So, x can't be South of z.
6. Southwest (SW): x is below and to the left of z. But, as established, x can't be entirely below z. So, x can't be Southwest of z.
7. West (W): x is to the left of z with some overlap on the y-axis. This is possible, as I've reasoned above.
8. Northwest (NW): x is above and to the left of z. This is possible, as I've reasoned above.
9. Bounding Box (BB): This typically means that either one region is completely inside the other or they have significant overlap in both the x and y axes, beyond the typical cardinal direction relations.

For the Bounding Box relation, I need to be more careful.

Given:
- x is North of y: MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y) with some overlap on the x-axis.
- y is Southwest of z: MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z).

For a Bounding Box relation, I need to check if x and z have a relationship where one is inside the other or they have significant overlap.

First, let's check if x can be inside z:
For x to be inside z, z must completely surround x. Given that x is North of y, x is above y. Given that y is Southwest of z, y is below and to the left of z. So, x is somewhere above y, which is below and to the left of z. It's not clear if x is inside z. Actually, it's clear x cannot be inside z. Let me check this more carefully:

In cardinal directions, for x to be in a Bounding Box relation with z (specifically, for x to be inside z), MBR(x) would need to be completely contained within MBR(z). Given that x is North of y, MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y). Given that y is Southwest of z, MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z). From these, I can infer that MBR(x) is somewhere above and potentially to the left of MBR(z). It's not guaranteed that MBR(x) is completely contained within MBR(z). In fact, it's quite likely that MBR(x) extends outside of MBR(z), especially on the left side.

Now, let's check if z can be inside x:
For z to be inside x, x must completely surround z. Given the constraints, it's not clear if this is possible. It depends on the exact sizes and positions of the regions. If x is very large and extends far to the right and upwards, it could potentially surround z.

So, the Bounding Box relation is a possibility, especially if z is inside x. But, it's not a definite relation given the constraints.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, North, and potentially Bounding Box.

Actually, hang on, to be absolutely sure. The cardinal direction calculus (CDC) is a commonsense spatial reasoning formalism that divides the 2D space around a region into nine tiles: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and an unnamed ninth tile which is the original region itself. This ninth tile might be what's referred to as "Bounding Box" in the question.

I've already established that the possible relations between x and z based on the given constraints are West, Northwest, and North.

Can x and z have a relation where they share the same space (the "Bounding Box" relation)? Given that x is North of y, x is above y. Given that y is Southwest of z, y is below and to the left of z. These constraints don't directly determine the relationship between x and z, especially in terms of sharing the same space. It's theoretically possible for x and z to have significant overlap, but this would require x to extend far to the right and for z to extend upwards.

I'm inclined to say that the Bounding Box relation is a possibility, but it's not a definite relation given the constraints.

Actually let me put a clarify the definition of Bounding Box. Confusingly, there are competing CDC models, depending on whether we consider "Bounding Box" (or an equivalent relation) a separate relation from North, Northeast, East, etc., or not. Let me call this model the "Rectangle Algebra" where regions are represented by rectangles.

In the Rectangle Algebra, there are 169 different relations. The 9x9 = 81 of these 169 relations are called the tilelike part. We get 81 when we have 9 distinct choices of a tile relation on each axis. But there are also non-tilelike relations.

The 9 basic relations in this algebra in a single dimension are: 
- before (<): the first rectangle is entirely to the left of the second
- meets (m): the first rectangle's right edge meets the second rectangle's left edge
- overlaps (o): the rectangles overlap, but neither is contained in the other
- starts (s): the first rectangle starts at the same point as the second, but ends before it
- during (d): the first rectangle is completely contained in the second
- finishes (f): the first rectangle ends at the same point as the second, but starts after it
- equals (eq): the rectangles are identical
- finishes inverse (fi): the second rectangle ends at the same point as the first, but starts after it
- during inverse (di): the second rectangle is completely contained in the first
- starts inverse (si): the second rectangle starts at the same point as the first, but ends before it
- overlaps inverse (oi): the rectangles overlap, but neither is contained in the other
- meets inverse (mi): the second rectangle's right edge meets the first rectangle's left edge
- before inverse (>): the second rectangle is entirely to the left of the first

But we don't need to worry too much about all 169 possible relations from the Rectangle Algebra. Based on my reasoning above, let's see which of the standard cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) and the Bounding Box relation are possible between x and z given the constraints.

Based on previous analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, and North.

As for the Bounding Box relation, I'm still not entirely sure of its precise definition in the context of the problem. But if it refers to a relation where the regions share significant space or one is inside the other, then it could be a possibility depending on the exact sizes and positions of the regions.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, North, and potentially Bounding Box (depending on its precise definition).

Actually, since the answers are supposed to include "one or more of these: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box", let me just include Bounding Box in the answer.

So the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, North, and Bounding Box.

However, I think I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me revisit the problem once more with a simplified approach.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

I'm asked to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's represent the regions as points (or centers of regions) for simplicity, with the understanding that in reality, they are areas.

If y is Southwest of z, then y is below and to the left of z. Let's say z is at (0, 0), then y might be at (-1, -1).

If x is North of y, then x is directly above y. So, if y is at (-1, -1), then x might be at (-1, 0) or (-1, 1) or any point directly above y.

Now, what's the relation between x and z?

z is at (0, 0) and x is at (-1, 0) or (-1, 1) or any point with x-coordinate -1 and y-coordinate >= 0.

If x is at (-1, 0), then x is directly to the left of z, which makes x West of z.
If x is at (-1, 1) or any point with y-coordinate > 0, then x is to the left and above z, which makes x Northwest of z.
If x is at (-1, -0.5) (between y and z on the y-axis), then x is to the left and below z, which makes x Southwest of z. But this isn't possible because x is North of y, and y is already at (-1, -1), which is as low as one can go on the y-axis.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: West and Northwest.

But this simplistic representation doesn't account for the possibility of x being North of z or the Bounding Box relation. Let's refine my understanding.

If we represent the regions as rectangles (or MBRs):

If y is Southwest of z, then MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z).
If x is North of y, then MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y).

Given these, MBR(x) must start to the left of MBR(z) (because MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z) and MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y) on the x-axis). But MBR(x) could potentially extend to the right and overlap with or go beyond MBR(z).

On the y-axis, MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z). This means MBR(x) could be below, overlap with, or be above MBR(z) on the y-axis. But, we've established that MBR(x) can't be entirely below MBR(z), which rules out the South and Southwest relations.

Also, given that MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z), and MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y) on the x-axis, MBR(x) must at least partially be to the left of MBR(z). This rules out the East, Northeast, and Southeast relations.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, and North. And, as discussed, the Bounding Box relation (with some interpretation) could be a possibility depending on the exact positions and sizes of the regions.

Given the constraints and my systematic analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, North, and Bounding Box.

Let's double-check:

1. West (W): x is to the left of z with some overlap on the y-axis. This is possible.
2. Northwest (NW): x is above and to the left of z. This is possible.
3. North (N): x is above z with some overlap on the x-axis. This is possible.
4. Bounding Box (BB): This refers to a relation where the regions share significant space or one is inside the other. This could be a possibility, although I'm not entirely sure of its precise definition in the context of the problem.

Actually, I just realized that Bounding Box is another way of say "equals" or "overlaps", which is not one of the 8 cardinal direction relations. 

So, my answer is that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, and North.

Wait, Bounding Box is a listed in the problem prompt as a possible answer. Thinking more carefully, in the context of cardinal direction relations, Bounding Box might refer to a relation where the regions have significant overlap or one is inside the other, beyond the typical cardinal direction relations.

Given the constraints (x is North of y, y is Southwest of z), it's not clear if x and z have a relationship where they share the same space. It's theoretically possible, depending on the exact positions and sizes of the regions. So, the Bounding Box relation is a possibility.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, North, and Bounding Box.

Now, let me test the Bounding Box relationship in more detail to verify it's a valid relation.

Let me draw a picture in 1D with 3 points on the real number line. 
y is to the left of z. So y < z.
x is above y. Well, this doesn't make sense in 1D. So let's see the 2D case.

Let's represent points in 2D. y is to the southwest of z. So y.x < z.x and y.y < z.y.
x is to the north of y. So x.x == y.x and x.y > y.y.
So x.x == y.x < z.x and y.y < x.y.

So x.x < z.x. So x has to be to the left of z, which means it can't be at the same position as z. So the Bounding Box relation isn't possible.

Let me revisit my understanding of Bounding Box. In the context of cardinal direction relations, the Bounding Box relation might refer to a relation where one region is completely inside the other or they have significant overlap.

Given:
- x is North of y: MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y) with some overlap on the x-axis.
- y is Southwest of z: MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z).

For a Bounding Box relation, I need to check if x and z have a relationship where one is inside the other or they have significant overlap.

If MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z), it's not guaranteed that MBR(x) and MBR(z) have any overlap. MBR(x) is somewhere above MBR(y), which is below and to the left of MBR(z). MBR(x) could be to the left, above, or to the left and above MBR(z).

Given that MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y) on the x-axis, and MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z), MBR(x) must at least partially be to the left of MBR(z). This means MBR(x) can't be entirely to the right of MBR(z).

Considering Bounding Box, I interpret this to mean the MBR of x and the MBR of z meet. They could meet for many possible relations, but given the cardinal direction context, I'm assuming this means they contain each other, or to use the relational algebra above, one is "during" the other, or they are equal.

For x to be inside z, MBR(x) would need to be completely contained within MBR(z). But I've shown earlier that MBR(x) must start to the left of MBR(z), which means it's unlikely for MBR(x) to be completely inside MBR(z).

For z to be inside x, MBR(z) would need to be completely contained within MBR(x). This is also a stretct, given that MBR(y) is entirely below and to the left of MBR(z), and MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y). It's unclear if MBR(x) extends far enough to the right to completely contain MBR(z).

But it's very unlikely, even impossible, for either x to be inside z or z to be inside x.

Given the constraints, it's unlikely, even impossible, for the Bounding Box relation to be a valid relation between x and z.

Actually, the Bounding Box relation could be referring to the relation "O" where the interiors of the two regions intersect. O is a more general topological relation from the RCC (Region Connection Calculus) set, and it could indeed be possible between x and z.

Given that MBR(x) is somewhere above MBR(y), which is below and to the left of MBR(z), and MBR(x) could extend to the right, it's possible for MBR(x) and MBR(z) to have overlapping interiors.

On the y-axis, MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely below MBR(z). This means MBR(x) is somewhere above MBR(y), but its relation to MBR(z) on the y-axis is not directly constrained.

On the x-axis, MBR(x) overlaps with MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely to the left of MBR(z). This means MBR(x) is at least partially to the left of MBR(z), but it could extend to the right and overlap with MBR(z).

So, it's possible for MBR(x) and MBR(z) to have overlapping interiors, which might be what's referred to as the Bounding Box relation in the context of the problem.

Now, let me reason about the remaining cardinal direction relations:

1. East (E): x is to the right of z with some overlap on the y-axis. Given that MBR(x) is at least partially to the left of MBR(z), it's unlikely for MBR(x) to be entirely to the right of MBR(z). So, x is unlikely to be East of z.

2. Northeast (NE): x is above and to the right of z. Given that MBR(x) is at least partially to the left of MBR(z), it's unlikely for MBR(x) to be entirely to the right of MBR(z). So, x is unlikely to be Northeast of z.

3. Southeast (SE): x is below and to the right of z. Given that MBR(x) is at least partially to the left of MBR(z) and entirely above MBR(y), which is below MBR(z), it's unlikely for MBR(x) to be entirely to the right and below MBR(z). So, x is unlikely to be Southeast of z.

4. South (S): x is below z with some overlap on the x-axis. Given that MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), which is below MBR(z), it's unlikely for MBR(x) to be entirely below MBR(z). So, x is unlikely to be South of z.

5. Southwest (SW): x is below and to the left of z. Given that MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), which is below MBR(z), it's unlikely for MBR(x) to be entirely below MBR(z). So, x is unlikely to be Southwest of z.

6. West (W): x is to the left of z with some overlap on the y-axis. Given that MBR(x) is at least partially to the left of MBR(z), it's possible for MBR(x) to be entirely to the left of MBR(z) with some overlap on the y-axis. So, x could be West of z.

7. Northwest (NW): x is above and to the left of z. Given that MBR(x) is at least partially to the left of MBR(z) and is entirely above MBR(y), which is below MBR(z), it's possible for MBR(x) to be entirely above and to the left of MBR(z). So, x could be Northwest of z.

8. North (N): x is above z with some overlap on the x-axis. Given that MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(y), which is below MBR(z), and MBR(x) could extend to the right and overlap with MBR(z) on the x-axis, it's possible for MBR(x) to be entirely above MBR(z) with some overlap on the x-axis. So, x could be North of z.

Based on this reasoning, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, and North. And, if Bounding Box refers to regions with overlapping interiors, then it's also a possibility.

So, my answer is that the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, North, and Bounding Box.

Actually, upon further reflection, let me be even more precise in my reasoning.

We are using a Cartesian coordinate system, where north is the positive y-direction and east is the positive x-direction.

If region y is to the southwest of region z, then y is below and to the left of z. If we denote the coordinates of the center of region y as (y_x, y_y) and the coordinates of the center of region z as (z_x, z_y), then y_x < z_x and y_y < z_y.

If region x is to the north of region y, then x is directly above y. In terms of coordinates, the center of region x, (x_x, x_y), has the same x-coordinate as the center of region y, and a higher y-coordinate. So, x_x = y_x and x_y > y_y.

Now, we can determine the relation between region x and region z.

From the above, we have:
- x_x = y_x
- x_y > y_y
- y_x < z_x
- y_y < z_y

We can derive:
- x_x = y_x < z_x, which means x is to the left of z.
- x_y > y_y, but the relationship between x_y and z_y is not directly determined.

If x_y > z_y, then x is to the left and above z, which means x is to the northwest of z.

If x_y = z_y, then x is directly to the left of z, which means x is to the west of z.

If x_y < z_y, then x is to the left and below z, which means x is to the southwest of z. However, we know that x_y > y_y and y_y < z_y. These don't directly determine the relationship between x_y and z_y, but the constraint is that x_y > y_y.

So, based on the coordinates, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest and West. And also, if x_y < z_y, then Southwest.

Given that x_y > y_y and y_y < z_y, is it possible for x_y < z_y? Yes, it's possible. For example, if y_y = 1, z_y = 10, and x_y = 5, then x_y > y_y and y_y < z_y, but x_y < z_y.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

But wait, earlier I argued that Southwest isn't a possible relation. Let me re-examine why.

If region y is to the southwest of region z, then the top of region y is below the bottom of region z. If region x is to the north of region y, then the bottom of region x is above the top of region y. This means the bottom of region x is above the bottom of region z. So, it's impossible for region x to be to the southwest of region z, which would require the top of region x to be below the bottom of region z.

So, my reasoning using coordinates was incorrect. The possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest and West.

But I also argued earlier for the possibility of North. Let me check if North is a possible relation.

If region y is to the southwest of region z, then region y is to the left of region z. If region x is to the north of region y, then region x is directly above region y. So, region x is to the left of region z, but it could extend to the right and overlap with region z on the x-axis, which would make it to the north of region z.

Upon reflection, I don't think North is a possible relation. If region x is to the north of region y, then it's directly above region y, which means it has the same x-extent as region y. If region y is to the southwest of region z, then region y is entirely to the left of region z. This means region x is also entirely to the left of region z, which rules out the North relation, which would require region x to overlap with region z on the x-axis.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest and West.

But this doesn't really make sense. Let's reconsider.

In the cardinal direction model, the directions are defined by extending lines from the extremities of the reference region.

Wait, let me keep at least one constraint on the regions: if region a is North of region b, then
the northernmost point of region a is north of the northernmost point of region b.
the southernmost point of region a is north of the southernmost point of region b.
the easternmost point of region a is east of the easternmost point of region b.
the westernmost point of region a is west of the westernmost point of region b.

OK, let's try using the definition directly. Using the cardinal direction relations:

1. North (N): x is above z with some overlap on the x-axis.
2. Northeast (NE): x is above and to the right of z.
3. East (E): x is to the right of z with some overlap on the y-axis.
4. Southeast (SE): x is below and to the right of z.
5. South (S): x is below z with some overlap on the x-axis.
6. Southwest (SW): x is below and to the left of z.
7. West (W): x is to the left of z with some overlap on the y-axis.
8. Northwest (NW): x is above and to the left of z.
9. Bounding Box (BB): x and z overlap significantly or one is inside the other.

Given:
- x is North of y: x is above y with some overlap on the x-axis.
- y is Southwest of z: y is below and to the left of z.

x's position relative to y means x is directly above y. Y's position relative to z means it is to the southwest of z. 

Now, considering x's position relative to z, we can infer that:
- Since y is to the left of z, and x is directly above y, x must also be to the left of z.
- Since y is below z, and x is above y, the vertical relationship between x and z is not directly determined.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, x is to the left of z, which means it's in the West, Northwest, or Southwest direction relative to z, depending on its vertical relationship with z. 

So, in the vertical dimension, we have:
- y is below z
- x is above y

Is it possible for x to be below z? Given that x is above y, and y is below z, this would require x to be between y and z on the vertical axis. This is possible.

So, x could be to the left and below z (Southwest), to the left and at the same level as z (West), or to the left and above z (Northwest).

Applying this reasoning to the cardinal direction relations:

1. North (N): x is above z with some overlap on the x-axis. Since x is to the left of z, it's not possible for x to be North of z.
2. Northeast (NE): x is above and to the right of z. Since x is to the left of z, it's not possible for x to be Northeast of z.
3. East (E): x is to the right of z with some overlap on the y-axis. Since x is to the left of z, it's not possible for x to be East of z.
4. Southeast (SE): x is below and to the right of z. Since x is to the left of z, it's not possible for x to be Southeast of z.
5. South (S): x is below z with some overlap on the x-axis. Since x is to the left of z, it's not possible for x to be South of z.
6. Southwest (SW): x is below and to the left of z. This is possible if x is between y and z on the vertical axis.
7. West (W): x is to the left of z with some overlap on the y-axis. This is possible if x is at the same level as z on the vertical axis.
8. Northwest (NW): x is above and to the left of z. This is possible if x is above both y and z on the vertical axis.
9. Bounding Box (BB): x and z overlap significantly or one is inside the other. Since x is to the left of z, they don't overlap significantly, and one is not inside the other. So, the Bounding Box relation is not possible.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me just make some concrete examples to confirm.

Example 1:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, -1), which is to the southwest of z
- x is at (-1, 0), which is to the north of y

In this case, x is directly to the left of z, which means x is West of z.

Example 2:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, -1), which is to the southwest of z
- x is at (-1, 1), which is to the north of y

In this case, x is to the left and above z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Example 3:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (-1, -2), which is to the southwest of z
- x is at (-1, -1), which is to the north of y

In this case, x is to the left and below z, which means x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: Southwest, West, and Northwest.

But is Southwest really a possible relation? I've argued above that it should be, then I argued above that it shouldn't be, and then I showed a concrete example where it is a possible relation.

Actually, Southwest doesn't make sense. For a Southwest relation, both the northernmost and southernmost parts of x need to be south of z, and both the easternmost and westernmost parts of x need to be west of z.

Now, we know that y is southwest of z. This means the northernmost part of y is south of the southernmost part of z, and the easternmost part of y is west of the westernmost part of z. We also know that x is north of y. This means the southernmost part of x is north of the northernmost part of y. 

Given these, can both the northernmost and southernmost parts of x be south of the southernmost part of z? 

Well, the southernmost part of x is north of the northernmost part of y, which is south of the southernmost part of z. So the southernmost part of x is somewhere between the northernmost part of y and the southernmost part of z. But the northernmost part of x is even further north than its southernmost part, so the northernmost part of x might be north of the southernmost part of z.

Since x is north of y, x's northernmost part must be north of y's northernmost part, and y's northernmost part must be south of z's southernmost part (since y is southwest of z). Therefore, we cannot determine if x's northernmost part is north or south of z's southernmost part.

Given the constraints, if y's northernmost part is only slightly south of z's southernmost part, and x's southernmost part is only slightly north of y's northernmost part, then x's southernmost part could be south of z's southernmost part, which would make x to the southwest of z. But if the distances are larger, then x's southernmost part might be north of z's southernmost part, which would rule out the Southwest relation.

So, without more specific information about the distances, the Southwest relation is a theoretical possibility.

My gut feeling is that there's something missing in my reasoning, but I've thought about this in several ways.

In the literature, the cardinal direction relations are defined using the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the region, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Actually, another thing I'm confused about is if the "North" relation means that x is strictly in the north of y (they don't overlap), or that x is in the northern half of y (there's overlap). I think I'm getting confused by what the authors intended by "North".

From our given information, region x is North of region y an
