PROMPT: Let  South and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem carefully.

We're told:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Northeast of region z

And we need to determine what relation(s) could hold between region x and region z.

First, let's clarify what these cardinal direction relations mean:
- South: The first region is directly below the second region
- Northeast: The first region is above and to the right of the second region

Let's think about the positions of the regions. If we use a coordinate system where:
- North is the positive y direction
- East is the positive x direction
- South is the negative y direction
- West is the negative x direction

Then:
- x is South of y means x has the same x-coordinate as y, but a lower y-coordinate
- y is Northeast of z means y has a higher x-coordinate and a higher y-coordinate than z

Now, let's determine the possible relationship between x and z.

If:
- x is South of y: x is directly below y
- y is Northeast of z: y is above and to the right of z

That means:
- x is directly below y
- y is above and to the right of z

So where is x relative to z?

We know that x is below y, and y is above z. But y is also to the right of z. 

Let's think about this in terms of coordinates:
- If y is at position (y_x, y_y)
- Then x is at approximately (y_x, y_y - some_distance)
- And z is at approximately (y_x - some_distance, y_y - some_distance)

So x is at (y_x, y_y - some_distance) and z is at (y_x - some_distance, y_y - some_distance).

Comparing the coordinates of x and z:
- x_x = y_x, which is greater than z_x = y_x - some_distance
- x_y = y_y - some_distance, which could be greater than, equal to, or less than z_y = y_y - some_distance, depending on the specific distances involved

So x is to the east of z (since x_x > z_x). 

As for the north-south relationship:
- If x is farther below y than z is below y, then x is south of z
- If x is the same distance below y as z is below y, then x is at the same latitude as z
- If x is less below y than z is below y, then x is north of z

But we know that y is northeast of z, which means y is above z, and z is southwest of y. Since x is south of y, x must be below y.

Actually, I think I'm making this too complicated. Let me try a simpler approach using a diagram.

Let's set up a coordinate system and place the regions:

z: (0, 0)
y: (1, 1) [Northeast of z]
x: (1, 0) [South of y]

Now, what's the relationship between x and z?
x is at (1, 0) and z is at (0, 0).
So x is East of z.

But wait, this is just one possible configuration. Let me see if there are others.

I've made an assumption about the exact positions, but the cardinal directions only specify regions, not exact points. Let's consider the full implications of the cardinal direction relations.

If region y is Northeast of region z, then y is somewhere in the quadrant that is both North and East of z. It doesn't have to be exactly at the 45-degree angle.

Similarly, if region x is South of region y, then x is somewhere directly below y, with the same range of East-West positions as y.

So, x could be:
- Southeast of z (if x is far enough East)
- South of z (if x is directly South of z)
- East of z (if x is directly East of z)
- Northeast of z (if x is far enough North)
- Bounding box relationship (if none of the cardinal directions apply)

Actually, let's be more rigorous. The cardinal direction relations are defined by the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. 

If region x is South of region y, it means the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y, with some overlap in the East-West extent.

If region y is Northeast of region z, it means the MBR of y is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of z.

Given these constraints, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

If x is South of y, then the x-coordinate range of x overlaps with the x-coordinate range of y.
If y is Northeast of z, then the x-coordinate range of y is entirely to the right of the x-coordinate range of z.

Since the x-coordinate range of x overlaps with y, and y is entirely to the right of z, the x-coordinate range of x must be at least partially to the right of z. It could be entirely to the right of z, or it could overlap.

Now, let's consider the y-coordinates:
If x is South of y, then the y-coordinate range of x is entirely below the y-coordinate range of y.
If y is Northeast of z, then the y-coordinate range of y is entirely above the y-coordinate range of z.

From these, we can't definitively determine whether x is above, below, or at the same level as z. It depends on the specific positions of the regions.

Let's consider specific configurations to explore the possible relationships:

Configuration 1:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (2, 0) to (3, 1) [South of y]

In this configuration, x is East of z.

Configuration 2:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (1, 2) to (2, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (1, 0) to (2, 1) [South of y]

In this configuration, x overlaps with z in the East-West extent, but is at the same level in the North-South extent. This doesn't cleanly fit into a cardinal direction relation, so it would be a Bounding Box relationship.

Configuration 3:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (1, 2) to (2, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (1, -1) to (2, 0) [South of y]

In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

Configuration 4:
z: (0, 2) to (1, 3)
y: (2, 4) to (3, 5) [Northeast of z]
x: (2, 0) to (3, 3) [South of y]

In this configuration, x and z overlap in the North-South extent, but x is East of z. This would be an East relationship.

I'm not sure I can find a configuration where x is Northeast, Northwest, or Southwest of z given the constraints. Let's see if they're possible.

For x to be Northeast of z, x would need to be both North and East of z. But since x is South of y, and y is North of z (being Northeast of z), it seems unlikely that x would be North of z.

For x to be Northwest of z, x would need to be both North and West of z. But since y is East of z (being Northeast of z), and x overlaps with y in the East-West extent (being South of y), it seems unlikely that x would be West of z.

For x to be Southwest of z, x would need to be both South and West of z. Given the constraints, it seems unlikely, for similar reasons as the Northwest case.

So, based on the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Bounding Box

Actually, let me be more careful and consider a few more configurations.

Configuration 5:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (0, -1) to (3, 0) [South of y]

In this configuration, x is South of z.

Configuration 6:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (0, 2) to (1, 3) [Northeast of z, assuming a broad interpretation]
x: (0, -1) to (1, 0) [South of y]

In this configuration, x is South of z.

I'm still not seeing how x could be Northeast, Northwest, or Southwest of z given the constraints. But let me double check if there are any edge cases.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. 

For region y to be Northeast of region z, the MBR of y doesn't have to be entirely to the right of the MBR of z. It just needs to be in the Northeast quadrant relative to z.

I don't think I specified these relations correctly earlier. Let me revisit the definitions of cardinal direction relations for MBRs.

For two MBRs, the cardinal direction relation is determined by the relative positions of the MBRs. 

For MBR1 to be North of MBR2, the southern edge of MBR1 must be at or above the northern edge of MBR2, and they must overlap in the East-West extent.

For MBR1 to be Northeast of MBR2, the southern edge of MBR1 must be at or above the northern edge of MBR2, and the western edge of MBR1 must be at or to the right of the eastern edge of MBR2.

With these proper definitions, let's reconsider the problem.

If region y is Northeast of region z, then the MBR of y is above and to the right of the MBR of z, with no overlap.

If region x is South of region y, then the MBR of x is below the MBR of y, with overlap in the East-West extent.

Given these constraints, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z.

From the East-West perspective, the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z (given y is Northeast of z). The MBR of x overlaps with the MBR of y in the East-West extent (given x is South of y). This means at least a part of the MBR of x is to the right of the MBR of z.

From the North-South perspective, the MBR of y is entirely above the MBR of z (given y is Northeast of z). The MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y (given x is South of y). From this, we can't determine the North-South relationship between x and z.

Let's consider a few configurations:

Configuration 1:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (2, 0) to (3, 1) [South of y]

In this configuration, x is East of z.

Configuration 2:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (1.5, 0) to (3.5, 1) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is East of z.

Configuration 3:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (1, -1) to (4, 0) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x overlaps with z in the East-West extent, but is South of z. This would be a South relationship.

Configuration 4:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (0.5, -1) to (4.5, 0) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x completely encloses z in the East-West extent and is South of z. This would still be a South relationship.

Configuration 5:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (2, 1.5) to (3, 1.9) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is East of z and North of z. This would be a Northeast relationship.

So, it seems the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- East
- South
- Northeast
- Southeast (if x is both East and South of z)
- Bounding Box (if none of the cardinal directions apply)

Hmm, I'm having a hard time imagining how a bounding box relation between x and z would look given the constraints that y is Northeast of z, and x is South of y. Let me try to visualize a specific configuration to understand this better. 

Actually, it seems like the relationship between x and z is going to be one of: East, South, Northeast, or Southeast. 

Let me think about a few more cases.

Configuration 6:
z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
y: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
x: (2.5, 0.5) to (2.6, 1.9) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is East of z, but overlaps with z in the North-South extent. This would be an East relationship.

Now, what about Northwest or West?

For x to be Northwest of z, it would need to be both North and West of z. Given that y is Northeast of z, and x is South of y, it's hard to imagine a configuration where x is both North and West of z.

Similarly, for x to be West of z, it would need to be to the left of z. But given that y is to the right of z (being Northeast of z), and x overlaps with y in the East-West extent (being South of y), it's challenging to conceive a configuration where x is West of z.

For x to be Southwest of z, it would need to be both South and West of z. Given the constraints, it seems unlikely, for similar reasons as the West case.

So, based on the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- East
- South
- Northeast
- Southeast

Let me carefully check if there are any other possibilities, especially if we allow for regions with more complex shapes. I've been considering regions with MBRs, which are rectangles.

Actually, I realize that I made a mistake earlier when interpreting the meaning of cardinal direction relations. The confusion arises from different ways to define cardinal direction relations.

One approach is based on centroids, where the cardinal direction is determined by the relative position of the centroids of the two regions.

Another approach is based on MBRs, which I described above.

But there's also a third approach, which is the one I should have been using: the projection-based approach. In this approach, the cardinal direction is determined by projecting the regions onto the x and y axes.

For region A to be North of region B, the entire projection of A onto the y-axis must be above the entire projection of B onto the y-axis.

For region A to be Northeast of region B, the entire projection of A onto the y-axis must be above the entire projection of B onto the y-axis, AND the entire projection of A onto the x-axis must be to the right of the entire projection of B onto the x-axis.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider the problem.

If region y is Northeast of region z, then y is entirely above and to the right of z.

If region x is South of region y, then x is entirely below y.

Given these constraints, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z.

From the East-West perspective, y is entirely to the right of z. x can overlap with y in the East-West extent, so x can be partially or fully to the right of z, or it can overlap with z in the East-West extent.

From the North-South perspective, y is entirely above z. x is entirely below y. So, x can be at the same level as z, above z, or below z.

Let's explore the possibilities:

1. x is entirely to the right of z and entirely above z: x is Northeast of z.
2. x is entirely to the right of z and at the same level as z: x is East of z.
3. x is entirely to the right of z and entirely below z: x is Southeast of z.
4. x overlaps with z in the East-West extent and is entirely above z: x is North of z.
5. x overlaps with z in the East-West extent and is entirely below z: x is South of z.
6. x overlaps with z in both the East-West and North-South extents: This would be a Bounding Box relationship.

I don't think x can be West, Northwest, or Southwest of z given the constraints.

So, based on the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- North
- South
- Bounding Box

Actually, hold on. I just realized that there's actually a standard set of cardinal direction relations, introduced by Frank, that's commonly used in qualitative spatial reasoning. The relations are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

Let's use these definitions and reconsider the problem.

If region y is Northeast of region z, then y is in the Northeast sector of z. This means y is both North and East of z.

If region x is South of region y, then x is in the South sector of y. This means x is South of y.

Given these constraints, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z.

We know that y is Northeast of z, which means y is in the upper-right quadrant relative to z. x is South of y, which means x is directly below y.

Let's use a coordinate system to visualize:

z is at the origin (0, 0).
y is in the Northeast quadrant, say at (1, 1).
x is directly below y, say at (1, -1).

In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

But this is just one possible configuration. Let's see if there are others.

Suppose z is at (0, 0), y is at (2, 2), and x is at (2, 1). In this case, x is East of z.

Suppose z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, 3), and x is at (1, 0). In this case, x is East of z.

Suppose z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, 2), and x is at (1, -1). In this case, x is Southeast of z.

I'm not seeing a clear way to have x be North, Northeast, South, Southwest, West, or Northwest of z given the constraints.

Let's double-check if x can be South of z. For this to happen, x would need to be directly below z.

Suppose z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, 1), and x is at (1, -2). In this case, x is Southeast of z, not South.

It seems like the constraint that y is Northeast of z forces x to be either East or Southeast of z, given that x is South of y.

Let's check one more case:

Suppose z is at (0, 0), y is at (0.1, 2), and x is at (0.1, -1). In this case, x is very slightly to the East of z but mostly South. This could be considered a South relation in some interpretations.

So, based on the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- East
- Southeast
- South (in some interpretations)

Wait, I need to be more careful about the definitions. The cardinal direction relations are often defined using the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle (with sides parallel to the coordinate axes) that contains the entire region.

Given this, let's redefine the cardinal direction relations:

- North: The MBR of one region is entirely above the MBR of the other, with some overlap in the East-West extent.
- Northeast: The MBR of one region is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of the other.
- East: The MBR of one region is entirely to the right of the MBR of the other, with some overlap in the North-South extent.
- Southeast: The MBR of one region is entirely below and to the right of the MBR of the other.
- South: The MBR of one region is entirely below the MBR of the other, with some overlap in the East-West extent.
- Southwest: The MBR of one region is entirely below and to the left of the MBR of the other.
- West: The MBR of one region is entirely to the left of the MBR of the other, with some overlap in the North-South extent.
- Northwest: The MBR of one region is entirely above and to the left of the MBR of the other.
- Bounding Box: The MBRs of the two regions overlap.

With these definitions, let's reconsider the problem.

If region y is Northeast of region z, then the MBR of y is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of z.

If region x is South of region y, then the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y, with some overlap in the East-West extent.

Given these constraints, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z.

We know that the MBR of y is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of z. We also know that the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y, with some overlap in the East-West extent.

Let's visualize:
- z's MBR is at the origin (0, 0) to (1, 1).
- y's MBR is at (2, 2) to (3, 3) (Northeast of z).
- x's MBR could be at (2, 0) to (3, 1) (South of y, with overlap in East-West with y).

In this configuration, x is East of z.

But x's MBR could also be at (1, 0) to (4, 1) (South of y, with overlap in East-West with y). In this case, x has a Bounding Box relationship with z.

x's MBR could also be at (2.5, -1) to (2.6, 1.5) (South of y, with overlap in East-West with y). In this case, x is East of z.

It seems like the possible relationships between x and z, given the constraints, are:
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Bounding Box

I'm not sure if x can be Northeast of z given the constraints. Let's check.

For x to be Northeast of z, the MBR of x would need to be entirely above and to the right of the MBR of z. Given that x is South of y, and y is Northeast of z, it's challenging to conceive a configuration where x is Northeast of z.

Similarly, I don't think x can be North, Northwest, West, or Southwest of z given the constraints.

So, based on the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Bounding Box

Actually, hold on. Let me check if x can be North of z, i.e., the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of z, with some overlap in the East-West extent.

Suppose:
- z's MBR is at (0, 0) to (3, 1).
- y's MBR is at (4, 3) to (5, 4) (Northeast of z).
- x's MBR is at (4, 2) to (5, 2.5) (South of y, with overlap in East-West with y).

In this configuration, x is East of z, not North.

Let's try another configuration.

Suppose:
- z's MBR is at (0, 0) to (5, 1).
- y's MBR is at (6, 3) to (7, 4) (Northeast of z).
- x's MBR is at (3, 2) to (8, 2.5) (South of y, with overlap in East-West with y).

In this configuration, x overlaps with z in the East-West extent and is above z. This would be a North relationship.

So, it seems like x can be North of z given the constraints.

What about Northeast? For x to be Northeast of z, the MBR of x would need to be entirely above and to the right of the MBR of z.

Suppose:
- z's MBR is at (0, 0) to (1, 1).
- y's MBR is at (3, 3) to (4, 4) (Northeast of z).
- x's MBR is at (2, 2) to (5, 2.5) (South of y, with overlap in East-West with y).

In this configuration, x is above and to the right of z. This would be a Northeast relationship.

So, it seems like x can be Northeast of z given the constraints.

Let's combine all the findings. Based on the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Bounding Box

Actually, let me revisit this to be 100% sure. I think I may have made a mistake in my analysis. 

The question: If region x is South of region y and region y is Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

Let's visualize the case on a coordinate system. I'll use the common convention where North is the positive y-direction, and East is the positive x-direction.

If y is Northeast of z, then y is in the first quadrant from z. Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity.

If y is Northeast of z, then y is in the quadrant where both x and y coordinates are positive. So, y is at (some positive value, some positive value).

Now, if x is South of y, then x is directly below y. This means x has the same x-coordinate as y, but a lower y-coordinate. So, x is at (same x value as y, a lower y value than y).

From this, we can determine the relative position of x to z.

Since x has the same x-coordinate as y, and y has a positive x-coordinate (being Northeast of z), x must have a positive x-coordinate. This means x is to the East of z.

As for the y-coordinate, x has a lower y-coordinate than y. If this y-coordinate is still positive, then x is Northeast of z. If this y-coordinate is 0, then x is East of z. If this y-coordinate is negative, then x is Southeast of z.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relationships between x and z could be:
- Northeast (if x's y-coordinate is positive)
- East (if x's y-coordinate is 0)
- Southeast (if x's y-coordinate is negative)

Wait, but I think I'm making an error here. The issue is that "South" doesn't necessarily mean that x has the exact same x-coordinate as y. It means that x is in the South direction from y. 

Let's be more clear about the definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction relations are often defined using the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) of the regions:

- North: The MBR of one region is entirely above the MBR of the other, with some overlap in the East-West extent.
- Northeast: The MBR of one region is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of the other.
- East: The MBR of one region is entirely to the right of the MBR of the other, with some overlap in the North-South extent.
- Southeast: The MBR of one region is entirely below and to the right of the MBR of the other.
- South: The MBR of one region is entirely below the MBR of the other, with some overlap in the East-West extent.
- Southwest: The MBR of one region is entirely below and to the left of the MBR of the other.
- West: The MBR of one region is entirely to the left of the MBR of the other, with some overlap in the North-South extent.
- Northwest: The MBR of one region is entirely above and to the left of the MBR of the other.
- Bounding Box: The MBRs of the two regions overlap.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider the problem.

If region y is Northeast of region z, then the MBR of y is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of z.

If region x is South of region y, then the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y, with some overlap in the East-West extent.

Given these constraints, let's reconsider the possible relationships between x and z.

Let's denote the MBRs as follows:
- MBR of z: (z_left, z_bottom) to (z_right, z_top)
- MBR of y: (y_left, y_bottom) to (y_right, y_top)
- MBR of x: (x_left, x_bottom) to (x_right, x_top)

For y to be Northeast of z, we have:
- y_left >= z_right (y is entirely to the right of z)
- y_bottom >= z_top (y is entirely above z)

For x to be South of y, we have:
- x_top <= y_bottom (x is entirely below y)
- x_left < y_right and x_right > y_left (x and y overlap in the East-West extent)

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z.

For the East-West relationship:
- We know y_left >= z_right (y is entirely to the right of z)
- We also know x_left < y_right and x_right > y_left (x and y overlap in the East-West extent)
- From these, we can infer that x_right > y_left >= z_right.
- This means x_right > z_right.

But we can't definitively determine whether x_left >= z_right (which would make x entirely to the right of z) or x_left < z_right (which would mean x and z overlap in the East-West extent).

For the North-South relationship:
- We know y_bottom >= z_top (y is entirely above z)
- We also know x_top <= y_bottom (x is entirely below y)
- From these, we can infer that x_top <= y_bottom >= z_top.
- This means x_top <= z_top.

But we can't definitively determine whether x_top < z_bottom (which would make x entirely below z) or x_top >= z_bottom (which would mean x and z overlap in the North-South extent).

So, the possible relationships between x and z could be:

1. If x_left >= z_right (x is entirely to the right of z) and x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z), then x is Northeast of z.
2. If x_left >= z_right (x is entirely to the right of z) and x_top <= z_bottom (x is entirely below z), then x is Southeast of z.
3. If x_left >= z_right (x is entirely to the right of z) and there's overlap in the North-South extent, then x is East of z.
4. If x_top <= z_bottom (x is entirely below z) and there's overlap in the East-West extent, then x is South of z.
5. If there's overlap in both the East-West and North-South extents, then x has a Bounding Box relationship with z.

Is it possible for x to be North of z? For this to happen, x would need to be entirely above z and overlap with z in the East-West extent.

We know that y is entirely to the right of z. For x to overlap with z in the East-West extent, x would need to extend further to the left than y does. But since x overlaps with y in the East-West extent, and y is entirely to the right of z, it's challenging to conceive a configuration where x overlaps with z in the East-West extent.

Actually, wait a moment. I think I'm making a logical error. Let's revisit.

For x to be South of y, we have:
- x_top <= y_bottom (x is entirely below y)
- x and y overlap in the East-West extent: (x_left < y_right) AND (x_right > y_left)

For y to be Northeast of z, we have:
- y_left >= z_right (y is entirely to the right of z)
- y_bottom >= z_top (y is entirely above z)

Now, for x to overlap with z in the East-West extent, we need:
- (x_left < z_right) AND (x_right > z_left)

Given that y_left >= z_right and x overlaps with y in the East-West extent, it's indeed possible for x to overlap with z in the East-West extent.

For example, consider:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (2, 2)
- y's MBR: (3, 3) to (4, 4) (Northeast of z)
- x's MBR: (1, 1) to (5, 2) (South of y, with overlap in East-West with y)

In this configuration, x overlaps with z in the East-West extent and is below the top of z. If we adjust the y-coordinate of x slightly, x could be North of z.

So, it seems like x can be North of z given the constraints.

Let's revise our list of possible relationships between x and z:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Bounding Box

I think I'm not being fully clear-minded about this. Let me try again with a clearer understanding of how cardinal direction relations are defined. 

For qualitative spatial reasoning, I'll use the standard definition of cardinal direction relations based on the MBR.

For one region to be in a cardinal direction of another, the MBRs of the two regions must have a specific relationship. For example, for region A to be North of region B, the MBR of A must be entirely above the MBR of B, with some overlap in the East-West extent.

Let's visualize the case on a coordinate system, where the x-axis represents the East-West direction (positive x is East) and the y-axis represents the North-South direction (positive y is North).

For region y to be Northeast of region z, the MBR of y must be entirely above and to the right of the MBR of z. This means:
- y_left >= z_right (y is entirely to the right of z)
- y_bottom >= z_top (y is entirely above z)

For region x to be South of region y, the MBR of x must be entirely below the MBR of y, with some overlap in the East-West extent. This means:
- x_top <= y_bottom (x is entirely below y)
- (x_left < y_right) AND (x_right > y_left) (x and y overlap in the East-West extent)

Given these constraints, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

For the East-West relationship, we know that y is entirely to the right of z (y_left >= z_right) and x overlaps with y in the East-West extent. This means that x extends to the right of the left edge of y, which is already to the right of the right edge of z. So, at least a part of x is to the right of z.

But we can't definitively determine whether x is entirely to the right of z or if there's an overlap in the East-West extent between x and z.

For the North-South relationship, we know that y is entirely above z (y_bottom >= z_top) and x is entirely below y (x_top <= y_bottom). From these, we can infer that x_top <= y_bottom >= z_top, which means x_top <= z_top.

But we can't definitively determine whether x is entirely below z, entirely above z, or if there's an overlap in the North-South extent between x and z.

So, the possible relationships between x and z could be:

1. If x is entirely to the right of z and entirely above z, then x is Northeast of z.
2. If x is entirely to the right of z and entirely below z, then x is Southeast of z.
3. If x is entirely to the right of z and there's overlap in the North-South extent, then x is East of z.
4. If x is entirely above z and there's overlap in the East-West extent, then x is North of z.
5. If x is entirely below z and there's overlap in the East-West extent, then x is South of z.
6. If there's overlap in both the East-West and North-South extents, then x has a Bounding Box relationship with z.

Let me check if I'm making a conceptual error. For region x to be South of region y, the MBR of x must be entirely below the MBR of y, with some overlap in the East-West extent. This means:
- x_top <= y_bottom (x is entirely below y)
- (x_left < y_right) AND (x_right > y_left) (x and y overlap in the East-West extent)

The overlap in the East-West extent means that x is not entirely to the left or right of y. It doesn't imply that x spans the entire East-West extent of y or that x extends beyond the East-West extent of y. It just means that there's some overlap.

So, while x overlaps with y in the East-West extent, and y is entirely to the right of z, it doesn't necessarily follow that x is entirely to the right of z. x could overlap with z in the East-West extent.

Actually, we just need a few examples to check this. Let's consider specific configurations to explore the possible relationships.

Configuration 1:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (2, 2)
- y's MBR: (3, 3) to (5, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (4, 0) to (4.5, 2.5) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is East of z.

Configuration 2:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (2, 2)
- y's MBR: (3, 3) to (5, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (4, -1) to (4.5, 0.5) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

Configuration 3:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (4, 2)
- y's MBR: (5, 3) to (7, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (3, 0) to (6, 2.5) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x overlaps with z in both the East-West and North-South extents. This would be a Bounding Box relationship.

Let me carefully check if we can have a North relationship. For x to be North of z, x would need to be entirely above z, with some overlap in the East-West extent.

Configuration 4:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (5, 2)
- y's MBR: (6, 3) to (8, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (4, 2.5) to (7, 3) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is above z and overlaps with z in the East-West extent. This would be a North relationship.

Actually, hold on. I'm making an error with the definition of "North." For x to be North of z, the MBR of x must be entirely above the MBR of z, with some overlap in the East-West extent. This means:
- x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z)
- (x_left < z_right) AND (x_right > z_left) (x and z overlap in the East-West extent)

For x to be entirely above z, we need x_bottom >= z_top. But we also know that x is entirely below y (x_top <= y_bottom) and y is entirely above z (y_bottom >= z_top). 

From these, we can infer that x_top <= y_bottom and y_bottom >= z_top. This doesn't conclusively tell us whether x_bottom >= z_top.

So, I think it's possible for x to be North of z given the constraints, if x is positioned such that it's above z and overlaps with z in the East-West extent.

Let me be extremely explicit with the constraints and the possible relationships.

For region y to be Northeast of region z:
- y_left >= z_right (y is entirely to the right of z)
- y_bottom >= z_top (y is entirely above z)

For region x to be South of region y:
- x_top <= y_bottom (x is entirely below y)
- (x_left < y_right) AND (x_right > y_left) (x and y overlap in the East-West extent)

For x to be North of z:
- x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z)
- (x_left < z_right) AND (x_right > z_left) (x and z overlap in the East-West extent)

From the constraints, we know that y_bottom >= z_top and x_top <= y_bottom. From these, we can't definitively determine whether x_bottom >= z_top or not.

For x to be Northeast of z:
- x_left >= z_right (x is entirely to the right of z)
- x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z)

From the constraints, we know that y_left >= z_right. Since x overlaps with y in the East-West extent, we know that x_right > y_left. From these, we can infer that x_right > y_left >= z_right. 

But we can't definitively determine whether x_left >= z_right or not.

Similarly, we can't definitively determine whether x is East, Southeast, South, or has a Bounding Box relationship with z based solely on the given constraints.

Actually, let me visually check this. Let's try to find examples for each of the relations to see if they're possible.

Configuration for North:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (5, 2)
- y's MBR: (6, 3) to (8, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (2, 2.5) to (7, 3) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is above z (x_bottom >= z_top) and overlaps with z in the East-West extent. This would be a North relationship.

Configuration for Northeast:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (2, 2)
- y's MBR: (3, 3) to (5, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (3, 2.5) to (4, 3) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is above z (x_bottom >= z_top) and to the right of z (x_left >= z_right). This would be a Northeast relationship.

Configuration for East:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (2, 3)
- y's MBR: (3, 4) to (5, 6) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (3, 1) to (4, 4) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is to the right of z (x_left >= z_right) and overlaps with z in the North-South extent. This would be an East relationship.

Configuration for Southeast:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (2, 2)
- y's MBR: (3, 3) to (5, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (3, -1) to (4, 3) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is to the right of z (x_left >= z_right) and below z (x_top <= z_bottom). This would be a Southeast relationship.

Configuration for South:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (4, 2)
- y's MBR: (5, 3) to (7, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (3, -1) to (6, 0) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is below z (x_top <= z_bottom) and overlaps with z in the East-West extent. This would be a South relationship.

Configuration for Bounding Box:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (4, 2)
- y's MBR: (5, 3) to (7, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (3, 0) to (6, 3) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x overlaps with z in both the East-West and North-South extents. This would be a Bounding Box relationship.

Based on these examples, it seems like the possible relationships between x and z, given the constraints, are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Bounding Box

I'm not seeing a way to have x be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z given the constraints. The constraint that y is Northeast of z pushes x toward the East of z, making it difficult for x to be West of z.

So, I'm not 100% sure, but it looks like the answer is:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Bounding Box

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating the problem. Let's visualize how these cardinal direction relations are typically defined. The usual way is to divide the space into 9 regions based on the MBR of a reference object:

```
|Northwest|  North  |Northeast|
|   West  |Bounding |  East   |
|         |   Box   |         |
|Southwest|  South  |Southeast|
```

For one region to be in a cardinal direction of another, it must fall entirely within that direction's region.

Given this visualization, let's reconsider the problem.

If region y is Northeast of region z, then y falls entirely within the Northeast region of z. 

If region x is South of region y, then x falls entirely within the South region of y.

Now, let's determine where x could fall in relation to z.

Since y is Northeast of z, y is in the upper-right quadrant of z. Since x is South of y, x is directly below y. This suggests that x is East or Southeast of z.

But this is simplistic. The issue with this visualization is that it assumes regions are points, which they might not be. Regions have spatial extent, and their MBRs can span multiple cardinal direction regions.

Actually, ok, wait. I need to be less hand-wavy. Let's think of an example. 

Suppose:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y's MBR: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (2, 0) to (3, 1) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is East of z.

Let's try another configuration:

- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y's MBR: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (1.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 1.9) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is Northeast of z.

Another configuration:

- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (2, 1)
- y's MBR: (3, 2) to (4, 3) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (1, 1.5) to (4, 1.9) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is North of z.

Let's check if x can be South of z. For x to be South of z, x would need to be entirely below z, with some overlap in the East-West extent.

- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (3, 1)
- y's MBR: (4, 2) to (5, 3) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (2, -1) to (5, 0) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is below z and overlaps with z in the East-West extent. This would be a South relationship.

Let's check if x can have a Bounding Box relationship with z. For this to happen, x would need to overlap with z in both the East-West and North-South extents.

- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (3, 2)
- y's MBR: (4, 3) to (5, 4) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (2, 1) to (5, 3) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x overlaps with z in both the East-West and North-South extents. This would be a Bounding Box relationship.

Let's check if x can be Southeast of z. For x to be Southeast of z, x would need to be entirely below and to the right of z.

- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y's MBR: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (1.5, -1) to (3, 0) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is below and to the right of z. This would be a Southeast relationship.

Let's be super careful to check if x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z given the constraints.

For x to be Northwest of z, x would need to be entirely above and to the left of z.
- Given that y is Northeast of z, y is entirely above and to the right of z.
- Given that x is South of y, x is entirely below y, with some overlap in the East-West extent.
- From these, we can infer that x is below y. But since y is above z, x could still be above, at the same level, or below z.
- For x to be to the left of z, x would need to be entirely to the left of z. But given that y is to the right of z and x overlaps with y in the East-West extent, it's challenging to conceive a configuration where x is entirely to the left of z.

Let's try a specific configuration:

- z's MBR: (2, 2) to (3, 3)
- y's MBR: (4, 4) to (5, 5) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (1, 3.5) to (4.5, 3.9) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

In this configuration, x is above and to the left of z. This would be a Northwest relationship.

Hmm, wait. I think I'm thinking of the cardinal relation incorrectly. Let's be super explicit. 

For one region to be in a cardinal direction of another, the MBR of the first region must fall entirely within the specific cardinal direction region of the second region.

For region y to be Northeast of region z, the MBR of y must be entirely in the Northeast region of z. This means:
- y_left > z_right (y is entirely to the right of z)
- y_bottom > z_top (y is entirely above z)

For region x to be South of region y, the MBR of x must be entirely in the South region of y. This means:
- x_left < y_right and x_right > y_left (x and y overlap in the East-West extent)
- x_top < y_bottom (x is entirely below y)

Actually, I think I should double check my definitions. The definitions I've been using are based on the MBR projection approach. Let's check if there are other ways to define cardinal direction relations.

Actually, let me proceed with the understanding that cardinal directions are defined based on the MBR projection approach, as I've been using.

So, for y to be Northeast of z:
- y_left >= z_right (y is entirely to the right of z)
- y_bottom >= z_top (y is entirely above z)

For x to be South of y:
- x_top <= y_bottom (x is entirely below y)
- (x_left < y_right) AND (x_right > y_left) (x and y overlap in the East-West extent)

Given these constraints, we need to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

We know that y is entirely to the right of z (y_left >= z_right) and x overlaps with y in the East-West extent. Since x overlaps with y in the East-West extent, x could be partially to the right of z, entirely to the right of z, or it could overlap with z in the East-West extent. I don't think we can definitively determine which.

Similarly, for the North-South relationship, we know that y is entirely above z (y_bottom >= z_top) and x is entirely below y (x_top <= y_bottom). From these, we can't definitively determine the North-South relationship between x and z.

Actually, I'm going to check each cardinal relation explicitly:

1. North: For x to be North of z, x must be entirely above z, with overlap in the East-West extent. 
   - x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z)
   - (x_left < z_right) AND (x_right > z_left) (x and z overlap in the East-West extent)
   We've shown this is possible.

2. Northeast: For x to be Northeast of z, x must be entirely above and to the right of z.
   - x_left >= z_right (x is entirely to the right of z)
   - x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z)
   We've shown this is possible.

3. East: For x to be East of z, x must be entirely to the right of z, with overlap in the North-South extent.
   - x_left >= z_right (x is entirely to the right of z)
   - (x_bottom < z_top) AND (x_top > z_bottom) (x and z overlap in the North-South extent)
   We've shown this is possible.

4. Southeast: For x to be Southeast of z, x must be entirely below and to the right of z.
   - x_left >= z_right (x is entirely to the right of z)
   - x_top <= z_bottom (x is entirely below z)
   We've shown this is possible.

5. South: For x to be South of z, x must be entirely below z, with overlap in the East-West extent.
   - x_top <= z_bottom (x is entirely below z)
   - (x_left < z_right) AND (x_right > z_left) (x and z overlap in the East-West extent)
   We've shown this is possible.

6. Southwest: For x to be Southwest of z, x must be entirely below and to the left of z.
   - x_right <= z_left (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - x_top <= z_bottom (x is entirely below z)
   We need to check if this is possible.

   Given that y is entirely to the right of z (y_left >= z_right) and x overlaps with y in the East-West extent (x_right > y_left), we can infer that x_right > y_left >= z_right > z_left. 
   
   This means x_right > z_left, which contradicts the condition for x to be Southwest of z.

   So, x cannot be Southwest of z given the constraints.

7. West: For x to be West of z, x must be entirely to the left of z, with overlap in the North-South extent.
   - x_right <= z_left (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - (x_bottom < z_top) AND (x_top > z_bottom) (x and z overlap in the North-South extent)
   We've already shown that x_right > z_left, which contradicts the condition for x to be West of z.

   So, x cannot be West of z given the constraints.

8. Northwest: For x to be Northwest of z, x must be entirely above and to the left of z.
   - x_right <= z_left (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - x_bottom >= z_top (x is entirely above z)
   We've already shown that x_right > z_left, which contradicts the condition for x to be Northwest of z.

   So, x cannot be Northwest of z given the constraints.

9. Bounding Box: For x to have a Bounding Box relationship with z, x must overlap with z in both the East-West and North-South extents.
   - (x_left < z_right) AND (x_right > z_left) (x and z overlap in the East-West extent)
   - (x_bottom < z_top) AND (x_top > z_bottom) (x and z overlap in the North-South extent)
   We've shown this is possible.

So, based on the analysis, the possible relationships between x and z, given the constraints, are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Bounding Box

OK, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check by thinking of configurations of x, y, and z that result in each of the relations.

1. North:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (3, 1)
- y's MBR: (4, 2) to (5, 3) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (1, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.9) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

2. Northeast:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y's MBR: (2, 2) to (3, 3) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (1.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 1.9) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

3. East:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (1, 2)
- y's MBR: (2, 3) to (3, 4) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (1.5, 0.5) to (2.5, 3.5) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

4. Southeast:
- z's MBR: (0, 1) to (1, 2)
- y's MBR: (2, 3) to (3, 4) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (1.5, 0) to (2.5, 1) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

5. South:
- z's MBR: (0, 1) to (3, 2)
- y's MBR: (4, 3) to (5, 4) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (2, 0) to (4.5, 0.5) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

6. Bounding Box:
- z's MBR: (0, 0) to (3, 2)
- y's MBR: (4, 3) to (5, 4) [Northeast of z]
- x's MBR: (2, 1) to (4.5, 3) [South of y, with overlap in East-West with y]

OK, the relations North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, and Bounding Box all seem to be possible. I think our answer is correct.

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Bounding Box

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what spatial relations could exist between regions x and z based on the given constraints.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Northeast of region z

I'll analyze what this means for the possible positions of x relative to z.

When region y is Northeast of region z, it means y is both above and to the right of z.

When region x is South of region y, it means x is directly below y with some overlap in the East-West extent.

Based on these constraints, I need to determine all possible positions x could have relative to z.

Examining all possibilities:

- North: x could be above z (if x is below y but still above z)
- Northeast: x could be above and to the right of z
- East: x could be to the right of z
- Southeast: x could be below and to the right of z
- South: x could be below z
- Bounding Box: x could overlap with z

The constraints eliminate Northwest, West, and Southwest as possibilities since y being Northeast of z and x being South of y makes these relations geometrically impossible.

The answer is: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Bounding Box
