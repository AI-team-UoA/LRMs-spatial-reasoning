PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's denote the "Northwest" relation as NW and the "East" relation as E. We want to determine the possible relation between regions x and z, given that:
- x is NW of y (or x NW y)
- y is E of z (or y E z)

To reason about this, let's think about what these cardinal directions mean in terms of the spatial layout.

Northwest (NW): This means that the region is to the north and west of another region. In other words, if x is NW of y, then x is both to the north and to the west of y.

East (E): This means the region is to the east of another region. If y is E of z, then y is to the east of z.

Now, let's try to determine where x is in relation to z.

Given:
- x is NW of y (x is both north and west of y)
- y is E of z (y is east of z)

This means:
- x is to the north and west of y
- y is to the east of z

Now, let's try to position z relative to x.

Since y is to the east of z, this means z is to the west of y.

And since x is to the northwest of y, this means x is to the north and west of y.

So, the relationship between x and z is:
- x is to the north and west of y
- z is to the west of y

From this, it's not clear directly what the relation between x and z is. Let's visualize this by placing these regions on a coordinate grid.

Let's say we place y at the origin (0, 0). Then:
- If x is NW of y, then x is at some position (-a, b), where a and b are positive numbers.
- If z is W of y, then z is at some position (-c, 0), where c is a positive number.

Wait, I need to rethink this. If y is E of z, then y is at the east of z, which means z is at the west of y. 

Let's position this differently:
- If y is at (0, 0)
- and x is NW of y, then x is at some position (-a, b), where a and b are positive numbers
- and z is W of y, then z is at some position (-c, 0), where c is a positive number.

But, this isn't quite right. If z is W of y, then z is directly to the west of y, but that's not necessarily the case. It's just that y is E of z. 

Let's try again with a different approach.

If y is E of z, then z is to the west of y. This means the y-coordinate of z can be the same as y, higher, or lower. 

If we place y at (0, 0):
- z can be at a position (-c, d), where c is a positive number and d can be any number (positive, zero, or negative).

And if x is NW of y, then x is at (-a, b), where a and b are positive numbers.

Now, let's try to determine the relation between x and z.

The position of x relative to z is:
- x is at (-a, b)
- z is at (-c, d)

The vector from z to x is:
(-a, b) - (-c, d) = (-a + c, b - d)

For x to be NW of z, both components of the vector from z to x should be negative (meaning x is to the west and north of z). This would mean -a + c < 0 and b - d > 0, or a > c and b > d.

For x to be N of z, we'd need -a + c = 0 and b - d > 0, or a = c and b > d.

For x to be W of z, we'd need -a + c < 0 and b - d = 0, or a > c and b = d.

For x to be NE of z, we'd need -a + c > 0 and b - d > 0, or a < c and b > d.

For x to be E of z, we'd need -a + c > 0 and b - d = 0, or a < c and b = d.

For x to be SE of z, we'd need -a + c > 0 and b - d < 0, or a < c and b < d.

For x to be S of z, we'd need -a + c = 0 and b - d < 0, or a = c and b < d.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need -a + c < 0 and b - d < 0, or a > c and b < d.

But this approach is getting a bit convoluted. Let's take a step back.

Actually, I'll try to draw out the situation with ASCII art to get a clearer picture.

Imagine a 2D grid where y is at (0, 0).
- If x is NW of y, then x is somewhere in the top-left quadrant relative to y.
- If y is E of z, then z is somewhere to the west of y (not necessarily directly west).

```
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . x . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . y . . . .
. . z . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
```

In the above, x is NW of y, and y is E of z (or z is W of y). It looks like x is NW of z.

But that's just one possible arrangement. Let's try another:

```
. . . . . . . . .
. . x . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . y . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . z . . . .
```

In this case, x is NW of y, and y is E of z (or z is W of y). But now x seems to be N of z.

Let's try one more arrangement:

```
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . x . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . y . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. z . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
```

Here, x is NW of y, and y is E of z (or z is W of y). But now x might be NE of z.

So, it looks like the relation between x and z can vary. It could be NW, N, or even NE, depending on the specific arrangement.

Actually, I think it's better to approach this geometrically. If I represent the cardinal directions with a diagram, with "North" being upwards on the y-axis and "East" being rightwards on the x-axis, I can visualize the possible relations.

This means that the relation "Northwest" can be represented as a cone in the top-left quadrant (extending infinitely). Similarly, "East" can be represented as a cone in the right half (extending infinitely).

So, if x is in the NW cone relative to y, and y is in the E cone relative to z, we need to determine where x is relative to z.

In fact, let's try to enumerate the possibilities. Given that x is NW of y and y is E of z, the possible relations between x and z are:

- x could be N of z: This is possible if z is directly south of y, and x is directly north of y.
- x could be NE of z: This is possible if z is SW of y, and x is NW of y.
- x could be E of z: This is possible if z is W of y, and x is at the same level as y but to the NW.
- x could be NW of z: This is possible if z is SE of y, and x is NW of y.

Actually, I think that depending on the specific positions of x, y, and z, the relation between x and z could be any of: N, NW, W, NE, E, and possibly others.

Let me try a more systematic approach.

Given:
- x is NW of y (x is both to the north and to the west of y)
- y is E of z (y is to the east of z, or z is to the west of y)

Let's establish a coordinate system:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-a, b) for some positive a and b
- z is at (-c, d) for some positive c and any d (since y is E of z, which means z is W of y)

The relation between x and z depends on the relative values of a, b, c, and d.

The vector from z to x is (-a, b) - (-c, d) = (c-a, b-d).

If c-a > 0 and b-d > 0, then x is NE of z.
If c-a > 0 and b-d = 0, then x is E of z.
If c-a > 0 and b-d < 0, then x is SE of z.
If c-a = 0 and b-d > 0, then x is N of z.
If c-a = 0 and b-d = 0, then x is at the same position as z (but this isn't a valid scenario given our constraints).
If c-a = 0 and b-d < 0, then x is S of z.
If c-a < 0 and b-d > 0, then x is NW of z.
If c-a < 0 and b-d = 0, then x is W of z.
If c-a < 0 and b-d < 0, then x is SW of z.

Wait, since z is at (-c, d) and y is at (0, 0), and y is E of z, we don't necessarily have a constraint on d. It just means that z is to the west of y, so the x-coordinate of z is less than the x-coordinate of y. This means d can be any value, positive, zero, or negative.

So, if z is at (-c, d) and x is at (-a, b), the vector from z to x is (c-a, b-d).

For z to be to the west of y, we have c > 0. For x to be to the northwest of y, we have a > 0 and b > 0.

Now, let's analyze the possible relative positions of x and z.

The vector from z to x is (c-a, b-d). The cardinal direction from z to x is determined by the signs of c-a and b-d.

Here are all the possible scenarios based on the values of a, b, c, and d, given that a, b, c are positive and d can be any value:

1. If a < c and b > d: x is NE of z. This means x is to the northeast of z.
2. If a < c and b = d: x is E of z. This means x is directly to the east of z.
3. If a < c and b < d: x is SE of z. This means x is to the southeast of z.
4. If a = c and b > d: x is N of z. This means x is directly to the north of z.
5. If a = c and b = d: x is at the same position as z (this isn't a valid scenario).
6. If a = c and b < d: x is S of z. This means x is directly to the south of z.
7. If a > c and b > d: x is NW of z. This means x is to the northwest of z.
8. If a > c and b = d: x is W of z. This means x is directly to the west of z.
9. If a > c and b < d: x is SW of z. This means x is to the southwest of z.

Wait, I'm making an error here. Let's re-do this. 

We have:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is NW of y, which means x is at (-a, b) for some positive a and b
- y is E of z, which means z is at (-c, 0) for some positive c

Actually, that's not right. If y is E of z, then y is to the east of z. This means the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z, and the y-coordinates could be anything. So if y is at (0, 0), then z could be at (-c, d) for any positive c and any d (positive, zero, or negative).

Let's proceed from there:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is NW of y, which means x is at (-a, b) for some positive a and b
- z is at (-c, d) for some positive c and any d

The vector from z to x is (-a, b) - (-c, d) = (c-a, b-d).

For x to be NW of z, we'd need c-a < 0 and b-d > 0, which means a > c and b > d.
For x to be N of z, we'd need c-a = 0 and b-d > 0, which means a = c and b > d.
For x to be NE of z, we'd need c-a > 0 and b-d > 0, which means a < c and b > d.
For x to be W of z, we'd need c-a < 0 and b-d = 0, which means a > c and b = d.
For x to be E of z, we'd need c-a > 0 and b-d = 0, which means a < c and b = d.
For x to be SW of z, we'd need c-a < 0 and b-d < 0, which means a > c and b < d.
For x to be S of z, we'd need c-a = 0 and b-d < 0, which means a = c and b < d.
For x to be SE of z, we'd need c-a > 0 and b-d < 0, which means a < c and b < d.

So, based on the specific values of a, b, c, and d, x could be in any of the eight cardinal directions relative to z. However, the question is about which relations are possible, not which ones are necessary.

Given the constraints that x is NW of y and y is E of z, I believe that x could be in any of the following positions relative to z: NW, N, NE, W, E, SW, S, SE.

However, that's a bit too many. Let me reconsider. My initial approach might have been too general.

Let's try with the most specific interpretation. If "NW" and "E" are strictly 45-degree cones, then:
- x is NW of y means x is exactly 45 degrees northwest of y.
- y is E of z means y is exactly 90 degrees (or due east) of z.

In this case, if z is due west of y and x is northwest of y, then x would be north of z.

But I'm skeptical of this interpretation. Cardinal directions are usually not this restrictive. They typically refer to general directions in a quadrant or half-plane.

Let's try a more relaxed interpretation. If "NW" refers to the entire northwest quadrant (anything between north and west) and "E" refers to anything in the eastern half-plane, then there's more flexibility.

Given:
- x is in the NW quadrant of y
- y is in the E half-plane of z

This means:
- x is somewhere to the north and west of y
- z is somewhere to the west of y

The relation between x and z depends on their specific positions, but given the constraints:
- x could be N of z
- x could be NW of z
- x could be NE of z
- x could be W of z
- x could be E of z

I'm not convinced that x could be S, SW, or SE of z given these constraints. Let me think about this further.

If x is NW of y and y is E of z, then:
- x is to the north and west of y
- z is to the west of y

For x to be S, SW, or SE of z, z would need to be to the north of x. But given that x is to the north of y and y is at the same level or above z (given the E relation), it's hard to imagine a scenario where z is to the north of x.

Let's try to visualize some extreme cases to see if x can be S, SW, or SE of z.

Case 1: z is far to the north and slightly to the west of y. y is at the origin (0, 0), so z might be at (-1, 100). If x is just slightly to the northwest of y, say at (-1, 1), then x would be to the south of z.

Ok wait, this is not quite right. If y is E of z, then z should be to the west of y. So if y is at (0, 0), then z is somewhere to the west of y, which means z is at (-c, d) for some positive c and any d.

Let's try to determine the possible relation between x and z as follows:

- y is at (0, 0)
- x is NW of y, so x is at (-a, b) for some positive a and b
- z is W of y, so z is at (-c, d) for some positive c and any d

The relation between x and z depends on the relative values of a, b, c, and d.

The vector from z to x is (-a, b) - (-c, d) = (c-a, b-d).

From this, we can determine the cardinal direction from z to x.

OK, let me think of specific scenarios for each possible relation between x and z.

x is N of z:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-1, 2)
- z is at (-1, 0)
In this case, y is E of z, x is NW of y, and x is N of z.

x is NE of z:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-1, 2)
- z is at (-3, 0)
In this case, y is E of z, x is NW of y, and x is NE of z.

x is E of z:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-1, 1)
- z is at (-3, 1)
In this case, y is E of z, x is NW of y, and x is E of z.

x is SE of z:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-1, 1)
- z is at (-2, 3)
In this case, y is E of z, x is NW of y, and x is SE of z.

x is S of z:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-1, 1)
- z is at (-1, 3)
In this case, y is E of z, x is NW of y, and x is S of z.

x is SW of z:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-2, 1)
- z is at (-1, 3)
In this case, y is E of z, x is NW of y, and x is SW of z.

x is W of z:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-3, 1)
- z is at (-1, 1)
In this case, y is E of z, x is NW of y, and x is W of z.

x is NW of z:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-3, 2)
- z is at (-1, 0)
In this case, y is E of z, x is NW of y, and x is NW of z.

So, it turns out that all eight cardinal directions are possible relations between x and z given the constraints that x is NW of y and y is E of z.

But this doesn't feel right.

Let me reconsidering. We're given:
- x is NW of y
- y is E of z

I'll use a slightly different approach. If y is E of z, then y is to the east of z, which means z is to the west of y. Given that x is to the northwest of y, we can visualize this as follows:

```
    N
    |
W -- -- E
    |
    S
```

If y is at the center, then:
- x is somewhere in the NW quadrant of y
- z is somewhere to the W of y

The possible relations between x and z can be visualized by considering the relative positions of x and z.

OK, I think I was overthinking this. From the visualization, it's clear that most of the cardinal relations from x to z are possible.

Given the constraints, the relation from x to z could be one of:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest

In fact, with those constraints, x and z could be in any cardinal relation to each other.

Actually, wait, I realize that I haven't been considering the problem in the right way. Cardinal directions are relational properties between regions. They're transitive in some ways but not in others. Let me try a more direct approach.

Given:
- x is NW of y
- y is E of z

If we're asked for the relation between x and z, I should be using the formal properties of the cardinal direction relations.

From a compositional standpoint, if we know that R1(x, y) and R2(y, z), we want to know what R3(x, z) could be.

OK, I think one way to approach this is to consider the inverse of the second relation. Instead of y is E of z, we can say z is W of y. So we have:
- x is NW of y
- z is W of y

From this, we can infer:
- x is in the NW quadrant of y
- z is to the W of y

Given the positions of x and z relative to y, the relation from x to z could be any of the 8 cardinal directions, except perhaps for S, SE, E, because x is always to the north of y, and z is always to the west of y. But I'm still not convinced.

Let me try something else. Let's use Cartesian coordinates:
- y is at (0, 0)
- For x to be NW of y, x is at some point (-a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0
- For y to be E of z, z is at some point (-c, d) where c > 0 and d is any real number

The relation from x to z depends on the values of a, b, c, and d:
- If a > c and b > d, then x is NW of z
- If a = c and b > d, then x is N of z
- If a < c and b > d, then x is NE of z
- If a > c and b = d, then x is W of z
- If a < c and b = d, then x is E of z
- If a > c and b < d, then x is SW of z
- If a = c and b < d, then x is S of z
- If a < c and b < d, then x is SE of z

So, x can be in any cardinal relation to z given the constraints. But that's a bit of a trivial result. I'm not sure if I'm interpreting the question correctly.

Actually, given the constraints, can x be E of z? If x is at (-a, b) and z is at (-c, d), for x to be E of z, we'd need a < c and b = d. This seems possible, so x can be E of z.

Actually, given that:
- x is at (-a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0
- z is at (-c, d) where c > 0 and d is any real number

I think the key to resolving this is to look at the y-coordinate of z.

If d > 0, then the possible cardinal relations from x to z include:
- NW
- N
- NE
- W
- E
- SW
- S
- SE

But if d is a specific value, then there are constraints. For example, if d = 0, x would be to the north of z, and if d < 0, x would be to the north of z.

I think part of my confusion has been trying to deduce a single relation. Instead, I should focus on enumerating all the possible relations.

Let's restate this yet again:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is NW of y, so x is at (-a, b) for some positive a and b
- y is E of z, so z is at (-c, d) for some positive c and any d

The vector from z to x is (c-a, b-d).

1. If c-a > 0 and b-d > 0, x is NE of z
2. If c-a = 0 and b-d > 0, x is N of z
3. If c-a < 0 and b-d > 0, x is NW of z
4. If c-a > 0 and b-d = 0, x is E of z
5. If c-a < 0 and b-d = 0, x is W of z
6. If c-a > 0 and b-d < 0, x is SE of z
7. If c-a = 0 and b-d < 0, x is S of z
8. If c-a < 0 and b-d < 0, x is SW of z

For each of these cases, I need to check if there are valid values of a, b, c, and d that satisfy the constraints.

For x to be NE of z, we need c-a > 0 (i.e., c > a) and b-d > 0 (i.e., b > d). Given that a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and d can be any value, this is possible if c is large enough and d is small enough (or negative).

For x to be N of z, we need c-a = 0 (i.e., c = a) and b-d > 0 (i.e., b > d). Given that a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and d can be any value, this is possible if c = a and d is small enough (or negative).

For x to be NW of z, we need c-a < 0 (i.e., c < a) and b-d > 0 (i.e., b > d). Given that a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and d can be any value, this is possible if c is small enough and d is small enough (or negative).

For x to be E of z, we need c-a > 0 (i.e., c > a) and b-d = 0 (i.e., b = d). Given that a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and d can be any value, this is possible if c is large enough and d = b.

For x to be W of z, we need c-a < 0 (i.e., c < a) and b-d = 0 (i.e., b = d). Given that a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and d can be any value, this is possible if c is small enough and d = b.

For x to be SE of z, we need c-a > 0 (i.e., c > a) and b-d < 0 (i.e., b < d). Given that a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and d can be any value, this is possible if c is large enough and d is large enough.

For x to be S of z, we need c-a = 0 (i.e., c = a) and b-d < 0 (i.e., b < d). Given that a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and d can be any value, this is possible if c = a and d is large enough.

For x to be SW of z, we need c-a < 0 (i.e., c < a) and b-d < 0 (i.e., b < d). Given that a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and d can be any value, this is possible if c is small enough and d is large enough.

It turns out that all eight cardinal directions are possible relations for x relative to z, given the constraints.

Let me double-check this by working through a specific example for each direction.

1. For x to be NE of z:
   - y is at (0, 0)
   - Let's say x is at (-1, 2)
   - And z is at (-3, 0)
   - Then, y is E of z (because y is to the right of z)
   - And x is NW of y (because x is to the left and above y)
   - The vector from z to x is (-1, 2) - (-3, 0) = (2, 2), which means x is NE of z

2. For x to be N of z:
   - y is at (0, 0)
   - Let's say x is at (-2, 2)
   - And z is at (-2, 0)
   - Then, y is E of z (because y is to the right of z)
   - And x is NW of y (because x is to the left and above y)
   - The vector from z to x is (-2, 2) - (-2, 0) = (0, 2), which means x is N of z

3. For x to be NW of z:
   - y is at (0, 0)
   - Let's say x is at (-3, 2)
   - And z is at (-1, 0)
   - Then, y is E of z (because y is to the right of z)
   - And x is NW of y (because x is to the left and above y)
   - The vector from z to x is (-3, 2) - (-1, 0) = (-2, 2), which means x is NW of z

4. For x to be E of z:
   - y is at (0, 0)
   - Let's say x is at (-1, 2)
   - And z is at (-3, 2)
   - Then, y is E of z (because y is to the right of z)
   - And x is NW of y (because x is to the left and above y)
   - The vector from z to x is (-1, 2) - (-3, 2) = (2, 0), which means x is E of z

5. For x to be W of z:
   - y is at (0, 0)
   - Let's say x is at (-3, 2)
   - And z is at (-1, 2)
   - Then, y is E of z (because y is to the right of z)
   - And x is NW of y (because x is to the left and above y)
   - The vector from z to x is (-3, 2) - (-1, 2) = (-2, 0), which means x is W of z

6. For x to be SE of z:
   - y is at (0, 0)
   - Let's say x is at (-1, 1)
   - And z is at (-3, 3)
   - Then, y is E of z (because y is to the right of z)
   - And x is NW of y (because x is to the left and above y)
   - The vector from z to x is (-1, 1) - (-3, 3) = (2, -2), which means x is SE of z

7. For x to be S of z:
   - y is at (0, 0)
   - Let's say x is at (-2, 1)
   - And z is at (-2, 3)
   - Then, y is E of z (because y is to the right of z)
   - And x is NW of y (because x is to the left and above y)
   - The vector from z to x is (-2, 1) - (-2, 3) = (0, -2), which means x is S of z

8. For x to be SW of z:
   - y is at (0, 0)
   - Let's say x is at (-3, 1)
   - And z is at (-1, 3)
   - Then, y is E of z (because y is to the right of z)
   - And x is NW of y (because x is to the left and above y)
   - The vector from z to x is (-3, 1) - (-1, 3) = (-2, -2), which means x is SW of z

So, through concrete examples, I've shown that x can be in any of the eight cardinal directions relative to z, given the constraints that x is NW of y and y is E of z.

Actually, to make this clearer, let me restate in terms of the original problem.

Given:
- x is NW of y
- y is E of z

This means:
- x is to the northwest of y
- y is to the east of z

I've shown through coordinates and examples that the relation between x and z can be any of the 8 cardinal directions. So, the answer to the question "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" is all 8 of: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

Actually, there's one more detail to check. The question specifically asks about cardinal direction relations, which are generally understood to be the 8 directions I've mentioned. But I should also check if there's a constraint that would make x and z have a bounding box relation. Actually, I don't know if the "Bounding Box" was one of the original options; I think I may have misremembered.

Actually, I don't think "Bounding Box" is a cardinal direction in this context. It's likely a different kind of spatial relation. Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are the 8 cardinal directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

Actually I'm overthinking this. The question gave a list of possible answers: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box. The solution is a subset of these.

So, the answer is:
North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest.

Let me double-check if "Bounding Box" is a possible relation. I think I need to understand what "Bounding Box" means in this context.

Generally, a bounding box is the smallest rectangle that contains a given set of points. In the context of spatial relations, a bounding box relation might mean that one region is completely contained within the bounding box of another.

Given the constraints that x is NW of y and y is E of z, can x be contained within the bounding box of z (or vice versa)? This doesn't seem to be a direct implication of the cardinal relations, and it would depend on the specific shapes and sizes of the regions, not just their relative positions.

So unless "Bounding Box" has a special meaning in the context of this problem that I'm not aware of, I'm inclined to exclude it from the answer. However, to be safe, I should consider if there's a way to interpret the problem such that x and z might have a bounding box relation.

Ok, let's just be more conservative.

Given the constraints that x is NW of y and y is E of z, the possible relations between x and z are the 8 cardinal directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

Actually, I realize that "Bounding Box" is referring to the Bounding Box representation of cardinal directions. This is a standard representation in spatial reasoning. In this representation, a region's position relative to another is described using a rectangle that's oriented along the cardinal directions.

In the Bounding Box representation, there are 9 basic relations: Northwest (NW), North (N), Northeast (NE), West (W), Equal (EQ), East (E), Southwest (SW), South (S), and Southeast (SE). There's also the "Bounding Box" relation, which would mean that one region is entirely contained within the bounding box of the other.

So, the answer remains the 8 cardinal directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest. I'm not including "Bounding Box" because, from the constraints given, we can't deduce that x is entirely contained within the bounding box of z (or vice versa).

Alright. Given the constraints that x is NW of y and y is E of z, the possible relations between x and z are:

North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

ANSWER:

North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest
