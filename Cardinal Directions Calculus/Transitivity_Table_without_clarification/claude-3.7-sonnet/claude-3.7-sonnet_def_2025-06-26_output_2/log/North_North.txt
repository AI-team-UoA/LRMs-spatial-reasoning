PROMPT: Let North and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about the cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y, and region y is North of region z, then what is the relation between x and z?

Since x is North of y, x is located above y.
Since y is North of z, y is located above z.

So transitively, x is located above z. This means x is North of z.

The only possible relation between x and z is North.

Let me double-check this. If we think about a coordinate system where North corresponds to the positive y-axis:

- If x is North of y, then x has a higher y-coordinate than y.
- If y is North of z, then y has a higher y-coordinate than z.

Therefore, x has a higher y-coordinate than z, which means x is North of z.

So the answer is: North.

Wait, let me think about this more carefully. I think the above reasoning is correct, but let me make sure.

If x is North of y, then x is entirely above y in the coordinate system.
If y is North of z, then y is entirely above z in the coordinate system.

Therefore, x is certainly entirely above z, which means x is North of z.

So the answer is: North.
