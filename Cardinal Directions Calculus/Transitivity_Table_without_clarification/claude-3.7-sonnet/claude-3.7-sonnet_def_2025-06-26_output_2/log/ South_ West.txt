PROMPT: Let  South and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step. We have three regions: x, y, and z. We're given that:
- x is South of y
- y is West of z

We need to determine the possible relation(s) between x and z.

First, let's establish what these cardinal directions mean:
- South means below (negative y-direction)
- West means to the left (negative x-direction)
- North means above (positive y-direction)
- East means to the right (positive x-direction)
- Northeast means above and to the right (positive y and positive x)
- Northwest means above and to the left (positive y and negative x)
- Southeast means below and to the right (negative y and positive x)
- Southwest means below and to the left (negative y and negative x)

Now, if x is South of y, that means x is below y.
And if y is West of z, that means y is to the left of z.

So, what can we say about the position of x relative to z?

We know that:
- x is below y
- y is to the left of z

From these, we can deduce that x is below and to the left of z. This corresponds to the Southwest direction. 

However, let's think more carefully. The problem asks for "possible" relations, which suggests there might be more than one possibility.

Actually, let me reconsider this. 

Let's think about regions as having some spatial extent, not just points. So x, y, and z are areas or regions.

If region x is South of region y, it means that every point in x is South of some point in y. Similarly, if region y is West of region z, every point in y is West of some point in z.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

Let's draw a rough diagram:

```
    y --- z
    |
    |
    x
```

Here, x is directly South of y, and y is directly West of z. In this case, x would be Southwest of z.

But regions can have different shapes and sizes. Let's consider a different scenario:

```
    y --- z
    |     |
    |     |
    x ----
```

In this case, x extends to the East and aligns with z in the East-West direction. Here, x would be South of z.

Let's consider one more scenario:

```
    y ----- 
    |      |
    |      |
    x ---- z
```

Here, x extends to the East and overlaps with z. In this case, x would be South of z, but they also have a partial overlap in the East-West direction.

From these scenarios, it seems like the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Southwest: x is both South and West of z
- South: x is directly South of z (they align in the East-West direction)

But I'm not entirely convinced that these are the only possibilities. Let me think through this more systematically.

Actually, the cardinal direction system doesn't seem to have a concept for regions that overlap. In the case of regions, we typically think of the cardinal direction relation as holding between the entire regions.

So, if x is South of y, it means that every point in x is South of every point in y. Similarly, if y is West of z, every point in y is West of every point in z.

Given these stricter definitions, let's reconsider.

If every point in x is South of every point in y, and every point in y is West of every point in z, then we can conclude that every point in x is South and West of every point in z. This would be the Southwest direction.

But this strict definition might be too restrictive for regions. Let me try a different approach.

Let's consider the bounding boxes of the regions. The bounding box of a region is the smallest rectangle (aligned with the cardinal directions) that contains the entire region.

If region x is South of region y, then the bounding box of x is entirely below the bounding box of y. And if region y is West of region z, the bounding box of y is entirely to the left of the bounding box of z.

Given this, what can we say about the relation between the bounding boxes of x and z?

The bounding box of x is below the bounding box of y, which is to the left of the bounding box of z. This means the bounding box of x is below and to the left of the bounding box of z, which corresponds to the Southwest direction.

But, as I've been thinking about this, I realized we need to be more precise about what it means for one region to be in a cardinal direction of another. 

Let me try a more formal definition based on coordinate systems:

If region x is South of region y, then for any point (x_i, y_i) in x and any point (x_j, y_j) in y, we have y_i < y_j. 
And if region y is West of region z, then for any point (y_i, y_j) in y and any point (z_i, z_j) in z, we have y_i < z_i.

Now, for any point (x_i, y_i) in x and any point (z_i, z_j) in z, what can we say?

From the first condition, we know that y_i < y_j for all points (x_i, y_i) in x and all points (x_j, y_j) in y.
From the second condition, we know that y_i < z_i for all points (y_i, y_j) in y and all points (z_i, z_j) in z.

We can't directly relate x_i to z_i from these conditions, but we can say that y_i < z_j for all points in x and z.
This means x is definitely South of z.

As for the East-West relation, we can't make a definitive statement because we don't have a direct relation between x_i and z_i. So, x could be West, East, or aligned with z in the East-West direction.

Let's consider the possibilities:
1. x is West of z: This would make the relation between x and z Southwest.
2. x is aligned with z in the East-West direction: This would make the relation between x and z South.
3. x is East of z: This would make the relation between x and z Southeast.

But wait, can x really be East of z given our constraints? Let's think about this.

If y is West of z, then y is to the left of z in our coordinate system. And if x is South of y, then x is below y. But the East-West position of x relative to z isn't directly constrained by these relations.

Let's try with a concrete example:
Suppose y is at (0, 0) and z is at (1, 0). Then, "y is West of z" is satisfied.
Now, if x is at (0, -1), then "x is South of y" is satisfied.
In this case, x is at (0, -1) and z is at (1, 0), which means x is Southwest of z.

But what if x is at (2, -1)? Then, "x is South of y" is still satisfied (because x is below y). But now, x is at (2, -1) and z is at (1, 0), which means x is Southeast of z.

So, it seems like x can be Southeast of z as well.

In fact, x can be anywhere along the South direction relative to y, which means it can be Southwest, South, or Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

I think this answers the question, but let me double-check by considering one more time the constraints and the possible positions.

Actually, my approach using a concrete example was not entirely accurate because I was considering points, not regions. Let me try again with regions.

Suppose:
- Region y is in the area defined by the coordinates (0, 0) to (1, 1).
- Region z is in the area defined by the coordinates (2, 0) to (3, 1).

Since every point in y is to the left of every point in z, we satisfy "y is West of z".

Now, for "x is South of y", region x must be entirely below region y. So, region x could be in an area defined by coordinates (a, b) to (c, d) where d <= 0 (since y starts at y=0).

The question is: what are the possible relations between x and z?

If a >= 2 and c <= 3, then x is directly South of z, and the relation is South.
If c < 2, then x is to the left of z, and the relation is Southwest.
If a > 3, then x is to the right of z, and the relation is Southeast.

So, the possible relations are Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Let's verify this with one more set of regions:
- Region y is in the area defined by the coordinates (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- Region z is in the area defined by the coordinates (3, 0) to (5, 2).

Again, "y is West of z" is satisfied. And for "x is South of y", region x could be in an area like (0, -2) to (2, -1).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is at (0, -2) to (2, -1)
- z is at (3, 0) to (5, 2)

Every point in x is to the left and below every point in z, so x is Southwest of z.

But what if x is at (1, -2) to (4, -1)?

- x is at (1, -2) to (4, -1)
- z is at (3, 0) to (5, 2)

Now, x overlaps with z in the East-West direction, but it's still below z. So, the relation would be South.

And if x is at (4, -2) to (6, -1)?

- x is at (4, -2) to (6, -1)
- z is at (3, 0) to (5, 2)

Now, x overlaps with z in the East-West direction, but it's still below z. So, the relation would still be South.

Wait, if x is to the right of z? Let's try x at (6, -2) to (7, -1):

- x is at (6, -2) to (7, -1)
- z is at (3, 0) to (5, 2)

Every point in x is to the right and below every point in z, so x is Southeast of z.

This confirms that the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

To express the relation in terms of the cardinal direction, x is always South of z, but it can be Southwest, South, or Southeast depending on the East-West alignment of x and z.

Actually, I think my analysis is correct, but I want to double-check by thinking about the constraints more carefully.

If "x is South of y", it means that in terms of coordinates, the y-coordinates of points in x are less than the y-coordinates of points in y. And if "y is West of z", the x-coordinates of points in y are less than the x-coordinates of points in z.

From these, we can deduce that the y-coordinates of points in x are less than the y-coordinates of points in z (because y is between x and z in the North-South direction). This means x is South of z in the North-South direction.

But in the East-West direction, we don't have a direct constraint. We know that y is West of z, but the East-West position of x relative to y isn't given. So, x could be to the left, aligned, or to the right of z, which corresponds to Southwest, South, or Southeast, respectively.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

Let me now just double-check if the original formulation of the problem allows for this general of a relationship.

If region x is South of region y and region y is West of region z...

There's no constraint on the East-West position of x relative to y, or the North-South position of y relative to z. So, x can be anywhere along the South direction relative to y, and y can be anywhere along the West direction relative to z.

This means x can be Southwest, South, or Southeast of z, which is consistent with our analysis.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

Actually, I just realized that Southwest, South, and Southeast describe a specific area in the cardinal direction system. In other words, the relation is restricted to the Southern region (Southwest, South, Southeast).

In the cardinal direction system, we divide the space into 9 areas: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Center (or bounding box, as mentioned in the problem).

Given our constraints, x must be in the Southern region relative to z, which includes Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Wait, I think I'm making this more complex than it really is. Let's approach it more generally.

In the cardinal direction system, "South" refers to the entire region below, which includes Southwest, South, and Southeast. Similarly, "West" refers to the entire region to the left, which includes Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Given that x is South of y and y is West of z, we know that x is in the southern region of y, and y is in the western region of z.

From these, we can deduce that x is in the southwestern region of z, which includes Southwest, South, and Southeast, as I concluded earlier.

Let me verify this with a concrete example:

Suppose:
- z is a square region at (3, 3) to (5, 5).
- y is a square region at (1, 3) to (3, 5). Since y is to the left of z, "y is West of z" is satisfied.
- x is a square region at (1, 1) to (3, 3). Since x is below y, "x is South of y" is satisfied.

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
- x is at (1, 1) to (3, 3)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

In this case, x is to the left and below z, so x is Southwest of z.

Now, let's adjust the position of x:
- x is a square region at (3, 1) to (5, 3). Again, "x is South of y" is satisfied (because x is below y).

The relation between x and z now:
- x is at (3, 1) to (5, 3)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

In this case, x is directly below z, so x is South of z.

And one more adjustment:
- x is a square region at (5, 1) to (7, 3). Again, "x is South of y" is satisfied.

The relation between x and z now:
- x is at (5, 1) to (7, 3)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

In this case, x is to the right and below z, so x is Southeast of z.

This confirms that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

Wait, actually I made a mistake in the second example. When I moved x to (3, 1) to (5, 3), x is no longer strictly South of y (which is at (1, 3) to (3, 5)). The regions overlap in the East-West direction, so this is a different kind of relation. Let me redo this.

Correctly:
- z is a square region at (3, 3) to (5, 5).
- y is a square region at (1, 3) to (3, 5). Since y is to the left of z, "y is West of z" is satisfied.
- x is a square region at (1, 1) to (3, 3). Since x is below y, "x is South of y" is satisfied.

Now, let's adjust the position of x to (2, 1) to (4, 3). This satisfies "x is South of y" because x is still below y.

The relation between x and z now:
- x is at (2, 1) to (4, 3)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

In this case, x is partially to the left and below z, but it also extends to the right, overlapping with z in the East-West direction. But since the regions don't spatially overlap, and x is below z, x is South of z.

Actually, in the cardinal direction system for regions, the relation is typically determined by the position of the entire region, not just individual points. If there's an overlap in the East-West direction but the regions are separate in the North-South direction, the relation is strictly North or South.

So, in this case, the relation would be South.

And one more adjustment:
- x is a square region at (4, 1) to (6, 3). This satisfies "x is South of y" because x is still below y (they don't overlap in the North-South direction).

The relation between x and z now:
- x is at (4, 1) to (6, 3)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

In this case, x is partially to the right and below z, but it also extends to the left, overlapping with z in the East-West direction. Given the reasoning above, the relation would be South.

And one more:
- x is a square region at (5, 1) to (7, 3). This satisfies "x is South of y" because x is still below y.

The relation between x and z now:
- x is at (5, 1) to (7, 3)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

In this case, x is to the right and below z, so x is Southeast of z.

Wait, let me make sure I'm being precise and accurate here. I think I'm getting lost in the weeds.

Let's redefine the cardinal direction relations for regions more carefully.

For two regions A and B, the cardinal direction relation between them is determined by the relationship between their bounding boxes. The possible relations are:
- North: A's bounding box is above B's bounding box.
- Northeast: A's bounding box is above and to the right of B's bounding box.
- East: A's bounding box is to the right of B's bounding box.
- Southeast: A's bounding box is below and to the right of B's bounding box.
- South: A's bounding box is below B's bounding box.
- Southwest: A's bounding box is below and to the left of B's bounding box.
- West: A's bounding box is to the left of B's bounding box.
- Northwest: A's bounding box is above and to the left of B's bounding box.
- Bounding Box: A's bounding box intersects with B's bounding box.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider the problem.

If "x is South of y", then x's bounding box is below y's bounding box. And if "y is West of z", then y's bounding box is to the left of z's bounding box.

What can we deduce about the relation between x's bounding box and z's bounding box?

Well, x's bounding box is below y's bounding box, and y's bounding box is to the left of z's bounding box. From this, we can only say for sure that x's bounding box is below and to the left of z's bounding box, which corresponds to the Southwest direction.

That can't be right. Let me try again with specific examples.

Suppose:
- z is a square region at (3, 3) to (5, 5).
- y is a square region at (1, 3) to (3, 5). Since y is to the left of z, "y is West of z" is satisfied.
- x is a square region at (1, 1) to (3, 3). Since x is below y, "x is South of y" is satisfied.

Now, the relation between x and z:
- x is at (1, 1) to (3, 3)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

Here, x's bounding box is below and to the left of z's bounding box, so the relation is Southwest.

Now, let's move x to (3, 1) to (5, 3). This doesn't satisfy "x is South of y" because x is not below y; they overlap in the East-West direction. 

Hmm, I think I'm being imprecise in how I define "below." Let me clarify.

For two regions A and B, A is "below" B if the maximum y-coordinate of A is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of B. Similarly, A is "to the left" of B if the maximum x-coordinate of A is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of B.

With this definition:
- x is at (1, 1) to (3, 3)
- y is at (1, 3) to (3, 5)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

x is below y (max y of x = 3, min y of y = 3, and 3 <= 3), so "x is South of y" is satisfied.
y is to the left of z (max x of y = 3, min x of z = 3, and 3 <= 3), so "y is West of z" is satisfied.

And the relation between x and z:
x is not below z (max y of x = 3, min y of z = 3, and 3 <= 3), so x is not strictly South of z.
x is to the left of z (max x of x = 3, min x of z = 3, and 3 <= 3), so x is West of z.

This is confusing. If x is below y and y is to the left of z, how can x be to the left of z but not below z?

Oh, I see the confusion. I said that x is not strictly South of z, but it is still South of z (because the max y of x is less than or equal to the min y of z). The term "strictly South" is not a standard term in the cardinal direction system; I was using it colloquially.

So, in this example, x is South of z and West of z, which makes the relation Southwest.

Let me try another example:
- x is at (2, 1) to (4, 3)
- y is at (1, 3) to (3, 5)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

x is below y (max y of x = 3, min y of y = 3, and 3 <= 3), so "x is South of y" is satisfied.
y is to the left of z (max x of y = 3, min x of z = 3, and 3 <= 3), so "y is West of z" is satisfied.

And the relation between x and z:
x is below z (max y of x = 3, min y of z = 3, and 3 <= 3), so x is South of z.
x is not strictly to the left of z (max x of x = 4, min x of z = 3, and 4 > 3).
x is not strictly to the right of z (min x of x = 2, max x of z = 5, and 2 < 5).

Given the position of x and z, their bounding boxes overlap in the East-West direction, so the relation would be South.

And another example:
- x is at (4, 1) to (6, 3)
- y is at (1, 3) to (3, 5)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

x is below y (max y of x = 3, min y of y = 3, and 3 <= 3), so "x is South of y" is satisfied.
y is to the left of z (max x of y = 3, min x of z = 3, and 3 <= 3), so "y is West of z" is satisfied.

And the relation between x and z:
x is below z (max y of x = 3, min y of z = 3, and 3 <= 3), so x is South of z.
x is not strictly to the left of z (max x of x = 6, min x of z = 3, and 6 > 3).
x is not strictly to the right of z (min x of x = 4, max x of z = 5, and 4 < 5).

Again, the bounding boxes overlap in the East-West direction, so the relation would be South.

And one more:
- x is at (5, 1) to (7, 3)
- y is at (1, 3) to (3, 5)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

x is below y (max y of x = 3, min y of y = 3, and 3 <= 3), so "x is South of y" is satisfied.
y is to the left of z (max x of y = 3, min x of z = 3, and 3 <= 3), so "y is West of z" is satisfied.

And the relation between x and z:
x is below z (max y of x = 3, min y of z = 3, and 3 <= 3), so x is South of z.
x is to the right of z (min x of x = 5, max x of z = 5, and 5 >= 5), so x is East of z.

This means the relation is Southeast.

So, from these examples, we see that the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest (when x is below and to the left of z)
- South (when x is below z and overlaps with z in the East-West direction)
- Southeast (when x is below and to the right of z)

Actually, the definition for cardinal direction relationships I provided above is too strict. It's more like how cardinal directions are defined between points.

For regions, the cardinal direction relations are typically defined in terms of projections onto the coordinate axes:
- A is North of B if the projection of A onto the y-axis is above the projection of B onto the y-axis.
- A is East of B if the projection of A onto the x-axis is to the right of the projection of B onto the x-axis.
- A is South of B if the projection of A onto the y-axis is below the projection of B onto the y-axis.
- A is West of B if the projection of A onto the x-axis is to the left of the projection of B onto the x-axis.

For compound directions (e.g., Northeast), both the simple cardinal directions must hold. 

So, A is Northeast of B if:
1. A is North of B, and
2. A is East of B.

Given these definitions, let's reconsider the problem.

If "x is South of y", then the projection of x onto the y-axis is below the projection of y onto the y-axis. And if "y is West of z", then the projection of y onto the x-axis is to the left of the projection of z onto the x-axis.

What can we deduce about the relation between x and z?

From the given constraints, we can only say for sure that the projection of x onto the y-axis is below the projection of z onto the y-axis (because x is South of y, and y and z don't have a North-South relationship). This means x is South of z.

But we can't make a definitive statement about the East-West relation between x and z from the given constraints. x could be to the left, aligned, or to the right of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Southwest (if x is to the left of z)
- South (if x and z are aligned in the East-West direction)
- Southeast (if x is to the right of z)

Actually, I don't think a compound relation like "Southwest" is possible if x is not strictly to the left of z (i.e., if the projections onto the x-axis overlap). If there's an overlap, the relation would simply be "South."

Let me redo my analysis with a concrete example:

Consider these regions:
- x is at (2, 1) to (4, 3)
- y is at (1, 3) to (3, 5)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

The projection of x onto the y-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of y onto the y-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, "x is South of y" is satisfied.
The projection of y onto the x-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of z onto the x-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, "y is West of z" is satisfied.

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
The projection of x onto the y-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of z onto the y-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, x is South of z.
The projection of x onto the x-axis is (2, 4), and the projection of z onto the x-axis is (3, 5). There's an overlap in the projections, so x is not strictly to the left or right of z.

Given this, the relation would simply be "South."

Let me try with a different setup, where x is strictly to the left of z:
- x is at (1, 1) to (3, 3)
- y is at (1, 3) to (3, 5)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

The projection of x onto the y-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of y onto the y-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, "x is South of y" is satisfied.
The projection of y onto the x-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of z onto the x-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, "y is West of z" is satisfied.

Now, the relation between x and z:
The projection of x onto the y-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of z onto the y-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, x is South of z.
The projection of x onto the x-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of z onto the x-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, x is West of z.

Given these, the compound relation would be "Southwest."

And let's try one more, where x is strictly to the right of z:
- x is at (5, 1) to (7, 3)
- y is at (1, 3) to (3, 5)
- z is at (3, 3) to (5, 5)

The projection of x onto the y-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of y onto the y-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, "x is South of y" is satisfied.
The projection of y onto the x-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of z onto the x-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, "y is West of z" is satisfied.

Now, the relation between x and z:
The projection of x onto the y-axis is (1, 3), and the projection of z onto the y-axis is (3, 5). Since 3 <= 3, x is South of z.
The projection of x onto the x-axis is (5, 7), and the projection of z onto the x-axis is (3, 5). Since 5 >= 5, x is East of z.

Given these, the compound relation would be "Southeast."

So, from these examples, we see that the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest (when x is strictly to the left of z)
- South (when x and z have an overlap in the East-West direction)
- Southeast (when x is strictly to the right of z)

Actually, I don't think the term "Bounding Box" describes a spatial relation in the way the problem is phrased. The term "Bounding Box" in the problem statement is likely just referring to the concept of a bounding box, not a potential relation.

Actually, I'm not sure if this is a simple containment relation or not. Let's clarify the definition of "South of" and "West of" in the context of the problem.

If region x is "South of" region y, it means the entirety of x is located in the southern half-plane from y. In other words, every point in x is to the south of at least one point in y.

Similarly, if region y is "West of" region z, it means the entirety of y is located in the western half-plane from z. In other words, every point in y is to the west of at least one point in z.

Given these definitions, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

Well, x is to the south of y, and y is to the west of z. From this, we can only say for sure that x is to the south of some part of z and to the west of some part of z. But this doesn't give us a definitive cardinal direction relation between x and z.

Actually, this is getting quite subtle. Let me take a different approach. If region x is South of region y, it does not necessarily mean that every point in x is to the south of every point in y. It just means that x is in the "South" region of y.

If we use a 9-intersection model (or the cardinal direction relations), the space around a reference region is divided into 9 areas: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the region itself (sometimes called Bounding Box or Contains).

Given these definitions:
- "x is South of y" means x is in the South region of y, but it doesn't constrain the East-West position of x relative to y.
- "y is West of z" means y is in the West region of z, but it doesn't constrain the North-South position of y relative to z.

From these, we can only deduce that x is to the South of some part of z and to the West of some part of z. But without further constraints, we can't determine a specific cardinal direction relation between x and z.

Actually, I'm getting confused by the precise definitions here. Let me go back to basics and think this through more carefully.

Let's consider a scenario where the world is divided into a grid. The cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) are defined relative to the grid. 

If region x is South of region y, it means that for every point in x, its y-coordinate is less than the y-coordinate of at least one point in y. Similarly, if region y is West of region z, it means that for every point in y, its x-coordinate is less than the x-coordinate of at least one point in z.

Now, let's think about the relation between x and z.

From the constraints, we know that:
1. Every point in x has a y-coordinate less than the y-coordinate of at least one point in y.
2. Every point in y has an x-coordinate less than the x-coordinate of at least one point in z.

From (1), we can infer that every point in x has a y-coordinate less than the y-coordinate of at least one point in z. This means x is South of z.

From (2), we can infer that... actually, we can't infer a direct East-West relation between x and z. x could be anywhere in the East-West direction relative to z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Southwest (if x is to the left of z)
- South (if x is neither to the left nor to the right of z)
- Southeast (if x is to the right of z)

But actually, I realize that given the constraints, there's no way to guarantee that x is to the west of z or to the east of z. So, the only definitive relation is "South."

Wait, let me check this again with a concrete example.

Consider:
- y is a region in the area (1, 3) to (3, 5).
- z is a region in the area (3, 3) to (5, 5).

Given that y is to the west of z, let's consider several positions for x:

1. x is a region in the area (1, 1) to (3, 3).
   Is x South of y? Yes, because every point in x is below at least one point in y.
   Now, what's the relation between x and z?
   Every point in x is below at least one point in z, so x is South of z.
   Every point in x is to the left of at least one point in z, so x is West of z.
   Since x is both South and West of z, the relation is Southwest.

2. x is a region in the area (2, 1) to (4, 3).
   Is x South of y? Yes, because every point in x is below at least one point in y.
   Now, what's the relation between x and z?
   Every point in x is below at least one point in z, so x is South of z.
   Some points in x are to the left of all points in z, and some points in x are to the right of some points in z. This means x is neither strictly West nor strictly East of z. The relation is South.

3. x is a region in the area (4, 1) to (6, 3).
   Is x South of y? This is tricky. Not every point in x is below every point in y. But every point in x is below at least one point in y. So, x is South of y.
   Now, what's the relation between x and z?
   Every point in x is below at least one point in z, so x is South of z.
   Some points in x are to the right of all points in z. This means x is East of z. The relation is Southeast.

From these examples, it seems that the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

Let's pause and redefine the cardinal direction relations more precisely:

For two regions A and B, the cardinal direction relations can be defined as follows:
- A is North of B if every point in A is above at least one point in B, and not every point in A is strictly to the left or right of all points in B.
- A is Northeast of B if every point in A is above at least one point in B, and every point in A is to the right of at least one point in B.
- A is East of B if every point in A is to the right of at least one point in B, and not every point in A is strictly above or below all points in B.
- A is Southeast of B if every point in A is below at least one point in B, and every point in A is to the right of at least one point in B.
- A is South of B if every point in A is below at least one point in B, and not every point in A is strictly to the left or right of all points in B.
- A is Southwest of B if every point in A is below at least one point in B, and every point in A is to the left of at least one point in B.
- A is West of B if every point in A is to the left of at least one point in B, and not every point in A is strictly above or below all points in B.
- A is Northwest of B if every point in A is above at least one point in B, and every point in A is to the left of at least one point in B.

With these definitions, let's reconsider the problem.

If "x is South of y", then every point in x is below at least one point in y. And if "y is West of z", then every point in y is to the left of at least one point in z.

What can we deduce about the relation between x and z?

We can say for sure that every point in x is below at least one point in z. This means x is in the southern half-plane of z.

But we can't make a definitive statement about the East-West relation between x and z. x could be to the left, aligned, or to the right of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Southwest (if every point in x is to the left of at least one point in z)
- South (if not every point in x is strictly to the left or right of all points in z)
- Southeast (if every point in x is to the right of at least one point in z)

I apologize for the lengthy analysis, but I wanted to be thorough. Let me summarize.

Given that region x is South of region y and region y is West of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

I believe I've examined all potential scenarios, and these are the only possible relations between x and z given the constraints in the problem.

So, the answer is Southwest, South, Southeast.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

Since x is South of y, we know x is below y. Since y is West of z, we know y is to the left of z. From these constraints:

1. x must be South of z (because x is below y, which has the same or higher vertical position as z)
2. The horizontal relationship between x and z is not constrained - x could be to the left of z (Southwest), aligned with z (South), or to the right of z (Southeast)
