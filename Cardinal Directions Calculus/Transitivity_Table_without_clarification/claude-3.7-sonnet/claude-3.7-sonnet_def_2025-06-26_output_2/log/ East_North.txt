PROMPT: Let  East and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I need to determine what cardinal direction relation holds between region x and region z, given:
- x is East of y
- y is North of z

Let's use a coordinate system where:
- North is the positive y-direction
- East is the positive x-direction

So if:
- x is East of y, then x has a greater x-coordinate than y
- y is North of z, then y has a greater y-coordinate than z

Now, what do we know about the relationship between x and z?
- x has a greater x-coordinate than y (because x is East of y)
- y has a greater y-coordinate than z (because y is North of z)

But this doesn't tell us directly how the x-coordinate of x compares to the x-coordinate of z, nor how the y-coordinate of x compares to the y-coordinate of z.

Let's try to visualize some possibilities:

Case 1: If x is directly East of y, and y is directly North of z, then x would be Northeast of z.
```
   y --- x
   |
   |
   z
```

Case 2: But x could be more North than y, in which case x would still be Northeast of z.
```
     x
    /
   y
   |
   |
   z
```

Case 3: Or x could be slightly South of y (but still East of y), in which case x could be East of z.
```
   y
   |     x
   |    /
   z ---
```

Case 4: Or x could be significantly South of y (but still East of y), in which case x could be Southeast of z.
```
   y
   |
   |
   z --- x
```

So based on these cases, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Let me double-check this by thinking more systematically.

If x is East of y, then x is in the Eastern half-plane with respect to y.
If y is North of z, then y is in the Northern half-plane with respect to z.

Now, where is x with respect to z?
- The x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y (because x is East of y)
- The x-coordinate of y could be greater than, equal to, or less than the x-coordinate of z (we don't know)
- So the x-coordinate of x could be greater than the x-coordinate of z (making x East of z), or it could be equal to or less than (not making x East of z). But wait, if the x-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the x-coordinate of z, and the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y, then the x-coordinate of x would still be greater than or equal to the x-coordinate of z. So x is at least as East as z is, if not more.

- The y-coordinate of y is greater than the y-coordinate of z (because y is North of z)
- The y-coordinate of x could be greater than, equal to, or less than the y-coordinate of y (we don't know)
- So the y-coordinate of x could be greater than the y-coordinate of z (making x North of z), or it could be equal to or less than (not making x North of z).

Let's enumerate the possibilities based on how the coordinates of x relate to the coordinates of z:
1. If the x-coordinate of x > x-coordinate of z AND y-coordinate of x > y-coordinate of z, then x is Northeast of z.
2. If the x-coordinate of x > x-coordinate of z AND y-coordinate of x = y-coordinate of z, then x is East of z.
3. If the x-coordinate of x > x-coordinate of z AND y-coordinate of x < y-coordinate of z, then x is Southeast of z.
4. If the x-coordinate of x = x-coordinate of z AND y-coordinate of x > y-coordinate of z, then x is North of z.
5. If the x-coordinate of x = x-coordinate of z AND y-coordinate of x = y-coordinate of z, then x is the same as z (which contradicts our premises).
6. If the x-coordinate of x = x-coordinate of z AND y-coordinate of x < y-coordinate of z, then x is South of z.
7. If the x-coordinate of x < x-coordinate of z AND y-coordinate of x > y-coordinate of z, then x is Northwest of z.
8. If the x-coordinate of x < x-coordinate of z AND y-coordinate of x = y-coordinate of z, then x is West of z.
9. If the x-coordinate of x < x-coordinate of z AND y-coordinate of x < y-coordinate of z, then x is Southwest of z.

But we already know that x is East of y, and y is North of z. Let's see if this eliminates any of the above possibilities.

If x is East of y, then the x-coordinate of x > x-coordinate of y.
If y is North of z, then the y-coordinate of y > y-coordinate of z.

We don't know how the x-coordinate of y relates to the x-coordinate of z, nor how the y-coordinate of x relates to the y-coordinate of y. So we can't eliminate any possibilities based on the x-coordinate of x vs the x-coordinate of z, or the y-coordinate of x vs the y-coordinate of z.

Let me try a slightly different approach. Let's denote the coordinates as:
- x: (x_x, y_x)
- y: (x_y, y_y)
- z: (x_z, y_z)

Given:
- x is East of y, so x_x > x_y
- y is North of z, so y_y > y_z

We want to determine the possible relationships between x and z, i.e., how (x_x, y_x) relates to (x_z, y_z).

We don't know how x_y relates to x_z, nor how y_x relates to y_y. So let's consider the possible cases:

Case 1: x_y > x_z
   This means y is East of z.
   We know x_x > x_y, so x_x > x_z, which means x is East of z.

Case 2: x_y = x_z
   This means y is neither East nor West of z.
   We know x_x > x_y, so x_x > x_z, which means x is East of z.

Case 3: x_y < x_z
   This means y is West of z.
   We know x_x > x_y, but we don't know if x_x > x_z or x_x < x_z or x_x = x_z. So in this case, x could be East of z, or West of z, or neither East nor West of z.

Now, let's consider the y-coordinates:

Case A: y_x > y_y
   This means x is North of y.
   We know y_y > y_z, so y_x > y_z, which means x is North of z.

Case B: y_x = y_y
   This means x is neither North nor South of y.
   We know y_y > y_z, so y_x > y_z, which means x is North of z.

Case C: y_x < y_y
   This means x is South of y.
   We know y_y > y_z, but we don't know if y_x > y_z or y_x < y_z or y_x = y_z. So in this case, x could be North of z, or South of z, or neither North nor South of z.

Now, let's combine these cases to see all possible relationships between x and z:

1. Case 1A: x is East and North of z, i.e., Northeast.
2. Case 1B: x is East and North of z, i.e., Northeast.
3. Case 1C: x could be East and North of z (Northeast), or East and neither North nor South of z (East), or East and South of z (Southeast).
4. Case 2A: x is East and North of z, i.e., Northeast.
5. Case 2B: x is East and North of z, i.e., Northeast.
6. Case 2C: x could be East and North of z (Northeast), or East and neither North nor South of z (East), or East and South of z (Southeast).
7. Case 3A: x could be East and North of z (Northeast), or West and North of z (Northwest), or neither East nor West but North of z (North).
8. Case 3B: x could be East and North of z (Northeast), or West and North of z (Northwest), or neither East nor West but North of z (North).
9. Case 3C: x could be East and North of z (Northeast), or East and neither North nor South of z (East), or East and South of z (Southeast), or West and North of z (Northwest), or West and neither North nor South of z (West), or West and South of z (Southwest), or neither East nor West but North of z (North), or neither East nor West nor North nor South of z (same position), or neither East nor West but South of z (South).

I'll combine these results to find the complete set of possible relationships between x and z.

Actually, let me reapproach this problem. I'm overcomplicating it and not making progress.

Let's use a different mental model. I'll use a 2D plane where North is the positive y-direction and East is the positive x-direction.

Given:
- x is East of y, so x is in the Eastern half-plane with respect to y.
- y is North of z, so y is in the Northern half-plane with respect to z.

Where can x be with respect to z?

If we consider the position of y as the origin, then:
- x is somewhere in the Eastern half-plane from y.
- z is somewhere in the Southern half-plane from y.

So x is East of y, and z is South of y. This gives us a quadrant system. The question is: where can x be with respect to z?

Well, x can be:
- Northeast of z (if x is significantly East and slightly South, or slightly East and significantly South, or anywhere in between)
- East of z (if x is directly East)
- Southeast of z (if x is East and South)
- North of z (if x is directly North)
- South of z (if x is South)
- Northwest of z (if x is West and North)
- West of z (if x is directly West)
- Southwest of z (if x is West and South)

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me start again.

Given:
- x is East of y
- y is North of z

Let's think of this in terms of a 2D grid.
```
   N
 W + E
   S
```

If y is North of z, then z is South of y. So we have:
```
   y
   |
   |
   z
```

If x is East of y, then:
```
   y --- x
   |
   |
   z
```

Now, what's the relationship between x and z? From the diagram, it appears that x is Northeast of z. But this is just one possibility.

The actual answer depends on how far East x is from y, and how far North y is from z. Let's consider different scenarios:

Scenario 1: If x is far East of y and y is slightly North of z, then x could be primarily East of z with a slight Northern component, which would still be classified as Northeast but more towards East.
```
   y ------------ x
   |
   z
```

Scenario 2: If x is slightly East of y and y is far North of z, then x could be primarily North of z with a slight Eastern component, which would still be classified as Northeast but more towards North.
```
   y
   |
   |
   |
   |
   z --- x
```

Scenario 3: If x is directly East of y and y is directly North of z, then x is precisely Northeast of z.
```
   y --- x
   |
   |
   z
```

Scenario 4: If x is East and slightly South of y, and y is North of z, then x could be East of z.
```
   y
   |     x
   |
   z
```

Scenario 5: If x is East and significantly South of y, but still North of z, then x is East and North of z, which is Northeast.
```
   y
   |
   x
   |
   z
```

Scenario 6: If x is East and South of y, and even South of z, then x is East and South of z, which is Southeast.
```
   y
   |
   z
   |
   x
```

Actually, this is a problem about the composition of cardinal direction relations.

If we denote "East" as E and "North" as N, then we're trying to find E ∘ N (the composition of E and N).

Let's try a systematic approach. Let's set up a coordinate system where the point at the origin is the reference point. In cardinal direction relations:
- North (N) is the region where y > 0 and x = 0
- Northeast (NE) is the region where y > 0 and x > 0
- East (E) is the region where y = 0 and x > 0
- Southeast (SE) is the region where y < 0 and x > 0
- South (S) is the region where y < 0 and x = 0
- Southwest (SW) is the region where y < 0 and x < 0
- West (W) is the region where y = 0 and x < 0
- Northwest (NW) is the region where y > 0 and x < 0

Now, let's think of it in terms of regions. If we have three regions x, y, and z:
- Region x is East of region y if every point in x is East of every point in y.
- Region y is North of region z if every point in y is North of every point in z.

But this means there's a whole range of possible positions for region x with respect to region z. It depends on the shapes and sizes of the regions.

I think I've been overcomplicating the problem, and the reason is that I'm thinking the question is asking for a single directional relation that must hold between x and z. But it's asking for which directional relations *could* hold between x and z. From the problem we are given: "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Going back to the scenarios I enumerated earlier, I found that x could be:
- Northeast of z
- East of z
- Southeast of z

Are there any other possible relations?

Actually, I think I might need to be more precise. In the context of cardinal directions, regions x, y and z are often treated as single points. If we suppose they are all individual points, then from x is East of y, and y is North of z, we can definitively say that x is Northeast of z. 

But if we're considering them as regions with extent, then the question is: given that every point in x is East of every point in y, and every point in y is North of every point in z, what are the possible directional relations between points in x and points in z?

Let's say we have a point in x, let's call it p_x, and a point in z, let's call it p_z. We know that p_x is East of some point in y, let's call it p_y. And p_y is North of p_z. So, p_x is East of a point that is North of p_z.

Now, where can p_x be with respect to p_z?

If p_y is directly North of p_z (i.e., they have the same x-coordinate), and p_x is directly East of p_y (i.e., they have the same y-coordinate), then p_x is Northeast of p_z.

If p_y is North and East of p_z, and p_x is East and North of p_y, then p_x is Northeast of p_z.

If p_y is North and West of p_z, and p_x is East and South of p_y, then the relation between p_x and p_z is unclear. We'd need to know the exact coordinates to determine if p_x is East, Northeast, or Southeast of p_z.

I realize that in the scenario where regions are treated as single points, we can answer definitively. But let's continue with regions of extent.

Let's go back to the problem where x, y, and z are all regions of possibly non-zero extent. So the directional relations mean:
- Region x is East of region y if every point in region x is East of some point in region y.
- Region y is North of region z if every point in region y is North of some point in region z.

Wait, let me revise these definitions based on the usual ones in the literature:
- Region x is East of region y if every point in region x is East of every point in region y.
- Region y is North of region z if every point in region y is North of every point in region z.

So, given these definitions and the statements from the problem:
- Every point in region x is East of every point in region y.
- Every point in region y is North of every point in region z.

Now, where can region x be with respect to region z?

Let's pick an arbitrary point p_x in region x and an arbitrary point p_z in region z. We want to find all possible directional relations between p_x and p_z.

We know:
- p_x is East of every point in region y.
- Every point in region y is North of p_z.

So, p_x is East of points that are North of p_z. This means p_x is in the Eastern half-plane with respect to the Northern half-plane from p_z. If we draw these half-planes, we get a quadrant: the Northeast quadrant from p_z.

So, p_x is Northeast of p_z. And since this is true for any arbitrary point p_x in region x and any arbitrary point p_z in region z, it means the entire region x is Northeast of the entire region z. And that seems to be the only possible directional relation.

I'm noticing a flaw in my reasoning. If x is East of y, it doesn't necessarily mean that every point in x is East of every point in y. It could mean that the central point or a representative point of x is East of the central point or a representative point of y. Without a precise definition, I'll assume the relationship is meant for all points as I had before.

Given that all points in x are East of all points in y, and all points in y are North of all points in z, I still believe the relationship between x and z can only be Northeast.

But I need to be careful. I'm thinking of "North" and "East" as straight-line directions. In reality, the relation "East" can include any point that is "Eastward" of another, which includes Northeast and Southeast. Similarly, "North" can include Northwest and Northeast.

Actually, in the formal definition of cardinal direction relations, "East" specifically means the region where y = 0 and x > 0 with respect to the reference point. So it's a straight-line direction, not an angular sector.

Let's revisit the problem. Given the formal definitions of cardinal directions:

- x is East of y means all points in x have the same y-coordinate as all points in y, but greater x-coordinates.
- y is North of z means all points in y have the same x-coordinate as all points in z, but greater y-coordinates.

Given these, where can x be with respect to z?

If x is directly East of y, then all points in x have the same y-coordinate as all points in y. And if y is directly North of z, then all points in y have the same x-coordinate as all points in z. This means all points in x have a greater x-coordinate than all points in z (because x is East of y, which has the same x-coordinate as z), and all points in x have the same y-coordinate as all points in y, which have a greater y-coordinate than all points in z. So, all points in x have greater x-coordinates and greater y-coordinates than all points in z, which means x is Northeast of z.

But, I'm concerned that I'm still interpreting "East" and "North" too strictly. Let me think about the question more carefully.

Actually, let's go back to the formal definitions for clarity.

Cardinal direction relations for regions (as opposed to points) are often defined using the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that can fully contain the region with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Using MBRs, we can define the cardinal direction relations as follows:
- Region x is East of region y if the westernmost point (minimum x-coordinate) of the MBR of x is east of the easternmost point (maximum x-coordinate) of the MBR of y.
- Region y is North of region z if the southernmost point (minimum y-coordinate) of the MBR of y is north of the northernmost point (maximum y-coordinate) of the MBR of z.

Now, given these definitions, let's see where region x can be with respect to region z.

If region x is East of region y, then the westernmost point of x is east of the easternmost point of y. And if region y is North of region z, then the southernmost point of y is north of the northernmost point of z.

This doesn't directly tell us where region x is with respect to region z. It depends on the relative positions of the MBRs. If the MBRs of y and z are aligned (i.e., have the same x-range) and the MBRs of x and y are aligned (i.e., have the same y-range), then region x would be Northeast of region z. But there are other possibilities.

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating this. If we're using the formal definitions based on MBRs or just straight directions, and given the information from the problem, region x must be one of the following with respect to region z:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

I'll now back up this conclusion by reviewing once more.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

Let's approach this systematically by considering the possible coordinates for three points, one from each region:

p_x = (x_x, y_x)
p_y = (x_y, y_y)
p_z = (x_z, y_z)

From the given directions:
- Since p_x is East of p_y, we have x_x > x_y.
- Since p_y is North of p_z, we have y_y > y_z.

But we don't know the relation between y_x and y_y, nor between x_y and x_z. So let's consider the cases.

Case 1: y_x > y_y, i.e., p_x is also North of p_y.
   In this case, y_x > y_y > y_z, so p_x is North of p_z.
   Also, x_x > x_y. If x_y > x_z, then x_x > x_z, so p_x is East of p_z.
   If x_y = x_z, then x_x > x_z, so p_x is East of p_z.
   If x_y < x_z, then the relation between x_x and x_z is uncertain, so p_x could be East or West of p_z.
   Overall, in this case, p_x could be Northeast, North, or Northwest of p_z.

Case 2: y_x = y_y, i.e., p_x is neither North nor South of p_y.
   In this case, y_x = y_y > y_z, so p_x is North of p_z.
   Similar to Case 1, p_x could be Northeast, North, or Northwest of p_z.

Case 3: y_x < y_y, i.e., p_x is South of p_y.
   In this case, the relation between y_x and y_z is uncertain. p_x could be North, South, or at the same latitude as p_z.
   Similar to the other cases, p_x could be East, West, or at the same longitude as p_z.
   So, in this case, p_x could be in any cardinal direction with respect to p_z.

OK, I realize that the task has become quite complicated. Let me try to more clearly bring out the possibilities.

If p_x is in region x, p_y is in region y, and p_z is in region z, then we know:
- p_x is East of p_y, so x_x > x_y.
- p_y is North of p_z, so y_y > y_z.

Given these, here are the possible relations between p_x and p_z:

1. If x_y > x_z, then x_x > x_y > x_z, so p_x is East of p_z.
2. If x_y = x_z, then x_x > x_y = x_z, so p_x is East of p_z.
3. If x_y < x_z, then we can't directly compare x_x and x_z, so p_x could be East, West, or at the same longitude as p_z.

Similarly:

1. If y_x > y_y, then y_x > y_y > y_z, so p_x is North of p_z.
2. If y_x = y_y, then y_x = y_y > y_z, so p_x is North of p_z.
3. If y_x < y_y, then we can't directly compare y_x and y_z, so p_x could be North, South, or at the same latitude as p_z.

Combining the possibilities for longitude and latitude:

- If p_x is East and North of p_z, then p_x is Northeast of p_z.
- If p_x is East and at the same latitude as p_z, then p_x is East of p_z.
- If p_x is East and South of p_z, then p_x is Southeast of p_z.
- If p_x is at the same longitude as p_z and North of p_z, then p_x is North of p_z.
- If p_x is at the same longitude and latitude as p_z, then p_x = p_z (which is unlikely, but technically possible).
- If p_x is at the same longitude as p_z and South of p_z, then p_x is South of p_z.
- If p_x is West and North of p_z, then p_x is Northwest of p_z.
- If p_x is West and at the same latitude as p_z, then p_x is West of p_z.
- If p_x is West and South of p_z, then p_x is Southwest of p_z.

But wait, I'm forgetting the original constraints. If we enforce those:

- From x_x > x_y (p_x is East of p_y), and the cases for x_y vs. x_z, we get: p_x is definitely East of p_z if x_y >= x_z.
- From y_y > y_z (p_y is North of p_z), and the cases for y_x vs. y_y, we get: p_x is definitely North of p_z if y_x >= y_y.

So, under what conditions would p_x not be East of p_z? Only if x_y < x_z and x_x <= x_z. But even if x_y < x_z, given that x_x > x_y, it's possible for x_x to be > x_z. So the only way p_x is not East of p_z is if x_y < x_z and x_x <= x_z, which doesn't contradict the original constraint.

And under what conditions would p_x not be North of p_z? Only if y_x < y_y and y_x <= y_z. Again, this doesn't contradict the original constraint.

So, based on the formal interpretation of cardinal directions and the constraints of the problem, region x could be in any of the nine cardinal direction relations with respect to region z.

But wait. I think I might be conflating several notions here. Let's be even more precise.

For the cardinal directions "East" and "North" as relations between spatial regions, I am going to use very strict definitions. These definitions depend on the properties of the cone-shaped cardinal direction relations system.

Using these definitions:
- Region x is East of region y if every point in x is to the East of every point in y, meaning that the x-coordinate of every point in x is greater than the x-coordinate of every point in y, and the y-coordinates can vary.
- Region y is North of region z if every point in y is to the North of every point in z, meaning that the y-coordinate of every point in y is greater than the y-coordinate of every point in z, and the x-coordinates can vary.

I have to be careful about mixing these cardinal relations. They don't correspond directly to the x and y axes, but rather to cones centered at the reference point.

Given these, and the problem statements:
- Every point in x is to the East of every point in y.
- Every point in y is to the North of every point in z.

What are the possible relations between a point in x and a point in z?

I think the question is actually asking about the composition of cardinal directions. That is, if xEy (x is East of y) and yNz (y is North of z), then what is the result of the composition E∘N? It's essentially asking: if you go East and then North, where do you end up?

OK, I'll try one more time. Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means that x is in the Eastern half-plane from y.
- Region y is North of region z: This means that y is in the Northern half-plane from z.

From z's perspective:
- y is in the Northern half-plane.
- x is in the Northern half-plane from z (since x is East of y, and y is North of z), and also in the Eastern half-plane from z (since x is East of y, and the Eastern half-plane from y is a subset of the Eastern half-plane from z).

Hmm, actually, I'm not sure about the last statement. Let me revisit it.

If x is East of y, then x is in the Eastern half-plane from y. And if y is North of z, then y is in the Northern half-plane from z. From this, can we determine which half-plane x is in with respect to z?

Actually, I think the approach I've been taking is incorrect. I need to get back to basics.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

I'll define the cardinal directions strictly:
- Region a is East of region b if all points in a have a greater x-coordinate than all points in b.
- Region a is North of region b if all points in a have a greater y-coordinate than all points in b.

Let's consider points from each region:
- p_x from region x
- p_y from region y
- p_z from region z

We know:
- p_x is East of p_y, so x_x > x_y.
- p_y is North of p_z, so y_y > y_z.

We don't have direct information about the relationship between p_x and p_z. All we know is that p_x is East of a point (p_y) that is North of p_z.

Now let me approach the problem systematically:

Regarding the x-coordinate:
1. If x_y > x_z, then x_x > x_y > x_z, so p_x is East of p_z.
2. If x_y = x_z, then x_x > x_y = x_z, so p_x is East of p_z.
3. If x_y < x_z, then we don't know if x_x > x_z or x_x < x_z or x_x = x_z, so p_x could be East, West, or at the same longitude as p_z.

Regarding the y-coordinate:
1. If y_x > y_y, then y_x > y_y > y_z, so p_x is North of p_z.
2. If y_x = y_y, then y_x = y_y > y_z, so p_x is North of p_z.
3. If y_x < y_y, then we don't know if y_x > y_z or y_x < y_z or y_x = y_z, so p_x could be North, South, or at the same latitude as p_z.

Combining these cases, p_x could be in any of the nine cardinal directions with respect to p_z, including being at the same location.

But let's try to narrow it down. Can we eliminate any directions based on the problem constraints?

Consider this: If x_y < x_z, and y_x < y_y, then p_x might be anywhere with respect to p_z.

OK, actually let me reorient how I'm thinking about this. In the question, it says "Let East and North be cardinal direction relations." That is, we're not dealing with individual points, but rather with relations between regions. And the question is, given the directional relations xEy and yNz, what are the possible directional relations between x and z?

The composition of East and North, or E∘N, would be the direction you get when you go East and then North. This is Northeast.

In fact, I think the answer is simply that x can be Northeast, East, or Southeast of z.

Let me try to convince myself more fully. Let's denote directions by their initials: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B (for "Bounding Box", which means the regions overlap or one contains the other).

If xEy, then the possible directions of x from y are: E. And if yNz, then the possible directions of y from z are: N.

To determine the possible directions of x from z, we need to find all directions d such that there exist points p_x, p_y, p_z, and directions d1 and d2 where p_x is d1 of p_y, p_y is d2 of p_z, and p_x is d of p_z, with d1 = E and d2 = N.

Let's think about this using coordinates.

If p_x is East of p_y, then x_x > x_y.
If p_y is North of p_z, then y_y > y_z.

These constraints don't fully determine the direction of p_x from p_z. We need to know the relation between y_x and y_y (is p_x North, South, or at the same latitude as p_y?) and the relation between x_y and x_z (is p_y East, West, or at the same longitude as p_z?).

If y_x > y_y (p_x is North of p_y) and x_y = x_z (p_y is at the same longitude as p_z), then p_x is Northeast of p_z.
If y_x = y_y (p_x is at the same latitude as p_y) and x_y = x_z (p_y is at the same longitude as p_z), then p_x is Northeast of p_z.
If y_x < y_y (p_x is South of p_y) and x_y = x_z (p_y is at the same longitude as p_z), then the direction of p_x from p_z depends on the specific values of y_x, y_y, and y_z. If y_x > y_z, then p_x is East of p_z. If y_x = y_z, then p_x is East of p_z. If y_x < y_z, then p_x is Southeast of p_z.

I'm going to simplify and just enumerate all possibilities, assuming the constraints that p_x is East of p_y and p_y is North of p_z.

The possible directions of p_x from p_z include:
- Northeast (if p_x is North of p_y and p_y is East of p_z, or if p_x is at the same latitude as p_y and p_y is East of p_z, or if p_x is South of p_y but still North of p_z, and p_y is East of p_z)
- East (if p_x is South of p_y and at the same latitude as p_z, and p_y is East of p_z)
- Southeast (if p_x is South of p_y and South of p_z, and p_y is East of p_z)
- North (if p_x is North of p_y and p_y is at the same longitude as p_z, or if p_x is at the same latitude as p_y and p_y is at the same longitude as p_z, or if p_x is South of p_y but still North of p_z, and p_y is at the same longitude as p_z)
- Same location (if p_x is South of p_y and at the same latitude as p_z, and p_y is at the same longitude as p_z)
- South (if p_x is South of p_y and South of p_z, and p_y is at the same longitude as p_z)
- Northwest (if p_x is North of p_y and p_y is West of p_z, or if p_x is at the same latitude as p_y and p_y is West of p_z, or if p_x is South of p_y but still North of p_z, and p_y is West of p_z)
- West (if p_x is South of p_y and at the same latitude as p_z, and p_y is West of p_z)
- Southwest (if p_x is South of p_y and South of p_z, and p_y is West of p_z)

In other words, p_x could be in any direction from p_z.

But, we also have to consider the problem statement more closely. If "x is East of y" is true for all points in x and all points in y, and if "y is North of z" is true for all points in y and all points in z, then the direction of every point in x from every point in z must be consistent with these constraints.

Let's re-examine the constraints more carefully:
- If x is East of y, then every point in x is East of every point in y. This means the westernmost point of x is still east of the easternmost point of y.
- If y is North of z, then every point in y is North of every point in z. This means the southernmost point of y is still north of the northernmost point of z.

So, let's consider the direction of an arbitrary point p_x in x from an arbitrary point p_z in z. We know p_x is east of the easternmost point of y, and we know any point in y is north of p_z.

If the easternmost point of y is directly north of p_z, then p_x is east and north of p_z, so p_x is Northeast of p_z.
If the easternmost point of y is northeast of p_z, then p_x is even further east and north, so p_x is Northeast of p_z.
If the easternmost point of y is east of p_z (but not north), then p_x is even further east, but the northness of p_x with respect to p_z is uncertain. p_x could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of p_z.
If the easternmost point of y is southeast of p_z, then p_x is even further east, but even further south, so p_x is Southeast of p_z.
If the easternmost point of y is south of p_z (but not east), then p_x is east of a point that is south of p_z, so the direction of p_x from p_z is uncertain. p_x could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of p_z.
If the easternmost point of y is southwest of p_z, then p_x is east of a point that is southwest of p_z. The direction of p_x from p_z is uncertain, but it could be Northeast, East, Southeast, North, or West.
If the easternmost point of y is west of p_z (but not south), then p_x is east of a point that is west of p_z. The direction of p_x from p_z is uncertain, but it could be any of the eight cardinal directions, or p_x could be at the same location as p_z.
If the easternmost point of y is northwest of p_z, then p_x is east of a point that is northwest of p_z. The direction of p_x from p_z is uncertain, but it could be any of the eight cardinal directions, or p_x could be at the same location as p_z.

Alright, I feel I'm overcomplicating this because I'm thinking of cardinal relations as binary relationships. But in the field of spatial reasoning, a cardinal relation like "East" has a precise meaning.

To be entirely clear: 

Cardinal Direction Relation "East" (E): Region A is East of Region B if every point in A is to the east of every point in B, i.e., for all a in A and b in B, the x-coordinate of a is greater than the x-coordinate of b.

Cardinal Direction Relation "North" (N): Region A is North of Region B if every point in A is to the north of every point in B, i.e., for all a in A and b in B, the y-coordinate of a is greater than the y-coordinate of b.

Given these, we can derive the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is East of y and y is North of z.

Let's denote coordinates as:
- (x_a, y_a) for a point in region A
- (x_b, y_b) for a point in region B
- (x_c, y_c) for a point in region C

Given that region A is East of region B, we know that for all points in these regions, x_a > x_b.
Given that region B is North of region C, we know that for all points in these regions, y_b > y_c.

These constraints do not fully determine the relation between region A and region C. We need to consider all possible relations between (x_a, y_a) and (x_c, y_c) that are consistent with the given constraints.

Actually, let me simply use set theory to clarify things. Given the definition of North and East:
- East = {(x,y) : x > 0}
- North = {(x,y) : y > 0}

If region x is East of region y, this means, using a coordinate system centered on y, that x is entirely contained in the East direction from y:
x ⊆ East

Similarly, if region y is North of region z, this means, using a coordinate system centered on z, that y is entirely contained in the North direction from z:
y ⊆ North

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to consider the coordinate system centered on z. In this system, y is in the North, i.e., y ⊆ North. Also, x is East of y, which means x is in the East with respect to a coordinate system centered on y. If we translate this to the coordinate system centered on z, where is x?

Let's denote the East direction from region y as East(y), and the North direction from region z as North(z). We know:
x ⊆ East(y)
y ⊆ North(z)

We want to find the possible directions of x from z, which is equivalent to asking: which direction sets from z could contain x?

Actually, here's a graphical approach: Think of two grids, one centered on y and one centered on z. In the y-centered grid, x is in the East. In the z-centered grid, y is in the North. Where is x in the z-centered grid?

If y is in the z-centered North, and x is in the y-centered East, then x is in the z-centered Northeast, East, or Southeast.

Let me explain why:
- Northeast: If x is in the y-centered East and slightly North, and y is in the z-centered North and slightly East, then x is in the z-centered Northeast.
- East: If x is in the y-centered East and slightly South (but still North of z), and y is in the z-centered North and slightly East, then x is in the z-centered East.
- Southeast: If x is in the y-centered East and sufficiently South (South of z), and y is in the z-centered North and slightly East, then x is in the z-centered Southeast.

So actually I think the answer is: Northeast, East, or Southeast.

Actually, no. I'm overcomplicating things because I'm not being clear enough on what East and North mean. Let me try a more precise approach:

Let's use a grid, where North is the positive y-direction and East is the positive x-direction.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y, which means all points in x have a greater x-coordinate than all points in y.
- Region y is North of region z, which means all points in y have a greater y-coordinate than all points in z.

Where can region x be with respect to region z?

I'll try to approach this problem more systematically by considering the constraints on the coordinates:

Let's denote:
- (x_i, y_i) as a point in region i

Given that region x is East of region y, we have:
for all points (x_x, y_x) in region x and (x_y, y_y) in region y, x_x > x_y

Given that region y is North of region z, we have:
for all points (x_y, y_y) in region y and (x_z, y_z) in region z, y_y > y_z

So for all points (x_x, y_x) in region x and (x_z, y_z) in region z, we have x_x > x_y for some point (x_y, y_y) in region y, and y_y > y_z.

This doesn't directly tell us the relation between (x_x, y_x) and (x_z, y_z). It only gives us:
x_x > x_y (from the first constraint)
y_y > y_z (from the second constraint)

We don't have direct constraints on x_y vs. x_z or y_x vs. y_y. So, region x could be in various directions from region z.

Let's try a visual approach. If we place region z at the origin, then region y is in the Northern half-plane from z. And region x is in the Eastern half-plane from y. So where can region x be with respect to the origin?

Given that y is in the Northern half-plane from z, the Eastern half-plane from y can overlap with the Northeast, East, or Southeast quadrants from z. So, region x could be in any of these directions from region z.

So actually, I think the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

But let me come back to the original question to double-check.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

Using the strict cardinal relations, what are the possible relations between region x and region z?

Let's break it down using the cardinal direction relation system:

1. If region x is East of region y, then the entirety of region x is in the Eastern half-plane from the entirety of region y.
2. If region y is North of region z, then the entirety of region y is in the Northern half-plane from the entirety of region z.

From the perspective of region z, where can region x be?
- Region y is in the Northern half-plane from z.
- Region x is in the Eastern half-plane from y.

Since region y is entirely North of region z, and region x is entirely East of region y, we can say that region x is in the Eastern half-plane from a region that is in the Northern half-plane from z. This means region x is either Northeast, East, or Southeast of region z, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

Actually, let me reconsider the Bounding Box, since you mentioned it as a possible directional relation. Let's consider the definitions more precisely:
- If regions A and B have some overlap, or if one contains the other, then A is said to be in the Bounding Box relation with B.

Given our problem:
- Region x is East of region y: This means region x is entirely to the east of region y, so they don't overlap.
- Region y is North of region z: This means region y is entirely to the north of region z, so they don't overlap.

Given these, can region x be in the Bounding Box relation with region z? I.e., can they overlap or can one contain the other?

If region x and region z overlap, it means there's a point (x_p, y_p) that belongs to both region x and region z. But then, this point should be East of every point in region y (since it belongs to region x), and every point in region y should be North of it (since it belongs to region z). This creates a contradictory situation because the point would be both East and not-East of region y. So, region x and region z cannot overlap.

Similarly, one cannot contain the other. So, the Bounding Box relation is not a possible relation between region x and region z.

I think my conclusion is correct: the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, let me revise how to use the grid in thinking about the problem. 

Given that region x is East of region y, we're saying that the entirety of region x is to the right of the entirety of region y on the 2D grid. Similarly, given that region y is North of region z, we're saying that the entirety of region y is above the entirety of region z on the grid.

Let's think of it step by step:
1. Let me place region z on the origin of our grid.
2. Since region y is North of region z, region y must be entirely in the upper half of the grid (positive y-coordinates) and can be anywhere in the x-direction.
3. Since region x is East of region y, region x must be to the right of region y (positive x-coordinates relative to y) and can be anywhere in the y-direction.

Now, let's consider the possible positions of region x with respect to region z:

Case 1: If region y is directly North of region z (i.e., they align along the x-axis), and region x is directly East of region y (i.e., they align along the y-axis), then region x would be in the Northeast quadrant with respect to region z.

Case 2: If region y is North and East of region z, and region x is East of region y, then region x would be even further East of region z and could be in the Northeast or Southeast quadrant, depending on how far North or South region x is with respect to region y.

Case 3: If region y is North and West of region z, and region x is East of region y, then region x could be in the Northeast, East, or Southeast quadrant with respect to region z, depending on how far East region x is from region y.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

This aligns with my previous conclusion. The Bounding Box relation is not a possible relation because the conditions in the problem ensure that regions x, y, and z do not overlap.

So the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is North of region z

When we analyze how these relations compose:

If we place region z as our reference point, then region y must be somewhere in the Northern half-plane relative to z. Since region x is East of region y, region x must be in the Eastern half-plane relative to y.

From region z's perspective, region x could be:
- Northeast of z (if x remains North of z while being East of y)
- East of z (if x is at the same latitude as z while being East of y)
- Southeast of z (if x is South of z while being East of y)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northeast, East, Southeast.
