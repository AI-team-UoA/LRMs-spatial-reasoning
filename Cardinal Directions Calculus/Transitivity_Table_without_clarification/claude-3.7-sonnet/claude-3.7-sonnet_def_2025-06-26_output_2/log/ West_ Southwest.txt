PROMPT: Let  West and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

1. Region x is West of region y
2. Region y is Southwest of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let me use a coordinate system to reason about this. Let's imagine a standard compass with 8 directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

If we place region z at the origin (0,0), then:
- Region y is Southwest of z, so y is in the direction that combines South and West from z.
- Region x is West of y, so x is directly West from y.

So if y is Southwest of z, that means y is in the direction that's both South and West from z. 

Now, x is West of y. So from y, you go directly West to reach x.

Let me visualize this:

```
       N
       |
    NW | NE
       |
W -----z----- E
       |
    SW | SE
       |
       S
```

So y is in the SW direction from z, and x is West of y.

If y is SW of z, then y could be anywhere in that SW direction, and x is West of y.

Let me try to place them on a grid:

```
       N
       |
    NW | NE
       |
W -----z----- E
       |
    SW | SE
       |
       S
       
       x---y
```

Here, y is SW of z, and x is W of y.

But we could also have:

```
       N
       |
    NW | NE
       |
W -----z----- E
       |
    SW | SE
       |
       S
       
    x---y
```

where y is still SW of z, and x is W of y.

Or even:

```
       N
       |
    NW | NE
       |
W --x--z----- E
       |
    SW | SE
       |
       S
       
       y
```

where y is SW of z, and x is W of y.

Given that there's a range of positions, let me think about the possible cardinal directions from z to x.

If y is SW of z, that means y is both South and West of z. 
If x is W of y, that means x is West of y. 

Now, let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x could be directly West of z.
2. x could be Northwest of z (if x is far enough West that it moves North of z).
3. x could be Southwest of z (if x is still South of z).

Let's check each of these:

**Case 1: x is directly West of z.**
This is possible. If y is slightly SW of z, and x is directly W of y, then x could be directly W of z.

**Case 2: x is Northwest of z.**
This is possible. If y is SW of z, and x is W of y but far enough West that it's also North of z, then x would be NW of z.

**Case 3: x is Southwest of z.**
This is also possible. If y is SW of z, and x is W of y, then x could still be SW of z if it remains South of z.

Let's visualize these cases:

**Case 1: x is West of z**
```
       N
       |
    NW | NE
       |
W --x--z----- E
       |
    SW | SE
       |
       S
       
       y
```

**Case 2: x is Northwest of z**
```
       N
       |
    NW | NE
    x  |
W -----z----- E
       |
    SW | SE
       |
       S
       
       y
```

**Case 3: x is Southwest of z**
```
       N
       |
    NW | NE
       |
W -----z----- E
       |
    SW | SE
    x  |
       S
       
       y
```

Hmm, but I think I'm missing something. Let's try a different approach. If y is SW of z, then y has coordinates that are negative in both the East-West axis (West of z) and the North-South axis (South of z). 

Let's say z is at (0, 0), and y is at (-a, -b) where a, b > 0. This confirms y is SW of z.

Now, x is W of y. So x is at (-a - c, -b) where c > 0. This means x is c units more West than y, but at the same North-South position.

So, x is at (-a - c, -b) relative to z.

- If -b < 0, then x is South of z.
- If -b > 0, then x is North of z.
- If -b = 0, then x is neither North nor South of z.

But because y is SW of z, we know -b < 0, meaning x is South of z.

Also, -a - c < 0, meaning x is West of z.

So, x is both West and South of z, which means x is Southwest of z.

Wait, I need to be more careful. 

If y is SW of z, then y has coordinates (-a, -b) where a, b > 0.
If x is W of y, then x has coordinates (-a - c, -b) where c > 0.

So, x is at (-a - c, -b) relative to z.

Is x SW of z? For this to be true, x needs to be both South and West of z.
- x is West of z because -a - c < 0.
- x is South of z because -b < 0.

So, one possible relation is that x is SW of z.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let's reconsider.

If y is SW of z, then y is both South and West of z.
If x is W of y, then x is further West than y, but at the same North-South position as y.

Let me specify a coordinate system. Let's put z at the origin (0, 0). East is the positive x-axis, and North is the positive y-axis.

If y is SW of z, then y has coordinates (-a, -b) where a, b > 0.
If x is W of y, then x has coordinates (-a - c, -b) where c > 0.

So, x is at (-a - c, -b) relative to z.

Is x SW of z? For this to be true, x needs to be both South and West of z.
- x is West of z because -a - c < 0.
- x is South of z because -b < 0.

So, x is SW of z.

But wait, let's double-check. 

For z at (0, 0):
- y at (-a, -b) means y is SW of z.
- x at (-a - c, -b) means x is...

Let's analyze the cardinal direction from z to x:
- x is West of z because -a - c < 0, which means x is to the left (West) of z.
- x is South of z because -b < 0, which means x is below (South of) z.

So, the cardinal direction from z to x is Southwest.

But what if we specify the coordinates differently?

Let's say z is at (0, 0), y is at (-1, -1) (SW of z), and x is at (-2, -1) (W of y).

Now, let's see the direction from z to x:
- From z (0, 0) to x (-2, -1): Moving -2 in the x-direction (West) and -1 in the y-direction (South). This is SW, but more West than South.

Alright, so x is SW of z.

But I'm still not convinced about the other possibilities. Let me think more broadly.

If y is SW of z, then y has coordinates (-a, -b) where a, b > 0.
If x is W of y, then x has coordinates (-a - c, -b) where c > 0.

Let's simplify this. I'll rename the coordinates for clarity.

If z is at (0, 0), y is at (y_x, y_y), and x is at (x_x, x_y).

Given that y is SW of z, we have y_x < 0 and y_y < 0.
Given that x is W of y, we have x_x < y_x and x_y = y_y.

So, x_x < y_x < 0 and x_y = y_y < 0.

Now, the cardinal direction from z to x is determined by the signs of x_x and x_y:
- x_x < 0: x is West of z.
- x_y < 0: x is South of z.

Since both conditions are met, x is SW of z.

Actually, I realized I'm ignoring a key detail. The question is asking for all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, not just one specific relation.

Let's reanalyze:

1. Region x is West of region y
2. Region y is Southwest of region z

So, y is both South and West of z. And x is West of y.

Given that y is SW of z, y is both South and West of z.
Given that x is W of y, x is further West than y.

Since y is already West of z, x is even more West of z.

Now, for the North-South relation:
- y is South of z.
- x is at the same North-South position as y (because x is directly West of y).

So, x is also South of z.

Therefore, x is both West and South of z, which means x is Southwest of z.

But wait, I need to be careful about the interpretation of "West" and "Southwest." These are cardinal directions, and they are specific about the direction, not just a general area.

Let me double-check my understanding.

In cardinal directions, if y is SW of z, it means y is exactly in the Southwest direction from z, not just "south and west" of z. Similarly, if x is W of y, it means x is exactly in the West direction from y.

Given these precise interpretations, where could x be relative to z?

Let me draw a coordinate system where z is at the origin (0, 0):

```
          N
          ^
          |
W <---z--->E
          |
          v
          S
```

Now, y is SW of z, so y is in the direction that's 225 degrees from the East direction:

```
          N
          ^
          |
W <---z--->E
         /|
        / v
       y  S
```

And x is W of y, so x is in the direction that's 270 degrees from the East direction from y:

```
          N
          ^
          |
W <---z--->E
         /|
    x---y v
          S
```

From this diagram, we can see that x is somewhere in the SW quadrant from z, but it's not exactly SW of z. It's somewhere between W and SW.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me reapproach.

The cardinal directions are N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.

If y is SW of z, it means y is in the direction that's both South and West from z, at a 45-degree angle from both South and West.

If x is W of y, it means x is directly West from y, at a 90-degree angle from the North-South line.

Now, to determine the direction from z to x, we need to consider both the direction from z to y (SW) and the direction from y to x (W).

If I draw a line from z to y (SW direction) and then from y to x (W direction), the resulting direction from z to x would be somewhere between W and SW, depending on the distances.

Actually, let me try to use vector addition to solve this.

If we represent directions as unit vectors:
- N = (0, 1)
- NE = (1, 1) / sqrt(2)
- E = (1, 0)
- SE = (1, -1) / sqrt(2)
- S = (0, -1)
- SW = (-1, -1) / sqrt(2)
- W = (-1, 0)
- NW = (-1, 1) / sqrt(2)

Then, if y is SW of z, the vector from z to y is (-1, -1) / sqrt(2) multiplied by some distance, let's call it d_1.

And if x is W of y, the vector from y to x is (-1, 0) multiplied by some distance, let's call it d_2.

Now, the vector from z to x is the sum of these two vectors:
Vector(z to x) = d_1 * (-1, -1) / sqrt(2) + d_2 * (-1, 0)

Simplifying:
Vector(z to x) = (-d_1 / sqrt(2) - d_2, -d_1 / sqrt(2))

The cardinal direction from z to x depends on the angle of this vector. Let's compute the angle:

Angle = atan2(-d_1 / sqrt(2), -d_1 / sqrt(2) - d_2)

Wait, I'm using the wrong coordinate system. Let me redefine it:

- East is positive x-axis
- North is positive y-axis

With this, the unit vectors for the cardinal directions are:
- N = (0, 1)
- NE = (1, 1) / sqrt(2)
- E = (1, 0)
- SE = (1, -1) / sqrt(2)
- S = (0, -1)
- SW = (-1, -1) / sqrt(2)
- W = (-1, 0)
- NW = (-1, 1) / sqrt(2)

Now, if y is SW of z, the vector from z to y is (-1, -1) / sqrt(2) multiplied by some distance, let's call it d_1.

And if x is W of y, the vector from y to x is (-1, 0) multiplied by some distance, let's call it d_2.

The vector from z to x is the sum of these two vectors:
Vector(z to x) = d_1 * (-1, -1) / sqrt(2) + d_2 * (-1, 0)

Simplifying:
Vector(z to x) = (-d_1 / sqrt(2) - d_2, -d_1 / sqrt(2))

To determine the cardinal direction, we need to find the angle of this vector with respect to the East (positive x-axis) and then map it to one of the 8 cardinal directions.

The angle is given by:
Angle = atan2(-d_1 / sqrt(2), -d_1 / sqrt(2) - d_2)

Now, to map this angle to a cardinal direction, we need to check which of the 8 sectors it falls into.

The angle of the SW direction is 5*pi/4 or 225 degrees. The angle of the W direction is pi or 180 degrees. 

Let's compute the angle for our vector for different values of d_1 and d_2 to see where it falls:

1. d_1 = 1, d_2 = 0:
   Vector(z to x) = (-1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2))
   Angle = atan2(-1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)) = -3*pi/4 or 5*pi/4 or 225 degrees

   This is exactly the SW direction.

2. d_1 = 1, d_2 = 1:
   Vector(z to x) = (-1/sqrt(2) - 1, -1/sqrt(2)) = (-1/sqrt(2) - 1, -1/sqrt(2))
   Angle = atan2(-1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) - 1)

   Let's compute this: atan2(-1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) - 1) ≈ atan2(-0.7071, -1.7071) ≈ 2.749 radians ≈ 157.5 degrees

   This is between the S and SW directions, but closer to SW.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the angle calculation. Let me redo it.

First, I know:
- The angle for E is 0 degrees.
- The angle for NE is 45 degrees or pi/4 radians.
- The angle for N is 90 degrees or pi/2 radians.
- The angle for NW is 135 degrees or 3*pi/4 radians.
- The angle for W is 180 degrees or pi radians.
- The angle for SW is 225 degrees or 5*pi/4 radians.
- The angle for S is 270 degrees or 3*pi/2 radians.
- The angle for SE is 315 degrees or 7*pi/4 radians.

Now, for a vector (x, y), the angle with respect to the East is given by:
Angle = atan2(y, x)

For our vector (-d_1 / sqrt(2) - d_2, -d_1 / sqrt(2)), the angle is:
Angle = atan2(-d_1 / sqrt(2), -d_1 / sqrt(2) - d_2)

Wait, I'm still making a mistake. Let me redo the angle calculation using the correct formula.

For a vector (x, y), the angle with respect to the East (positive x-axis) is:
Angle = atan2(y, x)

For our vector (-d_1 / sqrt(2) - d_2, -d_1 / sqrt(2)), the angle is:
Angle = atan2(-d_1 / sqrt(2), -d_1 / sqrt(2) - d_2)

For d_1 = 1, d_2 = 0:
Angle = atan2(-1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)) ≈ atan2(-0.7071, -0.7071) ≈ -2.356 radians

But in the context of cardinal directions, we want the angle to be between 0 and 2*pi, so we add 2*pi to get:
Angle = -2.356 + 2*pi ≈ 3.927 radians ≈ 225 degrees

This is exactly the SW direction.

For d_1 = 1, d_2 = 1:
Angle = atan2(-1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) - 1) ≈ atan2(-0.7071, -1.7071) ≈ -2.749 radians

Adding 2*pi:
Angle = -2.749 + 2*pi ≈ 3.534 radians ≈ 202.5 degrees

This is between the SW and W directions, but closer to SW.

For d_1 = 1, d_2 = 3:
Angle = atan2(-1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) - 3) ≈ atan2(-0.7071, -3.7071) ≈ -2.953 radians

Adding 2*pi:
Angle = -2.953 + 2*pi ≈ 3.33 radians ≈ 190.8 degrees

This is between the SW and W directions, but closer to W.

For d_1 = 1, d_2 = 10:
Angle = atan2(-1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) - 10) ≈ atan2(-0.7071, -10.7071) ≈ -3.068 radians

Adding 2*pi:
Angle = -3.068 + 2*pi ≈ 3.215 radians ≈ 184.2 degrees

This is very close to the W direction.

OK, I see a pattern here. As d_2 increases (meaning we go further west from y), the direction from z to x approaches the W direction. When d_2 is very large compared to d_1, the direction is very close to W.

So, the possible cardinal directions from z to x are:
- SW (when d_2 is small compared to d_1)
- W (when d_2 is very large compared to d_1)

And anything between these two directions, but we have to choose one of the 8 cardinal directions.

So, to answer the question, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West

Wait, I think I need to be more precise. Let's revisit the problem from the perspective of regions, not just points.

The question involves regions, not just points. When we say "region x is West of region y," we mean every point in region x is West of every point in region y. Similarly, when we say "region y is Southwest of region z," we mean every point in region y is Southwest of every point in region z.

Given these definitions, if region x is West of region y, and region y is Southwest of region z, what could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

Let's consider some specific configurations of these regions to better understand the possibilities.

Configuration 1: Regions are very small, almost like points.
In this case, as we've analyzed earlier, region x could be Southwest or West of region z, depending on the distances.

Configuration 2: Regions have some area.
If region y is entirely Southwest of region z, and region x is entirely West of region y, then region x could be:
- Southwest of region z (if it's still in the Southwest quadrant from z).
- West of region z (if it's in the West direction from z).

But, given that these are regions with area, I think there's another possibility. Let's say region z is very large, and region y is close to the western edge of region z but still entirely Southwest of it. Then, region x, being West of region y, could partially overlap with region z in the West direction.

Hmm, but that would mean some points in region x are not West of all points in region y, which contradicts our assumption. So, this configuration isn't valid.

Let's try another approach. Instead of thinking about the regions as having area, let's think about the constraints on the locations of the regions.

If region y is Southwest of region z, then the entirety of region y is in the Southwest quadrant from any point in region z.

If region x is West of region y, then the entirety of region x is to the West of any point in region y.

Now, consider a point p_z in region z and a point p_y in region y. Because region y is Southwest of region z, p_y is Southwest of p_z. Similarly, for a point p_x in region x, because region x is West of region y, p_x is West of p_y.

Now, the direction from p_z to p_x is given by the combination of the direction from p_z to p_y (Southwest) and the direction from p_y to p_x (West). As we've analyzed earlier, this direction could be Southwest, West, or somewhere in between. But since we're talking about cardinal directions, it's either Southwest or West.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West

Actually, wait. I just realized there's a potential issue with my analysis. 

If region y is Southwest of region z, it means every point in region y is Southwest of every point in region z. But this doesn't mean region y is exactly in the Southwest direction from region z. It could be more West than South, or more South than West, as long as it's in the Southwest quadrant.

Similarly, if region x is West of region y, it means every point in region x is West of every point in region y. But this doesn't mean region x is exactly in the West direction from region y. It could be slightly Northwest or Southwest, as long as it's generally West.

Given these nuances, the direction from region z to region x could be:
- West (if region x is significantly West of region z)
- Southwest (if region x is in the Southwest quadrant from region z)
- Northwest (if region x is in the Northwest quadrant from region z)

Actually I think I'm making the problem more complicated than it is. Let me take a step back and approach it differently.

Imagine a standard compass with 8 cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.

If region y is SW of region z, it means y is in the Southwest quadrant from z.

If region x is W of region y, it means x is directly West from y.

Now, to determine the possible directions from z to x, we need to consider the possible relative positions of x, y, and z.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) and think about the possible positions of y such that it's SW of z. This means y is in the quadrant where both coordinates are negative.

Next, for each possible position of y, we need to determine the possible positions of x such that it's W of y. This means x is to the left of y, with the same vertical coordinate.

Now, we need to figure out which cardinal direction sector x falls into from z's perspective.

Let's consider a few specific cases:

1. y is slightly SW of z, and x is slightly W of y: In this case, x could be W of z.
2. y is very SW of z (far South and slightly West), and x is slightly W of y: In this case, x could be SW of z.
3. y is very SW of z (far West and slightly South), and x is W of y: In this case, x could be SW or W of z, depending on how far W from y it is.

Actually, wait. I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me take yet another approach. Let's define the cardinal directions using constraints on coordinates.

If z is at (0, 0):
- y is SW of z if y_x < 0 and y_y < 0.
- x is W of y if x_x < y_x and x_y = y_y.

From these, we know:
x_x < y_x < 0 and x_y = y_y < 0.

Now, to determine the cardinal direction from z to x, we need to check which quadrant x falls into and, if it's on the boundary, which boundary it's on.

Given x_x < 0 and x_y < 0, x is in the SW quadrant from z. This means the cardinal direction from z to x is SW.

But wait, there's more to it. Let's define the cardinal directions in terms of angles, where East is 0 degrees, North is 90 degrees, West is 180 degrees, and South is 270 degrees. The other four directions are in between: NE is 45 degrees, NW is 135 degrees, SW is 225 degrees, and SE is 315 degrees.

For a point (x, y), the angle from the origin is given by atan2(y, x).

If y is SW of z, then the angle from z to y is between 180 and 270 degrees, specifically around 225 degrees.

If x is W of y, then the angle from y to x is 180 degrees.

Now, the direction from z to x depends on the angle from z to x, which is influenced by both the position of y relative to z and the position of x relative to y.

If y is exactly SW of z, and x is exactly W of y, then the angle from z to x is given by:

Angle = atan2(x_y, x_x) = atan2(y_y, y_x - d_2)

where d_2 is the distance from y to x.

Depending on the values of y_y, y_x, and d_2, this angle could be anywhere between 180 and 270 degrees. If the angle is exactly 225 degrees, then x is SW of z. If the angle is exactly 180 degrees, then x is W of z. If the angle is between these two, then x is in a direction that's between W and SW, but we'd classify it as either W or SW based on which it's closer to.

But this depends on the specific positions of y relative to z and x relative to y.

So, to answer the question, based on our analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West

However, the exact direction would depend on the specific positions of the regions.

Actually, wait. When I talked about being "between W and SW", I'm pretty sure we would refer to that as SW, not "between W and SW". Cardinal directions don't have in-betweens. A location is either N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, or NW of another.

So let me double-check my reasoning on this.

Given the constraints on x's coordinates:
- x_x < 0 (x is to the West of z)
- x_y < 0 (x is to the South of z)

If x is both West and South of z, then the cardinal direction from z to x is SW. That seems clear.

But wait, if x_x is very negative and x_y is slightly negative, is x still SW of z? 

Let me think about this: the boundary between W and SW is at an angle of 202.5 degrees (halfway between 180 degrees for W and 225 degrees for SW). If the angle from z to x is less than 202.5 degrees but more than 180 degrees, then x is W of z. If the angle is more than 202.5 degrees but less than 225 degrees, then x is SW of z.

Given the constraints, the angle from z to x is given by:
Angle = atan2(x_y, x_x) = atan2(y_y, y_x - d_2)

If y_y and y_x are such that y is exactly SW of z, then atan2(y_y, y_x) = 225 degrees.

Now, as d_2 increases (meaning x gets further West of y), the angle atan2(y_y, y_x - d_2) decreases and approaches 180 degrees.

So, depending on the specific values, x could be either W or SW of z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West

Actually wait. Let me reconsider the problem one more time.

Direction 1: Region x is West of region y
Direction 2: Region y is Southwest of region z

If region y is Southwest of region z, it means y is somewhere in the SW direction from z (225 degrees). 

If region x is West of region y, it means x is somewhere in the W direction from y (180 degrees).

Now, the direction from z to x depends on the specific positions of all three regions. We know that y is in the SW direction from z, and x is in the W direction from y. Depending on the exact positions, x could be:

- West of z (if x is in the W direction from z, around 180 degrees)
- Southwest of z (if x is in the SW direction from z, around 225 degrees)
- Northwest of z (if x is in the NW direction from z, around 135 degrees)

Wait, can x really be Northwest of z? Let's think about this. 

If y is SW of z, it means y_x < 0 and y_y < 0.
If x is W of y, it means x_x < y_x and x_y = y_y.

So, x_x < y_x < 0 and x_y = y_y < 0.

Given these coordinates, x is still in the SW quadrant from z (both x_x and x_y are negative). The cardinal direction from z to x would be:
- W if the angle atan2(x_y, x_x) is close to 180 degrees
- SW if the angle atan2(x_y, x_x) is close to 225 degrees

But since x_y is negative, the angle is always between 180 and 270 degrees, which means x is either W or SW of z, not NW.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West

Alright, let me think about this problem from a fresh and simple perspective, considering the relations between regions.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y: This means every point in region x is to the west of every point in region y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z: This means every point in region y is to the southwest of every point in region z.

Now, we want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let's denote the cardinal directions by the directions of the arrow:
- West: ←
- Southwest: ↙
- Northwest: ↖
- South: ↓
- etc.

So, we know:
- y is ↙ of z
- x is ← of y

To get from z to x, we go first ↙ to y, and then ← to x. 

Let's think of it visually:

```
z
↙
y ← x
```

Now, what's the direction from z to x?

The direction from z to x depends on the exact positions of z, y, and x. Given the constraints, x is somewhere in the lower-left quadrant from z (both West and South of z).

In the cardinal direction system, the lower-left quadrant is divided into:
- South (↓)
- Southwest (↙)
- West (←)

Given our constraints, x is not directly South of z. So, x is either Southwest or West of z.

But the specific cardinal direction depends on the angle of the line from z to x.

Let's think about it using ray tracing. From z, we draw rays in the 8 cardinal directions:
- N (↑, 90°)
- NE (↗, 45°)
- E (→, 0°)
- SE (↘, 315°)
- S (↓, 270°)
- SW (↙, 225°)
- W (←, 180°)
- NW (↖, 135°)

A region is in a specific cardinal direction from z if all of its points are within the sector defined by that cardinal direction. For example, a region is SW of z if all its points are in the 45° sector centered at 225° (from 202.5° to 247.5°).

Now, let's trace the position of x based on our constraints.

If y is SW of z, it means y is in the 45° sector centered at 225° from z.
If x is W of y, it means x is in the 45° sector centered at 180° from y.

From z, the direction to x depends on the exact positions, but it's somewhere in the lower-left quadrant. So, the cardinal direction from z to x is either:
- Southwest (if the angle from z to x is between 202.5° and 247.5°)
- West (if the angle from z to x is between 157.5° and 202.5°)

It cannot be South or Northwest due to our constraints.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West

OK, I think I've been on the right track, but let me just take a step back and think of this in a simpler way.

We have the following constraints:
- x is West of y: every point in x is directly to the west of every point in y.
- y is Southwest of z: every point in y is directly to the southwest of every point in z.

Let's think about the possible locations of region x relative to region z.

Imagine an orthogonal coordinate system with z at the origin. The Southwest direction from z is the 3rd quadrant (where both x and y coordinates are negative). If y is in the Southwest quadrant, and x is to the West of y, then x is even further west than y, but at the same North-South level as y. Given that y is in the Southwest quadrant, x must also be in the Southwest quadrant or possibly on the West axis if y is on the West axis.

But let's interpret "Southwest" and "West" in the cardinal sense. This means that a region is Southwest of another if it's in the 45° sector centered at 225° (from 202.5° to 247.5°). Similarly, a region is West of another if it's in the 45° sector centered at 180° (from 157.5° to 202.5°).

If y is in the Southwest sector from z, and x is in the West sector from y, then the direction from z to x depends on the exact positions. If y is near the boundary between Southwest and West from z, and x is West of y, then x could be in the West sector from z. If y is near the boundary between Southwest and South from z, and x is West of y, then x could be in the Southwest sector from z.

Given these considerations, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest (if the angle from z to x is between 202.5° and 247.5°)
- West (if the angle from z to x is between 157.5° and 202.5°)

If I visualize this:

```
      z
     /
    /
   y -- x
```

If y is in the Southwest sector from z, and x is in the West sector from y, then the direction from z to x could be either Southwest or West, depending on the exact positions.

Actually, wait, let me approach this more systematically, the answer isn't automatically Southwest and West. I'm approaching the problem spatially, but with my reasoning I may be oversimplifying.

Let's go back to our constraints:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

Let's define the cardinal directions more precisely using angles from the East direction (clockwise):
- N: 90°
- NE: 45°
- E: 0°
- SE: 315°
- S: 270°
- SW: 225°
- W: 180°
- NW: 135°

Let's also define sectors for each cardinal direction. For example, the SW sector is the 45° sector centered at 225° (from 202.5° to 247.5°).

Now, let's reason about the constraints:
- Region y is Southwest of region z: Every point in region y is in the SW sector from every point in region z.
- Region x is West of region y: Every point in region x is in the W sector from every point in region y.

Given these constraints, the direction from z to x is not automatically just Southwest or West. It depends on the exact positions of the regions.

Hang on, I'm not being careful enough. When we say "region x is West of region y" in the context of cardinal directions, it means that for every point p_x in region x and every point p_y in region y, p_x is in the West sector from p_y. Similarly, when we say "region y is Southwest of region z", it means that for every point p_y in region y and every point p_z in region z, p_y is in the Southwest sector from p_z.

Given these precise definitions, the direction from z to x is not automatic. It depends on the exact shapes and positions of the regions.

Actually, I think I need to represent cardinal directions differently, and being more careful about the semantics. Let me try again, using a more systematic approach.

Let's consider 9 primitive directional relations: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and Bounding Box (BB, where one region contains the other).

Given the constraints:
- Region x is West of region y: For every point p_x in region x and every point p_y in region y, the angle from p_y to p_x is in the range [157.5°, 202.5°].
- Region y is Southwest of region z: For every point p_y in region y and every point p_z in region z, the angle from p_z to p_y is in the range [202.5°, 247.5°].

Now, for the relation between region x and region z, we need to determine, for every point p_x in region x and every point p_z in region z, the angle from p_z to p_x. This angle can vary depending on the exact points chosen, but it must satisfy our constraints.

Given our constraints, p_y is in the SW sector from p_z, and p_x is in the W sector from p_y. This means the angle from p_z to p_x is influenced by both the angle from p_z to p_y and the angle from p_y to p_x.

Let's denote the angle from p_z to p_y as α, and the angle from p_y to p_x as β. We know that α is in the range [202.5°, 247.5°] (SW sector) and β is in the range [157.5°, 202.5°] (W sector).

The angle from p_z to p_x, let's call it γ, is not a simple addition of α and β. It depends on the distances as well. However, given our constraints, we can determine the range of possible values for γ.

OK, let me think about this simpler in a different way.

Let me consider that there are sets of positions for points in region x, y, and z. These sets are defined by the constraints.

For a point in region z, if the constraints are satisfied, where could the corresponding point in region x be, in terms of cardinal directions?

If a point in region y is SW of a point in region z, and a point in region x is W of a point in region y, then the point in region x is somewhere to the west and south of the point in region z. The exact cardinal direction depends on the specific positions.

Actually, I'm making this too complicated. Let me simplify even further, using a point-based approach.

Given the constraints, if I pick a point in region z and a corresponding point in region y (such that the point in region y is SW of the point in region z), and a corresponding point in region x (such that the point in region x is W of the point in region y), where could the point in region x be relative to the point in region z, in terms of cardinal directions?

Let's think about it using angles. The SW direction is at 225°, and the W direction is at 180°.

If I go from a point in region z to a point in region y at an angle of 225° (SW), and then from the point in region y to a point in region x at an angle of 180° (W), the resulting angle from the point in region z to the point in region x is somewhere between these two angles, depending on the distances.

But the angle from the point in region z to the point in region x can't be exactly 225° or 180° unless the three points are in a straight line. In general, the angle will be somewhere between these two, or possibly even outside this range.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z would be W, SW, and any other cardinal directions that are possible given the constraint that the angle from z to x is influenced by the angles from z to y and from y to x.

Let me approach this problem using the constraint-based representation of cardinal directions. Cardinal direction calculus (CDC) provides a method to represent the directional relation between two regions by dividing the space around one region into 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and Bounding Box (BB)) and noting which tiles the other region occupies.

Given the constraints:
- Region x is West of region y: Region x is entirely within the West tile of region y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z: Region y is entirely within the Southwest tile of region z.

Now, to determine the relation between region x and region z, we need to find the tiles of region z that region x occupies.

If region y is entirely within the Southwest tile of region z, and region x is entirely within the West tile of region y, then region x is somewhere to the west and south of region z. It must be in one or more of the following tiles of region z: W, SW, S, and possibly BB.

But given our constraints, region x can't be in the BB tile of region z (because then it would be contained within region z, which contradicts the other constraints). It also can't be in the S tile of region z (because then some points in region x would be East of some points in region y, which contradicts the constraint that region x is West of region y).

So, the possible tiles of region z that region x can occupy are W and SW.

In terms of cardinal direction relations, this means region x can be West of region z, or Southwest of region z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- West
- Southwest

Actually, now that I've reasoned through this problem from multiple angles, I think my original answer was correct. So the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- West
- Southwest

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the cardinal directions.

If region y is Southwest of region z, it means y is in the direction that combines South and West from z.

If region x is West of y, it means x is directly West from y.

When I trace the possible positions of x relative to z:
- If y is far Southwest of z (more South than West) and x is West of y, then x would be Southwest of z
- If y is closer to directly West of z and x is West of y, then x would be West of z

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West
