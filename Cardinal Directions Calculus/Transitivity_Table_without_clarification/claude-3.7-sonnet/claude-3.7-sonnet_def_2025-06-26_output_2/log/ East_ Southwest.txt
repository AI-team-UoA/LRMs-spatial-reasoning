PROMPT: Let  East and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

This question is asking about cardinal directions. Let's think about it step by step.

Region x is East of region y
Region y is Southwest of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let me visualize this on a cardinal direction grid:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | C | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

If y is Southwest of z, then z is Northeast of y.
If x is East of y, then y is West of x.

So we have:
- x is East of y
- z is Northeast of y

Let's visualize this:

```
       z
      /
     /
    y -- x
```

Where:
- x is to the east of y
- z is to the northeast of y

Now, what is the relation between x and z? Let's consider the possible positions:

1. If y is directly southwest of z (meaning z is directly northeast of y), and x is directly east of y, then x would be southeast of z.

2. However, there's some flexibility in these relations. For example, "East" means x is somewhere in the eastern half-plane from y, and "Southwest" means y is in the southwestern half-plane from z.

Given this flexibility, x could potentially be:
- East of z
- Southeast of z
- South of z

Let me double-check by drawing it out more carefully.

If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then y would be somewhere in the Southwest quadrant, let's say at (-1, -1). Then x would be East of y, so x could be at (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), etc.

From z's perspective (at (0, 0)), x at (0, -1) would be South of z.
From z's perspective, x at (1, -1) would be Southeast of z.
From z's perspective, x at (2, -1) could be Southeast or East of z depending on the exact definitions.

Let me try with another position for y. If y is at (-2, -1), then x could be at (-1, -1), (0, -1), (1, -1), etc.
From z's perspective, x at (-1, -1) would be Southwest of z.
From z's perspective, x at (0, -1) would be South of z.
From z's perspective, x at (1, -1) would be Southeast of z.

So, it seems the possible relations between x and z could be:
- Southwest (in some cases)
- South
- Southeast
- East (in some cases)

But I want to be more precise. Let's think about the exact definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

The cardinal direction relations typically divide the plane into 8 regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) plus the central region (which can be represented as the bounding box or simply as "same location").

Let's be more specific with the coordinates:

If z is at (0, 0):
- The Northeast region from z is the quadrant with positive x and positive y.
- The Southwest region from z is the quadrant with negative x and negative y.
- The East region from z is the half-plane with positive x.

If y is Southwest of z, then y has both negative x and negative y coordinates, let's say y is at (-a, -b) where a and b are positive values.

If x is East of y, then x has a higher x-coordinate than y, so x is at (c, -b) where c > -a.

Now, what's the relation between x and z (which is at (0, 0))?

If c < 0, then x is at (c, -b) with c < 0 and -b < 0, which means x is Southwest of z.
If c = 0, then x is at (0, -b) with -b < 0, which means x is South of z.
If c > 0, then x is at (c, -b) with c > 0 and -b < 0, which means x is Southeast of z.

So, based on the exact position of x relative to y, the relation between x and z could be:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

But what does "East of y" mean exactly? Let me reconsider.

In the context of cardinal directions, "East" typically means the half-plane to the east of a point, which includes NE, E, and SE from the standard 8 cardinal directions.

So, if x is East of y, it means x is in the eastern half-plane from y, which means x's x-coordinate is greater than y's x-coordinate. The y-coordinate can vary.

Similarly, if y is Southwest of z, it means y is in the southwestern quadrant from z, which means both y's x-coordinate and y-coordinate are less than z's.

Let's reconsider with these definitions:

If z is at (0, 0):
- y is Southwest of z, so y is at (-a, -b) for some positive a and b.
- x is East of y, so x's x-coordinate is greater than -a. x's y-coordinate can be anything.

Now, what's the relation between x and z?

If x's x-coordinate is negative and its y-coordinate is negative, x is Southwest of z.
If x's x-coordinate is negative and its y-coordinate is 0, x is West of z.
If x's x-coordinate is negative and its y-coordinate is positive, x is Northwest of z.
If x's x-coordinate is 0 and its y-coordinate is negative, x is South of z.
If x's x-coordinate is 0 and its y-coordinate is 0, x is the same as z (bounding box).
If x's x-coordinate is 0 and its y-coordinate is positive, x is North of z.
If x's x-coordinate is positive and its y-coordinate is negative, x is Southeast of z.
If x's x-coordinate is positive and its y-coordinate is 0, x is East of z.
If x's x-coordinate is positive and its y-coordinate is positive, x is Northeast of z.

However, we know that x is East of y, which means x's x-coordinate is greater than y's x-coordinate (which is -a). And y is Southwest of z, which means y's coordinates are (-a, -b).

So, x's x-coordinate is greater than -a, and its y-coordinate can be anything. This leads to the following possibilities:
- If x's x-coordinate is between -a and 0 and its y-coordinate is negative, x is Southwest of z.
- If x's x-coordinate is between -a and 0 and its y-coordinate is 0, x is West of z.
- If x's x-coordinate is between -a and 0 and its y-coordinate is positive, x is Northwest of z.
- If x's x-coordinate is 0 and its y-coordinate is negative, x is South of z.
- If x's x-coordinate is 0 and its y-coordinate is 0, x is the same as z (bounding box).
- If x's x-coordinate is 0 and its y-coordinate is positive, x is North of z.
- If x's x-coordinate is positive and its y-coordinate is negative, x is Southeast of z.
- If x's x-coordinate is positive and its y-coordinate is 0, x is East of z.
- If x's x-coordinate is positive and its y-coordinate is positive, x is Northeast of z.

But wait, I need to further constrain this. If x is East of y, it means x is in the eastern half-plane from y. But there's an additional constraint: we know that y is Southwest of z. 

Let's determine the possible positions of x relative to z based on the constraints:
1. x is East of y
2. y is Southwest of z

I'm going to approach this graphically, considering the possible regions where x can be relative to z.

If y is Southwest of z, it means y is in the southwestern quadrant from z. 
If x is East of y, it means x is in the eastern half-plane from y.

We know that the eastern half-plane from y intersects with multiple quadrants from z. To determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to identify which parts of the eastern half-plane from y fall into which quadrants from z.

Given that y is in the southwestern quadrant from z, and x is in the eastern half-plane from y, x can be:
- In the southwestern quadrant from z (if x is just slightly east of y but still southwest of z)
- In the southern half-plane from z (if x is directly south of z)
- In the southeastern quadrant from z
- In the eastern half-plane from z
- Possibly in the northwestern, northern, or northeastern regions, depending on how far east and north x is from y

But I feel like I'm getting confused and overcomplicating it. Let me simplify and be more precise.

We have the following constraints:
1. x is East of y
2. y is Southwest of z

To find the possible relations between x and z, I'll set up a coordinate system where z is at the origin (0, 0).

Since y is Southwest of z, y is in the third quadrant (negative x and negative y), so let's say y is at coordinates (-a, -b) where a and b are positive values.

Since x is East of y, x has a higher x-coordinate than y. So, x is at coordinates (c, d) where c > -a, and d can be any real number.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to check where x is relative to z:
- If c < 0 and d < 0, x is Southwest of z.
- If c < 0 and d = 0, x is West of z.
- If c < 0 and d > 0, x is Northwest of z.
- If c = 0 and d < 0, x is South of z.
- If c = 0 and d = 0, x is the same as z (bounding box).
- If c = 0 and d > 0, x is North of z.
- If c > 0 and d < 0, x is Southeast of z.
- If c > 0 and d = 0, x is East of z.
- If c > 0 and d > 0, x is Northeast of z.

Given that c > -a and a > 0, c can be negative, zero, or positive. And d can be any value. So, x can be in any of the regions mentioned above.

But I think I'm still missing something. Let me try another approach, focusing directly on the regions.

If y is Southwest of z, and x is East of y, then x is in the eastern half-plane from y. This half-plane can intersect with multiple regions from z. Let me visualize it:

```
    NW | N | NE
    ---+---+---
     W | z | E
    ---+---+---
    SW | S | SE
          \
           \
            y
```

If y is in the SW region from z, and x is East of y, then x can be in the SW, S, SE, W, B, E, NW, N, or NE regions from z, depending on exactly where x is located.

Let me double-check by considering a specific position for y and seeing where x could be:

Let's say y is at (-1, -1) and z is at (0, 0).
If x is East of y, then x's x-coordinate is greater than -1. So, x could be at (-0.9, -1), (-0.5, -1), (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), etc. It can also be at (-0.9, -2), (-0.9, 0), (-0.9, 1), etc.

From z's perspective (at (0, 0)):
- x at (-0.9, -1) is Southwest of z.
- x at (-0.5, -1) is Southwest of z.
- x at (0, -1) is South of z.
- x at (1, -1) is Southeast of z.
- x at (2, -1) is Southeast of z.
- x at (-0.9, -2) is Southwest of z.
- x at (-0.9, 0) is West of z.
- x at (-0.9, 1) is Northwest of z.

So, based on this, the possible relations between x and z can be:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- Northwest

But this is just for one possible position of y. Let's try another position to be sure.

Let's say y is at (-2, -0.5) and z is at (0, 0).
If x is East of y, then x's x-coordinate is greater than -2. So, x could be at (-1.9, -0.5), (-1, -0.5), (0, -0.5), (1, -0.5), etc. It can also be at (-1.9, -1), (-1.9, 0), (-1.9, 1), etc.

From z's perspective:
- x at (-1.9, -0.5) is Southwest of z.
- x at (-1, -0.5) is West of z.
- x at (0, -0.5) is South of z.
- x at (1, -0.5) is Southeast of z.
- x at (-1.9, -1) is Southwest of z.
- x at (-1.9, 0) is West of z.
- x at (-1.9, 1) is Northwest of z.

So the additional relation here is "West".

I think I was being too cautious before. Let me list all the possible relations between x and z:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- Bounding Box (if x and z are the same)
- East
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast

But I need to verify this. Let me think about it more systematically.

Given:
- y is Southwest of z
- x is East of y

I want to determine all possible relations between x and z.

The key thing to note is that "East" is a half-plane, which means that while x is certainly to the east of y, it can be in any direction from z depending on its position relative to y.

For instance, if y is at (-a, -b) and x is at (-a+ε, -b) for a small positive ε, then x is East of y but still Southwest of z. If x is further to the east, it could be South, Southeast, or any other direction from z.

In fact, given the constraints, x could be anywhere from the western half-plane of z to the eastern half-plane, and from the southern half-plane to the northern half-plane. In other words, x could be in any of the regions relative to z.

But maybe that's not right. Let's think about it using the composition table. But I can't recall the composition table right now. 

Let's try another approach. We want to get a more specific understanding here.

Given:
- y is Southwest of z
- x is East of y

We can think of this as trying to determine the relation East ∘ Southwest, where ∘ represents the composition of two relations.

Hmm, but again, without the composition table, it's hard to be precise.

Alright, let's use a geometric approach then.

Since y is Southwest of z, the angle from z to y is between 180° and 270° (considering 0° as East, 90° as North, 180° as West, and 270° as South).

Now, since x is East of y, the angle from y to x is between 315° and 45° (wrapping around).

Combining these, the angle from z to x can be anywhere from 180° + 315° - 360° = 135° to 270° + 45° = 315°. This means x can be anywhere from Southeast to Northwest of z, going counterclockwise.

But this doesn't seem right either, because if y is at (-1, -1) and x is at (0, -1), then x is East of y but South of z. And South is not in the range from Southeast to Northwest going counterclockwise.

I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let me approach it as a simple problem of the composition of spatial relations.

Actually, I think I've been approaching this the wrong way from the beginning. Let me start afresh.

Given:
- y is Southwest of z
- x is East of y

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Think of it this way: y is in the Southwest quadrant from z, which is a specific region. And x is in the East half-plane from y, which is another region. The question is: what are the possible overlaps of these two regions?

Let's visualize this. Imagine a grid with z at the center. The Southwest quadrant from z looks like this:

```
    | 
 ---+---
    |
    |
```

Now, for each point y in this quadrant, consider the East half-plane from y. For a point y near the boundary of the Southwest quadrant (close to the South or West axis), the East half-plane will include points in the South, Southeast, and East regions from z.

But for a point y deep inside the Southwest quadrant (far from both axes), the East half-plane might also include points in the Southwest, West, and even Northwest regions from z.

Considering all possible positions of y in the Southwest quadrant, and all possible positions of x in the East half-plane from y, x could be in the Southwest, South, Southeast, West, bounding box, East, Northwest, North, or Northeast regions from z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- Bounding Box (if x and z are the same)
- East
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast

But now I'm second-guessing my answer again. Let me try to be more systematic. 

Let's focus on the "East" relation first. If y is a point, then the region "East of y" is a half-plane where all points have a greater x-coordinate than y.

Similarly, the region "Southwest of z" is a quadrant where all points have both a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z.

Now, let's set up a coordinate system with z at the origin (0, 0).

If y is Southwest of z, then y is at coordinates (-a, -b) for positive values of a and b.

If x is East of y, then x is at coordinates (c, d) where c > -a and d can be any real number.

So, the relation between x and z depends on c and d:
- If c < 0 and d < 0, x is Southwest of z.
- If c < 0 and d = 0, x is West of z.
- If c < 0 and d > 0, x is Northwest of z.
- If c = 0 and d < 0, x is South of z.
- If c = 0 and d = 0, x is the same as z (bounding box).
- If c = 0 and d > 0, x is North of z.
- If c > 0 and d < 0, x is Southeast of z.
- If c > 0 and d = 0, x is East of z.
- If c > 0 and d > 0, x is Northeast of z.

Since c > -a, c can be negative, zero, or positive. And d can be any value. So, x can be in any of the 9 regions (8 cardinal directions and the bounding box) relative to z.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. The answer is simply:
All relations are possible, i.e., Southwest, South, Southeast, West, Bounding Box, East, Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Let me double-check by considering one specific example for each relation:

1. Southwest: 
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (-0.5, -0.5) (East of y but still Southwest of z)

2. South:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (0, -0.5) (East of y and South of z)

3. Southeast:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (0.5, -0.5) (East of y and Southeast of z)

4. West:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (-0.5, 0) (East of y but West of z)

5. Bounding Box:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (0, 0) (East of y and the same as z)

6. East:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (0.5, 0) (East of y and East of z)

7. Northwest:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (-0.5, 0.5) (East of y but Northwest of z)

8. North:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (0, 0.5) (East of y and North of z)

9. Northeast:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (0.5, 0.5) (East of y and Northeast of z)

Given these examples, it seems all relations are indeed possible. 

But I'm now questioning if this is the correct interpretation of the problem.

The problem statement mentions "cardinal direction relations", which means each relation (East, Southwest, etc.) divides the plane into distinct regions. If a point is in one region, it's not in the others. But I think my understanding is now correct, to find all the possible relations between x and z based on the given constraints.

Actually I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me revisit the original problem, which is: If region x is East of region y and region y is Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

We're looking for the composition of relations: East ∘ Southwest, which gives the possible relations between x and z.

Let me approach it one last time. 

If y is Southwest of z, then y is somewhere in the third quadrant (negative x, negative y) from z.

If x is East of y, then x is somewhere to the right of y (higher x-coordinate).

Depending on where exactly y is in the Southwest quadrant from z, and where x is in the East half-plane from y, x can be in various positions relative to z.

For instance, if y is very close to the West axis, then most of the East half-plane from y will still be to the west of z. If y is very close to the South axis, then most of the East half-plane from y will still be to the south of z.

But regardless of where y is in the Southwest quadrant, the East half-plane from y will always include some points to the southeast of z, some to the south, and some to the southwest. It may also include points in other directions, depending on the exact position of y.

Let me trace through one example to see which regions are always included:

Suppose z is at (0, 0) and y is at (-a, -b) for some positive a and b.

Now, consider x at (-a+ε, -b) for a small positive ε. x is East of y, but its position relative to z depends on a and ε. If a is much larger than ε, then x is still Southwest of z. If a is just slightly larger than ε, then x might be South or even Southeast of z.

Now, consider x at (-a+ε, -b+δ) for small positive ε and δ. Again, x is East of y, but its position relative to z depends on a, b, ε, and δ. It can be Southwest, South, Southeast, West, or even other directions depending on the values.

By varying the position of y within the Southwest quadrant, and the position of x within the East half-plane from y, x can be in any of the 9 regions (8 cardinal directions and the bounding box) relative to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
- West
- Bounding Box
- East
- Northwest
- North
- Northeast

In other words, all relations are possible.

Just to be completely sure, let's double-check by considering one specific example for each relation, making sure that y is always Southwest of z and x is always East of y:

1. Southwest:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-2, -1)
   - x at (-1, -1) (East of y but still Southwest of z)

2. South:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -2)
   - x at (0, -1) (East of y and South of z)

3. Southeast:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (1, -1) (East of y and Southeast of z)

4. West:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-2, -1)
   - x at (-1, 0) (East of y but West of z)

5. Bounding Box:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (0, 0) (East of y and the same as z)

6. East:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (1, 0) (East of y and East of z)

7. Northwest:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-2, -1)
   - x at (-1, 1) (East of y but Northwest of z)

8. North:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (0, 1) (East of y and North of z)

9. Northeast:
   - z at (0, 0)
   - y at (-1, -1)
   - x at (1, 1) (East of y and Northeast of z)

Yes, all relations are possible. The composition of "East" and "Southwest" can result in any of the cardinal directions or the bounding box.

Actually, wait. I think I need to be more careful with the definition of "East" here. In the Cardinal Directions Calculus, "East" refers to the eastern half-plane, which includes Northeast, East, and Southeast. The composition "East ∘ Southwest" doesn't include Northwest, because the Northwest region is entirely in the western half-plane.

Let's double-check my example for Northwest:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (-2, -1)
- x at (-1, 1) (claimed to be East of y but Northwest of z)

Is x really East of y here? The x-coordinate of x is -1, which is indeed greater than the x-coordinate of y (which is -2), but "East" in the Cardinal Directions Calculus refers to the relation where one point is strictly to the east of another, which means the first point is in the East, Northeast, or Southeast region of the second. But (-1, 1) is in the Northeast region of (-2, -1), not in the East, Northeast, or Southeast regions.

Actually I think I'm being too strict with the definition. "East" in the Cardinal Directions Calculus refers to the eastern half-plane, which includes points with a higher x-coordinate. So, if y is at (-2, -1) and x is at (-1, 1), then x is indeed East of y, because its x-coordinate is higher.

Let me re-check the definition of "East" to be sure. Let's see, Okay, the East cardinal direction relation is E = {(a, b) ∈ R^2 × R^2 | a_x < b_x and a_y = b_y}, where a_x and a_y are the x and y coordinates of point a, and b_x and b_y are the x and y coordinates of point b.

Oh, I think I may have been wrong. This definition says that for point b to be East of point a, b's x-coordinate should be greater than a's, and their y-coordinates should be the same. But I think there's confusion here. In the standard definition of cardinal directions, East refers to points with a greater x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate, whereas Northeast refers to points with both a greater x-coordinate and a greater y-coordinate, and Southeast refers to points with a greater x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate.

Actually, let me reconsider. I think the definition varies based on the specific Cardinal Directions Calculus being used. In some models, East, Northeast, Southeast, etc. are considered basic relations, while in others, East refers to the entire eastern half-plane.

Let's go with the standard interpretation where East refers to points directly to the east (same y-coordinate, greater x-coordinate). In this case, our previous analysis needs to be revisited.

I shouldn't have been confused. "East" does refer to the eastern half plane, but cardinal direction relations are more specific. Let me try again.

In the Cardinal Directions Calculus (CDC), the plane is divided into 9 regions (8 cardinal directions and the bounding box) based on a central point. For a point p, we have:
- North (N): Points directly above p.
- Northeast (NE): Points above and to the right of p.
- East (E): Points directly to the right of p.
- Southeast (SE): Points below and to the right of p.
- South (S): Points directly below p.
- Southwest (SW): Points below and to the left of p.
- West (W): Points directly to the left of p.
- Northwest (NW): Points above and to the left of p.
- Bounding Box (B): Points at the same location as p.

Given:
- y is Southwest of z
- x is East of y

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

First let's consider the case where y is strictly Southwest of z (not on the South or West axis). In this case, y is at (-a, -b) for positive a and b, and z is at (0, 0).

If x is strictly East of y, then x is at (-a+c, -b) for positive c.

Now, the relation between x and z depends on the values of a and c:
- If c < a, then x is at (-a+c, -b) where -a+c < 0 and -b < 0, so x is Southwest of z.
- If c = a, then x is at (0, -b) where -b < 0, so x is South of z.
- If c > a, then x is at (-a+c, -b) where -a+c > 0 and -b < 0, so x is Southeast of z.

So, for the strict interpretations, the possible relations are Southwest, South, and Southeast.

But we also need to consider the cases where y is on the South or West axis:

If y is on the South axis, i.e., y is at (0, -b) for positive b, then y is South of z, not Southwest. This is outside the scope of our problem.

If y is on the West axis, i.e., y is at (-a, 0) for positive a, then y is West of z, not Southwest. This is outside the scope of our problem.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

But wait, I think I'm being too strict again. The relations "y is Southwest of z" and "x is East of y" are not necessarily referring to the strict interpretations. They could be referring to the half-plane or quadrant interpretations.

If "Southwest" refers to the quadrant below and to the left of z, and "East" refers to the half-plane to the right of y, then we're back to our earlier analysis where x can be in any of the 9 regions relative to z.

Actually, I think I need to be more precise here. In the Cardinal Directions Calculus, "Southwest" and "East" are specific regions, as I mentioned earlier.

I think the answer is that when y is Southwest of z and x is East of y, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

Actually, let me check if these regions are correct. Let me draw a specific example.

z is at (0, 0).
y is Southwest of z, so y is at (-1, -1).
x is East of y, so x is at (0, -1).

From z's perspective, x is at (0, -1), which means x is South of z. So South is one of the possible relations.

Let's try another example:

z is at (0, 0).
y is Southwest of z, so y is at (-1, -1).
x is East of y, so x is at (1, -1).

From z's perspective, x is at (1, -1), which means x is Southeast of z. So Southeast is one of the possible relations.

One more example:

z is at (0, 0).
y is Southwest of z, so y is at (-2, -1).
x is East of y, so x is at (-1, -1).

From z's perspective, x is at (-1, -1), which means x is Southwest of z. So Southwest is one of the possible relations.

Let me double-check to see if any other relation is possible. Take the example above. Given that y is at (-2, -1) and x is East of y, x's coordinates are (-2+c, -1) for positive c. 

If c < 2, then x is at (-2+c, -1) where -2+c < 0, which means x is Southwest of z.
If c = 2, then x is at (0, -1), which means x is South of z.
If c > 2, then x is at (-2+c, -1) where -2+c > 0, which means x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually, I just realized I had been making an error in my understanding of the cardinal direction relations. Let me be clear with the definitions:

- North (N): Points with the same x-coordinate but a greater y-coordinate.
- Northeast (NE): Points with both a greater x-coordinate and a greater y-coordinate.
- East (E): Points with a greater x-coordinate but the same y-coordinate.
- Southeast (SE): Points with a greater x-coordinate but a smaller y-coordinate.
- South (S): Points with the same x-coordinate but a smaller y-coordinate.
- Southwest (SW): Points with both a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate.
- West (W): Points with a smaller x-coordinate but the same y-coordinate.
- Northwest (NW): Points with a smaller x-coordinate but a greater y-coordinate.
- Bounding Box (B): Points at the same location.

Given these definitions, if y is Southwest of z, then y has both a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than z. If x is East of y, then x has a greater x-coordinate than y, but the same y-coordinate.

So, if z is at (0, 0) and y is Southwest of z, then y is at (-a, -b) for positive a and b. If x is East of y, then x is at (-a+c, -b) for positive c, where c denotes the eastward displacement from y.

For x to be East of y and not Northeast or Southeast, the y-coordinate of x should be the same as that of y. So, x is at (-a+c, -b) for positive c.

Now, the relation between x and z depends on the values of a and c:
- If c < a, then x is at (-a+c, -b) where -a+c < 0 and -b < 0, so x is Southwest of z.
- If c = a, then x is at (0, -b) where -b < 0, so x is South of z.
- If c > a, then x is at (-a+c, -b) where -a+c > 0 and -b < 0, so x is Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

Actually, the correct answer is Southwest, South, and Southeast.

But let me just do one check. What if "East" doesn't mean strictly East, but could also include Northeast and Southeast? Similarly, what if "Southwest" doesn't mean strictly Southwest, but could also include South and West?

Actually, for the Cardinal Directions Calculus, the relations are typically as I defined them earlier, so this scenario seems unlikely. But for completeness, let's consider it.

If "East" means "in the eastern half-plane" (i.e., any point with a greater x-coordinate), and "Southwest" means "in the southwestern quadrant" (i.e., any point with both a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate), then the possible relations between x and z would be as I initially calculated, which is all 9 possible relations.

Actually, the problem statement mentions "cardinal direction relations", which suggests we're working with the specific relations defined in the Cardinal Directions Calculus. Given the definitions of these relations, the composition of "East" and "Southwest" yields the possible relations: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

So I think the answer is indeed Southwest, South, and Southeast. Let me double-check with the composition table for CDC.

For the Cardinal Directions Calculus, the composition of two directions gives the possible directions for the resulting relation. The composition of "East" and "Southwest" can be found in the composition table.

I can't recall the exact table values, but I think "East ∘ Southwest" should yield Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually, I've been confusing myself. I think the correct approach is the one I've been taking all along. Let's think about it from the composition perspective.

Given:
- y is Southwest of z
- x is East of y

We want to find the possible relations between x and z, which is the composition "East ∘ Southwest".

Using the formal definitions of the cardinal direction relations, we concluded that the possible relations are Southwest, South, and Southeast.

This seems correct based on geometric reasoning. If y is in the southwestern quadrant from z, and x is to the east of y (with the same y-coordinate), then x must be in the southwestern, southern, or southeastern region from z, depending on the relative distances.

So, the answer is:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

To summarize, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually, wait. I might be overthinking this again. Let me revisit the basics.

Cardinal direction relations are:
- North (N)
- Northeast (NE)
- East (E)
- Southeast (SE)
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- West (W)
- Northwest (NW)
- Bounding Box (B)

Let's consider the very BASIC definition of East and Southwest.

East: The East relation from a given point or region includes all areas directly to the east. From a reference point, this is the set of all points directly to the east (same y-coordinate, greater x-coordinate).

Southwest: The Southwest relation from a given point or region includes all areas to the southwest. From a reference point, this is the set of all points to the southwest (both smaller x-coordinate and smaller y-coordinate).

Actually, I think I need to check the definition more carefully, since there is a bit of ambiguity.

When using cardinal direction relations, we typically define the plane in terms of quadrants or half-planes. 

If "East" means "in the eastern half-plane" (any point with a greater x-coordinate), and "Southwest" means "in the southwestern quadrant" (any point with both a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate), then the reasoning I provided earlier is correct.

If "East" means "strictly east" (any point with a greater x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate), and "Southwest" means "strictly southwest" (any point with both a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate), then the reasoning I provided more recently is correct.

Actually, in the Cardinal Directions Calculus, "East" typically refers to points directly to the east (same y-coordinate, greater x-coordinate), not to the entire eastern half-plane. Similarly, "Southwest" refers to points directly to the southwest (both smaller x-coordinate and smaller y-coordinate).

I think that the set up of the problem:

"I will give you a question regarding cardinal direction relations. The possible answer can be one or more of these: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box."

Implies that we are thinking of the standard cardinal directions, not some generalized qualitative spatial calculus.

Given this, if y is Southwest of z and x is East of y, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest (if x is still to the west of z)
- South (if x is directly south of z)
- Southeast (if x is to the east of z)

Let me just double-check with the examples from before to make sure I've got the correct understanding.

Let's say z is at (0, 0) and y is Southwest of z, which means y is at (-a, -b) for positive a and b.

Now, if x is East of y, then x is at (-a+c, -b) for positive c, where c is the distance x is to the east of y.

Depending on the value of c relative to a, x can be:
- Southwest of z (if c < a, so -a+c < 0)
- South of z (if c = a, so -a+c = 0)
- Southeast of z (if c > a, so -a+c > 0)

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Southwest, South, and Southeast.

Actually, it was simply my calculation that was correct, but I kept second-guessing.

So, my final answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

Actually, let me also double-check if the "bounding box" option is possible. For x to be the same as z (i.e., in the bounding box of z), it would need to be at (0, 0). But we know that x is East of y, which means x is at (-a+c, -b) for positive a, b, and c. For x to be at (0, 0), we would need c = a (so -a+c = 0) and -b = 0, which contradicts b being positive.

So, the "bounding box" option is not possible. The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

Hmm, let me revisit the definition of "East" to be sure.

Actually, I think I've been using the wrong definition of "East". In the Context of Cardinal Direction Relations:

"East" typically means "any point to the east", which is any point with a greater x-coordinate, regardless of its y-coordinate. That means a bounding box isn't relevant.

"Southwest" typically means "any point to the southwest", which is any point with both a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate.

Given these, if y is Southwest of z and x is East of y, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Southwest (if x is still to the west of z)
- South (if x is directly south of z)
- Southeast (if x is to the east of z)

And as noted above, for x to be the same as z, the "bounding box" option can't happen.

So, my final final answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

I'm now confident that these are the only relations possible and there are no more.

Actually, there's one final thing to double-check.

"East" means "strictly east", which is the direction directly to the east. From a point (a, b), the region "East" contains all points (a+c, b) for positive c.

"Southwest" means "strictly southwest", which is the direction directly to the southwest. From a point (a, b), the region "Southwest" contains all points (a-c, b-d) for positive c and d.

Given these strict definitions, if y is at (a, b) and z is at (a+c, b+d) for positive c and d (i.e., y is Southwest of z), then the region "East of y" is {(a+e, b) | e > 0}.

But since the question involves a possible relation, I think it can be ambiguous. I need to carefully check the definition of "East" in the context of Cardinal Direction Relations.

Actually, I think the issue is that I'm getting confused with different definitions. I think I keep shifting back and forth between two main interpretations:

1. "East" as a direction from a point, meaning a half-line directly to the east.
2. "East" as a region in the cardinal direction calculus, meaning the region directly to the east (not the entire eastern half-plane).

For the purpose of this problem, I think we should use the second interpretation. For the Cardinal Directions Calculus, the plane is typically divided into 9 regions (8 cardinal directions and the bounding box) based on a central point, as shown below:

```
 NW | N | NE
----+---+----
  W | B | E
----+---+----
 SW | S | SE
```

Given this, if y is in the SW region from z, and x is in the E region from y, the possible locations of x relative to z are:
- in the SW region from z
- in the S region from z
- in the SE region from z

The ambiguity I was having comes from the fact that I was thinking "East of y" without locking in that "East" is a specific region. Given the original problem being about Cardinal Direction Relations, the second interpretation seems appropriate.

Ok, I think my final answer is:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

I've verified this answer through multiple approaches, and I'm confident it's correct.

Actually, there is ambiguity in what "East" and "Southwest" mean in this context. But based on the problem setup, which specifically mentions "cardinal direction relations", I believe I'm right. 

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze where x could be located relative to z.

If z is at the origin (0,0), then y being Southwest of z means y is at some point (-a,-b) where a and b are positive values.

Since x is East of y, x must be at point (-a+c,-b) for some positive value c.

The possible relations between x and z depend on the value of c relative to a:

- If c < a: Then x is at a point with negative x-coordinate and negative y-coordinate, making x Southwest of z
- If c = a: Then x is at a point with zero x-coordinate and negative y-coordinate, making x South of z
- If c > a: Then x is at a point with positive x-coordinate and negative y-coordinate, making x Southeast of z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- South
- Southeast
