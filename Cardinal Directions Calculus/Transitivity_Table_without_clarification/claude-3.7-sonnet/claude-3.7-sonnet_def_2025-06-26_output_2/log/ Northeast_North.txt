PROMPT: Let  Northeast and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's understand the cardinal direction relations first.

North = N: The first region is directly north of the second region. 
Northeast = NE: The first region is directly northeast of the second region.

These are the two relations used in the problem. Other cardinal directions would be East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), and Northwest (NW). A region can also be inside another region, but we don't have to worry about that based on the problem statement.

So, we are given two statements:
1. x is NE of y
2. y is N of z

We need to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let me approach this problem by visualizing it on a 2D coordinate system:
- If y is at the origin (0, 0).
- If y is N of z, then z is S of y. In the coordinate system, z is somewhere below y, e.g., z is at (0, -a) for some positive a.
- If x is NE of y, then x is somewhere to the northeast of y, e.g., x is at (b, c) for some positive b and c.

Now, to find the relation between x and z:
- The coordinates of x relative to z would be (b, c+a).
- Since b is positive and c+a is positive, x is somewhere to the northeast, north, or east of z.

However, the exact relation depends on the relative magnitudes of b and c+a.

- If b > c+a, then x is more to the east than north of z, but still in the NE quadrant.
- If b < c+a, then x is more to the north than east of z, but still in the NE quadrant.
- If b = c+a, then x is exactly NE of z.

But this analysis doesn't seem quite right, because I'm assuming specific positions for x, y, and z, and the problem is asking for qualitative direction relations.

Let me rethink...

If we have three points x, y, and z, and we're given that:
- x is NE of y
- y is N of z

Then, from the perspective of z:
- y is directly to the north of z.
- x is to the northeast of a point that is directly to the north of z.

This can be visualized as follows:
```
    x
   /
  y
  |
  z
```

In this diagram, moving from z to y, we go north. Moving from y to x, we go northeast.

Now, what's the relation between x and z? Looking at the diagram, x is somewhere to the northeast of z. But I think there's some ambiguity here.

Let's introduce some coordinates for clarity. If:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (0, 1) (directly north of z)
- x is at (1, 2) (northeast of y)

Then, from z's perspective, x is at (1, 2), which is to the northeast of z.

But, if:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (0, 2) (directly north of z)
- x is at (1, 3) (northeast of y)

From z's perspective, x is at (1, 3), which is also to the northeast of z.

However, if:
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (0, 3) (directly north of z)
- x is at (1, 4) (northeast of y)

From z's perspective, x is at (1, 4), which is also to the northeast of z.

It seems like in all cases, x is to the northeast of z. But I need to be more general to ensure I'm not missing any possibilities.

Let me consider the cardinal direction relations more formally:

Given a reference point (the second region in the relation), the space around it can be divided into 8 directional regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

If y is to the N of z, then y is in the N directional region of z.
If x is to the NE of y, then x is in the NE directional region of y.

But to determine the relation between x and z, I need to understand how these directional regions compose.

Actually, wait, let's be a bit more formal here. Let's use a 2D coordinate system where:
- N corresponds to the positive y-axis.
- E corresponds to the positive x-axis.
- NE corresponds to the region where both x and y are positive, and so on.

Given two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), the cardinal direction from (x_2, y_2) to (x_1, y_1) is:
- N if x_1 = x_2 and y_1 > y_2
- NE if x_1 > x_2 and y_1 > y_2
- E if x_1 > x_2 and y_1 = y_2
- And so on...

Now, if:
- (x_z, y_z) represents the coordinates of z.
- (x_y, y_y) represents the coordinates of y.
- (x_x, y_x) represents the coordinates of x.

Given:
- y is N of z: x_y = x_z and y_y > y_z.
- x is NE of y: x_x > x_y and y_x > y_y.

Combining these:
- x_x > x_y = x_z
- y_x > y_y > y_z

Which means:
- x_x > x_z
- y_x > y_z

So, x is to the NE of z.

Hmm, but that wasn't really the right approach either, since I'm assuming that the regions are points. The problem is talking about regions, which have an area, not just points.

Let's try to visualize this a bit more carefully. A more precise way to describe cardinal directions for regions is to use the 9-intersection model. This divides the space into 9 regions, with a central region corresponding to the reference region, and the other 8 regions corresponding to the cardinal directions.

Given two regions A and B:
- A is N of B if all of A is to the north of all of B.
- A is NE of B if all of A is to the northeast of all of B.
- And so on...

Now, given three regions x, y, and z:
- y is N of z: All of y is to the north of all of z.
- x is NE of y: All of x is to the northeast of all of y.

We can still use a coordinate system to reason about this. The minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z. And the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y, and the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.

But, let me think about this in terms of the possible relations. We know all of y is above all of z. And all of x is above and to the right of all of y. So, all of x is above all of z (since y is above z, and x is above y). Also, all of x is to the right of all of y, and y has the same x-coordinates as z (since y is directly north of z), so all of x is to the right of all of z.

So, x is to the northeast of z.

Wait, I was thinking too much about points. Let me approach it again for regions.

Actually, let's think of the problem in a slightly different way. In a 2D coordinate system, a region can be thought of as a set of points. Given two regions, the cardinal direction relation between them is determined by the relative positions of all points from one region to all points from the other.

For example, region A is to the north of region B if every point in A is to the north of every point in B.

With that in mind, let's analyze our problem.
1. x is NE of y: Every point in x is to the northeast of every point in y.
2. y is N of z: Every point in y is to the north of every point in z.

Let's think about what this implies for the relation between x and z.

1. Every point in y is to the north of every point in z. This means y has a greater y-coordinate than z for all points.
2. Every point in x is to the northeast of every point in y. This means x has a greater y-coordinate than y and a greater x-coordinate than y for all points.

Combining these:
- Every point in x has a greater y-coordinate than every point in y, which in turn has a greater y-coordinate than every point in z. So, every point in x has a greater y-coordinate than every point in z.
- Every point in x has a greater x-coordinate than every point in y.

We know y is directly north of z, so they have the same x-coordinates. This means every point in x also has a greater x-coordinate than every point in z.

In conclusion, every point in x has a greater y-coordinate and a greater x-coordinate than every point in z. This means x is to the northeast of z.

Actually, wait. I realize I've been thinking about this the wrong way. The cardinal direction relations in the problem are not just about the relative positions of all points in one region compared to all points in another. The relation "x is NE of y" doesn't mean every point in x is to the northeast of every point in y. It's more about the general direction. 

Let me approach this problem differently.

I think I need to be careful here. "x is NE of y" means that from y's perspective, x is in the NE direction. Similarly, "y is N of z" means that from z's perspective, y is in the N direction.

Let's define the cardinal directions more carefully. Given a reference region (e.g., y in "x is NE of y"), we can partition the plane into 9 regions: the reference region itself, and the 8 directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

Now, if x is NE of y, it means x is in the NE directional region of y. And if y is N of z, it means y is in the N directional region of z.

Hmm, this is still not quite right. Let me be even more precise.

Actually, I think the approach using the 9-intersection model is more accurate. In this model, for regions (not just points), cardinal direction relations are defined based on the bounding boxes of the regions.

Given two regions A and B, the cardinal direction relation of A with respect to B is defined based on where the bounding box of A is located relative to the bounding box of B. This gives us 9 potential atomic relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B, where B means bounding box, indicating that A's bounding box intersects with B's bounding box).

With this in mind, let's reanalyze our problem.
1. x is NE of y: The bounding box of x is to the northeast of the bounding box of y.
2. y is N of z: The bounding box of y is to the north of the bounding box of z.

Now, to determine the possible relation between x and z, we need to find where the bounding box of x can be located relative to the bounding box of z, given the above constraints.

Let me think about this geometrically...

Let me introduce some coordinates for the bounding boxes:
- Let the bounding box of z be [z_x_min, z_y_min, z_x_max, z_y_max].
- Let the bounding box of y be [y_x_min, y_y_min, y_x_max, y_y_max].
- Let the bounding box of x be [x_x_min, x_y_min, x_x_max, x_y_max].

Given:
1. y is N of z: This means y_y_min > z_y_max, and the projections of y and z onto the x-axis overlap.
2. x is NE of y: This means x_x_min > y_x_max and x_y_min > y_y_max.

Now, what's the relation between x and z?

The y-coordinate relation is straightforward:
x_y_min > y_y_max > z_y_max

This means x is to the north of z in terms of y-coordinates.

The x-coordinate relation is a bit more complex:
x_x_min > y_x_max

But we know that the projections of y and z onto the x-axis overlap. This means y_x_min <= z_x_max and y_x_max >= z_x_min.

Can we determine anything about the relation between x_x_min and z_x_max from this?

Let's say the projection of y onto the x-axis is completely contained within the projection of z. In this case, y_x_min > z_x_min and y_x_max < z_x_max. Given that x_x_min > y_x_max, we can say x_x_min > z_x_min, but we cannot determine if x_x_min > z_x_max.

But, y is directly N of z, so their projections on the x-axis is the same, i.e., y_x_min = z_x_min and y_x_max = z_x_max.
Given that x_x_min > y_x_max, we can say x_x_min > z_x_max.

This means x is to the east of z in terms of x-coordinates.

Combining the y-coordinate and x-coordinate relations, x is to the northeast of z.

Actually, I think it's a more nuanced. Let's be careful and think about the various possibilities.

Given two regions A and B, here are the possible cardinal direction relations using the 9-intersection model:
- A is N of B: The bounding box of A is entirely to the north of the bounding box of B.
- A is NE of B: The bounding box of A is entirely to the northeast of the bounding box of B.
- ... and so on for the other 7 directions.

Let's assume all regions have a non-zero area. 

Given:
1. x is NE of y: The bounding box of x is entirely to the northeast of the bounding box of y.
2. y is N of z: The bounding box of y is entirely to the north of the bounding box of z.

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

First, I'll determine the constraints on the bounding boxes:
- Since y is N of z, y's bounding box is entirely above z's bounding box. That is, the minimum y-coordinate of y's bounding box is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z's bounding box.
- Since x is NE of y, x's bounding box is entirely to the northeast of y's bounding box. That is, the minimum x-coordinate of x's bounding box is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y's bounding box, and the minimum y-coordinate of x's bounding box is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y's bounding box.

Now, given these constraints, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

From the y-coordinate constraints:
- Minimum y-coordinate of x > Maximum y-coordinate of y
- Minimum y-coordinate of y > Maximum y-coordinate of z

Transitively: Minimum y-coordinate of x > Maximum y-coordinate of z

This means x is to the north of z in terms of y-coordinates.

From the x-coordinate constraints:
- Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of y

Since y is N of z, the x-coordinates of y and z are independent. The x-coordinates of y's bounding box could be to the left of, to the right of, or overlap with the x-coordinates of z's bounding box.

Let's consider each case:

1. If y is to the left of z (Maximum x-coordinate of y < Minimum x-coordinate of z):
   - Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of y > Minimum x-coordinate of z
   - We can't determine if Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of z.
   - So, x could be to the northeast or north of z.

2. If y is to the right of z (Minimum x-coordinate of y > Maximum x-coordinate of z):
   - Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of y > Maximum x-coordinate of z
   - So, x is to the east of z in terms of x-coordinates.
   - Combining with the y-coordinate constraint, x is to the northeast of z.

3. If y's x-coordinates overlap with z's (Minimum x-coordinate of y <= Maximum x-coordinate of z and Maximum x-coordinate of y >= Minimum x-coordinate of z):
   - We know Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of y.
   - If Maximum x-coordinate of y >= Maximum x-coordinate of z, then Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of z, making x to the east of z in terms of x-coordinates. Combining with the y-coordinate constraint, x is to the northeast of z.
   - If Maximum x-coordinate of y < Maximum x-coordinate of z, we can't determine if Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of z. So, x could be to the northeast or north of z.

But actually I should be more careful. Given "y is N of z", this means that the relationship between y and z is of the North type. But here North means the idealized geometric north -- if y is N of z, then y's bounding box is entirely to the north of z's bounding box. In other words, the minimum y-coordinate of y's bounding box is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z's bounding box.

But, the relationship "y is N of z" also constrains the x-coordinates. It implies that the x-coordinates of y and z are aligned. That is, the projections of y and z onto the x-axis overlap. If they didn't, y would be to the northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest of z, not directly north.

So, given "y is N of z":
- Minimum y-coordinate of y > Maximum y-coordinate of z (y is to the north of z in terms of y-coordinates)
- Minimum x-coordinate of y <= Maximum x-coordinate of z and Maximum x-coordinate of y >= Minimum x-coordinate of z (y and z's x-coordinates overlap)

Now, given "x is NE of y":
- Minimum y-coordinate of x > Maximum y-coordinate of y (x is to the north of y in terms of y-coordinates)
- Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of y (x is to the east of y in terms of x-coordinates)

Combining these constraints:
- Minimum y-coordinate of x > Maximum y-coordinate of y > Maximum y-coordinate of z (x is to the north of z in terms of y-coordinates)
- Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of y >= Minimum x-coordinate of z (x is to the east of y, and y's x-coordinates overlap with z's)

From the second point, we can say Minimum x-coordinate of x > Minimum x-coordinate of z, but we can't determine if Minimum x-coordinate of x > Maximum x-coordinate of z.

So, from this analysis, x could be to the northeast or north of z.

Hang on, I need to be more careful again. Let's be very precise about the definitions.

Cardinal directions define a partition of the plane into 9 regions relative to a reference region. The 9 regions are: the reference region itself, and the 8 directional regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

Given "y is N of z", this means:
1. y is entirely in the N directional region relative to z.
2. The N directional region is defined as the area where the y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, and the x-coordinate is between the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of z.

Given "x is NE of y", this means:
1. x is entirely in the NE directional region relative to y.
2. The NE directional region is defined as the area where the y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y, and the x-coordinate is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.

Combining these, we have:
- y is in the area where the y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, and the x-coordinate is between the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of z.
- x is in the area where the y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y, and the x-coordinate is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.

From the first point, we know:
- The minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.
- The minimum x-coordinate of y is at most the maximum x-coordinate of z, and the maximum x-coordinate of y is at least the minimum x-coordinate of z. In other words, the x-coordinates of y and z overlap.

From the second point, we know:
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.

Transitively, we can say:
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z (since the minimum y-coordinate of x > maximum y-coordinate of y > maximum y-coordinate of z).
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.

With this, can we determine the relation between x and z? Let's check each directional region:

1. N directional region relative to z: The area where the y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, and the x-coordinate is between the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of z.
2. NE directional region relative to z: The area where the y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z, and the x-coordinate is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z.
3. E directional region relative to z: The area where the y-coordinate is between the minimum and maximum y-coordinates of z, and the x-coordinate is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z.
4. ... and so on for the other directions.

From our transitive constraints, we know x is in an area where the y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z. This eliminates the E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW directional regions. So, x can only be in the N or NE directional regions relative to z.

The thing I'm not sure about is how much we can constrain the x-coordinates of x relative to z. We know:
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.
- The x-coordinates of y and z overlap, but the exact overlap is not specified.

If the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x can be in the N directional region relative to z. If the maximum x-coordinate of y is equal to the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

To visualize this, consider a case where z's bounding box is [0,0,10,5], y's bounding box is [2,6,8,10], and x's bounding box is [9,11,12,15]. In this case, y is N of z (since y's y-coordinates are all greater than z's, and the x-coordinates overlap), and x is NE of y (since x's y-coordinates are all greater than y's, and x's x-coordinates are all greater than y's). But relative to z, x is in the NE directional region.

Now, consider a case where z's bounding box is [0,0,10,5], y's bounding box is [2,6,6,10], and x's bounding box is [7,11,8,15]. In this case, y is still N of z, and x is still NE of y. But relative to z, x is in the N directional region.

So, from this analysis, x can be in the N or NE directional regions relative to z.

Actually, I don't think the above is quite right. I've been confusing myself. Let me rethink everything.

Cardinal directions define a partition of the plane into 9 regions relative to a reference region: the reference region itself, and the 8 directional regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). Given "A is D of B" (where D is a directional relation), this means A is in the D directional region relative to B.

Now, let's define these directional regions:
1. N directional region relative to a reference region R: The area where the y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of R, and the x-coordinate is between the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of R.
2. NE directional region relative to R: The area where the y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of R, and the x-coordinate is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of R.
3. ... and so on for the other directions.

Given "y is N of z", this means y is in the N directional region relative to z. From the definition, this means:
- The minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.
- The minimum x-coordinate of y is at most the maximum x-coordinate of z, and the maximum x-coordinate of y is at least the minimum x-coordinate of z. In other words, the x-coordinates of y and z overlap.

Given "x is NE of y", this means x is in the NE directional region relative to y. From the definition, this means:
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

From our constraints:
- The minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y.
- Transitively, the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

So, in terms of y-coordinates, x is to the north of z.

For the x-coordinates:
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.
- The x-coordinates of y and z overlap.

The exact overlap of y and z's x-coordinates can vary. Let's consider the extremes:

1. If the minimum x-coordinate of y is equal to the minimum x-coordinate of z, and the maximum x-coordinate of y is equal to the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x, being to the east of y, is also to the east of z. In this case, x is to the northeast of z.

2. If the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x can be to the east of y but still within the x-coordinates of z. In this case, x is to the north of z.

3. If the maximum x-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x, being to the east of y, is also to the east of z. In this case, x is to the northeast of z.

Hmm, I think 2 is wrong again. If x is to the east of y, then the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y. But this doesn't imply that x is within the x-coordinates of z. Let's rethink this.

The x-coordinates of y and z overlap, which means the minimum x-coordinate of y is at most the maximum x-coordinate of z, and the maximum x-coordinate of y is at least the minimum x-coordinate of z.

But, the exact overlap is not specified. Let's consider the possible cases:

1. If the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the maximum x-coordinate of z:
   - The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y.
   - This means the minimum x-coordinate of x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z.
   - If the minimum x-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x is in the N directional region relative to z.
   - If the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

2. If the maximum x-coordinate of y is equal to the maximum x-coordinate of z:
   - The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y, which is equal to the maximum x-coordinate of z.
   - So, the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z.
   - This means x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

3. If the maximum x-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z:
   - The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y, which is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z.
   - So, the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z.
   - This means x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

From these cases, we can see that x can be in the N or NE directional regions relative to z.

But actually, I need to be careful with the terminology. The directional relation "N" doesn't mean that two regions have overlapping x-coordinates. It means one region is entirely above the other in terms of y-coordinates, and the projections of the two regions onto the x-axis overlap.

So, given "y is N of z", this means y is entirely above z in terms of y-coordinates, and the projections of y and z onto the x-axis overlap. Similarly, given "x is NE of y", this means x is entirely above and to the right of y.

With this understanding, let's determine the constraints:

From "y is N of z":
- The minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z (y is entirely above z).
- The projection of y onto the x-axis overlaps with the projection of z onto the x-axis. This means there exists an x-coordinate that is within both y's and z's projections.

From "x is NE of y":
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y (x is entirely above y).
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y (x is entirely to the right of y).

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to think in terms of the partitioning of the plane into directional regions relative to z.

In terms of y-coordinates, we know:
- The minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y (from "x is NE of y").
- The minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z (from "y is N of z").
- Transitively, the minimum y-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

This means x is entirely above z in terms of y-coordinates.

In terms of x-coordinates, we know:
- The minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y (from "x is NE of y").
- The projection of y onto the x-axis overlaps with the projection of z onto the x-axis (from "y is N of z").

This overlap can take many forms. The key question is: Can x's projection onto the x-axis overlap with z's projection onto the x-axis, given the constraints?

Given the constraint that the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of y, and the projection of y onto the x-axis overlaps with the projection of z onto the x-axis, there are two possibilities:

1. If the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the maximum x-coordinate of z, then the minimum x-coordinate of x can be less than the maximum x-coordinate of z. In this case, the projection of x onto the x-axis can overlap with the projection of z onto the x-axis. This would place x in the N directional region relative to z.

2. If the maximum x-coordinate of y is equal to or greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, then the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z. In this case, the projection of x onto the x-axis does not overlap with the projection of z onto the x-axis. This would place x in the NE directional region relative to z.

So, from this analysis, x can be in the N or NE directional regions relative to z.

OK let me continue and summarize.

The problem is asking about the possible directional relations between regions x and z, given that "x is NE of y" and "y is N of z". 

Let's use the cardinal direction system, which divides the space around a reference region into 9 directional regions: the reference region itself, and the 8 directional regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

From our constraints:
- Region y is in the N directional region relative to region z. This means y is entirely above z in terms of y-coordinates, and the projections of y and z onto the x-axis overlap.
- Region x is in the NE directional region relative to region y. This means x is entirely above and to the right of y.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to determine where x can be located relative to z's directional regions.

In terms of y-coordinates, we know x is entirely above y, which is entirely above z. So, x is entirely above z.

In terms of x-coordinates, we know x is entirely to the right of y, and the projections of y and z onto the x-axis overlap.

Let's consider the extreme cases of this overlap:

1. If y's projection onto the x-axis is entirely contained within z's projection, and y's right boundary aligns with z's right boundary, then x, being to the right of y, is also to the right of z. In this case, x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

2. If y's projection onto the x-axis is entirely contained within z's projection, but y's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary, then x, being to the right of y, might still be within z's projection onto the x-axis. In this case, x is in the N directional region relative to z.

In general, the possible relations between x and z are:
- If the minimum x-coordinate of x is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x is in the NE directional region relative to z.
- If the minimum x-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of z, then x is in the N directional region relative to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North or Northeast.

Actually, I think I should be a bit more careful about the cases.

The cardinal direction system divides the space around a reference region into directional regions based on the bounding box of the reference region. The N directional region is the area above the reference region, extending horizontally across the width of the reference region. The NE directional region is the area above and to the right of the reference region.

Given "y is N of z", we know:
- The minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z (y is above z).
- The projection of y onto the x-axis overlaps with the projection of z onto the x-axis.

Let's denote the bounding box of z as [z_x_min, z_y_min, z_x_max, z_y_max], and similar for y and x.

From "y is N of z", we know:
- y_y_min > z_y_max
- y_x_min <= z_x_max and y_x_max >= z_x_min (the projections overlap)

From "x is NE of y", we know:
- x_y_min > y_y_max
- x_x_min > y_x_max

Transitively, we know x_y_min > z_y_max (x is above z).

The relationship between x's and z's projections onto the x-axis depends on the exact overlap between y's and z's projections, and the relationship between x's and y's projections.

We know x_x_min > y_x_max (x is to the right of y).

Let's consider the possible cases for the overlap between y's and z's projections:

1. If y_x_min <= z_x_min and y_x_max >= z_x_max (y's projection fully contains z's projection):
   - We know x_x_min > y_x_max >= z_x_max.
   - This means x is to the right of z, and x's projection onto the x-axis does not overlap with z's projection.
   - So, x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

2. If z_x_min <= y_x_min and z_x_max >= y_x_max (z's projection fully contains y's projection):
   - We know x_x_min > y_x_max, but we can't determine the relationship between x_x_min and z_x_max without more information.
   - If x_x_min > z_x_max, then x is to the right of z, and x is in the NE directional region relative to z.
   - If x_x_min <= z_x_max, then x's projection onto the x-axis overlaps with z's projection, and x is in the N directional region relative to z.

3. If y_x_min <= z_x_min and y_x_max < z_x_max (partial overlap, y extends to the left of z):
   - We know x_x_min > y_x_max.
   - If y_x_max >= z_x_min (there is an actual overlap), we can't determine the relationship between x_x_min and z_x_max without more information.
   - If x_x_min > z_x_max, then x is to the right of z, and x is in the NE directional region relative to z.
   - If x_x_min <= z_x_max, then x's projection onto the x-axis overlaps with z's projection, and x is in the N directional region relative to z.

4. If y_x_min > z_x_min and y_x_max >= z_x_max (partial overlap, y extends to the right of z):
   - We know x_x_min > y_x_max >= z_x_max.
   - This means x is to the right of z, and x's projection onto the x-axis does not overlap with z's projection.
   - So, x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

5. If y_x_min > z_x_min and y_x_max < z_x_max (y's projection is fully contained within z's projection but doesn't extend to either edge):
   - We know x_x_min > y_x_max, but we can't determine the relationship between x_x_min and z_x_max without more information.
   - If x_x_min > z_x_max, then x is to the right of z, and x is in the NE directional region relative to z.
   - If x_x_min <= z_x_max, then x's projection onto the x-axis overlaps with z's projection, and x is in the N directional region relative to z.

From this analysis, we can see that x can be in the N or NE directional regions relative to z, depending on the exact overlap of the projections.

Actually I think I might be overcomplicating this. 

To simplify, the general question is: if region x is to the northeast of region y, and region y is to the north of region z, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

We know:
- x is to the northeast of y. This means x is above and to the right of y.
- y is to the north of z. This means y is directly above z, with some overlap in their projections onto the x-axis.

From the first point, we know that x is above y. From the second point, we know that y is above z. Transitively, x is above z.

From the first point, we know that x is to the right of y. From the second point, we know that y's projection onto the x-axis overlaps with z's projection. This means that the right boundary of y could be to the left of, aligned with, or to the right of the right boundary of z.

- If the right boundary of y is to the left of the right boundary of z, then x, being to the right of y, could still be within the x-projection of z. In this case, x would be to the north of z.
- If the right boundary of y is aligned with or to the right of the right boundary of z, then x, being to the right of y, is also to the right of z. In this case, x would be to the northeast of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North or Northeast.

Let's see if there are any other possible relations. 

Since x is to the northeast of y, and y is to the north of z, we know that x is above z. This eliminates the directional relations E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The remaining possibilities are N, NE, and a bounding box relation.

However, since we're only considering the 8 cardinal directions, not relations where regions overlap, and the question specified that the relations are cardinal direction relations, we can eliminate the bounding box relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are just: North or Northeast.

Ah, actually the "bounding box" is one of the possible answers listed in the problem, so I guess we should consider it. However, based on the constraints, I don't think a bounding box relation is possible.

A bounding box relation would mean that the bounding box of x overlaps with the bounding box of z. But we know that x is above y, which is above z. This means that the bounding box of x is entirely above the bounding box of z, ruling out a bounding box relation.

Actually, I don't think a "bounding box" relation is a cardinal direction relation anyway. The 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) partition the space around a reference region, and each of these directions is a distinct relation. A "bounding box" would refer to a case where one region is contained within the bounding box of another, which is a different type of relation.

So, I think the possible relations between x and z are just: North or Northeast. And I double checked that indeed the premise that "y is N of z" means that the bounding box of y is above the bounding box of z, and the projections of y and z onto the x-axis overlap.

In summary, if region x is to the northeast of region y, and region y is to the north of region z, then the possible relations between x and z are: North or Northeast.

Actually, to be completely sure, let me check once more. I think I've been overthinking this a bit. Let me try to solve it with a very clear approach.

Let's represent the cardinal directions on a 2D grid. Imagine the reference region at the center, and the 8 cardinal directions partitioning the space around it.

```
  NW  |  N  |  NE
------|-----|------
   W  |  R  |  E
------|-----|------
  SW  |  S  |  SE
```

In this grid, R is the reference region, and the other cells represent the 8 cardinal directions.

Given "y is N of z", this means y is in the N directional region relative to z. If we place z at the center (R) of our grid, y would be in the N cell.

```
      |  y  |
------|-----|------
      |  z  |
------|-----|------
      |     |
```

Given "x is NE of y", this means x is in the NE directional region relative to y. If we place y at the center of our grid, x would be in the NE cell.

```
      |     |  x
------|-----|------
      |  y  |
------|-----|------
      |     |
```

Combining the two, we can visualize the scenario as:

```
      |     |  x
------|-----|------
      |  y  |
------|-----|------
      |  z  |
```

Now, the question is: What is the directional relation of x with respect to z?

Looking at our visualization, x is to the northeast of z. This would place x in the NE cell relative to z.

Hmm wait, I haven't been considering some possible configurations. Let me think again.

Given "y is N of z", y is directly above z, with some overlap in their projections onto the x-axis. If z is at the origin, y would be somewhere along the positive y-axis, offset slightly to the left or right. If its projection is exactly over z, y would be precisely above z. And if its projection overlaps with z but isn't completely within z's projection, then y would be offset either to the left or right, or even extend beyond z both to the left and right. Here's a visualization:

```
   +---+   or  +---+  or     +-----+  or other overlaps
   | y |       | y |         |  y  |
   +---+       +---+         +-----+
     +---+     +---+           +---+
     | z |     | z |           | z |
     +---+     +---+           +---+
```

Let's call the first visualization is Config 1, the second is Config 2, and the third is Config 3.

Given "x is NE of y", x is above and to the right of y. If y is at the origin, x would be somewhere in the first quadrant, above the x-axis.

Now, combining the two constraints:

For Config 1:
```
         +---+
         | x |
         +---+
   +---+
   | y |
   +---+
     +---+
     | z |
     +---+
```

In this case, x could be to the north of z if it's directly above z, or to the northeast of z if it's to the right of z.

For Config 2:
```
     +---+
     | x |
     +---+
     +---+
     | y |
     +---+
     +---+
     | z |
     +---+
```

In this case, x is to the north of z.

For Config 3:
```
                 +---+
                 | x |
                 +---+
       +-----+
       |  y  |
       +-----+
         +---+
         | z |
         +---+
```

In this case, x is to the northeast of z.

There are many other possible configurations depending on the exact overlap of y and z, and the exact positioning of x relative to y. But in all cases, x will be either to the north of z or to the northeast of z.

Actually, no. I think I'm complicating things again.

Actually, this shouldn't be too complicated. North and Northeast are cardinal direction relations. I just need to draw the relations.

Given "y is N of z", y is in the northern direction from z.
Given "x is NE of y", x is in the northeastern direction from y.

The question is: What are the possible directional relations of x with respect to z?

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Given "y is N of z", y is at (0, y_dist) for some positive y_dist.

Given "x is NE of y", x is at (x_dist, y_dist + x_dist_y) for some positive x_dist and x_dist_y.

So, x is at (x_dist, y_dist + x_dist_y) relative to the origin.

In terms of cardinal directions, a point (x, y) relative to the origin is:
- N if x = 0 and y > 0
- NE if x > 0 and y > 0
- E if x > 0 and y = 0
- ... and so on.

In our case, x_dist > 0 and y_dist + x_dist_y > 0, which places x in the NE cardinal direction relative to z.

But that's only one possibility, where y is directly north of z. Let me try more possible configurations.

Actually wait. I don't think "y is N of z" means y is precisely above z. There's some leeway. The N cardinal direction generally refers to a region, not a precise direction. But given "y is N of z" (cardinal direction relation), I'd typically interpret this as y is above z with some overlap in their x-projections.

I see the problem. I've been trying to be very precise, and I've been interpreting "y is N of z" as y being in the N cardinal direction relative to z. The cardinal direction N is a region, not a single point or direction. Similarly, NE is a region. I need to think in terms of regions, not directions. 

So, given "y is N of z", y is in the northern directional region relative to z. This means y is above z, and the projections of y and z onto the x-axis overlap. Similarly, given "x is NE of y", x is in the northeastern directional region relative to y. This means x is above and to the right of y.

Now, considering both constraints together, what can we say about where x is located relative to z? 

If y is in the northern directional region relative to z, and x is in the northeastern directional region relative to y, then x is above y, which is above z. So, x is above z. Additionally, x is to the right of y. Depending on how y is positioned relative to z (i.e., how much their x-projections overlap), x could be directly above z (which would place it in the N directional region relative to z) or to the right of z (which would place it in the NE directional region relative to z).

There are three possible configurations for y relative to z:
1. y's x-projection is entirely within z's x-projection.
2. y's x-projection overlaps with z's x-projection, but extends to the right of z.
3. y's x-projection overlaps with z's x-projection, but extends to the left of z.

For x relative to y, we know x is in the NE directional region. Considering the three configurations of y relative to z, where would x be located relative to z?

1. If y's x-projection is entirely within z's x-projection, then x (being to the right of y) could be either directly above z or to the right of z. If it's directly above z, x is in the N directional region relative to z. If it's to the right of z, x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

2. If y's x-projection overlaps with z's x-projection, but extends to the right of z, then x (being to the right of y) is definitely to the right of z. In this case, x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

3. If y's x-projection overlaps with z's x-projection, but extends to the left of z, then x (being to the right of y) could be either directly above z or to the right of z. If it's directly above z, x is in the N directional region relative to z. If it's to the right of z, x is in the NE directional region relative to z.

From this analysis, I can see that the possible directional relations of x with respect to z are: North or Northeast.

So, in conclusion, if region x is to the northeast of region y, and region y is to the north of region z, then the possible relations between x and z are: North or Northeast.

Actually, let me add one more check by considering the extreme positions of these regions. 

Let's say:
- z is located at the origin (0, 0).
- y is directly above z at (0, 1).
- x is to the northeast of y at (1, 2).

In this case, from z's perspective, x is at (1, 2), which is to the northeast of z.

Now, let's say:
- z is located at the origin (0, 0).
- y is still to the north of z, but slightly to the left at (-1, 1).
- x is to the northeast of y, right above z at (0, 2).

In this case, from z's perspective, x is at (0, 2), which is directly to the north of z.

So, from these two examples, I can confirm that x can be either to the north or to the northeast of z, depending on the exact positions of y and x.

In conclusion, if region x is to the northeast of region y, and region y is to the north of region z, then the possible relations between x and z are: North or Northeast.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are: North or Northeast.
