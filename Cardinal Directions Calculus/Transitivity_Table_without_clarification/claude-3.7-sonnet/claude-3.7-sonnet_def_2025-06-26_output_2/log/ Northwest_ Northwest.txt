PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's consider the cardinal direction relations between regions. 

In this problem, we have:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is Northwest of region z

We need to determine what could be the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z.

Let's think about this:

When region x is Northwest of region y, it means x is located in the Northwest direction from y. Similarly, when region y is Northwest of region z, it means y is located in the Northwest direction from z.

To visualize this:
- If we place z at the origin (0,0)
- Then y would be in the Northwest direction from z, so y could be at (-a, b) where a, b > 0
- And x would be Northwest of y, so x could be at (-a-c, b+d) where c, d > 0

So x would be at (-a-c, b+d) relative to z at (0,0).

Since -a-c < 0 and b+d > 0, region x is in the direction where the x-coordinate is negative and the y-coordinate is positive relative to z. This corresponds to the Northwest direction.

Therefore, region x is Northwest of region z.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. Let's set up a coordinate system where:
- North corresponds to the positive y-axis
- East corresponds to the positive x-axis
- South corresponds to the negative y-axis
- West corresponds to the negative x-axis

In this coordinate system:
- Northwest is the direction where both x is negative and y is positive
- Northeast is the direction where both x and y are positive
- Southeast is the direction where x is positive and y is negative
- Southwest is the direction where both x and y are negative

Now, let's place:
- z at the origin (0, 0)
- y is Northwest of z, so y is in the region where x < 0 and y > 0
- x is Northwest of y, which means x is in the region where x is even more negative and y is even more positive compared to y

So, relative to z, x would have a more negative x-coordinate and a more positive y-coordinate than y does. This means x is still in the Northwest direction from z.

Therefore, if region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x must be Northwest of region z.

Actually wait, let me check this in a different way by considering specific coordinates. 

Let's place:
- z at the origin (0, 0)
- y at (-1, 1), which is Northwest of z
- x at (-2, 2), which is Northwest of y

Is x Northwest of z? From the perspective of z, x is at (-2, 2), which is indeed in the Northwest direction.

Let's try another example:
- z at (0, 0)
- y at (-3, 1), which is Northwest of z
- x at (-4, 2), which is Northwest of y

From the perspective of z, x is at (-4, 2), which is still in the Northwest direction.

It seems like in all cases, if x is Northwest of y and y is Northwest of z, then x is Northwest of z. This makes sense geometrically because the Northwest direction is consistent.

However, I think I should more carefully think about the definition of the "Northwest" cardinal direction relation for regions. 

The cardinal direction relation between two regions can be determined by comparing the Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Based on this:
- Region x is Northwest of region y if the MBR of x is completely to the west and north of the MBR of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z if the MBR of y is completely to the west and north of the MBR of z.

Given these conditions, the MBR of x would be completely to the west and north of the MBR of z, making x Northwest of z.

So, my answer stands: If region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Hmm wait. I am getting confused about what the MBR means for the definition of the NW relation. Let me be more precise.

In the context of cardinal direction relations for regions:

A region x is Northwest of a region y if and only if every point in x is Northwest of every point in y. This means that for every point (x_p, y_p) in region x and every point (x_q, y_q) in region y, x_p < x_q and y_p > y_q.

Given that:
- Region x is Northwest of region y, which means every point in x is Northwest of every point in y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z, which means every point in y is Northwest of every point in z.

We can infer that every point in x is Northwest of every point in z, because:
- Every point in x is Northwest of every point in y.
- Every point in y is Northwest of every point in z.
- This ensures that every point in x is Northwest of every point in z.

Therefore, region x is Northwest of region z.

So, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Hmm, I'm still not convinced I'm using the right definition. Typically, cardinal directions are defined based on the reference's minimum bounding rectangle (MBR).

For point-to-point relations, the definitions are simple:
- A point p is North of a point q if p has the same x-coordinate as q and a greater y-coordinate.
- A point p is Northwest of a point q if p has a smaller x-coordinate than q and a greater y-coordinate.

But for region-to-region relations, the situation is more complex due to the extent of the regions. Cardinal directions for regions are typically defined based on the 9-intersection model, which partitions the space around a reference region into 9 tiles (8 cardinal directions plus the reference region itself).

However, I think a natural way to define the Northwest relation for regions is to say:
- Region A is Northwest of region B if the MBR of A is completely to the west and north of the MBR of B.

If this is the definition we're using, then:
- Region x is Northwest of region y, which means the MBR of x is completely to the west and north of the MBR of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z, which means the MBR of y is completely to the west and north of the MBR of z.

Given these conditions, the MBR of x would be completely to the west and north of the MBR of z, making x Northwest of z.

So, if region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Hmm... Actually, I'm starting to doubt the transitivity of the Northwest relation. Let me think about it one more time from the beginning. We have regions with arbitrary shapes, and we want to define cardinal direction relations between them.

One approach is to use the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) of each region. The space around a reference region is partitioned into 9 tiles based on the reference's MBR:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- S (South)
- SW (Southwest)
- W (West)
- NW (Northwest)
- O (Overlap with the reference)

For a region to be "Northwest" of another, it means the region's MBR is entirely within the Northwest tile of the reference region.

Now, let's analyze the scenario:
- Region x is Northwest of region y. This means the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest tile of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means the MBR of y is entirely within the Northwest tile of z.

Does this guarantee that region x is Northwest of region z?

Let's imagine z's MBR is centered at the origin. The Northwest tile of z would be the area where both x-coordinates are negative and y-coordinates are positive. If y's MBR is entirely within this tile, then y is Northwest of z.

Now, if x's MBR is entirely within the Northwest tile of y, then x's MBR is even further to the West and North of y's MBR.

From the perspective of z, x's MBR would still be within the Northwest tile of z, because:
- If y's MBR is entirely within the Northwest tile of z, and
- x's MBR is entirely within the Northwest tile of y, 
- Then x's MBR must be entirely within the Northwest tile of z.

So, the Northwest relation is transitive.

Therefore, if region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Actually, I'm having a bit of doubt about the transitivity of the Northwest relation for region-to-region relations, especially when we're considering arbitrary regions. Let me think more carefully about this.

Let's first be really specific about the definition. There are different ways to define cardinal directions for regions, but a common approach is to use the 9-intersection model based on the MBRs of the regions.

Given a region R, the space around it is partitioned into 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the region itself) using the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the region's MBR.

For a region A to be in the Northwest (NW) of region B, the MBR of A should be entirely within the NW tile of B. This means that the maximum x-coordinate of A's MBR is less than the minimum x-coordinate of B's MBR, and the minimum y-coordinate of A's MBR is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of B's MBR.

Now, let's check the transitivity:

If region x is NW of region y, then:
max_x(x) < min_x(y) and min_y(x) > max_y(y)

If region y is NW of region z, then:
max_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(y) > max_y(z)

From these, we can infer that:
max_x(x) < max_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > min_y(y) > max_y(z)

Which simplifies to:
max_x(x) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > max_y(z)

This means region x is NW of region z. So, the NW relation is transitive under the definition we're using.

Therefore, if region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Actually, that's the second time I've been confused and the second time I've settled on Northwest as the answer. Let me just double-check the reasoning:

For a region A to be in the Northwest (NW) of region B, the MBR of A should be entirely within the NW tile of B. This means:
1. The maximum x-coordinate of A's MBR is less than the minimum x-coordinate of B's MBR (i.e., A is completely to the west of B).
2. The minimum y-coordinate of A's MBR is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of B's MBR (i.e., A is completely to the north of B).

If region x is NW of region y, then:
max_x(x) < min_x(y) and min_y(x) > max_y(y)

If region y is NW of region z, then:
max_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(y) > max_y(z)

Combining these, we get:
max_x(x) < min_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > max_y(y) > max_y(z)

Which simplifies to:
max_x(x) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > max_y(z)

This means region x is NW of region z according to our definition.

Therefore, if region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

However, to be absolutely certain, let me simulate this on a grid with specific examples.

Let's say:
- Region z has an MBR with coordinates (5, 5) to (7, 7).
- Region y has an MBR with coordinates (2, 8) to (4, 10), which is NW of z.
- Region x has an MBR with coordinates (0, 11) to (1, 12), which is NW of y.

Is region x NW of region z? 
max_x(x) = 1 < min_x(z) = 5 and min_y(x) = 11 > max_y(z) = 7.
So, region x is indeed NW of region z.

Let's try another example:
- Region z has an MBR with coordinates (10, 10) to (15, 15).
- Region y has an MBR with coordinates (5, 16) to (9, 20), which is NW of z.
- Region x has an MBR with coordinates (1, 21) to (4, 25), which is NW of y.

Is region x NW of region z? 
max_x(x) = 4 < min_x(z) = 10 and min_y(x) = 21 > max_y(z) = 15.
So, region x is indeed NW of region z.

It seems clear that the NW relation is transitive under the definition we're using. So, my answer remains: If region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

So the only possible answer is "Northwest"

Actually, wait let me re-read the question. It asks "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be". Is it possible there's more than one relation? Let me think more.

For the Nothwest cardinal direction, I'm now convinced that it is transitive, meaning if x is Northwest of y and y is Northwest of z, then x is Northwest of z.

But are there any other possible relations between x and z? I don't think so. Based on the properties of the cardinal direction relations, if x is Northwest of y and y is Northwest of z, then x can only be Northwest of z. It can't be in any other cardinal direction.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Actually wait, I just realized that I was assuming the relations are based on the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of the regions. But there are other ways to define cardinal direction relations for regions. Let me reconsider.

There's another approach called the direction-relation matrix, which gives a more detailed representation of the directional relations between two regions. In this approach, a region is projected onto the x and y axes, and the directional relations are determined by the overlaps of these projections.

Using this approach, a region A can have multiple directional relations with region B simultaneously. For instance, part of region A can be Northwest of region B, while another part can be North of it.

However, given the constraints of the problem (region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z), region x would still be Northwest of region z. This is because if x is completely in the Northwest of y, and y is completely in the Northwest of z, then x is completely in the Northwest of z.

I think another source of confusion is that for point-to-point relations, the Northwest direction can be broken down into "more North" and "more West" components. But for region-to-region relations using the MBR approach, a region is said to be Northwest of another if it is completely to the west and north of the other, which means the relation is more restrictive.

Given all this, I stick with my answer. If region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

In fact, actually, let me try to be really careful about this. Maybe the question is asking me to be precise about the possible cardinal direction relations specifically in a precise sense.

OK, let me just make sure I understand the precise, formal definition of the cardinal direction relations.

Formally, the cardinal direction relations between two regions can be defined using the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) approach. Given two regions A and B, we can divide the space around the MBR of B into 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the tile containing B itself). Region A is said to be in a particular cardinal direction of B if its MBR is entirely within the corresponding tile.

Using this definition:
- Region A is North of region B if the MBR of A is entirely above the MBR of B.
- Region A is Northeast of region B if the MBR of A is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of B.
- Region A is East of region B if the MBR of A is entirely to the right of the MBR of B.
- And so on.

Now, with these definitions, let's analyze the scenario:
- Region x is Northwest of region y. This means the MBR of x is entirely to the left and above the MBR of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means the MBR of y is entirely to the left and above the MBR of z.

From these, we can deduce that the MBR of x is entirely to the left and above the MBR of z. This means region x is Northwest of region z. Given the constraints of the problem, this is the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z using the MBR approach.

I think the issue is that we are just using the cardinal direction relations for regions. Is it possible that the operations is not the same as geographical positioning? For instance, I'm thinking of the cardinal direction as a relation, rather than a literal geometric positioning. 

Let me revisit the problem once again, focusing on the definition of the Northwest relation in the context of the question.

The Northwest relation between two regions is a binary spatial relation where one region is entirely to the northwest of another, based on their Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs). Specifically, region A is Northwest of region B if the MBR of A is entirely to the left and above the MBR of B.

Now, let's reason through this step by step:
- Region x is Northwest of region y. This means the MBR of x is entirely to the left and above the MBR of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means the MBR of y is entirely to the left and above the MBR of z.

From these, we can infer that the MBR of x is entirely to the left and above the MBR of z. This is because if x is to the left and above y, and y is to the left and above z, then x is certainly to the left and above z. This means region x is Northwest of region z.

So, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Given the wording of the question, I wonder if there are multiple possible relations? I am fairly certain that if we strictly adhere to the definition of the Northwest relation as described above, then if x is Northwest of y and y is Northwest of z, it must be the case that x is Northwest of z.

My reasoning was already correct based on the transitivity of the Northwest relation. If A is Northwest of B and B is Northwest of C, then A is Northwest of C.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

OK, I still believe my answer is correct. I suspect the question is testing whether I understand that the transitivity of the Northwest relation is straightforward and that, given the premises, the only possible relation is that x is Northwest of z.

Let me double-check once more:

For a region A to be Northwest of a region B, the MBR of A must be entirely to the left and above the MBR of B. If this is the case, then:
max_x(A) < min_x(B) and min_y(A) > max_y(B)

If x is Northwest of y, then:
max_x(x) < min_x(y) and min_y(x) > max_y(y)

If y is Northwest of z, then:
max_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(y) > max_y(z)

Combining these, we get:
max_x(x) < min_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > max_y(y) > max_y(z)

Which means:
max_x(x) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > max_y(z)

This directly implies that x is Northwest of z.

Given our definition and the premises, the only possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

But let me check if the NW relation for a pair of regions has a specific, non-obvious definition in this context that doesn't correspond to "x is to the northwest of y" in a typical geographical sense.

Let's explore a different definition of the NW relation for regions. In the 9-intersection model for regions, the space is divided into 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the tile containing the reference region itself). A region is said to be in a particular cardinal direction of another if it intersects with the corresponding tile.

Under this definition, a region A can have multiple cardinal direction relations with region B simultaneously. For instance, part of region A can be Northwest of region B, while another part can be North of it.

However, even with this more relaxed definition, if we are given that x is entirely Northwest of y and y is entirely Northwest of z, then the only possible relation between x and z is that x is entirely Northwest of z. This is still due to the transitivity of the Northwest relation, even in this relaxed definition.

Therefore, my answer stands: if region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Actually, after thinking about this for a while, I'm also wondering if the question is intended to test my knowledge of cardinal direction relations and their compositions. 

Let's denote the cardinal direction relations as follows:
- N (North)
- NE (Northeast)
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)
- S (South)
- SW (Southwest)
- W (West)
- NW (Northwest)
- B (Bounding Box, or the region itself)

In the context of the composition of cardinal directions (i.e., the relation between x and z given the relations between x and y, and between y and z), there are known results for which compositions result in which relations. For example, if region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then region x could be N, NE, or E of region z.

For the composition of NW with NW, let's work it out:
- If x is NW of y, it means x is to the northwest of y, which can be decomposed as "x is to the north and west of y."
- Similarly, if y is NW of z, it means y is to the north and west of z.
- Combining these, x is to the north and west of something (i.e., y) that is already to the north and west of z. This means x is even further to the north and west of z.
- Therefore, x is to the northwest of z.

This confirms our earlier analysis. The composition of NW with NW gives NW.

So, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Actually, I think I've been on the right track all along. In the context of cardinal direction relations for regions, if region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z. This is due to the transitivity of the Northwest relation, which, as we've shown, is inherent in the definition.

Let me confirm this by checking if the composition of NW with NW is specifically NW in established spatial reasoning frameworks.

In the RCC-8 framework combined with direction relations, the composition of cardinal directions has been studied. For point-to-point relations, the composition table is well-established. For region-to-region relations, the situation is more complex due to the extent of the regions, but the basic principles remain.

In the context of our problem, the composition of NW with NW should give NW, which aligns with our intuitive understanding and the formal analysis we've conducted.

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Hmm, let me think again. I think there's one complication to keep in mind. When we reason about cardinal directions for regions, there are a few different definitions.

One important distinction is between cone-based and projection-based cardinal directions. In cone-based directions, the directions are defined by a cone centered at a point, extending outwards. In projection-based directions, the space is divided into regions based on vertical and horizontal lines.

When we say "region x is Northwest of region y," we're using projection-based directions. In this case, as I've already shown, if x is Northwest of y and y is Northwest of z, then x is Northwest of z.

I can't think of a scenario under the given constraints where x would have a different cardinal direction relationship with z. The definition of "Northwest" and the given constraints ensure that x is Northwest of z.

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Actually wait, in terms of compositions. Actually, it depends on the exact definition we use.

Let's consider a different approach to defining cardinal directions for regions. In some spatial reasoning frameworks, the cardinal direction between two regions is determined by their centroids. In this case, the cardinal direction is the direction from the centroid of one region to the centroid of the other.

Under this definition, if the centroid of x is Northwest of the centroid of y, and the centroid of y is Northwest of the centroid of z, then the centroid of x is Northwest of the centroid of z. This is because, if (x_x, y_x) is the centroid of x, (x_y, y_y) is the centroid of y, and (x_z, y_z) is the centroid of z, then we have x_x < x_y < x_z and y_x > y_y > y_z, which means x_x < x_z and y_x > y_z, i.e., the centroid of x is Northwest of the centroid of z.

So even with this definition, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

I believe the problem is more complex than I initially thought. Let's go back to the foundational definitions of cardinal directions for regions.

In the context of regions, we can use the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) approach. Given two regions A and B, the cardinal direction relation between them is determined by the relative position of the MBR of A with respect to the MBR of B.

Under this approach, the space around the MBR of a region is divided into 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the tile containing the region itself). Another region is said to be in a particular cardinal direction of the first region if its MBR is entirely within the corresponding tile.

Given this definition, let's re-examine the scenario:
- Region x is Northwest of region y. This means the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest tile of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means the MBR of y is entirely within the Northwest tile of z.

From this, can we infer the relation between x and z?

Let's imagine z's MBR is at the origin. The Northwest tile of z would be the area where both the x-coordinates are negative and the y-coordinates are positive. If y's MBR is entirely within this tile, then y is Northwest of z.

Now, if x's MBR is entirely within the Northwest tile of y, then x's MBR is even further to the West and North than y's MBR.

From the perspective of z, x's MBR would still be within the Northwest tile of z, because if y's MBR is entirely within the Northwest tile of z and x's MBR is entirely within the Northwest tile of y, then x's MBR must be entirely within the Northwest tile of z.

This reasoning aligns with the formal analysis I did earlier:
If x is Northwest of y, then: max_x(x) < min_x(y) and min_y(x) > max_y(y)
If y is Northwest of z, then: max_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(y) > max_y(z)
Combining these, we get: max_x(x) < min_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > max_y(y) > max_y(z)
Which means: max_x(x) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > max_y(z), implying x is Northwest of z.

So, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Alright, let me resolve this definitively.

Let's consider a grid where the space is divided into 9 regions based on the MBR of a reference region:

```
NW | N  | NE
------------------
W  | B  | E
------------------
SW | S  | SE
```

Where B represents the MBR of the reference region.

For region A to be in the Northwest (NW) of region B, the MBR of A must be entirely within the NW region of the space divided by the MBR of B.

Now, let's reason through this step by step:
- Region x is Northwest of region y. This means the MBR of x is entirely within the NW region of the space divided by the MBR of y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z. This means the MBR of y is entirely within the NW region of the space divided by the MBR of z.

From these, can we infer the relation between x and z?

If the MBR of y is entirely within the NW region of the space divided by the MBR of z, and the MBR of x is entirely within the NW region of the space divided by the MBR of y, then the MBR of x must be entirely within the NW region of the space divided by the MBR of z.

This can be proved mathematically:
- If the MBR of y is in the NW of the MBR of z, then max_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(y) > max_y(z).
- If the MBR of x is in the NW of the MBR of y, then max_x(x) < min_x(y) and min_y(x) > max_y(y).
- Combining these, we get max_x(x) < min_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > max_y(y) > max_y(z).
- This means max_x(x) < min_x(z) and min_y(x) > max_y(z), which implies the MBR of x is in the NW of the MBR of z.

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

I think the confusion was caused by the problem setup. But, after checking all possible ways to define the NW relation for regions (e.g., centroid-based, MBR-based), the result remains the same. If x is NW of y and y is NW of z, then x is NW of z.

The only possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

Actually I still wonder if the question is about composition of relations.

In the field of qualitative spatial reasoning, there are composition tables for cardinal direction relations. These tables tell us what the possible relations between two regions are, given their relations with a third region.

For example, if region A is North of region B and region B is East of region C, the composition table would tell us the possible relations between A and C (which, in this case, could be N, NE, or E).

For the composition of NW with NW, the result is indeed NW, as I've already shown through several different approaches. This is not just intuitive but is also formally justified.

Given the wording of the question, I believe it's asking about the possible relations between x and z given the constraints, which is indeed NW.

Let me check for each of the possible answers listed in the question: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

- North: Can region x be North of region z? No, because x is NW of y and y is NW of z, which means x is NW of z.
- Northeast: Can region x be Northeast of region z? No, for the same reason.
- Southeast: Can region x be Southeast of region z? No, for the same reason.
- South: Can region x be South of region z? No, for the same reason.
- East: Can region x be East of region z? No, for the same reason.
- Northwest: Can region x be Northwest of region z? Yes, as we've demonstrated.
- West: Can region x be West of region z? No, because x is NW of y and y is NW of z, which means x is NW of z.
- Southwest: Can region x be Southwest of region z? No, for the same reason.
- Bounding Box: Can region x be in the Bounding Box of region z? No, because x is NW of y and y is NW of z, which means x is NW of z.

So, the only possible relation between region x and region z is Northwest.

So here, I think my final answer is "Northwest", which means the only possible cardinal direction relation between regions x and z is the Northwest relation.

Nevermind, I think I was overthinking this. Let me do a quick check. Given that region x is Northwest of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, we want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Using transitive reasoning of the Northwest relation, region x is Northwest of region z. Hence, the answer is "Northwest".

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is:

Northwest
