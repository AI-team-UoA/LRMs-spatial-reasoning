PROMPT: Let  Northwest and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let me think about this problem step by step.

We have:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is North of region z

We need to determine what could be the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's think about the cardinal directions in terms of their spatial relationships. 
- North: A region that is directly above another
- Northwest: A region that is above and to the left of another
- Northeast: A region that is above and to the right of another
- East: A region that is directly to the right of another
- Southeast: A region that is below and to the right of another
- South: A region that is directly below another
- Southwest: A region that is below and to the left of another
- West: A region that is directly to the left of another

Now, let's try to visualize this. If x is Northwest of y, and y is North of z, let's place them on a grid:

If y is North of z, then y is directly above z.
If x is Northwest of y, then x is above and to the left of y.

So we have:
```
    x
   /
  y
  |
  z
```

Where x is Northwest of y, and y is North of z.

Now, the question is, what is the relationship between x and z?

x is Northwest of y, which means x is above and to the left of y.
y is North of z, which means y is directly above z.

So, x is above and to the left of y, and y is directly above z. This means x is above and to the left of z. 

The cardinal direction that represents "above and to the left" is Northwest. 

However, I need to be careful here. The description I gave is a simplistic view, and cardinal directions can be more complex when dealing with regions rather than points. But in the simplified model I used, the relation between x and z would be Northwest.

Actually, let me think more carefully about this. Cardinal directions can be more nuanced, and there might be multiple possible relations depending on how the regions are arranged.

Let's consider a more concrete example:

```
x
 \
  y
  |
  z
```

In this case, x is Northwest of y, and y is North of z. Now, what is the relation between x and z? It seems like it could be North or Northwest, depending on the exact positions.

Actually, wait, that picture doesn't properly show "Northwest". Let me redraw:

```
x
  \
   y
   |
   z
```

Now, if x is Northwest of y, and y is North of z, it seems like x could be Northwest or North of z, depending on the exact positions.

Let me see if I can be more precise about this. If we use coordinates, with North being the positive y-direction and West being the negative x-direction:

Suppose z is at (0, 0).
y is North of z, so y might be at (0, 1).
x is Northwest of y, so x might be at (-1, 2).

In this case, x is Northwest of z.

But what if:
z is at (0, 0).
y is North of z, so y might be at (0, 1).
x is Northwest of y, but only slightly to the West, so x might be at (-0.1, 2).

In this case, x is still slightly to the West of z, so it's Northwest of z, but it's almost directly North.

Hmm, let me think again. If region x is Northwest of region y, it means that x is entirely in the Northwest quadrant with respect to y. Similarly, if y is North of z, it means y is entirely in the North quadrant with respect to z.

Actually, let me reconsider using the direction algebra more carefully.

The composition of cardinal directions is a bit complex because they are relations between regions, not points. 

When we say "x is Northwest of y", we mean that every point in x is to the Northwest of every point in y. Similarly, when we say "y is North of z", we mean that every point in y is to the North of every point in z.

Now, if x is Northwest of y, and y is North of z, what does this tell us about the relation between x and z?

Well, every point in x is to the Northwest of every point in y, and every point in y is to the North of every point in z. 

If we consider the composition of these relations, we can see that every point in x is to the Northwest of some point in y, and that point is to the North of some point in z. 

This means that every point in x is to the Northwest or North of every point in z. So, the possible relations between x and z could be Northwest or North.

Actually, I'm still not being precise enough. Let me try a different approach.

Cardinal directions form a calculus where we can reason about the composition of relations. The composition of two cardinal directions gives us a set of possible directions that could hold between the first and third regions.

For the specific case of "Northwest ◦ North" (where ◦ denotes composition), the result is {Northwest, North}. This means that if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x could be either Northwest of region z or North of region z.

Actually, let me verify this once more to make sure I'm not missing anything.

If we consider the extreme cases:

Case 1: x is directly Northwest of y, and y is directly North of z. In this case, x is Northwest of z.

Case 2: x is barely Northwest of y (almost directly North), and y is directly North of z. In this case, x is very close to being directly North of z, but it's still slightly to the West, so it's Northwest of z.

So, based on these extreme cases, it seems like the relation between x and z could only be Northwest, not North. Let me double-check this.

Actually, I should be more careful in my reasoning. We're dealing with regions, not points. In the context of regions, if region x is Northwest of region y, it means that every point in x is to the Northwest of every point in y (or, more precisely, the minimum bounding rectangle of x is entirely within the Northwest quadrant of the minimum bounding rectangle of y).

With this understanding, if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then every point in x is to the Northwest of every point in y, and every point in y is to the North of every point in z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to consider all possible configurations of x, y, and z that satisfy the given constraints. Let's approach this by thinking about the range of possible positions for x relative to z.

If y is North of z, then y is directly above z. If x is Northwest of y, then x is above and to the left of y. Combining these, x is above and to the left of z, which means x is Northwest of z. Hmm, but what about North... could it be North of z as well? If it's directly above z, it would be North of z.

Okay, I think I might be overcomplicating things. Let's step back and think about the properties of cardinal directions more carefully. Cardinal directions can be defined in terms of the positions of the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions.

Let's denote the MBR of a region r as MBR(r).

If region x is Northwest of region y, then MBR(x) is entirely within the Northwest quadrant of MBR(y). This means that every point in MBR(x) is to the Northwest of every point in MBR(y).

Similarly, if region y is North of region z, then MBR(y) is entirely within the North quadrant of MBR(z). This means that every point in MBR(y) is to the North of every point in MBR(z).

Now, what does this tell us about the relation between x and z?

Well, MBR(x) is entirely within the Northwest quadrant of MBR(y), and MBR(y) is entirely within the North quadrant of MBR(z). 

This means that MBR(x) is entirely within the Northwest quadrant of MBR(z), since the Northwest quadrant of the North quadrant is a subset of the Northwest quadrant. 

So, if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

But wait, I was also thinking about whether it could be North. Let me think about that again.

If region x is Northwest of region y, it doesn't mean that x is to the left of y. It means x is to the left and above y. So, if x is Northwest of y, and y is North of z, then x is to the left and above z, which means x is Northwest of z, not North of z.

So, my conclusion is that if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Wait, let me do one more check to be sure.

Actually, I need to revise my thinking. When we reason about cardinal directions in a qualitative spatial reasoning context, we need to be careful about the composition of relations.

The composition of "Northwest ◦ North" (where ◦ denotes composition) gives us a set of possible directions that could hold between the first and third regions. It is actually {Northwest, North}.

To see why, consider the following scenarios:

1. Region x is Northwest of region y, but it's almost directly North (only slightly to the West). Region y is directly North of region z. In this case, region x is Northwest of region z, but it's very close to being directly North.

2. Region x is Northwest of region y, but it's very far to the West. Region y is directly North of region z. In this case, region x is clearly Northwest of region z.

3. And here's the case I was missing: Region x is very far to the Northwest of region y, and region y is directly North of region z. In this case, region x is so far to the Northwest that it's actually directly North of z.

Actually, I need to be more careful with scenario 3. If x is very far to the Northwest of y, and y is directly North of z, then x would still be to the Northwest of z, not directly North.

So, based on the compositions of cardinal directions, the possible relations between x and z are:

If region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Actually, let me step back once more and think about the compositions of cardinal directions even more carefully.

Ah, I see the issue. I've been implicitly assuming that the regions are points, which simplifies the reasoning. However, when dealing with regions, the composition of cardinal directions can be more complex.

For a more accurate answer, I should use the composition table for cardinal directions. According to the composition table for the cardinal direction calculus:

Northwest ◦ North = Northwest

This means that if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z. This is the only possible relation based on the given constraints.

Hold on, I need to double-check this composition result.

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me think once more about the cardinal directions in a more systematic way.

The cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) form a calculus where we can reason about the composition of relations. The composition of two cardinal directions gives us a set of possible directions that could hold between the first and third regions.

For the specific case of "Northwest ◦ North" (where ◦ denotes composition), I need to determine the result.

If region x is Northwest of region y, it means that the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest quadrant of the MBR of y. Similarly, if region y is North of region z, it means that the MBR of y is entirely within the North quadrant of the MBR of z.

Now, the Northwest quadrant of the North quadrant is a subset of the Northwest quadrant. Therefore, if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

So, the composition "Northwest ◦ North" results in {Northwest}.

But I need to be more careful about this. Let's try to think of a counterexample. Could there be a case where x is Northwest of y, y is North of z, but x is not Northwest of z but some other relation?

Actually, I don't think so. Because if x is Northwest of y, and y is North of z, then x is both north and west of z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Let me double-check this reasoning.

If x is Northwest of y, then x is North and West of y.
If y is North of z, then y is North of z.

Now, if x is North of y, and y is North of z, then x is North of z. And if x is West of y, then x is West of z. So, x is both North and West of z, which means x is Northwest of z.

Actually, let's be a bit more careful. If x is West of y, and y is North of z, it doesn't immediately follow that x is West of z. The relation could be Northwest or West, depending on the exact positions.

Let me try again. If region x is Northwest of region y, it means that the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest quadrant of the MBR of y. Similarly, if region y is North of region z, it means that the MBR of y is entirely within the North quadrant of the MBR of z.

Now, if the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest quadrant of the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is entirely within the North quadrant of the MBR of z, then the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest quadrant of the MBR of z.

So, if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Actually, you know what, maybe it's easier for me to just try to compose the directions using a picture. So I'll draw a 2D Cartesian grid. North is the positive y-direction, and West is the negative x-direction.

Suppose z is at the origin (0, 0).
y is North of z, so y is at (0, c) for some positive constant c. Let's say c = 1 for simplicity, so y is at (0, 1).
x is Northwest of y, so x is at (-a, 1+b) for some positive constants a and b. Let's say a = b = 1 for simplicity, so x is at (-1, 2).

Now, what is the relation between x and z? x is at (-1, 2) and z is at (0, 0). Clearly, x is Northwest of z.

But let's try to find a counterexample. Can we place x, y, and z such that x is Northwest of y, y is North of z, but x is not Northwest of z?

Let's try. Suppose again that z is at the origin (0, 0), and y is North of z at (0, 1). For x to be Northwest of y, it must be at (-a, 1+b) for some positive constants a and b. But then x is at (-a, 1+b) and z is at (0, 0), which means x is Northwest of z. So, it seems like there's no counterexample.

But wait, maybe I'm thinking about this incorrectly. What if the regions are not points but actually extend in space? Let's think about this differently. The cardinal directions can be defined using the 9-intersection model, where the space is divided into 9 tiles with respect to a region's MBR.

Actually, let me try to use a standard direction relation matrix to reason about this. Let me define the direction relation matrix for the 8 cardinal directions:

N = (0, 1)
NE = (1, 1)
E = (1, 0)
SE = (1, -1)
S = (0, -1)
SW = (-1, -1)
W = (-1, 0)
NW = (-1, 1)

Now, if x is NW of y, we can represent this as x = y + NW = y + (-1, 1).
If y is N of z, we can represent this as y = z + N = z + (0, 1).

Combining these, we get:
x = y + NW = (z + N) + NW = z + (N + NW) = z + ((0, 1) + (-1, 1)) = z + (-1, 2).

Now, (-1, 2) is in the NW quadrant, so x is NW of z.

Hmm, actually using this representation, the composition of North and Northwest would be (0, 1) + (-1, 1) = (-1, 2), which is in the Northwest quadrant. So the composition of North and Northwest is Northwest.

Actually, let me take a more general approach from the basics of qualitative spatial reasoning.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the composition of two cardinal directions gives us a set of possible directions that could hold between the first and third regions. For the specific case of "Northwest ◦ North" (where ◦ denotes composition), let's determine the result systematically.

If region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, we can determine the possible relations between x and z using the composition table for cardinal directions.

There are two widely used approaches for qualitative direction reasoning: the cone-based approach and the projection-based approach. I've been using the projection-based approach, which uses the MBRs of regions.

In the projection-based approach, the space around a region is divided into 9 tiles based on the MBR of the region: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the region itself (Bounding Box).

Now, let's think about the composition of Northwest and North.

If region x is Northwest of region y, it means that the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest tile of the MBR of y. Similarly, if region y is North of region z, it means that the MBR of y is entirely within the North tile of the MBR of z.

To determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to consider all possible positions of x given the constraints. Since y is North of z, and x is Northwest of y, x is both North and West of z. This means x is Northwest of z.

So, the composition of Northwest and North results in Northwest.

Actually, in the context of the problem, I think it's easier to think about it as a question about the cone-based approach. Here's how the cone-based approach defines cardinal directions:

North: 337.5° to 22.5°
Northeast: 22.5° to 67.5°
East: 67.5° to 112.5°
Southeast: 112.5° to 157.5°
South: 157.5° to 202.5°
Southwest: 202.5° to 247.5°
West: 247.5° to 292.5°
Northwest: 292.5° to 337.5°

So the Northwest direction corresponds to the angle range 292.5° to 337.5° (or -67.5° to -22.5° if we use the standard angle convention).

North corresponds to the angle range 337.5° to 22.5° (or -22.5° to 22.5°).

Now, let me compose these. 

If x is Northwest of y, then the angle from y to x is in the range 292.5° to 337.5°.
If y is North of z, then the angle from z to y is in the range 337.5° to 22.5°.

Now, the angle from z to x would be the vector addition of these angles. Let's see...

Actually, vector addition of angles is not straightforward, so let me try a different approach. We can use the vector representation of the directions.

North can be represented as the vector (0, 1).
Northwest can be represented as the vector (-1, 1).

If y is North of z, then the vector from z to y is (0, 1).
If x is Northwest of y, then the vector from y to x is (-1, 1).

The vector from z to x would be the sum of these vectors, which is (0, 1) + (-1, 1) = (-1, 2).

Now, I need to determine which direction the vector (-1, 2) corresponds to. The angle of this vector is arctan(2/(-1)) = arctan(-2) ≈ -63.4°. This is in the range -67.5° to -22.5°, which corresponds to the Northwest direction.

So, if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

OK, I've convinced myself that if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x is Northwest of region z.

Actually, let me make one very last check. Let me check that I haven't overlooked the case where x is North of z, rather than Northwest of z.

Suppose z is at (0, 0).
y is North of z, so y is at (0, 1).
For x to be Northwest of y, it must be at (-a, 1+b) for some positive constants a and b.

Now, for x to be North of z, it must be directly above z, which means its x-coordinate must be 0. However, for x to be Northwest of y, its x-coordinate must be less than 0. These two conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously.

So, if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x cannot be North of region z. The only possible relation is Northwest.

Wait, I think I might have been confused about something. The cardinal directions in spatial reasoning can be defined in different ways. Let me make sure I understand the definitions correctly.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the directions North, Northeast, East, etc. are defined based on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. Specifically, the space around the MBR of a region is divided into 9 tiles: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the region itself (Bounding Box).

So, when we say "region x is Northwest of region y", we mean that the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest tile of the MBR of y. Similarly, when we say "region y is North of region z", we mean that the MBR of y is entirely within the North tile of the MBR of z.

Now, let's reason about the composition of these directions.

If region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, we can visualize this as follows:

1. The MBR of y is entirely within the North tile of the MBR of z.
2. The MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest tile of the MBR of y.

Let's denote the MBRs of x, y, and z as MBR(x), MBR(y), and MBR(z), respectively.

From (1), we know that MBR(y) is entirely above MBR(z), and the projection of MBR(y) onto the x-axis overlaps with the projection of MBR(z) onto the x-axis.

From (2), we know that MBR(x) is entirely above and to the left of MBR(y).

Combining these, we can say that MBR(x) is entirely above MBR(z) (because it's above MBR(y), which is above MBR(z)), and it's entirely to the left of MBR(y).

But is MBR(x) entirely to the left of MBR(z)? Not necessarily. It depends on the exact positions of the MBRs. If the projection of MBR(y) onto the x-axis extends far to the left of the projection of MBR(z) onto the x-axis, and MBR(x) is only slightly to the left of MBR(y), then the projection of MBR(x) onto the x-axis might still overlap with the projection of MBR(z) onto the x-axis. In this case, region x would be North of region z, not Northwest.

Ah, I see. The composition of Northwest and North could result in either Northwest or North, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

OK, I realized that I'm making a subtle error in my reasoning. In the cardinal direction calculus, the directions are defined based on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. The space around the MBR of a region is divided into 9 tiles: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the region itself (Same).

When we say "region x is Northwest of region y", we mean that the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest tile of the MBR of y. Similarly, when we say "region y is North of region z", we mean that the MBR of y is entirely within the North tile of the MBR of z.

Now, let's reason about the composition of these directions. I'll use a different notation to make it clearer.

Let's define the regions as a, b, and c, where a is Northwest of b, and b is North of c. We want to know the possible relations between a and c.

Using NW and N to denote the Northwest and North relations, we have:
a NW b and b N c, and we want to know a ? c.

For a to be Northwest of b, it means that the MBR of a is entirely within the Northwest tile of the MBR of b. This means that the MBR of a is entirely above and to the left of the MBR of b.

For b to be North of c, it means that the MBR of b is entirely within the North tile of the MBR of c. This means that the MBR of b is entirely above the MBR of c, and the projections of the MBRs of b and c onto the x-axis overlap.

Now, since the MBR of a is entirely above the MBR of b, and the MBR of b is entirely above the MBR of c, the MBR of a is entirely above the MBR of c.

Since the MBR of a is entirely to the left of the MBR of b, and the MBR of b has an overlap with the MBR of c when projected onto the x-axis, the MBR of a could be either entirely to the left of the MBR of c, or it could have an overlap with the MBR of c when projected onto the x-axis. In the first case, a would be Northwest of c. In the second case, a would be North of c.

So, the composition of Northwest and North could result in either Northwest or North, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Actually, hold on. I need to be precise when I say "the projection of the MBR of region a onto the x-axis overlaps with the projection of the MBR of region c onto the x-axis."

Scenario 1: If region a is so far to the left that the projection of its MBR onto the x-axis is completely to the left of the projection of the MBR of region c onto the x-axis, then region a is Northwest of region c.

Scenario 2: If the projections of the MBRs of regions a and c onto the x-axis overlap, then region a is North of region c.

I need to check if both of these scenarios are possible given that a is Northwest of b, and b is North of c. 

OK, let me think step by step, again. But let me change my notation to make it clearer.

Let's define the regions as a, b, and c, where a is Northwest of b, and b is North of c. We want to know the possible relations between a and c.

I'll use a diagram to help me understand the constraints, where I'm marking the corners of the MBRs of the regions a, b, and c.

For region a to be Northwest of region b, the MBR of a must be entirely above and to the left of the MBR of b. Let's say the MBR of a is defined by the points (a_left, a_bottom) and (a_right, a_top), and the MBR of b is defined by the points (b_left, b_bottom) and (b_right, b_top).

For a to be Northwest of b, we must have:
a_right < b_left (a is to the left of b)
a_bottom > b_top (a is above b)

Similarly, for region b to be North of region c, the MBR of b must be entirely above the MBR of c, and the projections of the MBRs of b and c onto the x-axis must overlap. Let's say the MBR of c is defined by the points (c_left, c_bottom) and (c_right, c_top).

For b to be North of c, we must have:
b_bottom > c_top (b is above c)
b_left < c_right (the right edge of c is to the right of the left edge of b)
b_right > c_left (the left edge of c is to the left of the right edge of b)

The last two conditions ensure that the projections of the MBRs of b and c onto the x-axis overlap.

Now, from these constraints, what can we infer about the relationship between a and c?

We know:
a_right < b_left (a is to the left of b)
a_bottom > b_top (a is above b)
b_bottom > c_top (b is above c)
b_left < c_right (the right edge of c is to the right of the left edge of b)
b_right > c_left (the left edge of c is to the left of the right edge of b)

From these, we can infer:
a_bottom > b_top > c_top (a is above c) - This is because a is above b, and b is above c. So a is North of c.

But what about the east-west relationship?

We know that a is to the left of b (a_right < b_left), but b and c overlap in the east-west direction. So, a could be to the left of c, or it could overlap with c in the east-west direction.

If a is to the left of c (a_right < c_left), then a is Northwest of c.
If a overlaps with c in the east-west direction (a_right > c_left and a_left < c_right), then a is North of c.

Both of these scenarios are possible.

Let me check with a specific example.

Let's set some specific values:

For region c, let's say the MBR is defined by the points (0, 0) and (10, 10). So c_left = 0, c_bottom = 0, c_right = 10, c_top = 10.

For region b to be North of c, its MBR must be entirely above c, and the projections of the MBRs of b and c onto the x-axis must overlap. Let's set b_left = 2, b_bottom = 15, b_right = 8, b_top = 20. With these values, b is North of c because b is entirely above c (b_bottom = 15 > c_top = 10), and the projections of b and c onto the x-axis overlap (b_left = 2 < c_right = 10 and b_right = 8 > c_left = 0).

Now, for region a to be Northwest of b, its MBR must be entirely above and to the left of b. 

Scenario 1: Let's set a_left = -5, a_bottom = 25, a_right = 0, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = 0 < b_left = 2). In this case, a is also to the left of c (a_right = 0 < c_left = 0), so a is Northwest of c.

Scenario 2: Let's set a_left = -5, a_bottom = 25, a_right = 5, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = 5 < b_left = 2). In this case, a overlaps with c in the east-west direction (a_right = 5 > c_left = 0 and a_left = -5 < c_right = 10), so a is North of c.

So, both scenarios are possible. If region a is Northwest of region b, and region b is North of region c, then region a could be either Northwest of region c or North of region c.

Let me triple-check this. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let's ensure that a is Northwest of b and b is North of c.

For region c, let's say the MBR is defined by the points (0, 0) and (10, 10). So c_left = 0, c_bottom = 0, c_right = 10, c_top = 10.

For region b to be North of c, its MBR must be entirely above c, and the projections of the MBRs of b and c onto the x-axis must overlap. Let's set b_left = 2, b_bottom = 15, b_right = 8, b_top = 20. With these values, b is North of c because b is entirely above c (b_bottom = 15 > c_top = 10), and the projections of b and c onto the x-axis overlap (b_left = 2 < c_right = 10 and b_right = 8 > c_left = 0).

Now, for region a to be Northwest of b, its MBR must be entirely above and to the left of b. Let's set a_left = -5, a_bottom = 25, a_right = 1, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = 1 < b_left = 2).

Now, what is the relationship between a and c? a is entirely above c (a_bottom = 25 > c_top = 10). The projections of a and c onto the x-axis overlap because a_right = 1 > c_left = 0 and a_left = -5 < c_right = 10. So, a is North of c.

So, it is indeed possible for a to be North of c. Let me check if it's possible for a to be Northwest of c.

For a to be Northwest of c, a must be entirely above and to the left of c. For a to be entirely to the left of c, we must have a_right < c_left, which means a_right < 0.

Let's set a_left = -10, a_bottom = 25, a_right = -1, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = -1 < b_left = 2). a is also entirely to the left of c (a_right = -1 < c_left = 0), so a is Northwest of c.

So, both scenarios are possible. If region a is Northwest of region b, and region b is North of region c, then region a could be either Northwest of region c or North of region c.

Wait, in my Scenario 1, I set a_right to be 0 and c_left to be 0. So a_right is equal to c_left, not less than c_left. Let's correct this.

For a to be Northwest of c, a must be entirely above and to the left of c. For a to be entirely to the left of c, we must have a_right < c_left, which means a_right < 0.

Let's set a_left = -10, a_bottom = 25, a_right = -1, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = -1 < b_left = 2). a is also entirely to the left of c (a_right = -1 < c_left = 0), so a is Northwest of c.

Scenario 2 was correct, I believe: a_left = -5, a_bottom = 25, a_right = 5, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = 5 < b_left = 2).

Wait, I still made an error. For a to be Northwest of b, we need a_right < b_left, but I set a_right = 5 and b_left = 2, which doesn't satisfy this condition. Let me be more careful.

For region c, let's say the MBR is defined by the points (0, 0) and (10, 10). So c_left = 0, c_bottom = 0, c_right = 10, c_top = 10.

For region b to be North of c, its MBR must be entirely above c, and the projections of the MBRs of b and c onto the x-axis must overlap. Let's set b_left = 2, b_bottom = 15, b_right = 8, b_top = 20. With these values, b is North of c because b is entirely above c (b_bottom = 15 > c_top = 10), and the projections of b and c onto the x-axis overlap (b_left = 2 < c_right = 10 and b_right = 8 > c_left = 0).

Now, for region a to be Northwest of b, its MBR must be entirely above and to the left of b. Let's set a_left = -5, a_bottom = 25, a_right = 1, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = 1 < b_left = 2).

Now, what is the relationship between a and c? a is entirely above c (a_bottom = 25 > c_top = 10). The projections of a and c onto the x-axis overlap because a_right = 1 > c_left = 0 and a_left = -5 < c_right = 10. So, a is North of c.

So, it is indeed possible for a to be North of c. Let me check if it's possible for a to be Northwest of c.

For a to be Northwest of c, a must be entirely above and to the left of c. For a to be entirely to the left of c, we must have a_right < c_left, which means a_right < 0.

Let's set a_left = -10, a_bottom = 25, a_right = -1, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = -1 < b_left = 2). a is also entirely to the left of c (a_right = -1 < c_left = 0), so a is Northwest of c.

So, both scenarios are possible. If region a is Northwest of region b, and region b is North of region c, then region a could be either Northwest of region c or North of region c.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful. When we define "a is Northwest of b", we're saying that a is both above and to the left of b. Similarly, for "b is North of c", we're saying b is directly above c. I believe the correct compositional reasoning is:

1. If a is Northwest of b, and b is North of c, then a is Northwest of c.

Let me verify this with an example.

For region c, let's say the MBR is defined by the points (0, 0) and (10, 10). So c_left = 0, c_bottom = 0, c_right = 10, c_top = 10.

For region b to be North of c, its MBR must be entirely above c, and the projections of the MBRs of b and c onto the x-axis must overlap. Let's set b_left = 2, b_bottom = 15, b_right = 8, b_top = 20. With these values, b is North of c because b is entirely above c (b_bottom = 15 > c_top = 10), and the projections of b and c onto the x-axis overlap (b_left = 2 < c_right = 10 and b_right = 8 > c_left = 0).

Now, for region a to be Northwest of b, its MBR must be entirely above and to the left of b. Let's set a_left = -5, a_bottom = 25, a_right = 1, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = 1 < b_left = 2).

Now, what is the relationship between a and c? a is entirely above c (a_bottom = 25 > c_top = 10). But a is not entirely to the left of c (a_right = 1 > c_left = 0). So, a is not Northwest of c; it's North of c.

Let me try a different configuration to check if a could be Northwest of c.

Let's set c_left = 5, c_bottom = 0, c_right = 15, c_top = 10. For region b to be North of c, let's set b_left = 7, b_bottom = 15, b_right = 13, b_top = 20. With these values, b is North of c because b is entirely above c (b_bottom = 15 > c_top = 10), and the projections of b and c onto the x-axis overlap (b_left = 7 < c_right = 15 and b_right = 13 > c_left = 5).

For region a to be Northwest of b, let's set a_left = 0, a_bottom = 25, a_right = 6, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b because a is entirely above b (a_bottom = 25 > b_top = 20) and entirely to the left of b (a_right = 6 < b_left = 7).

Now, what is the relationship between a and c? a is entirely above c (a_bottom = 25 > c_top = 10). But a is not entirely to the left of c (a_right = 6 > c_left = 5). So, a is not Northwest of c; it's North of c.

Actually, in my example, let's try a different configuration. For c, let's say the MBR is defined by the points (5, 0) and (15, 10). For b to be North of c, let's set b_left = 7, b_bottom = 15, b_right = 13, b_top = 20. With these values, b is North of c.

For a to be Northwest of b, let's set a_left = 0, a_bottom = 25, a_right = 4, a_top = 30. With these values, a is Northwest of b. Now, a is entirely to the left of c (a_right = 4 < c_left = 5), so a is Northwest of c.

So, both scenarios are possible. If region a is Northwest of region b, and region b is North of region c, then region a could be either Northwest of region c or North of region c.

Hmm, this is still a bit confusing, let's try again.

Actually, I keep getting confused with the picture. Let me visualize it differently. I think of it in terms of the 9-intersection model for cardinal directions. Given a region y, the space is divided into 9 tiles: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the region itself (Bounding Box). Each tile is defined by the MBR of y.

When we say "region x is Northwest of region y", we mean that the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest tile of the MBR of y. Similarly, when we say "region y is North of region z", we mean that the MBR of y is entirely within the North tile of the MBR of z.

OK, so if region y is North of region z, we have:

```
    +-------+
    |   y   |
    +-------+
        |
+---------------+
|       z       |
+---------------+
```

And since x is Northwest of y, we have:

```
+-------+
|   x   |
+-------+
    \
    +-------+
    |   y   |
    +-------+
```

So, the picture is:

```
+-------+
|   x   |
+-------+
    \
    +-------+
    |   y   |
    +-------+
        |
+---------------+
|       z       |
+---------------+
```

Now, what is the relation between x and z? It depends on the exact positions of the regions. If the projection of x onto the x-axis is entirely to the left of the projection of z onto the x-axis, then x is Northwest of z. If the projections overlap, then x is North of z.

Both scenarios are possible. Therefore, if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x could be either Northwest of region z or North of region z.

Oh wait, I think there's a third possibility. If the MBR of x is very far to the left, it might fall within the West tile of the MBR of z. In this case, x would be West of z.

Nope, that can't be. If x is Northwest of y, then x is above y. And if y is North of z, then y is above z. So, x is above z. Therefore, x cannot be West of z, because the West tile is neither above nor below the reference region.

OK, so just North and Northwest are the possibilities. Let me double-check my reasoning by looking at a composition table for cardinal directions. In the composition table for the cardinal direction calculus, what is the composition of Northwest and North?

According to the composition table I've learned, the composition of Northwest and North is indeed {Northwest, North}.

So, if region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x could be either Northwest of region z or North of region z.

OK great. So the relationship between region x and region z could be either North or Northwest.

Hmm, let me just quickly double-check the definition of "region x is Northwest of region y". I might have made an error. Let me refer to a more formal definition.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the directions are defined based on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. The space around the MBR of a region is divided into 9 tiles: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the region itself (Bounding Box).

When we say "region x is Northwest of region y", we mean that the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest tile of the MBR of y. Similarly, when we say "region y is North of region z", we mean that the MBR of y is entirely within the North tile of the MBR of z.

OK, let me just verify one last time that the composition of NW and N could be either NW or N, by running through some examples.

Example 1: Let's say the MBR of z is at (0, 0) to (10, 10), the MBR of y is at (2, 15) to (8, 20) (so y is North of z), and the MBR of x is at (-5, 25) to (1, 30) (so x is Northwest of y). In this case, the MBR of x is at (-5, 25) to (1, 30), and the MBR of z is at (0, 0) to (10, 10). So, the projection of x onto the x-axis is (-5, 1), and the projection of z onto the x-axis is (0, 10). These projections overlap, so x is North of z.

Example 2: Let's say the MBR of z is at (5, 0) to (15, 10), the MBR of y is at (7, 15) to (13, 20) (so y is North of z), and the MBR of x is at (0, 25) to (4, 30) (so x is Northwest of y). In this case, the MBR of x is at (0, 25) to (4, 30), and the MBR of z is at (5, 0) to (15, 10). So, the projection of x onto the x-axis is (0, 4), and the projection of z onto the x-axis is (5, 15). These projections do not overlap, and x is to the left of z, so x is Northwest of z.

So, based on these examples, the composition of Northwest and North could result in either Northwest or North, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

OK great. So the relationship between region x and region z could be either North or Northwest.

Let me check one more thing, when we say "region x is Northwest of region y", do we mean that the entirety of x is in the Northwest tile of y? Or just that there's some overlap?

Actually, in cardinal direction calculus, the directions are defined based on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. When we say "region x is Northwest of region y", we mean that the MBR of x is entirely within the Northwest tile of the MBR of y.

So, my reasoning was correct. If region x is Northwest of region y, and region y is North of region z, then region x could be either Northwest of region z or North of region z.

My final answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are North and Northwest.

ANSWER:

Looking at the composition of Northwest and North:

If region x is Northwest of region y, then x is above and to the left of y.
If region y is North of region z, then y is directly above z.

When we combine these relations, region x must be above region z (because it's above y, which is above z). For the east-west relationship:

- If x is far enough to the left that it doesn't overlap with z on the east-west axis, then x is Northwest of z
- If x's east-west extent overlaps with z, then x is North of z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- North
- Northwest
