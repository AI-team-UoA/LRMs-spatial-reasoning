PROMPT: Let  South and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

We have the following:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Northwest of region z

Let's set up a coordinate system where:
- North is the positive y-direction
- South is the negative y-direction
- East is the positive x-direction
- West is the negative x-direction

Now, let's think about what these cardinal relations mean in terms of coordinates:

- If x is South of y, then x has a lower y-coordinate than y.
- If y is Northwest of z, then y has a higher y-coordinate than z AND y has a lower x-coordinate than z.

From these two facts:
1. x has a lower y-coordinate than y
2. y has a higher y-coordinate than z

We can deduce that:
- x may have a lower y-coordinate than z (South of z)
- x may have a higher y-coordinate than z (North of z)
- x may have the same y-coordinate as z

We also know:
- y has a lower x-coordinate than z

But we don't know how the x-coordinates of x and z compare. So x could be:
- West of z (lower x-coordinate)
- East of z (higher x-coordinate)
- Same x-coordinate as z

Let me try to be more precise by drawing this out. 

If z is at the origin (0,0), then y is in the Northwest quadrant relative to z, so y has coordinates (-a, b) where a and b are positive numbers.

Now, x is South of y, so x has coordinates (-a, b-c) where c is positive.

So x is at (-a, b-c) and z is at (0,0).

Comparing x and z:
- In the x-direction: x is at -a, z is at 0, so x is West of z (since -a < 0)
- In the y-direction: x is at b-c, z is at 0
  - If b-c > 0, then x is North of z
  - If b-c < 0, then x is South of z
  - If b-c = 0, then x and z have the same y-coordinate

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if b-c > 0)
- West (if b-c = 0)
- Southwest (if b-c < 0)

Wait, I realize I made a mistake in my thinking. Let me try again with a different approach.

In cardinal direction relations, we typically divide the plane into 9 regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and same location.

Let's use relative coordinates for clarity. If we place z at the origin (0,0), then because y is Northwest of z, y must be in the Northwest quadrant, so y has coordinates (-a, b) where a and b are positive.

Now, x is South of y, which means x has the same x-coordinate as y but a lower y-coordinate. So x has coordinates (-a, b-c) where c is positive and b-c could be positive, zero, or negative.

So x is at (-a, b-c) and z is at (0,0).

Comparing their coordinates:
- x-coordinate of x: -a
- x-coordinate of z: 0
- y-coordinate of x: b-c
- y-coordinate of z: 0

Since -a < 0, x is West of z.
For the y-coordinate:
- If b-c > 0, then x is North of z
- If b-c = 0, then x has the same y-coordinate as z
- If b-c < 0, then x is South of z

Combining these:
- If b-c > 0, then x is Northwest of z
- If b-c = 0, then x is West of z
- If b-c < 0, then x is Southwest of z

Hmm, actually let's think more carefully. "South of" doesn't mean "directly south" but rather "in a southerly direction". So if x is South of y, it means x has a lower y-coordinate than y, but their x-coordinates might be different.

Let's try again:

If y is Northwest of z, we know that y has a lower x-coordinate and a higher y-coordinate than z.

If x is South of y, we know that x has a lower y-coordinate than y, but we don't know how their x-coordinates compare.

So if z is at (0,0), then y is at (-a, b) for positive a and b, and x is at some point (c, d) where d < b. The value of c could be anything relative to -a.

Let's compare the coordinates of x and z:
- x-coordinate of x: c
- x-coordinate of z: 0
- y-coordinate of x: d
- y-coordinate of z: 0

For the x-coordinate:
- If c < 0, then x is West of z
- If c = 0, then x has the same x-coordinate as z
- If c > 0, then x is East of z

For the y-coordinate:
- If d > 0, then x is North of z
- If d = 0, then x has the same y-coordinate as z
- If d < 0, then x is South of z

Actually, I still have a conceptual issue in how I'm thinking about this. Let me approach it differently. The cardinal directions define regions in the plane.

If z is at the origin (0,0):
- North of z means the region y > 0, x = 0
- Northeast of z means the region y > 0, x > 0
- East of z means the region y = 0, x > 0
- Southeast of z means the region y < 0, x > 0
- South of z means the region y < 0, x = 0
- Southwest of z means the region y < 0, x < 0
- West of z means the region y = 0, x < 0
- Northwest of z means the region y > 0, x < 0

No, this is still not correct. Let me try to be more precise.

In the context of cardinal direction relations for regions, "South" typically means "in a southerly direction", not just "directly south". Same for the other directions.

So if z is at the origin (0,0):
- North of z means the region y > 0, any x
- Northeast of z means the region y > 0, x > 0
- East of z means the region any y, x > 0
- Southeast of z means the region y < 0, x > 0
- South of z means the region y < 0, any x
- Southwest of z means the region y < 0, x < 0
- West of z means the region any y, x < 0
- Northwest of z means the region y > 0, x < 0

Hmm, but this isn't right either because these regions overlap.

Let me try a different approach. In cardinal direction relations for regions, we typically partition the plane into 9 tiles based on the bounding box of the reference region. For a region z, the 9 tiles are:

- Northwest of z: x < min_x(z) and y > max_y(z)
- North of z: min_x(z) <= x <= max_x(z) and y > max_y(z)
- Northeast of z: x > max_x(z) and y > max_y(z)
- West of z: x < min_x(z) and min_y(z) <= y <= max_y(z)
- Same as z: min_x(z) <= x <= max_x(z) and min_y(z) <= y <= max_y(z)
- East of z: x > max_x(z) and min_y(z) <= y <= max_y(z)
- Southwest of z: x < min_x(z) and y < min_y(z)
- South of z: min_x(z) <= x <= max_x(z) and y < min_y(z)
- Southeast of z: x > max_x(z) and y < min_y(z)

Ok, now let's apply this to our problem:

Given:
- x is South of y
- y is Northwest of z

We know that:
- x is in the region: min_x(y) <= x_x <= max_x(y) and y_x < min_y(y)
- y is in the region: x_y < min_x(z) and y_y > max_y(z)

From these, can we determine the relationship between x and z?

If y is Northwest of z, then y_y > max_y(z) and x_y < min_x(z).

If x is South of y, then y_x < min_y(y) and min_x(y) <= x_x <= max_x(y).

So, we know:
- y_x < min_y(y)
- y_y > max_y(z)

But this doesn't tell us how y_x compares to max_y(z), so we can't determine if x is North of z, South of z, or at the same latitude as z.

Also, we know:
- min_x(y) <= x_x <= max_x(y)
- x_y < min_x(z)

But this doesn't tell us how x_x compares to min_x(z) or max_x(z), so we can't determine if x is East of z, West of z, or at the same longitude as z.

Actually, let's simplify our approach. Let's consider points instead of regions, and later we can generalize. This is because the definitions for regions are more complex and involve min and max coordinates, while points are simpler.

For points, the cardinal relations are:
- North: y_1 > y_2 and x_1 = x_2
- Northeast: y_1 > y_2 and x_1 > x_2
- East: y_1 = y_2 and x_1 > x_2
- Southeast: y_1 < y_2 and x_1 > x_2
- South: y_1 < y_2 and x_1 = x_2
- Southwest: y_1 < y_2 and x_1 < x_2
- West: y_1 = y_2 and x_1 < x_2
- Northwest: y_1 > y_2 and x_1 < x_2

Hmm, I still don't think we're on the right track. Let's try to simplify and think about the direction relation matrix, which is a more formal way to represent cardinal direction relations.

Actually, wait. I think our mistake was thinking of "South" as a very narrow region directly below a point. In reality, "South" means "in a southerly direction", which is a half-plane below the reference point.

So, if we think of the 8 cardinal directions as dividing the plane into 8 sectors (plus the reference point), then:

- North: y > 0, x = 0
- Northeast: y > 0, x > 0
- East: y = 0, x > 0
- Southeast: y < 0, x > 0
- South: y < 0, x = 0
- Southwest: y < 0, x < 0
- West: y = 0, x < 0
- Northwest: y > 0, x < 0

Actually, this is not right either. I'm getting confused with different definitions.

Let's use a more standard definition. Given a reference point (0, 0), the cardinal directions are usually defined as follows:

- North: y > 0, |y| > |x|
- Northeast: x > 0, y > 0, |x| = |y|
- East: x > 0, |x| > |y|
- Southeast: x > 0, y < 0, |x| = |y|
- South: y < 0, |y| > |x|
- Southwest: x < 0, y < 0, |x| = |y|
- West: x < 0, |x| > |y|
- Northwest: x < 0, y > 0, |x| = |y|

Hmm, but this doesn't seem to fit our situation.

Actually wait, in the context of cardinal direction relations, I now recall that "South" of a region means the entire half-plane below that region, not just the strip directly below it. Similarly, "Northwest" means the quadrant to the northwest of the region.

So if z is at the origin (0,0):
- North of z: y > 0, -ε < x < ε for some small ε
- Northeast of z: y > 0, x > 0
- East of z: -ε < y < ε, x > 0 for some small ε
- Southeast of z: y < 0, x > 0
- South of z: y < 0, -ε < x < ε for some small ε
- Southwest of z: y < 0, x < 0
- West of z: -ε < y < ε, x < 0 for some small ε
- Northwest of z: y > 0, x < 0

But I'm still not satisfied with this definition.

Ok, actually let's use a standard definition from literature. The cardinal direction relations are often defined using the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the reference region. If z is the reference region, the plane is divided into 9 tiles: the MBR of z itself and 8 surrounding regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

Given this:
- If x is South of y, it means x is in the South tile of y.
- If y is Northwest of z, it means y is in the Northwest tile of z.

Now, let's think about what this means for the relationship between x and z.

If z is at the origin (0,0) with an MBR of size 1x1 (from -0.5 to 0.5 in both dimensions), the 9 tiles are:

- Northwest of z: x < -0.5, y > 0.5
- North of z: -0.5 <= x <= 0.5, y > 0.5
- Northeast of z: x > 0.5, y > 0.5
- West of z: x < -0.5, -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
- z itself: -0.5 <= x <= 0.5, -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
- East of z: x > 0.5, -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
- Southwest of z: x < -0.5, y < -0.5
- South of z: -0.5 <= x <= 0.5, y < -0.5
- Southeast of z: x > 0.5, y < -0.5

Now, if y is in the Northwest tile of z, y has coordinates (x_y, y_y) where x_y < -0.5 and y_y > 0.5.

If x is in the South tile of y, we need to define the 9 tiles around y. The MBR of y might have any shape, but for simplicity, let's say it's a 1x1 square centered at (x_y, y_y). Then, the South tile of y is the region:

(x_y - 0.5) <= x <= (x_y + 0.5), y < (y_y - 0.5)

So, x has coordinates (x_x, y_x) where (x_y - 0.5) <= x_x <= (x_y + 0.5) and y_x < (y_y - 0.5).

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we need to see which of the 9 tiles around z contains x.

We know:
- x_y < -0.5 (from y is Northwest of z)
- y_y > 0.5 (from y is Northwest of z)
- (x_y - 0.5) <= x_x <= (x_y + 0.5) (from x is South of y)
- y_x < (y_y - 0.5) (from x is South of y)

From these, we can deduce:
- x_x <= (x_y + 0.5) < (-0.5 + 0.5) = 0, so x_x < 0. This means x is to the West of the y-axis.
- Since y_y > 0.5, we have (y_y - 0.5) > 0. Since y_x < (y_y - 0.5), we know y_x < 0 or y_x > 0, so we can't determine if x is to the North or South of the x-axis.

Based on these, x could be in the West, Northwest, or Southwest tile of z.

Actually, hold on. I made a mistake. If y_y > 0.5, and y_x < (y_y - 0.5), then y_x < 0 doesn't necessarily follow. We know y_x < (y_y - 0.5), but since y_y could be any value greater than 0.5, we can't determine if y_x is positive or negative without more information.

Let me think about this problem differently.

Given:
- x is South of y
- y is Northwest of z

Using the standard cardinal direction calculus, we can compose these relations to get the possible relations between x and z.

The composition table for cardinal directions is complex, but for our specific case:

South composed with Northwest can be: West, Northwest, or Southwest.

Actually, I'm having a hard time with the exact composition table. Let me reason through this step by step.

If y is Northwest of z, then y is in the region: x_y < min_x(z) and y_y > max_y(z).

If x is South of y, then x is in the region: min_x(y) <= x_x <= max_x(y) and y_x < min_y(y).

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, we need to see where x falls in relation to z's boundaries.

For the x-coordinate:
- We know x_y < min_x(z).
- And min_x(y) <= x_x <= max_x(y).
- The maximum value of max_x(y) is min_x(z) (since y is strictly Northwest of z).
- So, x_x <= max_x(y) <= min_x(z).
- This means x is to the West of z (x_x < min_x(z)).

For the y-coordinate:
- We know y_y > max_y(z).
- And y_x < min_y(y).
- The minimum value of min_y(y) is max_y(z) (since y is strictly Northwest of z).
- So, y_x < min_y(y) >= max_y(z).

Now, this doesn't give us a definitive relationship between y_x and max_y(z) or min_y(z). So, x could be to the North of z (y_x > max_y(z)), to the South of z (y_x < min_y(z)), or within the same y-range as z (min_y(z) <= y_x <= max_y(z)).

Combining these, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- West (if x is within the same y-range as z)
- Northwest (if x is to the North of z)
- Southwest (if x is to the South of z)

Actually, wait. I want to be more careful about this reasoning.

Let's say:
- z has MBR coordinates (min_x(z), min_y(z), max_x(z), max_y(z)).
- y has MBR coordinates (min_x(y), min_y(y), max_x(y), max_y(y)).
- x has MBR coordinates (min_x(x), min_y(x), max_x(x), max_y(x)).

Given:
- y is Northwest of z, which means max_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(y) > max_y(z).
- x is South of y, which means min_x(x) >= min_x(y), max_x(x) <= max_x(y), and max_y(x) < min_y(y).

From these, we can derive:
- max_x(x) <= max_x(y) < min_x(z), which means x is to the West of z.
- max_y(x) < min_y(y) and min_y(y) > max_y(z), which means max_y(x) < min_y(y) > max_y(z).

From the last inequality, we can't determine the relationship between max_y(x) and max_y(z) without more information. So, x could be to the North of z (min_y(x) > max_y(z)), to the South of z (max_y(x) < min_y(z)), or overlap with z in the y-dimension (some part of x's y-range falls within z's y-range).

Combining these, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- West (if x overlaps with z in the y-dimension)
- Northwest (if x is to the North of z)
- Southwest (if x is to the South of z)

Actually wait I keep repeating myself. Let me take a step back and try to solve this problem differently.

So "West" is defined as "to the left", "North" is defined as "above", etc. Formally speaking, if z is at the origin, then the cardinal directions are defined as:
- North of z: y > 0, x = 0
- Northeast of z: y > 0, x > 0
- East of z: y = 0, x > 0
- Southeast of z: y < 0, x > 0
- South of z: y < 0, x = 0
- Southwest of z: y < 0, x < 0
- West of z: y = 0, x < 0
- Northwest of z: y > 0, x < 0

Actually I think my above definition is not right, because it only covers the axes and the 45-degree diagonal lines. Let me try again.

If z is at the origin, then the cardinal directions are defined as regions:
- North of z: y > 0, -b < x < b (a strip above z)
- Northeast of z: y > 0, x > 0 (the first quadrant)
- East of z: -b < y < b, x > 0 (a strip to the right of z)
- Southeast of z: y < 0, x > 0 (the fourth quadrant)
- South of z: y < 0, -b < x < b (a strip below z)
- Southwest of z: y < 0, x < 0 (the third quadrant)
- West of z: -b < y < b, x < 0 (a strip to the left of z)
- Northwest of z: y > 0, x < 0 (the second quadrant)

where b is some constant. Actually, this is still not consistent with the standard definition.

Let's simplify and just use the 9-tile model, which is a standard approach. In this model, the space is divided into 9 regions: the 8 cardinal directions and the reference region itself. For a point, the reference region is just the point itself; for a region, it's the MBR.

So, if z is at the origin (0,0) with an MBR of size 1x1 (from -0.5 to 0.5 in both dimensions), the 9 tiles are:

- Northwest of z: x < -0.5, y > 0.5
- North of z: -0.5 <= x <= 0.5, y > 0.5
- Northeast of z: x > 0.5, y > 0.5
- West of z: x < -0.5, -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
- z itself: -0.5 <= x <= 0.5, -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
- East of z: x > 0.5, -0.5 <= y <= 0.5
- Southwest of z: x < -0.5, y < -0.5
- South of z: -0.5 <= x <= 0.5, y < -0.5
- Southeast of z: x > 0.5, y < -0.5

Now, given:
- x is South of y
- y is Northwest of z

Let's determine the relationship between x and z.

If y is Northwest of z, y lies in the region where y_y > max_y(z) and x_y < min_x(z).

If x is South of y, x lies in the region where y_x < min_y(y) and min_x(y) <= x_x <= max_x(y).

Combining these:
- Since x_y < min_x(z) and x_x <= max_x(y), we have x_x < min_x(z), which means x is to the West of z.
- Since y_y > max_y(z) and y_x < min_y(y), we have y_x < min_y(y). But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between y_x and max_y(z) or min_y(z).

One key thing to note is that since y is Northwest of z, min_y(y) > max_y(z). And since x is South of y, max_y(x) < min_y(y). From these two, we have max_y(x) < min_y(y) > max_y(z). But this doesn't tell us the direct relationship between max_y(x) and max_y(z).

So, based on the 9-tile model, x can be:
- West of z (if min_y(z) <= max_y(x) and min_y(x) <= max_y(z))
- Northwest of z (if min_y(x) > max_y(z))
- Southwest of z (if max_y(x) < min_y(z))

Actually, since y is Northwest of z, we know that min_y(y) > max_y(z). And since x is South of y, we have max_y(x) < min_y(y). Combining these, we get max_y(x) < min_y(y) > max_y(z).

Unfortunately, this doesn't give us a direct relationship between max_y(x) and max_y(z) or between min_y(x) and min_y(z). So, x could be above, below, or at the same level as z in the y-dimension.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- West (if x and z overlap in the y-dimension)
- Northwest (if x is above z in the y-dimension)
- Southwest (if x is below z in the y-dimension)

Actually, wait. One thing to think about is that maybe I am overthinking this? Let me simplify this. If we represent directions as vectors:
- North: (0, 1)
- South: (0, -1)
- East: (1, 0)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northeast: (1, 1)
- Southeast: (1, -1)
- Southwest: (-1, -1)
- Northwest: (-1, 1)

Then, if x is South of y, we have the vector from y to x as (0, -1). And if y is Northwest of z, we have the vector from z to y as (-1, 1).

Combining these, the vector from z to x would be (-1, 1) + (0, -1) = (-1, 0), which is West.

But this is a simplification and doesn't consider the spatial extent of the regions. Actually wait, this can't be right. How do I get from z to x? I'd have to go from z to y first, then from y to x, so the vector would be from z to y, then from y to x, not the other way around. The vector from z to y is (-1, 1), and from y to x is (0, -1). So the vector from z to x is (-1, 1) + (0, -1) = (-1, 0), which corresponds to West.

Actually wait, this is oversimplifying by not considering that regions can have different sizes and shapes. Let's go back to the 9-tile model, which is more appropriate for this context.

In the 9-tile model, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- West (if x and z overlap in the y-dimension)
- Northwest (if x is above z in the y-dimension)
- Southwest (if x is below z in the y-dimension)

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. In the context of cardinal direction relations (i.e., a model like the cardinal direction calculus), the composition table is a valuable tool to determine the result of a composition of two cardinal direction relations. According to this calculus, the composition of South and Northwest is one of the following: Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Let me check with this. If I say:
- x is South of y
- y is Northwest of z

Then, according to the composition table of the cardinal direction calculus, the relationship between x and z is one of: Northwest, West, or Southwest.

This is consistent with our earlier derivation!

Actually wait, I'm not trusting myself here because I think I'm getting lost.

Let's use concrete scenarios to make sure. Imagine z is at the origin (0,0) with an MBR of size 1x1 (from -0.5 to 0.5 in both dimensions).

For y to be Northwest of z, y must be in the region where x < -0.5 and y > 0.5. Let's say y is at (-1, 1) with an MBR of size 1x1 (from -1.5 to -0.5 in the x-dimension and from 0.5 to 1.5 in the y-dimension).

For x to be South of y, x must be in the region where -1.5 <= x <= -0.5 and y < 0.5. Let's consider three cases:

1. x is at (-1, 0) with an MBR of size 1x1 (from -1.5 to -0.5 in the x-dimension and from -0.5 to 0.5 in the y-dimension). In this case, x overlaps with z in the y-dimension, so x is West of z.

2. x is at (-1, 0.75) with an MBR of size 1x1 (from -1.5 to -0.5 in the x-dimension and from 0.25 to 1.25 in the y-dimension). In this case, x is above z in the y-dimension, so x is Northwest of z.

3. x is at (-1, -1) with an MBR of size 1x1 (from -1.5 to -0.5 in the x-dimension and from -1.5 to -0.5 in the y-dimension). In this case, x is below z in the y-dimension, so x is Southwest of z.

Therefore, the possible relationships between x and z are: West, Northwest, or Southwest. This is consistent with our derivation.

Actually, I think the right approach for determining the composition of cardinal direction relations is to use the composition table. For the 8 cardinal directions (plus the "equals" relation), there's a 9x9 composition table. For the specific case of composing South with Northwest, the result is: Northwest, West, or Southwest.

I think that's the final answer: x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

Actually, let me verify that our original derivation indeed corresponds to the composition of South and Northwest.

Northwest and West are straightforward. For West, we have that if x is at (-1, 0) with an MBR from (-1.5, -0.5) to (-0.5, 0.5), then it intersects the West tile of z. For Northwest, if x is at (-1, 0.75) with an MBR from (-1.5, 0.25) to (-0.5, 1.25), then it intersects the Northwest tile of z. For Southwest, if x is at (-1, -1) with an MBR from (-1.5, -1.5) to (-0.5, -0.5), then it intersects the Southwest tile of z.

All of these examples demonstrate the three possible relations I derived. Thus, the answer is correct, and x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

So the correct answer is: Northwest, West, Southwest.

Acually, wait. One thing to note is that in the original problem, we're asked for the "possible relations" between x and z. This suggests that there might be multiple correct answers, not just a single one. It's asking for the set of possible cardinal direction relations between x and z given the constraints.

So, the answer is: the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

OK, let's verify one more time using examples. If z is at the origin (0,0) with an MBR of size 1x1 (from -0.5 to 0.5 in both dimensions), and y is at (-1, 1) with an MBR of size 1x1 (from -1.5 to -0.5 in the x-dimension and from 0.5 to 1.5 in the y-dimension), then for x to be South of y, it must be below y.

Case 1: If x is entirely to the West of z and has some overlap with z in the y-dimension, then x is West of z. For example, x could be at (-1, 0) with an MBR from (-1.5, -0.5) to (-0.5, 0.5).

Case 2: If x is entirely to the West of z and entirely above z in the y-dimension, then x is Northwest of z. For example, x could be at (-1, 0.75) with an MBR from (-1.5, 0.25) to (-0.5, 1.25).

Case 3: If x is entirely to the West of z and entirely below z in the y-dimension, then x is Southwest of z. For example, x could be at (-1, -1) with an MBR from (-1.5, -1.5) to (-0.5, -0.5).

Based on the constraints (x is South of y, and y is Northwest of z), these are the only three possible relationships between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, and Southwest.

So the final answer is: West, Northwest, Southwest.

No wait, my coordinates are off. Let me verify case 1 again.

Case 1: For x to be West of z, it should be entirely to the left of z, and have some overlap with z in the y-dimension. Given that z's MBR is from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5), x would need to have its x-coordinates less than -0.5, and its y-coordinates overlapping with (-0.5, 0.5). For example, x could be at (-1, 0) with an MBR from (-1.5, -0.5) to (-0.5, 0.5).

But for x to be South of y, it should be below y. Given y's MBR from (-1.5, 0.5) to (-0.5, 1.5), x would need to have its y-coordinates less than 0.5.

So, for x to be both South of y and West of z, x would need to have its x-coordinates less than -0.5 and its y-coordinates overlapping with (-0.5, 0.5) but also less than 0.5. This means x's y-coordinates would be less than 0.5, but could potentially overlap with (-0.5, 0.5). This satisfies the West relationship.

Case 2: For x to be Northwest of z, it should be entirely to the left and above z. Given z's MBR from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5), x would need to have its x-coordinates less than -0.5 and its y-coordinates greater than 0.5.

For x to be South of y, it should be below y. Given y's MBR from (-1.5, 0.5) to (-0.5, 1.5), x would need to have its y-coordinates less than 0.5.

These two conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously (y-coordinates greater than 0.5 but also less than 0.5), so x cannot be Northwest of z.

Case 3: For x to be Southwest of z, it should be entirely to the left and below z. Given z's MBR from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5), x would need to have its x-coordinates less than -0.5 and its y-coordinates less than -0.5.

For x to be South of y, it should be below y. Given y's MBR from (-1.5, 0.5) to (-0.5, 1.5), x would need to have its y-coordinates less than 0.5.

These two conditions can be satisfied (y-coordinates less than -0.5 are also less than 0.5), so x can be Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: West and Southwest.

Wait, I think I got confused. South of y doesn't mean "below the min of y" but "below the MBR of y", which means y_x < min_y(y). For y at (-1, 1) with an MBR from (-1.5, 0.5) to (-0.5, 1.5), min_y(y) = 0.5.

Let's re-analyze:

Case 1: For x to be West of z, x should be entirely to the left of z and have some overlap with z in the y-dimension. For x to be South of y, it should be below y, meaning y_x < 0.5. These conditions can be satisfied simultaneously, so x can be West of z.

Case 2: For x to be Northwest of z, x should be entirely to the left and above z, meaning x's y-coordinates are greater than 0.5. For x to be South of y, it should be below y, meaning y_x < 0.5. These two conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously, so x cannot be Northwest of z.

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself again. Let's be methodical.

For a region r, its tiles are defined relative to its minimum bounding rectangle, which is [min_x(r), min_y(r), max_x(r), max_y(r)].

If z's MBR is [min_x(z), min_y(z), max_x(z), max_y(z)], then:
- The West tile of z is the region x < min_x(z), min_y(z) <= y <= max_y(z).
- The Northwest tile of z is the region x < min_x(z), y > max_y(z).
- The Southwest tile of z is the region x < min_x(z), y < min_y(z).

If y is Northwest of z, then y's MBR is entirely in the Northwest tile of z. So, max_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(y) > max_y(z).

If x is South of y, then x's MBR is entirely in the South tile of y. So, min_x(x) >= min_x(y), max_x(x) <= max_x(y), and max_y(x) < min_y(y).

From these, we can derive:
- max_x(x) <= max_x(y) < min_x(z). So, x is to the left of z.
- max_y(x) < min_y(y) > max_y(z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in the y-dimension.

Since x is to the left of z and can have any position in the y-dimension relative to z, the possible relations are:
- West (if x's y-range overlaps with z's y-range)
- Northwest (if x is above z in the y-dimension)
- Southwest (if x is below z in the y-dimension)

So, the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, and Southwest.

Actually, I think I see my confusion above. For Northwest, I incorrectly thought the constraint was "above min_y(z)" rather than "above max_y(z)". Let me double-check:

If x is Northwest of z, x should be entirely to the left and above z, meaning x's x-coordinates are less than min_x(z) and x's y-coordinates are greater than max_y(z).

Given the constraints:
- y is Northwest of z, so max_x(y) < min_x(z) and min_y(y) > max_y(z).
- x is South of y, so min_x(x) >= min_x(y), max_x(x) <= max_x(y), and max_y(x) < min_y(y).

From these, we can derive:
- max_x(x) <= max_x(y) < min_x(z). So, x is to the left of z.
- max_y(x) < min_y(y) and min_y(y) > max_y(z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in the y-dimension.

If x's y-coordinates are all greater than max_y(z), then x is Northwest of z. Is this possible given our constraints? max_y(x) < min_y(y) and min_y(y) > max_y(z). If min_y(y) is only slightly greater than max_y(z), and max_y(x) is only slightly less than min_y(y), then max_y(x) can still be greater than max_y(z), placing x in the Northwest of z.

Similarly, if x's y-coordinates are all less than min_y(z), then x is Southwest of z. And if x's y-range overlaps with z's y-range, then x is West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: West, Northwest, and Southwest.

Actually wait, we need to be super clear about the definitions. Let's define the cardinal relations for regions using the minimum bounding rectangle approach.

For two regions u and v with MBRs [min_x(u), min_y(u), max_x(u), max_y(u)] and [min_x(v), min_y(v), max_x(v), max_y(v)], the cardinal directions are defined as:

1. u is North of v if and only if min_y(u) >= max_y(v) and min_x(u) <= max_x(v) and max_x(u) >= min_x(v).
2. u is South of v if and only if max_y(u) <= min_y(v) and min_x(u) <= max_x(v) and max_x(u) >= min_x(v).
3. u is East of v if and only if min_x(u) >= max_x(v) and min_y(u) <= max_y(v) and max_y(u) >= min_y(v).
4. u is West of v if and only if max_x(u) <= min_x(v) and min_y(u) <= max_y(v) and max_y(u) >= min_y(v).
5. u is Northeast of v if and only if min_y(u) >= max_y(v) and min_x(u) >= max_x(v).
6. u is Northwest of v if and only if min_y(u) >= max_y(v) and max_x(u) <= min_x(v).
7. u is Southeast of v if and only if max_y(u) <= min_y(v) and min_x(u) >= max_x(v).
8. u is Southwest of v if and only if max_y(u) <= min_y(v) and max_x(u) <= min_x(v).
9. u is equal to v (Bounding Box) if and only if min_x(u) = min_x(v) and min_y(u) = min_y(v) and max_x(u) = max_x(v) and max_y(u) = max_y(v).

Given these definitions and the constraints:
- x is South of y, so max_y(x) <= min_y(y) and min_x(x) <= max_x(y) and max_x(x) >= min_x(y).
- y is Northwest of z, so min_y(y) >= max_y(z) and max_x(y) <= min_x(z).

From these, we can derive:
- max_y(x) <= min_y(y) and min_y(y) >= max_y(z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in the y-dimension.
- min_x(x) <= max_x(y) and max_x(y) <= min_x(z). This gives us min_x(x) <= min_x(z).
- max_x(x) >= min_x(y) and max_x(y) <= min_x(z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between max_x(x) and min_x(z).

Actually, hold on. Let's be more careful. Given:
- y is Northwest of z, so min_y(y) >= max_y(z) and max_x(y) <= min_x(z).
- x is South of y, so max_y(x) <= min_y(y) and min_x(x) <= max_x(y) and max_x(x) >= min_x(y).

From these, we can derive:
- max_y(x) <= min_y(y) and min_y(y) >= max_y(z). If min_y(y) > max_y(z), then max_y(x) < min_y(y). From these, we can't determine the relationship between max_y(x) and max_y(z) or between max_y(x) and min_y(z).
- min_x(x) <= max_x(y) and max_x(y) <= min_x(z). This gives us min_x(x) <= min_x(z).
- max_x(x) >= min_x(y). But we don't know how min_x(y) relates to min_x(z) or max_x(z).

Actually wait. Since y is Northwest of z, we know that max_x(y) <= min_x(z). And since x is South of y, we know that max_x(x) >= min_x(y). But min_x(y) could be less than, equal to, or greater than min_x(z). So, we can't determine the relationship between max_x(x) and min_x(z) without more information.

Wait, actually the constraint says that y is Northwest of z, which means max_x(y) <= min_x(z). And x is South of y, which means max_x(x) >= min_x(y). There's no direct relationship between max_x(x) and min_x(z) from these.

But wait, x is South of y also means min_x(x) <= max_x(y). Combined with max_x(y) <= min_x(z), we get min_x(x) <= min_x(z).

Actually, let's take another approach. If y is Northwest of z, then y's MBR is entirely in the Northwest tile of z. If x is South of y, then x's MBR is entirely in the South tile of y.

The South tile of y extends from y's West to y's East in the x-dimension, and from y's South to negative infinity in the y-dimension. Since y is entirely in the Northwest tile of z, and x is entirely in the South tile of y, x is somewhere to the West of z. But in the y-dimension, we can't determine the exact relationship without more information.

OK, actually I think this is where the composition table for cardinal direction relations comes into play. Given:
- x is South of y
- y is Northwest of z

According to the composition table, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, or Southwest.

I haven't been able to derive this mathematically with certainty, so I'll trust the composition table.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Let me try a pure geometric approach to confirm my answer.

Let's place z at the origin (0,0), and let's normalize all regions to be points for simplicity. Since y is Northwest of z, y is in the second quadrant, let's say at (-1, 1). Since x is South of y, x is directly below y, so x is at (-1, -k) for some k > 0.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:
- If k = 1, then x is at (-1, -1), which is in the third quadrant, so x is Southwest of z.
- If k = 0, then x is at (-1, 0), which is on the negative x-axis, so x is West of z.
- If k = -0.5, then x is at (-1, 0.5), which is in the second quadrant, so x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually wait, in the case where k = -0.5, we have x at (-1, 0.5). But x is supposed to be South of y, which is at (-1, 1). If x is at (-1, 0.5), it's still below y, so this works. But is x at (-1, 0.5) Northwest of z? z is at (0, 0), so (-1, 0.5) is to the northwest of it, being both to the left and above.

OK, so these scenarios are consistent. Let's double-check:

1. If x is at (-1, -1), it's below y (which is at (-1, 1)), so x is South of y. And x is to the southwest of z (which is at (0, 0)), so the relation is Southwest.
2. If x is at (-1, 0), it's below y, so x is South of y. And x is to the west of z, so the relation is West.
3. If x is at (-1, 0.5), it's below y, so x is South of y. And x is to the northwest of z, so the relation is Northwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Oh actually k can be negative? x needs to be South of y, so it needs to be below y. If y is at (-1, 1), for x to be below it, x could be at (-1, 0.5) (with k = 0.5, not -0.5). I think I made a mistake.

Let's correct and verify:

1. If x is at (-1, -1), it's below y (which is at (-1, 1)), so x is South of y. And x is to the southwest of z (which is at (0, 0)), so the relation is Southwest.
2. If x is at (-1, 0), it's below y, so x is South of y. And x is to the west of z, so the relation is West.
3. If x is at (-1, 0.5), it's below y, so x is South of y. And x is to the northwest of z, so the relation is Northwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

I think I got confused by saying k = -0.5 when I meant k = 0.5. Let's correct this:

1. If k = 2, then x is at (-1, -1), which is in the third quadrant, so x is Southwest of z.
2. If k = 1, then x is at (-1, 0), which is on the negative x-axis, so x is West of z.
3. If k = 0.5, then x is at (-1, 0.5), which is in the second quadrant, so x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

OK, one last check on the definitions to make sure I've got this right.

For two points p and q, the cardinal directions are defined as:
1. p is North of q if and only if p_y > q_y and p_x = q_x.
2. p is South of q if and only if p_y < q_y and p_x = q_x.
3. p is East of q if and only if p_x > q_x and p_y = q_y.
4. p is West of q if and only if p_x < q_x and p_y = q_y.
5. p is Northeast of q if and only if p_y > q_y and p_x > q_x.
6. p is Northwest of q if and only if p_y > q_y and p_x < q_x.
7. p is Southeast of q if and only if p_y < q_y and p_x > q_x.
8. p is Southwest of q if and only if p_y < q_y and p_x < q_x.

Given these definitions and the constraints:
- x is South of y, so x_y < y_y and x_x = y_x.
- y is Northwest of z, so y_y > z_y and y_x < z_x.

From these, we can derive:
- x_y < y_y and y_y > z_y. This doesn't give us a direct relationship between x_y and z_y.
- x_x = y_x and y_x < z_x. This gives us x_x < z_x, which means x is to the West of z (in the x-dimension).

But for the cardinal directions, we need exact relationships, not just tendencies in one dimension.

If x_y > z_y, then x is Northwest of z. If x_y = z_y, then x is West of z. If x_y < z_y, then x is Southwest of z.

All of these scenarios are possible given our constraints. So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Hmm, I'm trying to reconcile the point-based and region-based definitions. Let's see:

For regions:
1. u is South of v if and only if max_y(u) <= min_y(v) and min_x(u) <= max_x(v) and max_x(u) >= min_x(v).
2. u is Northwest of v if and only if min_y(u) >= max_y(v) and max_x(u) <= min_x(v).

Given:
- x is South of y, so max_y(x) <= min_y(y) and min_x(x) <= max_x(y) and max_x(x) >= min_x(y).
- y is Northwest of z, so min_y(y) >= max_y(z) and max_x(y) <= min_x(z).

Actually, the issue is that when regions are involved, "x is South of y" doesn't mean "x is directly below y" as it does for points. It means "x is entirely below y's MBR and has some x-overlap with y's MBR".

Let's go with the region-based definitions and see what we can derive.

Given:
- x is South of y, so max_y(x) <= min_y(y) and min_x(x) <= max_x(y) and max_x(x) >= min_x(y).
- y is Northwest of z, so min_y(y) >= max_y(z) and max_x(y) <= min_x(z).

From these, we can derive:
- max_y(x) <= min_y(y) and min_y(y) >= max_y(z). This gives us max_y(x) <= min_y(y) >= max_y(z). But we can't determine the exact relationship between max_y(x) and max_y(z) without more information.
- min_x(x) <= max_x(y) and max_x(y) <= min_x(z). This gives us min_x(x) <= min_x(z).
- max_x(x) >= min_x(y). But we don't know how min_x(y) relates to min_x(z) or max_x(z) without more information.

Actually, I'm thinking about it, and if max_x(y) <= min_x(z), it means y is entirely to the left of z's MBR. If min_x(x) <= max_x(y), it means x's MBR extends at least as far left as y's MBR extends right. And if max_x(x) >= min_x(y), it means x's MBR extends at least as far right as y's MBR extends left.

If x's MBR doesn't extend past y's MBR in the x-dimension (min_x(y) <= min_x(x) <= max_x(x) <= max_x(y)), then x's MBR is entirely to the left of z's MBR.

If x's MBR extends past y's MBR to the right (min_x(y) <= min_x(x) <= max_x(y) <= max_x(x)), we don't know if x's MBR overlaps with z's MBR in the x-dimension without more information.

But, the definitions for the cardinal directions are mutually exclusive for regions. If x is South of y and y is Northwest of z, x can't be in multiple cardinal directions relative to z.

I'm really struggling with this, so let me just go with the composition table for cardinal direction relations, which states that the composition of South and Northwest is one of: Northwest, West, or Southwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually wait, we're not trying to deduce a single definite cardinal direction; we're asked for the "possible relations" between x and z. This suggests that there are multiple possible cardinal direction relations that x could have with z, depending on the specific positions and shapes of x, y, and z within the constraints.

So, the answer is: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, the composition table for cardinal direction relations is the key. When we say "if x is South of y and y is Northwest of z, then what are the possible relations between x and z?", we're asking for the composition of South and Northwest. According to the cardinal direction calculus, the composition of South and Northwest is the set {Northwest, West, Southwest}.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

So the answer is: Northwest, West, Southwest.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given information:
- Region x is South of region y
- Region y is Northwest of region z

When we compose these two relations, we need to determine all possible positions where region x could be relative to region z.

If we place z at the origin for reference:
- Since y is Northwest of z, y must be both to the left and above z
- Since x is South of y, x must be below y

From these constraints, region x must be to the left of z (because y is to the left of z, and x is in the same lateral region as y). However, in the vertical dimension, x can be:
- Above z (making it Northwest of z)
- At the same level as z (making it West of z)
- Below z (making it Southwest of z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, West, Southwest.
