PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I'll solve this by thinking about what it means for a region to be in a particular cardinal direction of another.

First, let's define what it means for region x to be southwest of region y. This generally means that x is both south and west of y. In other words, x is in the southwest quadrant from y's perspective.

Similarly, for region y to be northwest of region z, it means that y is both north and west of z. In other words, y is in the northwest quadrant from z's perspective.

Now, let's try to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is southwest of y
- y is northwest of z

Let's think about this in terms of coordinates. If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then:
- y is in the northwest quadrant relative to z, so y has coordinates (y_x, y_y) where y_x < 0 (west) and y_y > 0 (north).
- x is in the southwest quadrant relative to y, so x has coordinates (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x (west of y) and x_y < y_y (south of y).

So, relative to z, x has coordinates (x_x, x_y) where:
- x_x < y_x < 0, which means x is west of z.
- For the y-coordinate, we know x_y < y_y, but we don't know how x_y compares to 0. There are three possibilities:
  1. x_y > 0: This means x is north of z.
  2. x_y = 0: This means x is at the same latitude as z.
  3. x_y < 0: This means x is south of z.

Let's analyze each case:

Case 1: If x_y > 0, then x is both west and north of z, which means x is northwest of z.

Case 2: If x_y = 0, then x is west of z but at the same latitude, which means x is directly west of z.

Case 3: If x_y < 0, then x is both west and south of z, which means x is southwest of z.

Actually, let me think again to make sure I haven't missed anything. I'm not sure if my reasoning is correct, because I need to consider the exact definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

Let me try a more systematic approach. I'll use MBRs (Minimum Bounding Rectangles) to represent the regions.

Let's denote the MBR of region x as (x_min_x, x_min_y, x_max_x, x_max_y), where (x_min_x, x_min_y) is the lower-left corner and (x_max_x, x_max_y) is the upper-right corner. Similarly for regions y and z.

According to the cardinal direction model, region x is southwest of region y if:
- x_max_x <= y_min_x (x is to the west of y)
- x_max_y <= y_min_y (x is to the south of y)

Similarly, region y is northwest of region z if:
- y_max_x <= z_min_x (y is to the west of z)
- y_min_y >= z_max_y (y is to the north of z)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:

- Since x_max_x <= y_min_x and y_max_x <= z_min_x, we have x_max_x <= z_min_x, which means x is to the west of z.

- For the y-coordinates, we have x_max_y <= y_min_y and y_min_y >= z_max_y. From these, we can deduce that x_max_y <= z_max_y. But this doesn't tell us the exact relation between x_min_y, x_max_y, z_min_y, and z_max_y.

Hmm, I'm not sure if my approach is completely correct. Let me think again.

Actually, I think there's a simpler way to approach this. Let's consider the relative positions of the regions without getting into the details of MBRs.

Given:
- x is southwest of y
- y is northwest of z

If we draw this out, here's what we know:
- x is both south and west of y.
- y is both north and west of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- x is west of y, and y is west of z. So, x is west of z.
- x is south of y, and y is north of z. This doesn't give us a clear relation between x and z in the north-south direction.

So, the possible relations between x and z (in terms of cardinal directions) are:
- Northwest (if x is north of z)
- West (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest (if x is south of z)

Wait, I think my confusion arises because I'm mixing two different interpretations of cardinal directions. Let me clarify.

In the grid-based cardinal direction model (which is what I've been implicitly using), the regions are represented by MBRs, and the 9 possible directional relations are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Same (or Equals).

In this model, the relation "x is southwest of y" means that x is located in the southwest direction relative to y, without any overlap. Similarly, "y is northwest of z" means y is in the northwest direction relative to z.

Using this interpretation, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

Given:
- x is southwest of y
- y is northwest of z

If we draw this out on a grid:
- x is in the cell to the southwest of y.
- y is in the cell to the northwest of z.

Now, if we trace the path from z to y, and then from y to x, we're moving northwest and then southwest. This means we're moving west twice, but the north-south movement can vary.

So, the possible relations between x and z (in terms of cardinal directions) are:
- Northwest (if the northern movement from z to y is greater than the southern movement from y to x)
- West (if the northern movement from z to y equals the southern movement from y to x)
- Southwest (if the northern movement from z to y is less than the southern movement from y to x)

Actually, let me approach this problem using a different method to be sure.

Let's establish a coordinate system with the origin at the bottom-left. In this system, moving north increases the y-coordinate, and moving east increases the x-coordinate.

Given:
- x is southwest of y: This means x_center_x < y_center_x and x_center_y < y_center_y.
- y is northwest of z: This means y_center_x < z_center_x and y_center_y > z_center_y.

From these, we can deduce:
- x_center_x < y_center_x < z_center_x, which means x is west of z.
- x_center_y < y_center_y and y_center_y > z_center_y. But we can't directly compare x_center_y and z_center_y without knowing more. So, x could be north, south, or at the same latitude as z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x_center_y > z_center_y)
- West (if x_center_y = z_center_y)
- Southwest (if x_center_y < z_center_y)

Now, let's reconsider the exact statements:

"Region x is Southwest of region y" means that x is entirely to the southwest of y. Specifically, the northeasternmost point of x is to the southwest of the southwesternmost point of y.

"Region y is Northwest of region z" means that y is entirely to the northwest of z. Specifically, the southeasternmost point of y is to the northwest of the northwesternmost point of z.

Given these precise definitions, let's reevaluate:

Let's denote the extreme points of region x as (x_min_x, x_min_y) for the southwesternmost point and (x_max_x, x_max_y) for the northeasternmost point. Similarly for regions y and z.

According to the cardinal direction model:
- x is southwest of y if: x_max_x <= y_min_x and x_max_y <= y_min_y.
- y is northwest of z if: y_max_x <= z_min_x and y_min_y >= z_max_y.

From these, we can deduce:
- x_max_x <= y_min_x <= z_min_x, which means x is west of z.
- x_max_y <= y_min_y and y_min_y >= z_max_y. This gives us x_max_y <= z_max_y, but we still can't directly compare x_min_y, x_max_y, z_min_y, and z_max_y without more information.

So, based on this interpretation, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is north of z)
- West (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest (if x is south of z)
- North (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction but is entirely to the north)
- South (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction but is entirely to the south)
- Bounding Box (if x overlaps with z)

Actually, that's not right. Let me think again.

Let's be very clear about the definitions:

"Region x is Southwest of region y" means that every point in x is southwest of every point in y. That is, for every point (x_x, x_y) in x and every point (y_x, y_y) in y, we have x_x < y_x and x_y < y_y.

"Region y is Northwest of region z" means that every point in y is northwest of every point in z. That is, for every point (y_x, y_y) in y and every point (z_x, z_y) in z, we have y_x < z_x and y_y > z_y.

Given these definitions, if x is southwest of y and y is northwest of z, then:
- For every point (x_x, x_y) in x, (y_x, y_y) in y, and (z_x, z_y) in z, we have x_x < y_x < z_x. This means x is west of z.
- For the y-coordinates, we have x_y < y_y and y_y > z_y. But we can't directly compare x_y and z_y without more information.

So, based on this interpretation, the possible relations between x and z (in terms of cardinal directions) are:
- Northwest (if x is north of z)
- West (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest (if x is south of z)

But wait, I'm getting confused because I'm mixing 9-intersection model with cardinal directions. Let me be even more precise.

In the cardinal direction calculus, the 9 possible directional relations are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Same (or Equals).

"Region x is Southwest of region y" means that x is located in the southwest direction relative to y. Specifically, the upper-right corner of x's MBR is to the southwest of the lower-left corner of y's MBR.

"Region y is Northwest of region z" means that y is located in the northwest direction relative to z. Specifically, the lower-right corner of y's MBR is to the northwest of the upper-left corner of z's MBR.

Given these definitions, if x is southwest of y and y is northwest of z, then:
- The upper-right corner of x's MBR is to the southwest of the lower-left corner of y's MBR.
- The lower-right corner of y's MBR is to the northwest of the upper-left corner of z's MBR.

From these, we can deduce:
- x is to the west of z. This is because x is to the west of y, and y is to the west of z.
- For the north-south direction, it's less clear. x is to the south of y, and y is to the north of z. Depending on the exact positions, x could be to the north, south, or at the same latitude as z.

So, the possible relations between x and z (in terms of cardinal directions) are:
- Northwest (if x is to the north of z)
- West (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest (if x is to the south of z)

Ah, I see. There's a model about cardinal directions proposed by Frank (1992), called the "Cardinal Direction Calculus" (CDC). In this model, cardinal directions are defined based on the relative positions of the regions. Using the CDC, we can infer the possible cardinal directions between regions given certain constraints.

Given:
- x is southwest of y
- y is northwest of z

We can deduce:
- x is west of z. This is because x is west of y, and y is west of z.
- For the north-south direction, it's less clear. x is south of y, and y is north of z. Depending on the exact positions, x could be north, south, or at the same latitude as z.

So, based on the CDC, the possible cardinal directions between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is north of z)
- West (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest (if x is south of z)

Alright, I think my understanding is clearer now.

Using the Cardinal Direction Calculus, if region x is southwest of region y and region y is northwest of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Let me verify this once more with a clear visual example.

Imagine a 3x3 grid. Let's place z in the center (position (1, 1)), y in the northwest corner (position (0, 2)), and x in the southwest corner (position (0, 0)).

In this scenario:
- x is southwest of y (as x is at (0, 0) and y is at (0, 2))
- y is northwest of z (as y is at (0, 2) and z is at (1, 1))
- x is southwest of z (as x is at (0, 0) and z is at (1, 1))

This confirms that "Southwest" is one possible relation between x and z.

Now, let's place x at position (0, 1):
- x is southwest of y (as x is at (0, 1) and y is at (0, 2))
- y is northwest of z (as y is at (0, 2) and z is at (1, 1))
- x is west of z (as x is at (0, 1) and z is at (1, 1))

This confirms that "West" is another possible relation.

Finally, let's place x at position (0, 2):
- x is southwest of y (as x is at (0, 2) and y is at (0, 2))... Wait, this doesn't make sense. x can't be southwest of y if they're at the same position.

Let me rethink this.

I think my confusion stems from the fact that I'm using a discrete grid, which doesn't adequately represent the continuous nature of regions. Let's approach this differently.

Using the Cardinal Direction Calculus for regions:

- If region x is southwest of region y, then every point in x is to the west and south of every point in y.
- If region y is northwest of region z, then every point in y is to the west and north of every point in z.

From these, we can deduce:
- Every point in x is to the west of every point in y, and every point in y is to the west of every point in z. Therefore, every point in x is to the west of every point in z.
- Every point in x is to the south of every point in y, and every point in y is to the north of every point in z. Without more information, we can't determine the north-south relation between x and z.

So, based on this, the possible cardinal directions between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is to the north of z)
- West (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest (if x is to the south of z)

Actually, I'm getting confused with my own explanations. Let me go back to basics.

In cardinal direction relations, if we have two regions, the relation can be one of North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box (which means the regions overlap).

Given:
- x is southwest of y
- y is northwest of z

Let me visualize this using relative positions:
- If x is southwest of y, then x is both south and west of y.
- If y is northwest of z, then y is both north and west of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- x is west of y, and y is west of z. Therefore, x is west of z.
- x is south of y, and y is north of z. Without additional information, we can't determine the north-south relation between x and z.

So, based on this visualization, the possible cardinal directions between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is north of z)
- West (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest (if x is south of z)

Let me draw this using a simple coordinate system to make sure:
- Let's place z at the origin (0, 0).
- Since y is northwest of z, let's place y at (-1, 1).
- Since x is southwest of y, we know x is both south and west of y. 

If we place x at (-2, 0.5), then:
- x is southwest of y (as x is at (-2, 0.5) and y is at (-1, 1))
- y is northwest of z (as y is at (-1, 1) and z is at (0, 0))
- x is northwest of z (as x is at (-2, 0.5) and z is at (0, 0))

If we place x at (-2, 0), then:
- x is southwest of y (as x is at (-2, 0) and y is at (-1, 1))
- y is northwest of z (as y is at (-1, 1) and z is at (0, 0))
- x is west of z (as x is at (-2, 0) and z is at (0, 0))

If we place x at (-2, -0.5), then:
- x is southwest of y (as x is at (-2, -0.5) and y is at (-1, 1))
- y is northwest of z (as y is at (-1, 1) and z is at (0, 0))
- x is southwest of z (as x is at (-2, -0.5) and z is at (0, 0))

This confirms that the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Wait, I still don't think this is right. Let me make sure I'm using the correct definition of "southwest of" and "northwest of".

In cardinal direction relations, if we say "region a is southwest of region b", it means that every point in region a is in the southwest direction of every point in region b. Specifically, if (a_x, a_y) is a point in region a and (b_x, b_y) is a point in region b, then a_x < b_x and a_y < b_y.

Similarly, if we say "region a is northwest of region b", it means that every point in region a is in the northwest direction of every point in region b. Specifically, if (a_x, a_y) is a point in region a and (b_x, b_y) is a point in region b, then a_x < b_x and a_y > b_y.

Given:
- x is southwest of y: For every point (x_x, x_y) in region x and every point (y_x, y_y) in region y, we have x_x < y_x and x_y < y_y.
- y is northwest of z: For every point (y_x, y_y) in region y and every point (z_x, z_y) in region z, we have y_x < z_x and y_y > z_y.

From these, we can deduce:
- For every point (x_x, x_y) in region x, (y_x, y_y) in region y, and (z_x, z_y) in region z, we have x_x < y_x < z_x. Therefore, x is west of z.
- For the y-coordinates, we have x_y < y_y and y_y > z_y. Without more information, we can't determine the relation between x_y and z_y.

So, based on this definition, the possible cardinal directions between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x_y > z_y for all points)
- West (if x_y = z_y for all points)
- Southwest (if x_y < z_y for all points)

But I need to note that for regions, it's unlikely that x_y = z_y for all points (unless the regions are lines or have special shapes). So, in reality, the most likely relations are Northwest and Southwest. However, since the question asks for "possible" relations, all three are valid.

Wait, actually, the definition I gave is for strict cardinal directions (e.g., "strictly southwest of"). For the standard cardinal direction relations, we'd be using the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) of the regions.

Let me think more carefully.

In the cardinal direction model for regions, each region is represented by its MBR. The MBR is divided into 9 tiles (NW, N, NE, W, O, E, SW, S, SE) by drawing lines through the centroid of the MBR in the north-south and east-west directions.

Given:
- x is southwest of y: This means that the MBR of x is entirely in the southwest tile of the MBR of y.
- y is northwest of z: This means that the MBR of y is entirely in the northwest tile of the MBR of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- The MBR of x is west of the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is west of the MBR of z. Therefore, the MBR of x is west of the MBR of z.
- The MBR of x is south of the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is north of the MBR of z. Without more information, we can't determine the north-south relation between the MBR of x and the MBR of z.

So, based on this interpretation, the possible cardinal directions between x and z are:
- Northwest (if the MBR of x is north of the MBR of z)
- West (if the MBR of x is neither north nor south of the MBR of z)
- Southwest (if the MBR of x is south of the MBR of z)

It seems that regardless of the precise definition of cardinal direction relations, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, my explanations above are not correct for all cardinal direction models. Some models use the centroid of the region, while others use the MBR. But generally, the principles remain the same.

Given:
- x is southwest of y
- y is northwest of z

In most cardinal direction models, we can deduce:
- x is west of z
- The north-south relation between x and z is indeterminate without more information

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

I think this is the correct answer, and I've verified it through multiple approaches.

So the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest (if x is north of z)
- West (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest (if x is south of z)

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest
