PROMPT: Let  West and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Okay, I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z, given:
1. x is West of y
2. y is Northwest of z

Let me think about what these relations mean in terms of directions:
- West means x is directly to the west of y. So if we're using a compass, x is towards the W from y.
- Northwest means y is to the northwest of z. So y is towards the NW from z.

To figure out the possible relations between x and z, I need to analyze what it means for x to be West of y, and y to be Northwest of z.

In a 2D plane, if we consider a coordinate system with north as the positive y-axis and east as the positive x-axis:
- If x is West of y, then x is at a location with a smaller x-coordinate than y and the same y-coordinate.
- If y is Northwest of z, then y is at a location with a smaller x-coordinate than z and a larger y-coordinate than z.

Given these relations, where would x be in relation to z?

If x is West of y, and y is Northwest of z, then x would be in a position west and north of z. But let's analyze this more precisely.

Let's denote the coordinates of x, y, and z as (x_x, x_y), (y_x, y_y), and (z_x, z_y), respectively.

Given information:
- x is West of y: This implies x_x < y_x and x_y = y_y.
- y is Northwest of z: This implies y_x < z_x and y_y > z_y.

From these conditions, we have:
- x_x < y_x < z_x (x is further west than y, which is further west than z)
- x_y = y_y > z_y (x has the same y-coordinate as y, which is further north than z)

So, x is west of z and also north of z. The combination of west and north would place x in the Northwest direction from z.

Hmm, let me double-check this. I think I made a mistake. West doesn't imply the same y-coordinate; it just means the x-coordinate is less. Similarly, Northwest doesn't imply a specific relationship on the x and y coordinates; it means the direction is between North and West.

Let me rethink this more carefully.

When we say x is West of y, it means x is located to the west of y. This doesn't restrict the north-south position of x relative to y; it could be slightly north or south of y as well, as long as the primary direction is west.

Similarly, when we say y is Northwest of z, y is in a direction that's a combination of north and west from z.

Let's think about this differently. If we imagine a compass centered at z, the direction from z to y would be towards the Northwest. And if we place another compass at y, the direction from y to x would be towards the West.

Now, consider the direct direction from z to x. Given that y is Northwest of z, and x is West of y, x could be:
- West of z: This would be the case if the westward displacement from y to x is significant compared to the northwest displacement from z to y.
- Northwest of z: This would be the case if the westward displacement from y to x doesn't change the overall northwest direction from z.
- Possibly North of z: Depending on the exact positions, x could even be directly North of z.

In fact, let's try to visualize this with some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:
Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Given that y is Northwest of z, let's say y is at (-1, 1). Now, given that x is West of y, x could be at (-2, 1). In this case, the direction from z to x would be Northwest.

Example 2:
Again, place z at the origin (0, 0). But this time, let's say y is more strongly northwest, at (-2, 3). If x is West of y, it could be at (-4, 3). In this case, the direction from z to x would still be Northwest, but a bit closer to West.

Example 3:
Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) and y at (-1, 10). If x is West of y, it could be at (-3, 10). In this case, the direction from z to x would be very close to North, but still slightly West of North, so still Northwest.

It seems like in all scenarios, the possible relation between x and z is Northwest.

Hmm, wait. I might be making some assumptions here. Let me try to be more general.

The direction "West" means that the angle is 270 degrees (using a compass where North is 0 degrees, East is 90 degrees, South is 180 degrees, and West is 270 degrees).

The direction "Northwest" means that the angle is somewhere between 315 degrees and 360 degrees, or 0 degrees and 45 degrees (since North spans from 337.5 to 22.5 degrees, and Northwest is an additional 45 degrees to the west).

If y is Northwest of z, then the angle from z to y is somewhere between 315 and 0/360 degrees (bearing in mind that Northwest covers a range).

Now, if x is West of y, then the angle from y to x is around 270 degrees.

Combining these directions, the angle from z to x would be influenced by both the Northwest direction from z to y and the West direction from y to x. The exact angle would depend on the distances and exact positions, but it's going to be somewhere between North and West.

Wait, I want to be more precise.

Let's use vector notation to describe this. We can represent the positions of x, y, and z as vectors in the 2D plane. Let's denote these as x, y, and z.

Given information:
- x is West of y: This means the vector from y to x, denoted as (x - y), is pointing westward.
- y is Northwest of z: This means the vector from z to y, denoted as (y - z), is pointing northwestward.

Now, the vector from z to x, denoted as (x - z), can be expressed as (x - z) = (x - y) + (y - z).

Since (x - y) is pointing westward and (y - z) is pointing northwestward, the vector (x - z) will be a combination of these two directions. Given that both (x - y) and (y - z) have westward components, the vector (x - z) will also have a westward component. And since (y - z) has a northward component, (x - z) will also have a northward component.

The exact direction of (x - z) depends on the magnitudes of (x - y) and (y - z), but it will be somewhere between North and West, which corresponds to the Northwest direction.

Actually, wait. I'm not sure if that's right. Let me try a more concrete approach using coordinates.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Given that y is Northwest of z, y can be at any point in the Northwest quadrant from z, which means y is at a point (y_x, y_y) where y_x < 0 and y_y > 0.

Now, given that x is West of y, x is at a point (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x. There's no constraint on the relative positions of x_y and y_y based solely on the "West" relation, so x_y could be greater than, equal to, or less than y_y.

So, the coordinates of x are (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x < 0 and x_y could be any value.

Now, considering the direction from z to x, the vector from z to x is (x_x, x_y). If x_y > 0, then x is in the Northwest quadrant from z. If x_y = 0, then x is directly West of z. If x_y < 0, then x is in the Southwest quadrant from z.

Let's consider these cases one by one:

1. If x_y > 0, then x is in the Northwest quadrant from z, so the relation between x and z is Northwest.
2. If x_y = 0, then x is directly West of z, so the relation between x and z is West.
3. If x_y < 0, then x is in the Southwest quadrant from z, so the relation between x and z is Southwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be: Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, I need to be more careful here. The constraint "x is West of y" doesn't just mean that x is to the west of y; it means that the primary direction from y to x is west. This places a more specific constraint on the relative positions of x and y.

Given that y is at (y_x, y_y) with y_x < 0 and y_y > 0 (in the Northwest quadrant from z), and x is West of y, the position of x, denoted as (x_x, x_y), should satisfy:
- x_x < y_x (further west than y)
- x_y is close enough to y_y such that the primary direction from y to x is west, which means |x_y - y_y| should be relatively small compared to |x_x - y_x|.

Actually, let's try to define "West" and "Northwest" as cardinal direction relations. 

"West" typically means that the direction is 270 degrees (using a compass where North is 0 degrees). But in the context of cardinal direction relations, it might include a range around 270 degrees, maybe from 247.5 to 292.5 degrees (giving it a 45-degree span, which is common for compass directions).

Similarly, "Northwest" would typically mean a direction of 315 degrees, but it might include a range around 315 degrees, maybe from 292.5 to 337.5 degrees.

Oh wait, I see the issue. Let me try to define cardinal direction relations using a standard approach, like the one proposed by Frank et al., as they define nine basic cardinal direction relations: North (N), Northeast (NE), East (E), Southeast (SE), South (S), Southwest (SW), West (W), Northwest (NW), and Bounding Box (B).

These cardinal direction relations can be visualized using the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the reference region. For instance, if we divide the plane around the MBR of region z into nine regions (the nine cardinal directions), then the relation between x and z depends on which of these regions x falls into.

Ah, let me try a different approach. I think I got confused in my earlier analyses because I've been trying to understand "West" and "Northwest" as single direction arrows, but in the context of cardinal direction relations between regions, they can represent more complex relationships.

Let's approach it from a different angle. We're dealing with regions, not points, and the cardinal direction relations between regions can be defined using various methods. One common method is to use the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the reference region to partition the plane.

For instance, given a reference region, we can draw a MBR around it and extend lines from its sides to create nine zones: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box (which corresponds to the MBR itself).

Based on these partitions, we can define the cardinal direction relation between two regions. For instance, if a region falls entirely in the North zone of the reference region, then the relation is "North".

In our problem:
- x is West of y: This means x falls entirely in the West zone of y.
- y is Northwest of z: This means y falls entirely in the Northwest zone of z.

Now, we need to determine the possible zones of z where x can fall. (Hmm, maybe I mean we need to determine the possible zones x can be relative to z.)

Oh, let's use a diagram approach. 

Imagine we have a grid. If x is West of y, then x is located to the left (or entirely on the left side) of y. 

If y is Northwest of z, then y is located to the upper left (or entirely in the upper left quadrant) of z.

Now, to determine the possible positions of x relative to z, let's try to visualize this:

z is our reference point. From z's perspective, y is in the Northwest zone. And from y's perspective, x is in the West zone.

So, starting from z, we go Northwest to reach y, and then West to reach x. This gives us a sort of "path" from z to x.

Using this path, x could be:
- Northwest of z: If the Northwest displacement from z to y is significant compared to the West displacement from y to x.
- West of z: If the West displacement from y to x is significant compared to the Northwest displacement from z to y, making the overall direction from z to x primarily westward.
- Or somewhere in between: For instance, WNW (west-northwest), which is not one of our cardinal directions.

Actually, since we're not restricted to strict angles but are using zones, x could fall in the North, Northwest, or West zones of z, depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z.

Actually, let me try to draw it using ASCII, to make it more concrete.

```
     NW       N       NE
       \      |      /
        \     |     /
         \    |    /
          \   |   /
           \  |  /
            \ | /
W ------------+------------ E
            / | \
           /  |  \
          /   |   \
         /    |    \
        /     |     \
       /      |      \
     SW       S       SE
```

In this diagram, the + represents the center (or the reference region z in our context). The zones are labeled with their respective cardinal direction.

Now, if y is in the NW zone and x is to the W of y, then x could be in:
1. The NW zone itself.
2. The W zone.
3. The SW zone (in theory, if y is close to the boundary of the NW and W zones, and x is directly west of y, it could even fall in the SW zone).

Actually, no, that's not right because that's assuming that x can be significantly "south" of y, which isn't implied by "West of". Let me redraw.

Okay, let's assume that "West of" means "directly west", with little or no north-south displacement. And "Northwest of" means "directly northwest", at an angle of 315 degrees.

```
          y
           \
            \
             \
              \
x ------------ z
```

In this diagram, z is at the origin, y is Northwest of z, and x is West of y. Given these strict interpretations, the relation between x and z would be West.

But that's a very restrictive interpretation. In reality, "West of" and "Northwest of" could have some variation. Let's consider that.

If y is Northwest of z, it means y is in the Northwest zone from z. This zone can be represented as:

```
     y (NW zone of z)
     |
     |
     |
     |
     z
```

Now, if x is West of y, it means x is in the West zone from y. This zone can be represented as:

```
     y
     |
x----|
     |
     |
```

Combining these, we get:

```
     y
     |
x----|
     |
     |
     |
     |
     z
```

From this diagram, it appears that x could be in the Northwest or West zone from z, depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z within their respective zones.

Actually, I'm still a bit worried that I'm being too restrictive. The cardinal direction relation "West" doesn't necessarily mean "directly west with no north-south displacement". It means that the region falls in the West zone of the reference region. Similarly, "Northwest" means the region falls in the Northwest zone of the reference region.

Maybe I'd better go back to basics. Let's define the nine zones around a reference region:

```
     NW       N       NE
       \      |      /
        \     |     /
         \    |    /
          \   |   /
           \  |  /
            \ | /
W ------------+------------ E
            / | \
           /  |  \
          /   |   \
         /    |    \
        /     |     \
       /      |      \
     SW       S       SE
```

In this diagram, the + represents the reference region. The zones are labeled with their respective cardinal direction.

Now, if y is in the NW zone from z, then y is somewhere in:

```
     NW
       \
        \
         \
          \
           \
            \
---------------
```

And if x is in the W zone from y, then x is somewhere in:

```
     ----------------------- (y is here)
     |
     |
     |
     |
     W
     |
     |
     ----------------------- 
```

Combining these, and considering all possible positions of y in the NW zone of z and all possible positions of x in the W zone of y, x could be in the NW, W, or SW zones of z.

But this doesn't really narrow it down! I guess this is because the definitions of "West" and "Northwest" are quite broad.

Actually, wait. I'm mixing up basic cardinal directions with cardinal direction relations for regions. Let me try to approach this differently.

In the context of cardinal direction relations for regions, a common approach is to use the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) to define the nine cardinal direction relations. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given a reference region, we can define nine zones based on its MBR: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B (where B, or Bounding Box, corresponds to the MBR itself).

Using this framework, "X is West of Y" means that X is entirely in the W zone of Y's MBR. Similarly, "Y is Northwest of Z" means that Y is entirely in the NW zone of Z's MBR.

Now, let's analyze the possible relations between X and Z.

From Y's perspective, X is in the W zone.
From Z's perspective, Y is in the NW zone.

Using these, we need to determine the possible zones of Z where X can fall.

Hmm, but this is getting quite abstract. Let's try to use a more concrete example or a visualization to understand this better.

Actually, let's approach this from a different angle. Instead of thinking about zones, let's think about the relative positions of the regions in terms of their coordinates.

If we associate each region with its MBR, then we have:

MBR(x) = [x_min, x_max] × [y_min, y_max]
MBR(y) = [y_min, y_max] × [y'_min, y'_max]
MBR(z) = [z_min, z_max] × [z'_min, z'_max]

Given information:
- x is West of y: This means x_max < y_min (x is entirely to the west of y).
- y is Northwest of z: This means y_max < z_min (y is entirely to the west of z) and y'_min > z'_max (y is entirely to the north of z).

From these, we can derive:
- x_max < y_min < z_min (x is entirely to the west of z, so x is in the W, NW, or SW zone of z).
- The relation between y'_min, y'_max, and x_min, x_max is not specified by "x is West of y", so we can't make a direct inference about the north-south relation between x and z.

So, based on the coordinates, x could be in the W, NW, or SW zone of z.

Let's work through a concrete example:

Let's say:
MBR(z) = [0, 1] × [0, 1]
Given that y is Northwest of z, we have y_max < 0 and y'_min > 1. For simplicity, let's say:
MBR(y) = [-2, -1] × [2, 3]
Now, given that x is West of y, we have x_max < -2. For simplicity, let's say:
MBR(x) = [-4, -3] × [2, 3]

In this example, the relation between x and z is Northwest, because x is entirely to the west and north of z.

But this is just one example. If we change the coordinates a bit, we can get a different relation:

MBR(z) = [0, 1] × [0, 1]
MBR(y) = [-2, -1] × [2, 3]
MBR(x) = [-4, -3] × [0, 1]

In this case, the relation between x and z is West.

And with another adjustment:

MBR(z) = [0, 1] × [0, 1]
MBR(y) = [-2, -1] × [0, 1]
MBR(x) = [-4, -3] × [-1, 0]

In this case, the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually let's think about this differently. Let me define regions that satisfy the constraints: x is West of y, and y is Northwest of z.

For region z, I'll consider it to be at the origin, so z = [0, 0].

If y is Northwest of z, then y is in the Northwest quadrant of z. So, y is at a point where the x-coordinate is negative and the y-coordinate is positive. Let's say y = [-a, b] where a > 0 and b > 0.

Now, if x is West of y, then x is to the west of y. So, x is at a point where the x-coordinate is smaller than that of y. Let's say x = [-a-c, b+d] where c > 0 and d can be any real number (positive, negative, or zero).

So, we have:
- z = [0, 0]
- y = [-a, b] where a > 0 and b > 0
- x = [-a-c, b+d] where c > 0 and d can be any real number

Now, let's analyze the possible directions from z to x:

The direction from z to x is determined by the angle from the positive x-axis (East) to the line connecting z to x. The angle is given by arctan((b+d)/(-a-c)).

For x to be Northwest of z, the angle should be between 90 and 180 degrees, which means b+d > 0 (the y-coordinate of x is positive).

For x to be West of z, the angle should be 180 degrees, which means b+d = 0 (the y-coordinate of x is zero).

For x to be Southwest of z, the angle should be between 180 and 270 degrees, which means b+d < 0 (the y-coordinate of x is negative).

Given that b > 0 (because y is Northwest of z), and d can be any real number:
- If d > -b, then x is Northwest of z.
- If d = -b, then x is West of z.
- If d < -b, then x is Southwest of z.

Since d can be any real number, all three relations are possible between x and z: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, I feel like I've been making things too complicated. Let's try one more time, with a more straightforward approach.

Let's say we're dealing with coordinates on a grid. Let me define the cardinal direction regions:

```
     NW       N       NE
       \      |      /
        \     |     /
         \    |    /
          \   |   /
           \  |  /
            \ | /
W ------------+------------ E
            / | \
           /  |  \
          /   |   \
         /    |    \
        /     |     \
       /      |      \
     SW       S       SE
```

In this diagram, the + represents the reference point, which in our case is region z. The zones are labeled with their respective cardinal direction.

Now, if y is in the NW zone of z, then y is somewhere in the top-left quadrant relative to z. And if x is in the W zone of y, then x is somewhere to the left of y.

Given these constraints, where can x be in relation to z? 

Well, x is to the left of y, which is in the top-left quadrant of z. So, x is even further to the left of z. The exact direction (NW, W, or SW) depends on the north-south position of x relative to z.

If x is further north than z, then x is in the NW zone of z.
If x is at the same north-south level as z, then x is in the W zone of z.
If x is further south than z, then x is in the SW zone of z.

All three of these scenarios are consistent with the given constraints: x is W of y, and y is NW of z. So, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

But I'm concerned that this approach might be too simplistic, especially if we're dealing with regions rather than points.

Actually, based on the context of the problem, it seems like we're dealing with cardinal direction relations between regions, not just points. So, I should be thinking about it in terms of the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of each region.

You know what, let me try one more time to think about this. I think I've been making an error in the representation of the problem.

Let's use the cardinal direction calculus (CDC) for regions, which uses the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of each region. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given a reference region, we can define nine cardinal direction relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B (where B, or Bounding Box, corresponds to the MBR itself).

Now, let's translate the given constraints:
- x is West of y: In terms of CDC, this means x falls entirely in the West zone of y's MBR. That is, the maximum x-coordinate of x is less than the minimum x-coordinate of y.
- y is Northwest of z: In terms of CDC, this means y falls entirely in the Northwest zone of z's MBR. That is, the maximum x-coordinate of y is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z, AND the minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- x_max < y_min < z_min (x is entirely to the west of z).
- Regarding the north-south position of x relative to z:
  - If x is entirely north of z (i.e., x_min_y > z_max_y), then x is Northwest of z.
  - If x overlaps with z in the north-south direction (i.e., there's a non-empty intersection of [x_min_y, x_max_y] and [z_min_y, z_max_y]), then x is West of z.
  - If x is entirely south of z (i.e., x_max_y < z_min_y), then x is Southwest of z.

Given that y is Northwest of z, and x is West of y, we know that x is always west of z (i.e., x_max < z_min). But the north-south relation between x and z depends on the specific positions of x, y, and z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, let me try just once more in a slightly different way. Let me enumerate a couple of examples.

Example 1:
Let's say z is at (0, 0) with MBR(z) = [0, 1] × [0, 1].
Given that y is Northwest of z, y could be at (-2, 2) with MBR(y) = [-2, -1] × [2, 3].
Given that x is West of y, x could be at (-4, 2) with MBR(x) = [-4, -3] × [2, 3].
In this case, x is entirely to the west and north of z, making the relation between x and z Northwest.

Example 2:
Let's again say z is at (0, 0) with MBR(z) = [0, 1] × [0, 1].
Given that y is Northwest of z, y could be at (-2, 2) with MBR(y) = [-2, -1] × [2, 3].
Given that x is West of y, x could be at (-4, 0) with MBR(x) = [-4, -3] × [0, 1].
In this case, x is entirely to the west of z and at the same north-south level as z, making the relation between x and z West.

Example 3:
Let's again say z is at (0, 0) with MBR(z) = [0, 1] × [0, 1].
Given that y is Northwest of z, y could be at (-2, 2) with MBR(y) = [-2, -1] × [2, 3].
Given that x is West of y, x could be at (-4, -1) with MBR(x) = [-4, -3] × [-1, 0].
In this case, x is entirely to the west and south of z, making the relation between x and z Southwest.

From these examples, it's clear that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Alright, I'm going to go with the answer: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, let me double-check whether "West" is the only possible relation between x and y. Looking back at the problem, it says "If region x is  West of region y." This means x is entirely to the west of y, so the cardinal direction relation between x and y is strictly "West". Similarly, the cardinal direction relation between y and z is strictly "Northwest".

Given these strict relations, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, let's try to see if any other configurations are possible.

Hmm, actually, what if y is completely inside the "Northwest" zone of z, but is very far to the north and only slightly to the west? In that case, if x is west of y, could x be so far to the north that it's actually in the "North" zone of z?

Let's see:
If z is at (0, 0), then y could be at (-1, 10). If x is west of y, then x could be at (-2, 10).

From z's perspective, the direction to x is arctan(10/(-2)) ≈ arctan(-5) ≈ -79 degrees (or 281 degrees if we convert to the 0-360 degree range). This is indeed in the West or Northwest-West direction, not the North direction. I think this aligns with our conclusion that the possible relations are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Let's check if it's possible for x to be Northeast or East of z. This seems very counterintuitive given the constraints, but let's see:

If z is at (0, 0), then y being Northwest of z means y is in the Northwest quadrant, let's say at (-1, 1). If x is West of y, then x is even further to the west, let's say at (-3, 1). From z's perspective, the direction to x is arctan(1/(-3)) ≈ arctan(-0.33) ≈ -18 degrees (or 342 degrees in the 0-360 degree range). This is in the Northwest direction, not Northeast or East. Again, this aligns with our conclusion.

Finally, let's check if x can be in the South or Southeast or East direction from z:

If z is at (0, 0), then y being Northwest of z means y is in the Northwest quadrant, let's say at (-1, 1). If x is West of y, then x is even further to the west, let's say at (-3, 0). From z's perspective, the direction to x is arctan(0/(-3)) = 0 degrees or 180 degrees (depending on the reference). Given the context, it's 180 degrees, which is West.

So, based on the constraints, x is always to the west of z. The north-south relation between x and z can vary, leading to the possible cardinal direction relations: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, let's try to think about this using a sketch.

```
    ^
    |
 y  |           x is west of y:  x  <--  y

 |  |           y is northwest of z:   z  ---->  y

    +--------------------------------->
```

This is not a very good sketch, but the idea is that y is to the northwest of z, so it's up and to the left from z. And x is to the west of y, so x is to the left of y. The question is, from the perspective of z, in which directions can x be?

If y is far to the northwest of z, and x is only slightly to the west of y, then x is still in the northwest of z. But if y is only slightly to the northwest of z, and x is far to the west of y, then x might be more to the west-northwest or even purely to the west of z. And if y is not very far to the north of z, and x is slightly to the south of y, then x might be to the southwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Alright, I'm confident in this answer:

Given that x is West of y, and y is Northwest of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, and Southwest.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
Northwest, West, Southwest
