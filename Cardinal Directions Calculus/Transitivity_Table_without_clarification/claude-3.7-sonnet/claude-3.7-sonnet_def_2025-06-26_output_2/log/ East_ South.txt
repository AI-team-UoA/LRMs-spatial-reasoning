PROMPT: Let  East and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's solve this problem step by step. 

First, let me understand the given information:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is South of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

To do this, I need to think about how cardinal directions work. Let's consider a 2D coordinate system where:
- North means increasing y-coordinate
- South means decreasing y-coordinate
- East means increasing x-coordinate
- West means decreasing x-coordinate

Given that:
- Region x is East of region y: This means x has a larger x-coordinate than y
- Region y is South of region z: This means y has a smaller y-coordinate than z

So if we denote the coordinates of x, y, and z as (x₁, x₂), (y₁, y₂), and (z₁, z₂) respectively, then:
- x₁ > y₁ (x is East of y)
- y₂ < z₂ (y is South of z)

Now, let's think about the relationship between x and z:
- For the x-coordinate: We know x₁ > y₁, but we don't have a direct relationship between y₁ and z₁. So x₁ could be greater than, equal to, or less than z₁.
- For the y-coordinate: We know y₂ < z₂, but we don't have a direct relationship between x₂ and y₂. So x₂ could be greater than, equal to, or less than z₂.

Let's consider the possible relations based on these:

1. If x₁ > z₁ and x₂ = z₂, then x is East of z.
2. If x₁ > z₁ and x₂ > z₂, then x is Northeast of z.
3. If x₁ > z₁ and x₂ < z₂, then x is Southeast of z.
4. If x₁ = z₁ and x₂ > z₂, then x is North of z.
5. If x₁ = z₁ and x₂ < z₂, then x is South of z.
6. If x₁ < z₁ and x₂ > z₂, then x is Northwest of z.
7. If x₁ < z₁ and x₂ = z₂, then x is West of z.
8. If x₁ < z₁ and x₂ < z₂, then x is Southwest of z.

Let's see if we can eliminate any of these possibilities based on the given information.

Wait, I need to be more careful about this. Let me draw a diagram to help reason through this problem:

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity.
Since y is South of z, y could be at (0, -1).
Since x is East of y, x could be at (1, -1).

In this case, x would be Southeast of z.

But there are other possibilities too. Let's try another configuration:
z at (0, 0)
y at (0, -1)
x at (0.5, -0.5)

In this case, x would be Southeast of z too.

But what if:
z at (0, 0)
y at (-1, -1)
x at (0, -1)

Now, x would be South of z.

Let me try one more:
z at (0, 0)
y at (-1, -1)
x at (0, -2)

In this case, x would be Southeast of z.

I'm starting to see a pattern. It seems like x can be Southeast or South of z, but I need to be more rigorous.

Let's reconsider the problem using a different approach. If y is South of z, then y must be somewhere in the half-plane below z. If x is East of y, then x must be somewhere in the half-plane to the right of y.

Now, if we combine these:
- y can be anywhere below z
- x can be anywhere to the right of y

The question is: What's the region where x can be in relation to z?

If y is directly below z (same x-coordinate), then x can be to the right of y, which means x is in the quadrant that's Southeast of z.

But if y is somewhere below and to the left of z, then x can be to the right of y but still potentially directly below z, which would make x South of z.

Similarly, if y is below and to the right of z, then x, being to the right of y, would be further to the right of z, making x Southeast of z.

It doesn't seem like x can be East of z or any other direction based on the given constraints.

Actually, let's be even more rigorous. I'll try to determine the possible region for x in relation to z based on the given constraints.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is South of region z

Let's denote the coordinates as before: x(x₁, x₂), y(y₁, y₂), z(z₁, z₂).

From the constraints:
- x₁ > y₁ (x is East of y)
- y₂ < z₂ (y is South of z)

Now, let's think about the relationship between x and z:
- For the x-coordinate: We know x₁ > y₁, but we don't know the relationship between y₁ and z₁. So, x₁ can be greater than, equal to, or less than z₁.
- For the y-coordinate: We know y₂ < z₂, but we don't know the relationship between x₂ and y₂. So, x₂ can be greater than, equal to, or less than z₂.

However, the constraints also imply that x₂ can be related to z₂ in any way, as there's no direct constraint on their relationship. 

So, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- If x₁ > z₁ and x₂ > z₂, then x is Northeast of z.
- If x₁ > z₁ and x₂ = z₂, then x is East of z.
- If x₁ > z₁ and x₂ < z₂, then x is Southeast of z.
- If x₁ = z₁ and x₂ > z₂, then x is North of z.
- If x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂, then x is at the same location as z.
- If x₁ = z₁ and x₂ < z₂, then x is South of z.
- If x₁ < z₁ and x₂ > z₂, then x is Northwest of z.
- If x₁ < z₁ and x₂ = z₂, then x is West of z.
- If x₁ < z₁ and x₂ < z₂, then x is Southwest of z.

But wait, there's a constraint that we haven't fully utilized yet: the relationship between y and both x and z.

If y is South of z, it means y₂ < z₂. 
If x is East of y, it means x₁ > y₁.

We haven't established a direct constraint on the x-coordinate of y in relation to z, or the y-coordinate of x in relation to y. But we can derive some consequences from the given constraints.

For y to be South of z, we know:
- y₂ < z₂
- No constraint on y₁ vs z₁

For x to be East of y, we know:
- x₁ > y₁
- No constraint on x₂ vs y₂

Combining these, we know:
- x₁ > y₁ (from x is East of y)
- y₂ < z₂ (from y is South of z)

This still doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z. But it does tell us the region where x can be in relation to z.

Let's think of it this way: if y is somewhere in the half-plane south of z, and x is somewhere in the half-plane east of y, then what's the possible region for x in relation to z?

If y is directly below z (i.e., y₁ = z₁), then x, being east of y, is also east of z. This would make x Southeast of z.

But y could also be southwest of z (i.e., y₁ < z₁). In that case, x, being east of y, could be southeast of z, south of z, or even southwest of z, depending on how far east x is from y.

Similarly, y could be southeast of z (i.e., y₁ > z₁). In that case, x, being east of y, is also east of z and could be east of z, southeast of z, or northeast of z, depending on the y-coordinate of x.

Actually, let's approach this a bit differently. Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity.

Given:
- Region y is South of region z: This means y is somewhere in the half-plane below z. So, y could be at any point (y₁, y₂) where y₂ < 0.
- Region x is East of region y: This means x is somewhere in the half-plane to the right of y. So, x could be at any point (x₁, x₂) where x₁ > y₁.

Now, let's consider a few examples to understand the possible relationships:

1. If y is at (0, -1), then y is directly below z. If x is at (1, -1), then x is east of y and southeast of z. But x could also be at (1, 0) (east of z) or (1, 1) (northeast of z).

2. If y is at (-1, -1), then y is southwest of z. If x is at (0, -1), then x is east of y but south of z. But x could also be at (0, 0) (same as z) or (0, 1) (north of z).

3. If y is at (1, -1), then y is southeast of z. If x is at (2, -1), then x is east of y and southeast of z. But x could also be at (2, 0) (east of z) or (2, 1) (northeast of z).

From these examples, it seems like x can be east, northeast, southeast, north, south, or even at the same location as z.

But wait, I realize I was making a mental error with the third example. If y is at (1, -1) and x is at (2, -1), then x is indeed southeast of z, not just east of y.

Let me rethink this to make sure I have the right intuition. 

Let's approach this systematically. We're given two constraints:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is South of region z

We can represent the coordinates of x, y, and z as x(x₁, x₂), y(y₁, y₂), z(z₁, z₂).

From the constraints:
- x₁ > y₁ (x is East of y)
- y₂ < z₂ (y is South of z)

Now, we want to determine the possible relations between x and z. For this, we need to consider the possible relationships between x₁ and z₁, as well as x₂ and z₂.

For the x-coordinate:
- We know x₁ > y₁.
- The relationship between y₁ and z₁ is not constrained by the given information. So y₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁.
- As a result, x₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁, depending on the values of y₁ and how much greater x₁ is than y₁.

For the y-coordinate:
- We know y₂ < z₂.
- The relationship between x₂ and y₂ is not constrained by the given information. So x₂ can be less than, equal to, or greater than y₂.
- As a result, x₂ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₂, depending on the values of y₂ and how x₂ compares to y₂.

Combining all possibilities, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- If x₁ > z₁ and x₂ > z₂, then x is Northeast of z.
- If x₁ > z₁ and x₂ = z₂, then x is East of z.
- If x₁ > z₁ and x₂ < z₂, then x is Southeast of z.
- If x₁ = z₁ and x₂ > z₂, then x is North of z.
- If x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂, then x is at the same location as z.
- If x₁ = z₁ and x₂ < z₂, then x is South of z.
- If x₁ < z₁ and x₂ > z₂, then x is Northwest of z.
- If x₁ < z₁ and x₂ = z₂, then x is West of z.
- If x₁ < z₁ and x₂ < z₂, then x is Southwest of z.

However, there's a constraint: x₁ > y₁ and y₂ < z₂. If we consider all possible values of y₁ and y₂ that satisfy these constraints, then x₁ can still be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁, and x₂ can still be less than, equal to, or greater than z₂.

So, it seems like all of the above relationships are possible.

Actually I think I need to be more careful again and consider if some of these cases are actually impossible. Let me try a more direct approach.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means x is somewhere in the half-plane to the right of y, or x₁ > y₁.
- Region y is South of region z: This means y is somewhere in the half-plane below z, or y₂ < z₂.

Let's consider the possible regions for y in relation to z. Since y is South of z, y can be anywhere in the half-plane below z.

Now, for each possible position of y, let's determine where x can be in relation to z.

If y is directly below z (i.e., y₁ = z₁), then x, being east of y, is also east of z. This would make x either East, Northeast, or Southeast of z, depending on the value of x₂ relative to z₂.

If y is southwest of z (i.e., y₁ < z₁), then x, being east of y, can be anywhere in the half-plane to the right of y. This means x₁ > y₁, but x₁ can still be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁. So, x can be Southwest, South, Southeast, West, at the same location as z, East, Northwest, North, or Northeast of z, depending on the specific values of x₁ and x₂.

If y is southeast of z (i.e., y₁ > z₁), then x, being east of y, is also east of z. This would make x either East, Northeast, or Southeast of z, depending on the value of x₂ relative to z₂.

But, there's still the constraint y₂ < z₂ (y is South of z). This means that even if y is southwest of z, it's still below z in terms of the y-coordinate. Similarly, if y is southeast of z, it's still below z in terms of the y-coordinate.

But I can't use the constraint from y to directly constrain the position of x. There's no direct constraint from the problem statement about the y-coordinate of x.

Actually, I don't need to consider each case. I can try to directly constrain the position of x based on the given constraints.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means x₁ > y₁.
- Region y is South of region z: This means y₂ < z₂.

From these constraints, can we derive a direct relationship between x and z?

For the x-coordinate:
- We know x₁ > y₁.
- The relationship between y₁ and z₁ is not directly constrained by the given information.
- So, x₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁, depending on the values of y₁ and how much greater x₁ is than y₁.

For the y-coordinate:
- We know y₂ < z₂.
- The relationship between x₂ and y₂ is not directly constrained by the given information.
- So, x₂ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₂, depending on the values of y₂ and how x₂ compares to y₂.

Hmm...I'm still not getting a direct constraint on the relationship between x and z. Let's try a graphical approach.

Hmm...what I'm realizing is that we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between x and z based on the given constraints. The constraints tell us:
- x is East of y: This constrains the x-coordinate of x in relation to y.
- y is South of z: This constrains the y-coordinate of y in relation to z.

But these constraints don't provide a direct relationship between the coordinates of x and z.

I think I'll try once more with a different approach.

Actually, let me consider a key point. If we're told y is south of z, then the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z. But the x-coordinates of y and z can be anything.

Similarly, if we're told x is east of y, then the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y. But the y-coordinates of x and y can be anything.

Given these, the constraint "y is south of z" tells us y₂ < z₂, and the constraint "x is east of y" tells us x₁ > y₁.

But from these, we can't derive a direct constraint on the relationship between x₁ and z₁, or between x₂ and z₂. This means that x can be in any of the eight cardinal directions in relation to z, or even at the same location as z, depending on the specific values of y₁ and y₂.

So I think based on the constraints, the relation between x and z can be any of the cardinal or ordinal directions.

I think I have to take a step back and reconsider.

Let's denote the positions of regions x, y, and z as points in a 2D plane: x(x₁, x₂), y(y₁, y₂), z(z₁, z₂).

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means x₁ > y₁. The y-coordinates can be anything.
- Region y is South of region z: This means y₂ < z₂. The x-coordinates can be anything.

Given these constraints, we need to find the possible relations between x and z. To do this, we need to determine the possible relationships between x₁ and z₁, as well as x₂ and z₂.

For the x-coordinate, since we know x₁ > y₁, and the relationship between y₁ and z₁ can be anything, x₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁. So, relative to z, x can be on the left, same x-value, or right.

Similarly, for the y-coordinate, since y₂ < z₂, and the relationship between x₂ and y₂ can be anything, x₂ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₂. So, relative to z, x can be below, same y-value, or above.

Given the cardinal and ordinal directions, if:
- x is to the right of z (x₁ > z₁) and at the same y-level as z (x₂ = z₂), then x is East of z.
- x is to the right of z (x₁ > z₁) and above z (x₂ > z₂), then x is Northeast of z.
- x is to the right of z (x₁ > z₁) and below z (x₂ < z₂), then x is Southeast of z.
- x is at the same x-level as z (x₁ = z₁) and above z (x₂ > z₂), then x is North of z.
- x is at the same location as z (x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂).
- x is at the same x-level as z (x₁ = z₁) and below z (x₂ < z₂), then x is South of z.
- x is to the left of z (x₁ < z₁) and above z (x₂ > z₂), then x is Northwest of z.
- x is to the left of z (x₁ < z₁) and at the same y-level as z (x₂ = z₂), then x is West of z.
- x is to the left of z (x₁ < z₁) and below z (x₂ < z₂), then x is Southwest of z.

So, with the given constraints, the relation between x and z can be East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, Southwest, or x can be at the same location as z.

Actually, I think I made a mistake. let's think through the case where x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂, which means x and z are at the same location.

We know "x is East of y" (i.e., x₁ > y₁) and "y is South of z" (i.e., y₂ < z₂). If x and z are at the same location, then x₁ = z₁. But given that x₁ > y₁, this means z₁ > y₁. However, the constraint "y is South of z" doesn't place any restriction on the x-coordinates, so y₁ can be anything. So, y₁ can be less than z₁, which doesn't contradict the constraint.

Similarly, if x and z are at the same location, then x₂ = z₂. Given that y₂ < z₂ (from "y is South of z"), this means y₂ < x₂. The constraint "x is East of y" doesn't place any restriction on the y-coordinates, so this doesn't contradict the constraint.

So, it's possible for x and z to be at the same location given the constraints.

Actually, I think I should revisit the definition of "East" and "South" in the context of cardinal directions. In a strict sense:
- "East" means directly to the right with the same y-coordinate.
- "South" means directly below with the same x-coordinate.

But in a more general sense:
- "East" could mean anywhere in the eastern half-plane, which is the half-plane to the right of the reference point.
- "South" could mean anywhere in the southern half-plane, which is the half-plane below the reference point.

I think the problem statement is using the general sense of cardinal directions. So:
- "x is East of y" means x₁ > y₁, regardless of their y-coordinates.
- "y is South of z" means y₂ < z₂, regardless of their x-coordinates.

Given this understanding, the possible relations between x and z can be any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions, or x can be at the same location as z.

Actually, I think I need to be more careful about the definition. Let me check what the typical definition of "East" and "South" is in the context of regions.

Actually, the way I understood it in my previous analysis is correct. When we say "region x is East of region y", it means that the x-coordinate of any point in region x is greater than the x-coordinate of any point in region y. Similarly, when we say "region y is South of region z", it means that the y-coordinate of any point in region y is less than the y-coordinate of any point in region z.

Given these definitions, the constraints tell us:
- x₁ > y₁ (from "x is East of y")
- y₂ < z₂ (from "y is South of z")

From these, we can't derive a direct constraint on the relationship between x₁ and z₁, or between x₂ and z₂. This means that x can be in any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions in relation to z, or even at the same location as z, depending on the specific values of y₁ and y₂.

Actually, I think at this point I should be referring to the work that's been done on region connection calculus (RCC) and cardinal direction calculus (CDC). From a CDC perspective, when we say "region x is East of region y", it typically means that the westernmost point of x is to the east of the easternmost point of y. Similarly, when we say "region y is South of region z", it means that the northernmost point of y is to the south of the southernmost point of z.

With these definitions, the constraints give us:
- min(x₁) > max(y₁) (from "x is East of y")
- max(y₂) < min(z₂) (from "y is South of z")

But even with these more precise definitions, we still can't derive a direct constraint on the relationship between the coordinates of x and z.

Actually, let's approach this from a different angle. Let's consider the possible positions of y relative to z, and then determine the possible positions of x relative to both y and z.

Given:
- Region y is South of region z: This means y is somewhere in the half-plane below z.
- Region x is East of region y: This means x is somewhere in the half-plane to the right of y.

Now, let's consider a coordinate system where the origin (0, 0) is at the center of region z.

Since y is South of z, y is somewhere in the half-plane below z. This means y is somewhere in the region with y-coordinate less than 0.

Now, for each possible position of y, let's determine where x can be in relation to z.

If y is directly below z (i.e., with x-coordinate 0), then x, being east of y, is somewhere in the half-plane to the right of y. This region, to the right of y, intersects with all eight possible cardinal and ordinal directions from z, depending on the specific position of x.

If y is southwest of z (i.e., with x-coordinate less than 0 and y-coordinate less than 0), then x, being east of y, can be anywhere in the half-plane to the right of y. Again, this region intersects with all eight possible cardinal and ordinal directions from z.

If y is southeast of z (i.e., with x-coordinate greater than 0 and y-coordinate less than 0), then x, being east of y, is also in the half-plane to the right of z. This restricts x to be in one of the directions: East, Northeast, or Southeast of z.

Hmm, looks like we're narrowing down the possible relations. Let's continue with this approach.

Actually, let's be more systematic. Given that y is South of z, y can be:
1. Directly South of z (same x-coordinate)
2. Southeast of z (x-coordinate greater than z's)
3. Southwest of z (x-coordinate less than z's)

Now, for each of these positions of y, let's determine where x can be in relation to z, given that x is East of y.

Case 1: y is directly South of z.
- Since x is East of y, x has a greater x-coordinate than y, which is the same as z's x-coordinate. This means x has a greater x-coordinate than z.
- The y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z's y-coordinate.
- So, x can be East, Northeast, or Southeast of z.

Case 2: y is Southeast of z.
- Since x is East of y, and y is already East of z, x is even further East of z.
- The y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z's y-coordinate.
- So, x can be East, Northeast, or Southeast of z.

Case 3: y is Southwest of z.
- Since x is East of y, x has a greater x-coordinate than y, which is less than z's x-coordinate. This means x's x-coordinate can be less than, equal to, or greater than z's x-coordinate.
- The y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z's y-coordinate.
- So, x can be in any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions in relation to z, or even at the same location as z.

Combining all these cases, the possible relations between x and z are East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, Southwest, or x can be at the same location as z.

Actually, I don't think that's right. I'm trying to be more careful but let's think more clearly about the constraints.

For simplicity, let's consider regions as points, though I think the reasoning extends to regions.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y. So, x₁ > y₁.
- Region y is South of region z: This means the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z. So, y₂ < z₂.

Now, let's consider the possible positions of y relative to z, and then determine the possible positions of x relative to both y and z.

Given that y is South of z, y can be at any x-coordinate relative to z. So, y₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁.

Now, for each of these cases, let's determine where x can be in relation to z, given that x is East of y.

Case 1: y₁ < z₁ (y is to the left of z).
- Since x₁ > y₁, x₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁, depending on the specific values of y₁ and how much greater x₁ is than y₁.
- Given that y₂ < z₂ (y is below z), the y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z₂, depending on the specific value of x₂.
- So, x can be in any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions in relation to z, or even at the same location as z.

Case 2: y₁ = z₁ (y is directly below z).
- Since x₁ > y₁, x₁ > z₁.
- Given that y₂ < z₂ (y is below z), the y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z₂, depending on the specific value of x₂.
- So, x can be East, Northeast, or Southeast of z.

Case 3: y₁ > z₁ (y is to the right of z).
- Since x₁ > y₁, x₁ > z₁.
- Given that y₂ < z₂ (y is below z), the y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z₂, depending on the specific value of x₂.
- So, x can be East, Northeast, or Southeast of z.

Combining all these cases, the possible relations between x and z are East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, Southwest, or x can be at the same location as z.

Actually, I think I made an error in Case 1 above. If y₁ < z₁ (y is to the left of z) and y₂ < z₂ (y is below z), then y is Southwest of z.

If x₁ > y₁ (x is to the right of y), then x₁ can still be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁. And the y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z₂.

So, x can be Southwest, South, Southeast, West, East, Northwest, North, Northeast of z, or even at the same location as z.

But wait, there's a constraint I'm not considering. If y is Southwest of z, and x is East of y, then x can't be at the same location as z unless y₁ = z₁, which contradicts the assumption that y₁ < z₁.

Actually, let's rethink this step by step.

If we visualize this problem, we are given that:
- Region y is South of region z
- Region x is East of region y

We need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

When we say "y is South of z", we mean that the entirety of region y is below region z. Similarly, when we say "x is East of y", we mean that the entirety of region x is to the right of region y.

Now, given these constraints, let's determine the possible positions of x relative to z.

The fact that y is South of z constrains y to be below z. But it doesn't place any restriction on the x-coordinate of y relative to z. Similarly, the fact that x is East of y constrains x to be to the right of y. But it doesn't place any restriction on the y-coordinate of x relative to y.

So, the x-coordinate of y can be less than, equal to, or greater than the x-coordinate of z. And the y-coordinate of x can be less than, equal to, or greater than the y-coordinate of y.

Let's consider all possible cases:

Case 1: y is directly South of z (same x-coordinate).
- x, being East of y, is also East of z.
- The y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z.
- So, x can be East, Northeast, or Southeast of z.

Case 2: y is Southwest of z (y is to the left and below z).
- x, being East of y, can be to the left, same x-coordinate, or to the right of z, depending on how far East x is from y.
- The y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z.
- So, x can be in any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions in relation to z.

Case 3: y is Southeast of z (y is to the right and below z).
- x, being East of y, is also to the right of z.
- The y-coordinate of x can be anything in relation to z.
- So, x can be East, Northeast, or Southeast of z.

Combining all these cases, the possible relations between x and z are East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Hmm, but I still think something isn't right here. Case 2 says x can be in any of the eight directions, which seems too broad.

Actually, let's be more careful about the definition of "East" and "South" in the context of regions. When we say "region x is East of region y", it means that every point in x is to the east of every point in y. Similarly, when we say "region y is South of region z", it means that every point in y is to the south of every point in z.

With this more precise definition, let's reconsider the problem.

Given:
- Region y is South of region z: This means the northernmost point of y is to the south of the southernmost point of z.
- Region x is East of region y: This means the westernmost point of x is to the east of the easternmost point of y.

Now, let's determine the possible positions of x relative to z.

The fact that y is South of z constrains y to be entirely below z. But it doesn't place any restriction on the x-coordinates of y relative to z. Similarly, the fact that x is East of y constrains x to be entirely to the right of y. But it doesn't place any restriction on the y-coordinates of x relative to y.

Let's consider all possible cases:

Case 1: y is directly below z (the x-extent of y overlaps with the x-extent of z).
- Since x is entirely to the right of y, and y overlaps with z in terms of x-coordinates, the westernmost point of x can be to the east of the easternmost point of z, or x can overlap with z in terms of x-coordinates, or the easternmost point of x can be to the west of the westernmost point of z.
- In terms of y-coordinates, x can be entirely above z, overlap with z, or be entirely below z.
- So, the possible relations between x and z can be East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Case 2: y is to the left of z (the easternmost point of y is to the west of the westernmost point of z).
- Since x is entirely to the right of y, the westernmost point of x can be to the east of the easternmost point of z, or x can overlap with z in terms of x-coordinates, or the easternmost point of x can be to the west of the westernmost point of z.
- In terms of y-coordinates, x can be entirely above z, overlap with z, or be entirely below z.
- So, the possible relations between x and z can be East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Case 3: y is to the right of z (the westernmost point of y is to the east of the easternmost point of z).
- Since x is entirely to the right of y, and y is entirely to the right of z, x is also entirely to the right of z.
- In terms of y-coordinates, x can be entirely above z, overlap with z, or be entirely below z.
- So, the possible relations between x and z can be East, Northeast, or Southeast.

Hmm, Cases 1 and 2 seem to give the same result, which is that x can be in any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions in relation to z. But that doesn't sound right.

Let me reconsider.

Hmm, I think I'm not being careful about the spatial relations of the different directions. Let me try with a clearer representation. I'll use a 2D grid with:
- x-axis from west (negative) to east (positive)
- y-axis from south (negative) to north (positive)

Given:
- Region y is South of region z: This means the y-coordinate (or y-coordinates) of region y is less than the y-coordinate (or y-coordinates) of region z.
- Region x is East of region y: This means the x-coordinate (or x-coordinates) of region x is greater than the x-coordinate (or x-coordinates) of region y.

Now, let's determine the possible positions of x relative to z.

For simplicity, let's consider regions as points. The reasoning should extend to regions.

Given that y is South of z, the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z. So, y₂ < z₂.

Given that x is East of y, the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y. So, x₁ > y₁.

Now, let's consider the possible positions of y relative to z in terms of x-coordinates, and then determine the possible positions of x relative to both y and z.

Case 1: y₁ < z₁ (y is to the west of z).
- Since x₁ > y₁, x₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁.
- Since y₂ < z₂ (y is to the south of z) and there's no constraint on the y-coordinate of x relative to y, x₂ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₂.
- So, x can be in any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions in relation to z.

Case 2: y₁ = z₁ (y is directly south of z).
- Since x₁ > y₁, x₁ > z₁.
- Since y₂ < z₂ (y is to the south of z) and there's no constraint on the y-coordinate of x relative to y, x₂ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₂.
- So, x can be East, Northeast, or Southeast of z.

Case 3: y₁ > z₁ (y is to the east of z).
- Since x₁ > y₁, x₁ > z₁.
- Since y₂ < z₂ (y is to the south of z) and there's no constraint on the y-coordinate of x relative to y, x₂ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₂.
- So, x can be East, Northeast, or Southeast of z.

Combining all these cases, the possible relations between x and z are East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, or Southwest. But this isn't right, because it's essentially all eight directions. Let's revisit our thinking.

Wait, I think I might actually be right. Let's delve deeper into Case 1.

In Case 1, y₁ < z₁ (y is to the west of z) and y₂ < z₂ (y is to the south of z). This places y at the southwest of z.

Given that x₁ > y₁ (x is to the east of y), x₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁, depending on how far east x is from y.

Let's consider sub-cases:

Case 1.1: x₁ < z₁ (x is to the west of z).
- Since x₂ can be anything in relation to z₂, x can be Southwest, West, or Northwest of z.

Case 1.2: x₁ = z₁ (x is at the same longitude as z).
- Since x₂ can be anything in relation to z₂, x can be South, at the same location as z, or North of z.

Case 1.3: x₁ > z₁ (x is to the east of z).
- Since x₂ can be anything in relation to z₂, x can be Southeast, East, or Northeast of z.

Combining these sub-cases, in Case 1 (when y is at the southwest of z), x can be in any of the eight cardinal or ordinal directions in relation to z.

So, it seems like my earlier conclusion is correct. The possible relations between x and z are East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, wait. In Case 1.2, I said x can be at the same location as z. But this doesn't make sense if x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂, because that would mean x and z are at the same location. But we know x₁ > y₁ and y₁ < z₁, which means x₁ > y₁ < z₁. If x₁ = z₁, then we have z₁ > y₁ < z₁, which is a contradiction.

So, in Case 1.2, x can be South or North of z, but not at the same location as z.

Given this correction, the possible relations between x and z are East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, let's make sure I'm thinking about this correctly.

In Case 1, y₁ < z₁ (y is to the west of z) and y₂ < z₂ (y is to the south of z).

Given that x₁ > y₁ (x is to the east of y), we have x₁ > y₁ < z₁. This doesn't constraint the relation between x₁ and z₁. So, x₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁.

Let's consider the case where x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂. This means x and z are at the same location. Is this consistent with the given constraints?

We know x₁ > y₁ (from "x is East of y") and y₂ < z₂ (from "y is South of z"). If x₁ = z₁, this means z₁ > y₁. There's no contradiction here; z can be to the east of y.

If x₂ = z₂, there's no relation to check against y₂ because the constraint "x is East of y" doesn't place any restriction on the y-coordinates.

So, it's possible for x and z to be at the same location given the constraints.

But wait, I just realized something. If x and z are at the same location, then x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂. But we also know x₁ > y₁ and y₂ < z₂. If x₂ = z₂, then x₂ > y₂. But there's no constraint on the relationship between x₂ and y₂ from the given constraints. So, it's possible for x₂ to be equal to y₂ or even less than y₂. This means x and z can be at the same location.

Actually, I think I'm not doing the right reasoning again with the cases "x and z are at the same location". Let's go through this methodically.

We know:
- x₁ > y₁ (from "x is East of y")
- y₂ < z₂ (from "y is South of z")

For x and z to be at the same location, we need x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂.

Given that x₁ > y₁, if x₁ = z₁, then z₁ > y₁. This is consistent with the first constraint.

Given that y₂ < z₂, if x₂ = z₂, then y₂ < x₂. There's no direct constraint on the relationship between x₂ and y₂ from the given information, so this is a possibility.

So, it's possible for x and z to be at the same location.

Actually, wait I think I'm making another mistake. I'm not sure that "x is east of y" means that "x₁ > y₁" exactly. Let me reconsider the definitions.

In a 2D plane:
- "East" refers to the direction along the positive x-axis.
- "South" refers to the direction along the negative y-axis.

When we say "region x is East of region y", it means that every point in x is to the east of every point in y. So, the westernmost point of x is to the east of the easternmost point of y. Similarly, when we say "region y is South of region z", it means that every point in y is to the south of every point in z. So, the northernmost point of y is to the south of the southernmost point of z.

Let's denote the coordinates of the regions as:
- Region x: (x_min, x_max) for x-coordinates, (y_min, y_max) for y-coordinates.
- Region y: (y_min, y_max) for x-coordinates, (z_min, z_max) for y-coordinates.
- Region z: (z_min, z_max) for x-coordinates, (w_min, w_max) for y-coordinates.

Actually, the notation is getting confusing. Let's change it:
- Region x: (x_x_min, x_x_max) for x-coordinates, (x_y_min, x_y_max) for y-coordinates.
- Region y: (y_x_min, y_x_max) for x-coordinates, (y_y_min, y_y_max) for y-coordinates.
- Region z: (z_x_min, z_x_max) for x-coordinates, (z_y_min, z_y_max) for y-coordinates.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means x_x_min > y_x_max.
- Region y is South of region z: This means y_y_max < z_y_min.

For x and z to be at the same location, we would need x_x_min = z_x_min, x_x_max = z_x_max, x_y_min = z_y_min, and x_y_max = z_y_max.

Given the constraint "x is East of y", we have x_x_min > y_x_max. If x and z are at the same location, then z_x_min = x_x_min > y_x_max. This means z is to the east of y, which is consistent with the constraints.

Given the constraint "y is South of z", we have y_y_max < z_y_min. If x and z are at the same location, then x_y_min = z_y_min > y_y_max. This means x is to the north of y, which is consistent with the constraint "y is South of z" but doesn't follow directly from the constraint "x is East of y".

So, for x and z to be at the same location, x must also be to the north of y. But the constraint "x is East of y" doesn't place any restriction on the y-coordinates of x relative to y. So, x can be at the same location as z only if it's also to the north of y, which is a possibility but not a necessity.

Actually, I think I'm making this problem more complicated than it is. In cardinal direction calculus, if y is South of z then y is exactly below z (in the south direction), with the same x-coordinates. Similarly, if x is East of y, then x is exactly to the right of y (in the east direction), with the same y-coordinates.

Actually, the more I think about the original problem statement, the more I think that when it says "region x is East of region y", it means that region x is entirely to the east of region y, and when it says "region y is South of region z", it means that region y is entirely to the south of region z. I think the rest of my reasoning was correct.

Assuming regions are points for simplicity, let's reason again from the beginning.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y. So, x₁ > y₁.
- Region y is South of region z: This means the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z. So, y₂ < z₂.

Now, let's determine the possible positions of x relative to z.

For the x-coordinate, since we know x₁ > y₁, and the relationship between y₁ and z₁ can be anything, x₁ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₁. So, relative to z, x can be on the left, same x-value, or right.

Similarly, for the y-coordinate, since y₂ < z₂, and the relationship between x₂ and y₂ can be anything, x₂ can be less than, equal to, or greater than z₂. So, relative to z, x can be below, same y-value, or above.

Now, if I consider the 3 x 3 grid of possibilities, I get 9 cells:

1. x₁ < z₁ and x₂ < z₂: x is Southwest of z.
2. x₁ = z₁ and x₂ < z₂: x is South of z.
3. x₁ > z₁ and x₂ < z₂: x is Southeast of z.
4. x₁ < z₁ and x₂ = z₂: x is West of z.
5. x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂: x is at the same location as z.
6. x₁ > z₁ and x₂ = z₂: x is East of z.
7. x₁ < z₁ and x₂ > z₂: x is Northwest of z.
8. x₁ = z₁ and x₂ > z₂: x is North of z.
9. x₁ > z₁ and x₂ > z₂: x is Northeast of z.

But I know from the constraints:
- x₁ > y₁ (from "x is East of y")
- y₂ < z₂ (from "y is South of z")

Are all of these 9 cells possible given these constraints? Let's check.

1. x₁ < z₁ and x₂ < z₂: This requires y₁ < x₁ < z₁ and y₂ < z₂, with no constraint on the relationship between x₂ and y₂. There's no contradiction, so this is possible.
2. x₁ = z₁ and x₂ < z₂: This requires y₁ < x₁ = z₁ and y₂ < z₂, with no constraint on the relationship between x₂ and y₂. There's no contradiction, so this is possible.
3. x₁ > z₁ and x₂ < z₂: This requires y₁ < x₁ > z₁ and y₂ < z₂, with no constraint on the relationship between x₂ and y₂. There's no contradiction, so this is possible.
4. x₁ < z₁ and x₂ = z₂: This requires y₁ < x₁ < z₁ and y₂ < z₂ = x₂. This means y₂ < x₂, which doesn't contradict any given constraint. So, this is possible.
5. x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂: This requires y₁ < x₁ = z₁ and y₂ < z₂ = x₂. This means y₂ < x₂, which doesn't contradict any given constraint. So, this is possible.
6. x₁ > z₁ and x₂ = z₂: This requires y₁ < x₁ > z₁ and y₂ < z₂ = x₂. This means y₂ < x₂, which doesn't contradict any given constraint. So, this is possible.
7. x₁ < z₁ and x₂ > z₂: This requires y₁ < x₁ < z₁ and y₂ < z₂ < x₂. This means y₂ < x₂, which doesn't contradict any given constraint. So, this is possible.
8. x₁ = z₁ and x₂ > z₂: This requires y₁ < x₁ = z₁ and y₂ < z₂ < x₂. This means y₂ < x₂, which doesn't contradict any given constraint. So, this is possible.
9. x₁ > z₁ and x₂ > z₂: This requires y₁ < x₁ > z₁ and y₂ < z₂ < x₂. This means y₂ < x₂, which doesn't contradict any given constraint. So, this is possible.

So, all 9 cells are possible. This means the relation between x and z can be Southwest, South, Southeast, West, East, Northwest, North, Northeast, or x can be at the same location as z.

Is that right?

Actually, for x to be at the same location as z, we would need x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂. But we also know x₁ > y₁ (from "x is East of y") and y₂ < z₂ (from "y is South of z"). If x₁ = z₁, then z₁ > y₁. This means z is to the east of y, which is consistent.

If x₂ = z₂, given that y₂ < z₂, we have y₂ < x₂. There's no direct constraint on the relationship between x₂ and y₂ from the given information, so this is a possibility.

So, it's possible for x and z to be at the same location.

Let's go through the other cells as well.

Wait, I already did that above and found that all 9 cells are possible. But the 9 cells correspond to the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions plus the case where x and z are at the same location.

So, the possible relations between x and z are East, Northeast, Southeast, North, South, Northwest, West, Southwest, or x can be at the same location as z.

But that's essentially saying that, given the constraints, x can be anywhere in the 2D plane relative to z, which doesn't seem to offer any restrictive information. Let me revisit the reasoning to ensure I haven't made an error.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means x₁ > y₁.
- Region y is South of region z: This means y₂ < z₂.

I've been thinking about the relationships between x₁ and z₁, as well as x₂ and z₂, to determine the possible positions of x relative to z.

Let's rethink this from a different angle. Given the constraints:
- y is South of z, which means y is in the half-plane below z.
- x is East of y, which means x is in the half-plane to the right of y.

The combination of these constraints means that x is in the half-plane to the right of a point y, which is in the half-plane below z. This doesn't place x in any specific region relative to z.

Let's try one more approach using the Cartesian plane, placing z at the origin (0, 0). Given the constraints:
- y is South of z: This means y is at (y₁, y₂) where y₂ < 0 and y₁ can be any value.
- x is East of y: This means x is at (x₁, x₂) where x₁ > y₁ and x₂ can be any value.

Given this, the possible positions of x relative to z can be anywhere in the 2D plane, depending on the specific values of y₁, y₂, x₁, and x₂.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions, or x can be at the same location as z, depending on the specific values of y₁, y₂, x₁, and x₂.

Wait I think I'm making things too complex again. Let's go back to a simpler approach.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y. So, x₁ > y₁.
- Region y is South of region z: This means the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z. So, y₂ < z₂.

These constraints by themselves don't limit the type of relationship x can have with respect to z. Both can be at the same position, in any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions, or anywhere else.

But I think I should also consider the context of the question in the cardinal direction calculus. In this calculus, the usual practice is to work with the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) and the Bounding Box relation.

So, given the constraints and considering the context of cardinal direction calculus, the possible relations between x and z can be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions, or the Bounding Box relation.

Actually, having x and z at the same location is more than just x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂. It's also about the extent of the regions. The Bounding Box relation is more appropriate for this. But considering regions as points, the possible relations are the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions, or x and z can be at the same location.

Actually, wait. I think when I say "x and z can be at the same location", I'm referring to a relation where the regions x and z have the same spatial extent, which is the Bounding Box relation in the context of cardinal direction calculus.

So, the possible relations between x and z are North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or the Bounding Box relation.

I think that's my answer. To be sure, let's check if there are any constraints I may have overlooked. The key constraints are:
1. Region x is East of region y.
2. Region y is South of region z.

Given that East and South are orthogonal directions, the composition of these relations allows for a variety of outcomes depending on the specific positioning of the regions. This is why I concluded that the possible relations between x and z can be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions, or the Bounding Box relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Actually, one quick check. Bounding Box should mean that the regions have the same spatial extent. But given that y is South of z and x is East of y, can x and z actually be in a Bounding Box relation?

For x and z to be in a Bounding Box relation, they would have the same spatial extent, meaning x₁ = z₁ and x₂ = z₂. But we know x₁ > y₁ (from "x is East of y") and y₂ < z₂ (from "y is South of z"). If x₁ = z₁, then z₁ > y₁. This means z is to the east of y, which is consistent.

If x₂ = z₂, given that y₂ < z₂, we have y₂ < x₂. There's no direct constraint on the relationship between x₂ and y₂ from the given information, so this is a possibility.

So, it's possible for x and z to be in a Bounding Box relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Wait, let me clarify something. In the context of regions, the Bounding Box relation doesn't mean that the regions have the same spatial extent. It refers to a relationship where one region is inside another region. In the Bounding Box relation, one region is completely contained within the bounding box (or minimum bounding rectangle) of another region.

Given the constraints that x is East of y and y is South of z, can x be contained within the bounding box of z, or vice versa?

Let's think about it. If x is East of y, it means x is to the right of y. If y is South of z, it means y is below z. These constraints don't prevent x from being contained within the bounding box of z, or vice versa. It depends on the specific shapes and sizes of the regions.

For instance, if z is a large region and y is a small region just below z, and x is a small region just to the right of y, then x could still be within the bounding box of z. Similarly, if x is a large region that extends in all directions, it could contain z within its bounding box.

So, the Bounding Box relation is a valid possibility. The possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

That's my answer.

Actually, wait, let me just make sure I understand the directions too. When the problem statement talks about the cardinal direction relations "East" and "South", it's referring to the possible relations between regions. These are the relations that can exist between two regions in 2D space, based on their positions relative to each other.

So, when the problem statement asks "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", it's asking for the possible relations from the list of cardinal and ordinal directions, plus the Bounding Box relation.

Given the constraints that x is East of y and y is South of z, the possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

In cardinal direction calculus, we don't typically refer to regions being at the "same location" as this is only one possibility of the Bounding Box relation. 

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

Actually, I still want to revisit the Bounding Box relation once more just to be sure. From the literature of cardinal direction calculus, I remember that the Bounding Box relation is when neither of the usual cardinal or ordinal relations hold, and instead, the two regions have a more complex relationship. I'll need to use what I know about the constraints to check if the Bounding Box relation is possible.

Given:
- Region x is East of region y: This means x is to the right of y in the plane.
- Region y is South of region z: This means y is below z in the plane.

For the Bounding Box relation to hold between x and z, neither the cardinal nor ordinal relations should hold. This means x should not be solely to the north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, or northwest of z.

Given the constraints, x is to the right of y, and y is below z. These constraints do not prevent x from having a complex relationship with z such that none of the cardinal or ordinal relations hold exclusively. It depends on the specific shapes and sizes of the regions.

For instance, if z is a large region with a complex shape, and y is somewhere below z, and x is to the right of y, then x and z could have a complex relationship where no single cardinal or ordinal
