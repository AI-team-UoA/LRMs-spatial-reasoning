PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

I'm given that:
1. Region x is Southwest of region y.
2. Region y is South of region z.

And I'm asked to determine what the possible relations could be between region x and region z. Let's think about this step by step.

When we say x is Southwest of y, it means x is both South and West of y. So x is in the southwest quadrant with respect to y.

When we say y is South of z, it means y is directly South of z, i.e., y is below z.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider the transitive property of these cardinal direction relations.

Let's visualize this: If z is at the origin (0, 0), then y is somewhere directly South of z, so y could be at (0, -d_1) for some positive distance d_1. Now, x is Southwest of y, so x could be at (-d_2, -d_3) for some positive distances d_2 and d_3, relative to y. This puts x at (-d_2, -d_1 - d_3) relative to z.

This means x is both South and West of z, which is the definition of x being Southwest of z.

However, I should double-check this. Let's think about it in terms of regions and areas.

If region z is at the origin, then region y is somewhere to the South of it. The "South" relation typically means that y is directly below z, but it might also include being a bit to the East or West while still predominantly being to the South.

Now, x is Southwest of y. This places x to the Southwest of the region y.

Given that y is directly South of z, and x is Southwest of y, x must be to the South and West of z. This is the definition of x being Southwest of z.

But I should consider if there are any other possible relations. Let's think again.

Wait, actually, I need to be careful. The cardinal direction relations aren't as simple as I've been thinking, especially when dealing with regions, which can have extents and shapes.

Let's try to reason this differently. If y is South of z, that means the latitude of y is less than the latitude of z. If x is Southwest of y, that means the latitude of x is less than the latitude of y and the longitude of x is less than the longitude of y.

By transitivity of the "less than" relation, the latitude of x is less than the latitude of z. So, x is definitely South of z in some sense. Also, x is West of y, which is South of z. This suggests that x is West of z as well.

Combining these two observations, it seems like x could be Southwest of z. But are there other possibilities?

Let's reconsider the problem more carefully. If region z is at the origin, and region y is directly South of it, then y is somewhere along the negative y-axis. Now, if x is Southwest of y, it's in the third quadrant with respect to y. This places x in the third quadrant with respect to z as well, which means x is Southwest of z.

But I'm being a bit imprecise. The problem statement talks about regions, not points. Regions have spatial extents. So, the cardinal direction relations between regions can be more complex.

Let's try another approach. If y is South of z, then the northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z. Similarly, if x is Southwest of y, then the northeasternmost point of x is southwest of the southwesternmost point of y.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

Well, x is definitely South of z because the northernmost point of x is south of the northernmost point of y, which is south of the southernmost point of z. And x is also West of z because the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y, which isn't guaranteed to be west of the westernmost point of z.

Wait, I'm still being imprecise. I think I need to revisit the definitions of cardinal direction relations between regions. I need to be clear.

Actually, I realize this problem is using what's called the single-point approximation, where a region is represented by a point (often its center). With this approximation, cardinal direction relations between regions are straightforward.

Let's reconsider the problem with this lens:

1. Region x is Southwest of region y, which means the center of x is both South and West of the center of y.
2. Region y is South of region z, which means the center of y is directly South of the center of z.

Now, what's the relation between x and z? Well, the center of x is South of the center of y, which is South of the center of z. So, the center of x is South of the center of z. Also, the center of x is West of the center of y, which is at the same longitude as the center of z. So, the center of x is West of the center of z.

Combining these, the center of x is both South and West of the center of z, which means x is Southwest of z.

But wait, I realize the problem statement doesn't necessarily imply a single-point approximation. It could be about topological relationships between regions. Let's reconsider.

In the context of topological relationships, "South" means that one region is wholly to the south of another, and "Southwest" means that one region is wholly to the southwest of another. With this understanding:

1. If y is wholly to the south of z, and x is wholly to the southwest of y, then x is definitely wholly to the south of z.
2. But is x wholly to the west of z? Not necessarily. It could be that x and z have some overlap in longitude. So, it's not guaranteed that x is wholly to the southwest of z.

Actually, thinking even more, if y is South of z, it means every point in y is directly South of some point in z. And if x is Southwest of y, it means every point in x is Southwest of some point in y. But this doesn't guarantee that every point in x is Southwest of every point in z.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's simplify and think of the cardinal direction relations as defined between points, or between the centers of regions.

If y is South of z, it means the center of y is directly South of the center of z. If x is Southwest of y, it means the center of x is Southwest of the center of y. From these, we can deduce that the center of x is Southwest of the center of z. So, x is Southwest of z.

But now I'm reminded that cardinal directions can be more nuanced when dealing with regions. Hmm..

Ok, I'm going back to the problem definition. I think this refers to the standard 9-intersection model of direction relations. So if region y is South of region z, then y is in the South tile of z. Similarly, if region x is Southwest of region y, then x is in the Southwest tile of y. Alright, so here are our assumptions:

1. Region x is inside the Southwest tile of region y.
2. Region y is inside the South tile of region z.

What can we say about the position of x relative to z?

If we are fixed on the center of z as a reference, then the South tile of z would contain region y. And the Southwest tile of y would then contain region x. Given that the South tile of z is directly below z, and the Southwest tile of y is to the Southwest of y, we can deduce that region x is in a direction from z that is a combination of South and West, which is the Southwest direction.

But is that the only possibility?

Let's actually use a Cartesian coordinate system to think about this. If the center of region z is at the origin (0, 0), then the South tile of z would be the area below it, so its y-coordinate is negative. So, region y is in the South tile, which means its center has coordinates (x_y, y_y) where y_y < 0 and x_y can be any value (but typically within the width of region z).

Now, region x is in the Southwest tile of region y. If the center of region y is at (x_y, y_y), then the Southwest tile of y would be the area to the Southwest of it. So, the center of region x has coordinates (x_x, y_x) where x_x < x_y and y_x < y_y.

Given these constraints, we can say that x_x < x_y and y_x < y_y < 0. This places region x to the West and further South of region z. So, region x is Southwest of region z.

I think that's the correct answer: x is Southwest of z.

Hmm, actually, I should be careful here. If the center of region z is at the origin (0, 0), and the center of region y is at (x_y, y_y) with y_y < 0, it doesn't necessarily mean that x_y can be any value. The "South" relation typically implies that the center of y is directly below the center of z, which would mean x_y = 0. If this is the case, then the center of region x would be at (x_x, y_x) with x_x < 0 (since it's to the West of y) and y_x < y_y < 0. This would indeed place x to the Southwest of z.

However, if the "South" relation allows for some flexibility in the East-West direction, then x_y could be slightly to the East or West of the center of z. If x_y is to the West of the center of z (i.e., x_y < 0), and the center of x is to the West of the center of y, then x is definitely to the West of z. This, combined with the fact that x is further South than z, means x is Southwest of z.

But if x_y is to the East of the center of z (i.e., x_y > 0), and the center of x is to the West of the center of y but not enough to be to the West of the center of z, then x could be to the East of z. In this case, since x is further South than z, x would be to the Southeast of z.

Actually, this doesn't sound right. Let me re-evaluate.

If region y is South of region z, it means the entire region y is to the South of region z. There's no overlap in the North-South direction. Similarly, if region x is Southwest of region y, the entire region x is to the Southwest of region y. There's no overlap in the Northeast-Southwest direction.

Given these strict definitions, we can say that region x is entirely to the South of region z (because it's to the South of y, which is to the South of z). Also, region x is to the West of y. But is it necessarily to the West of z? 

Hmm, wait. There seems to be a bit of ambiguity in the problem's description, depending on how we interpret the cardinal direction relations.

In the simplest interpretation, we can think of the cardinal direction relations as being between the centers of the regions. If the center of y is directly South of the center of z, and the center of x is Southwest of the center of y, then the center of x is Southwest of the center of z.

But in a more general sense, when we say region A is in a certain direction of region B, we might be referring to a tile-based approach. For example, when we say A is South of B, we mean A is in the South tile of B, which is the area to the South of B. Similarly, when we say A is Southwest of B, we mean A is in the Southwest tile of B.

With this interpretation, if y is in the South tile of z, and x is in the Southwest tile of y, then x is in a "tile" that is to the Southwest of z. This would make x to be Southwest of z.

Given the context and the simplicity of the problem, I believe the intent is to use the center-based interpretation. With this, the answer is straightforward: if y is South of z, and x is Southwest of y, then x is Southwest of z.

But wait a minute, let me just double check by drawing out a quick example. I'll use coordinates (x, y) for the centers of the regions. We could have z = (0, 0) and y = (0, -1) and x = (-1, -2). In this case:

z is at the origin (0, 0).
y is 1 unit directly South of z at (0, -1).
x is Southwest of y at (-1, -2).

Comparing x and z: x is 1 unit to the West and 2 units to the South of z. So, x is Southwest of z.

But let's try another example. Let's say z = (0, 0), y = (1, -1), and x = (0, -2). In this case:

z is at the origin (0, 0).
y is to the South and East of z at (1, -1).
x is to the Southwest of y at (0, -2).

Comparing x and z: x is 0 units to the West (i.e., directly below) and 2 units to the South of z. So, x is South of z, not Southwest.

Wait, I made a mistake in my second example. If y is South of z, then y should be directly below z, not to the South and East. So, y should be at (0, -1) and not at (1, -1). Given this, the second example is invalid.

Let me try a different approach. If we consider a unit square centered at the origin (0, 0) to represent region z, then the "South" tile of z would be a unit square centered at (0, -1). This would be where region y is. Now, the "Southwest" tile of y would be a unit square centered at (-1, -2). This is where region x would be. Comparing the center of x (-1, -2) to the center of z (0, 0), we can see that x is Southwest of z.

I'm pretty confident that the answer is: x is Southwest of z.

But wait, I think I've been thinking about this a bit too restrictively. I'm focusing too much on y being directly South of z, where it's strictly on the same longitude. But what if we think of cardinal directions in a more qualitative manner? For instance, in the STAR calculus (or the 9-intersection model), a region is "South" of another if it's in the South tile. This doesn't necessarily mean it's directly below; it can be to the Southeast or Southwest as well, as long as it's predominantly to the South.

If we adopt this more qualitative approach, then y being South of z means y is in the South tile of z, which is the area directly below z. And x being Southwest of y means x is in the Southwest tile of y, which is the area to the Southwest of y. Given these, where would x be relative to z?

Well, if y is in the South tile of z, and x is in the Southwest tile of y, then x is to the South and West of z. So, x is in the Southwest tile of z, which means x is Southwest of z.

Actually, if I look at my previous reasoning, maybe I was thinking just only one level of granularity of the relations. I.e., just North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the containment relation "Bounding Box." 

But hold on, now I'm also thinking of a different interpretation. I realized that there are other mathematical definitions of cardinal direction relations. Let me reconsider the problem. So far I've been thinking about this in terms of the region connection calculus (RCC) or the 9-intersection model, but there are actually other ways to define the cardinal direction relations, e.g., the cone-based model and the projection-based model. But I think the projection-based model is most fitting for this problem.

In the projection-based approach, the bounding box of a reference region divides the space into 9 tiles: the 8 cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, etc.) and a central tile (containing the reference region).

So, if y is South of z, then the entire region y is in the South tile of the projection of z. Similarly, if x is Southwest of y, then the entire region x is in the Southwest tile of the projection of y.

Given these, where would x be relative to z? If y is entirely to the South of z, and x is entirely to the Southwest of y, then x is definitely to the South of z. But is it to the West of z? Let's think about it.

The South tile of z extends left and right of z, so y could be a bit to the East or West of z while still being in the South tile. If y is to the East of z, and x is to the Southwest of y, then x could be directly South of z (if the westward extent of x from y is enough to align with z) or still to the East of z (if the westward extent isn't enough).

So, the possible relations between x and z could be South, Southwest, or Southeast, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Actually wait, I think I'm approaching this wrongly. I think I need to consider the definitions of the cardinal direction relations in the problem more precisely.

In the projection-based approach (which I think the problem is using), the cardinal direction "South" between regions indicates that the entirety of the South region is in the South tile of the reference region. Similar for "Southwest".

So, if region y is South of region z, it means the entire region y is in the South tile of region z. And if region x is Southwest of region y, it means the entire region x is in the Southwest tile of region y.

Given these, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

Well, if y is entirely in the South tile of z, and x is entirely in the Southwest tile of y, then x is definitely to the South of z. But is it to the West of z? Let's analyze.

The South tile of z extends left and right of z's bounding box. Since y is entirely within this South tile, it could be aligned with z in the East-West direction, or it could be slightly to the East or West of z, as long as it doesn't go beyond the South tile.

Now, x is entirely in the Southwest tile of y. This means x is to the West of y. If y is aligned with or to the West of z, then x is definitely to the West of z. But if y is to the East of z, then x might not be to the West of z, depending on how far to the East y is and how far to the West x is from y.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be Southwest (if x is to the West of z) or South (if x is aligned with z in the East-West direction) or Southeast (if x is to the East of z).

Wait, let me revise. I think I might have been overthinking. I think there is actually a standard definition for the cardinal direction relations.

Let me take a step back and simplify. The cardinal direction relations are, typically, defined using the projection-based approach, which divides the space into 9 tiles based on the bounding box of the reference region. With this approach, and by following the rules of composition for cardinal direction relations, the composition of Southwest and South is SW+S = {S, SE, SW}.

I now realize that I've been focusing too much on the intuitive meaning, but there's actually a formal calculus for composing these relations.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking and mixing different models in my head. Let me go back to the most basic projection model of cardinal directions.

In this model, the frame of reference is established by the bounding box of the reference region. This bounding box, extended to infinity, divides the plane into 9 tiles. The center tile contains the reference region itself. The other 8 tiles correspond to the 8 cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW.

With this model, we can define the relation between two regions. If region A is in the South tile of region B, then A is South of B. If A is in the Southwest tile of B, then A is Southwest of B. And so on.

Now, using this model, let's analyze the problem:

1. Region x is Southwest of region y. This means x is in the Southwest tile of y.
2. Region y is South of region z. This means y is in the South tile of z.

What is the relation between x and z?

Let's think about this. If y is in the South tile of z, it means y is to the South of z. The bounding box of y is below the bounding box of z.

Now, if x is in the Southwest tile of y, it means x is to the Southwest of y. The bounding box of x is to the Southwest of the bounding box of y.

Combining these, we can see that x is to the South of z (because y is to the South of z, and x is to the South of y) and possibly to the West of z (because x is to the West of y, but y's East-West relation to z is not specified). This means x could be to the Southwest of z or it could be to the South of z.

Actually, y could also be to the East or West of z while still being in the South tile. If y is to the East of z and x is to the Southwest of y, then x could be to the Southeast of z or directly South of z, depending on how far to the West x is from y. Similarly, if y is to the West of z and x is to the Southwest of y, then x is definitely to the Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

But I think I'm overthinking again. Let's use a concrete example to clarify.

Suppose region z is a unit square from (0, 0) to (1, 1). The South tile of z is the area from (-∞, 0) to (∞, 0). If region y is South of z, then the bounding box of y is entirely within the South tile of z.

Now, suppose region y is a unit square from (0.5, -1.5) to (1.5, -0.5). The Southwest tile of y is the area to the Southwest of y. If region x is Southwest of y, then the bounding box of x is entirely within the Southwest tile of y.

Given the positions of z and y, where could x be? Well, if x is to the Southwest of y, it could be a unit square from (-0.5, -2.5) to (0.5, -1.5). Comparing this to z, we can see that x is to the South of z but not necessarily to the West of z. In fact, in this example, x is aligned with z in the East-West direction, so x is South of z.

Let's try another example. Suppose region z is a unit square from (0, 0) to (1, 1) and region y is a unit square from (1.5, -1.5) to (2.5, -0.5). In this case, y is to the South and East of z. If region x is a unit square from (0.5, -2.5) to (1.5, -1.5), then x is to the Southwest of y. But comparing x to z, we can see that x is to the South of z, but it's also to the East of z. So, x is to the Southeast of z.

And one more example. Suppose region z is a unit square from (0, 0) to (1, 1) and region y is a unit square from (-1.5, -1.5) to (-0.5, -0.5). In this case, y is to the South and West of z. If region x is a unit square from (-2.5, -2.5) to (-1.5, -1.5), then x is to the Southwest of y. Comparing x to z, we can see that x is to the South and West of z. So, x is to the Southwest of z.

Based on these examples, the possible relations between x and z are South, Southwest, and Southeast, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Wait, I'm re-reading the problem and I realize that there might be another way of approaching it. If we're just thinking about relation composition (without getting into the specific positions of the regions), then there's a standard composition table for cardinal direction relations. For the composition of Southwest and South, the result is typically {South, Southwest, Southeast}.

So, the answer is: The possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Actually, I now realize the correct composition for Southwest and South is {S, SW, SE}. But I want to double-check by doing a different analysis to check. We know that:

1. x is Southwest of y.
2. y is South of z.

Projective Cardinal Directions define relation between two regions in terms of the bounding boxes of these regions. The universe is divided into 9 tiles: NW, N, NE, W, O, E, SW, S, SE. If region y is South of region z, it means the entirety of y's bounding box is in the S tile of z.

So, given the relation "y is South of z", where can x be with respect to z, if x is Southwest of y?

Let's think about this logically. If y is in the S tile of z, it means the northernmost point of y is to the South of the southernmost point of z. And if x is in the SW tile of y, it means the easternmost point of x is to the West of the westernmost point of y, and the northernmost point of x is to the South of the southernmost point of y.

Given these, can we determine where x is with respect to z?

Well, since the northernmost point of y is to the South of the southernmost point of z, and the northernmost point of x is to the South of the southernmost point of y, we can say (by transitivity) that the northernmost point of x is to the South of the southernmost point of z. This means x is definitely in the S, SW, or SE tile of z.

Now, the easternmost point of x is to the West of the westernmost point of y. But the position of y with respect to z in the East-West direction isn't uniquely determined by "y is South of z". y could be to the East, West, or aligned with z in the East-West direction. This means the position of x with respect to z in the East-West direction can't be uniquely determined.

So, the possible relations between x and z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

To visualize this, imagine a 3x3 grid. If region z is in the center, then the S tile of z is the middle-bottom tile. Region y is entirely within this S tile. Now, the SW tile of y is the bottom-left tile from y's perspective. Depending on where y is within the S tile of z, the SW tile of y could overlap with the S, SW, or SE tiles of z. This gives us the possible relations between x and z.

Actually, let me double check this with some concrete examples using coordinates:

Example 1: Region z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (1, 1). The S tile of z is everything below z, i.e., the area from (-∞, -∞) to (∞, 0). Let's say region y has a bounding box from (0, -2) to (1, -1). The SW tile of y is everything to the Southwest of y, i.e., the area from (-∞, -∞) to (0, -2). Region x could have a bounding box from (-2, -4) to (-1, -3). Comparing x to z, we can see that x is to the South and West of z, so x is to the Southwest of z.

Example 2: Region z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (1, 1). Region y has a bounding box from (2, -2) to (3, -1). The SW tile of y is the area from (-∞, -∞) to (2, -2). Region x could have a bounding box from (0, -4) to (1, -3). Comparing x to z, we can see that x is to the South of z but not to the East or West. So, x is to the South of z.

Example 3: Region z has a bounding box from (0, 0) to (1, 1). Region y has a bounding box from (-3, -2) to (-2, -1). The SW tile of y is the area from (-∞, -∞) to (-3, -2). Region x could have a bounding box from (-5, -4) to (-4, -3). Comparing x to z, we can see that x is to the South and West of z. So, x is to the Southwest of z.

Based on these examples, and many more we could construct, the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, South, and Southeast. This aligns with the standard composition result for the composition of Southwest and South, which is {South, Southwest, Southeast}.

So, the answer is: The possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Actually, I want to find out if there's anything I'm missing. Let me try to think about the relation between x and z through relation composition.

Given that:
1. x is Southwest of y.
2. y is South of z.

What are the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z?

Let me analyze using relation composition. First, let's establish what the Southwest and South relations imply based on the projection-based model:

1. Southwest relation: If x is Southwest of y, then the entire bounding box of x is in the Southwest tile of y. This means that the easternmost point of x is to the West of the westernmost point of y, and the northernmost point of x is to the South of the southernmost point of y.

2. South relation: If y is South of z, then the entire bounding box of y is in the South tile of z. This means that the northernmost point of y is to the South of the southernmost point of z.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

First, in the North-South direction: The northernmost point of x is to the South of the southernmost point of y, and the northernmost point of y is to the South of the southernmost point of z. By transitivity, the northernmost point of x is to the South of the southernmost point of z. This means x is in the South, Southwest, or Southeast tile of z.

Next, in the East-West direction: The easternmost point of x is to the West of the westernmost point of y. But the position of y with respect to z in the East-West direction isn't uniquely determined by "y is South of z". y could be to the East, West, or aligned with z in the East-West direction. This means the position of x with respect to z in the East-West direction can't be uniquely determined.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. x is South of z: This happens if x is aligned with z in the East-West direction.
2. x is Southwest of z: This happens if x is to the West of z.
3. x is Southeast of z: This happens if x is to the East of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

This outcome is consistent with the cardinal direction relation composition table, which says that the composition of Southwest and South is {South, Southwest, Southeast}.

Alright, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Wait, one more cross-check. Let's think of this in terms of the projective cardinal direction relations. So each region has a bounding box. Given the bounding boxes of two regions, the relation between them is the tile in which one's bounding box falls in relation to the other.

Specifically: Region x is Southwest of region y if the bounding box of x is in the Southwest tile of the bounding box of y. Region y is South of region z if the bounding box of y is in the South tile of the bounding box of z.

Let's represent the coordinates of the bounding boxes as:
- Z: [min_x_z, min_y_z, max_x_z, max_y_z]
- Y: [min_x_y, min_y_y, max_x_y, max_y_y]
- X: [min_x_x, min_y_x, max_x_x, max_y_x]

Given:
1. Y is South of Z: This means max_y_y < min_y_z, and min_x_y <= max_x_z, and max_x_y >= min_x_z.
2. X is Southwest of Y: This means max_y_x < min_y_y and max_x_x < min_x_y.

From (1) and (2), we can deduce that max_y_x < min_y_y < min_y_z, which means max_y_x < min_y_z. This confirms that X is to the South of Z in the North-South direction.

From (2), we know that max_x_x < min_x_y. However, the East-West relationship between Y and Z is not fully determined by the South relation. Y could be aligned with, to the East of, or to the West of Z while still being in the South tile. This means the East-West relationship between X and Z is not fully determined. X could be to the West of Z, aligned with Z, or to the East of Z.

Given these, the possible relations between X and Z are:

1. X is Southwest of Z: This happens if max_x_x < min_x_z, meaning X is to the West of Z.
2. X is South of Z: This happens if min_x_x <= max_x_z and max_x_x >= min_x_z, meaning X is aligned with Z in the East-West direction.
3. X is Southeast of Z: This happens if min_x_x > max_x_z, meaning X is to the East of Z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Let me verify this with a simple example. Imagine region z with a bounding box from (0, 0) to (1, 1). If region y is South of z, its bounding box could be from (0, -2) to (1, -1). Now, if region x is Southwest of y, its bounding box could be from (-2, -4) to (-1, -3). Comparing x directly to z, we can see that x is to the Southwest of z.

But if we shift region y to the East, say with a bounding box from (2, -2) to (3, -1), and keep x to the Southwest of y, say with a bounding box from (0, -4) to (1, -3), then x would be to the South of z. And if we shift y even further to the East, x would be to the Southeast of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

The final answer is: The possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Wait, I had a realization now: maybe the relations here refer not to the 9-tiles, but to the traditional 8 cardinal direction relations, which are North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest. The difference is that the "bounding box" relation, where one region contains the other, is not listed in these 8. It's a ninth relation. Also the 8 relations don't need to be tile based.

But anyway let's evaluate our answer again. Given:
1. x is Southwest of y.
2. y is South of z.

What is the cardinal direction relation between x and z?

We've determined that the possible relations are Southwest, South, and Southeast. These are all among the 8 cardinal direction relations. So, our answer stands.

Wait, another angle: what if the directions use the cone-based approach instead of the projection-based approach? In the cone-based approach, the 8 cardinal directions are defined by cones of 45 degrees each, centered at the reference point. But again our approach above does not assume any specific model of these cardinal relations. It deduces that the possible relations are Southwest, South, and Southeast. 

So, the final answer is: The possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Actually, the problem asks for which relations "could be the possible". So I need to list all possible relations.

Given:
1. x is Southwest of y.
2. y is South of z.

We've deduced that the northernmost point of x is to the South of the southernmost point of z. This means x is definitely to the South of z in the North-South direction. But in the East-West direction, x could be to the West of z, aligned with z, or to the East of z. This gives us the possible relations as Southwest, South, and Southeast. I can't think of any other scenarios.

So, the final answer is: The possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

Actually, I'm looking at the setup again. I am asked to find "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" and I'm given a set of possible relations to choose from: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box. My answer must be a subset of these 9 possibilities. 

Given the deductions I've made, the possible relations between x and z are South, Southwest, and Southeast. These are all among the 9 possibilities given. So, my final answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

The final answer is: The possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are South, Southwest, and Southeast.
