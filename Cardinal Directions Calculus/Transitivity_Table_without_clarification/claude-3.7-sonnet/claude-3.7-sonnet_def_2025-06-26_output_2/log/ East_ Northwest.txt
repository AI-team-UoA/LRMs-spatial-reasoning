PROMPT: Let  East and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the cardinal direction relations.

Given information:
- Region x is East of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

We want to find the possible relation(s) between region x and region z.

Let's visualize this using a cardinal direction grid:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | O | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Let's say z is at the origin O.
If y is Northwest of z, then y is in the NW position relative to z.
If x is East of y, then x is in the E position relative to y.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, let's try to place them on a more detailed grid.

If z is at the origin (0,0), then y would be in the Northwest quadrant, so y could be at position (-a, b) for some positive values a and b.

If x is East of y, then x would be to the right of y. So x could be at position (c, b) where c > -a, or we could even have c > 0.

Now, to determine the relation of x to z, we need to see which quadrant x falls in relative to z.

If c < 0, then x is in the Northwest or West quadrant relative to z.
If c = 0, then x is North of z.
If c > 0, then x could be North, Northeast, or East of z.

Let me think more carefully. If y is at position (-a, b) and x is East of y, then x could be at (-a', b) where -a < -a' < 0, or x could be at (c, b) where c ≥ 0.

If x is at (-a', b) where -a < -a' < 0, then x is still in the Northwest quadrant relative to z.
If x is at (0, b), then x is North of z.
If x is at (c, b) where c > 0, then x is in the Northeast quadrant relative to z.

But wait, I've made an assumption that "East" means exactly along the east-west axis. Let's be more precise. If x is East of y, it means that x is in the E position relative to y. This could mean that x is at position (-a + d, b + e) for some d > 0 and some e. If e > 0, x moves more to the north. If e < 0, x moves more to the south.

Let's think even more carefully. If y is Northwest of z, then y is in the Northwest quadrant relative to z. In a 2D Cartesian grid, if z is at the origin (0, 0), then y would be at some point (-a, b) where a, b > 0.

If x is East of y, then x is in the East direction from y. This means that x would be at some point (-a + d, b) where d > 0.

Now, to determine the relation of x to z (the origin), we need to compare the coordinates of x with (0, 0).

If -a + d < 0, then x is to the west of z, and since b > 0, x is in the Northwest quadrant relative to z.
If -a + d = 0, then x is directly North of z.
If -a + d > 0, then x is to the east of z, and since b > 0, x is in the Northeast quadrant relative to z.

Actually, the more I think about this, the more I realize I can't give a single answer without knowing the exact positions. The relationship between x and z could be Northwest, North, or Northeast, depending on the specific coordinates.

Let me reframe the problem. I think it's clearer to think in terms of regions on a grid.

z is at some position.
y is Northwest of z, so y is in the Northwest region relative to z.
x is East of y, so x is in the East region relative to y.

Let's denote the position of z as (0, 0) for simplicity. Then y is in the Northwest quadrant, so its coordinates are (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.

Now, if x is East of y, its coordinates are (c, d) such that c > -a and the point (c, d) is in the East region relative to (-a, b).

The East region relative to (-a, b) includes all points (c, d) such that c > -a and b-h < d < b+h for some threshold h. Essentially, the East region is a horizontal band extending to the right from y.

Given that, the position of x could be anywhere in this East band. If we project this onto the grid centered at z, x could fall into several regions depending on its exact position:

If c < 0 and d > 0, then x is in the Northwest region relative to z.
If c = 0 and d > 0, then x is in the North region relative to z.
If c > 0 and d > 0, then x is in the Northeast region relative to z.
If c > 0 and d = 0, then x is in the East region relative to z.

Actually, let me redo this analysis, because I think I'm treating the "East" relation too narrowly.

The cardinal direction relations partition the plane into 9 regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the region itself (which we often call "Overlapping" or "Equal").

If y is Northwest of z, it means that y is in the Northwest region relative to z. If we denote the position of z as (0, 0) for simplicity, then y is in the quadrant where both x-coordinates and y-coordinates are non-zero, with x-coordinates being negative and y-coordinates being positive. So, y is at position (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.

If x is East of y, it means that x is in the East region relative to y. In the grid centered at y, the East region consists of all points with significantly larger x-coordinates than y and roughly the same y-coordinates. So, if y is at position (-a, b), then x is at position (-a + c, b + d) for some c > 0 and small d (could be positive, negative, or zero).

Now, let's determine the position of x relative to z (which is at the origin). The position of x is (-a + c, b + d).

If -a + c < 0, then x is to the west of the origin.
If -a + c = 0, then x is directly aligned with the origin along the east-west axis.
If -a + c > 0, then x is to the east of the origin.

Similarly:
If b + d > 0, then x is to the north of the origin.
If b + d = 0, then x is directly aligned with the origin along the north-south axis.
If b + d < 0, then x is to the south of the origin.

Combining these:

If -a + c < 0 and b + d > 0, then x is in the Northwest region relative to z.
If -a + c = 0 and b + d > 0, then x is in the North region relative to z.
If -a + c > 0 and b + d > 0, then x is in the Northeast region relative to z.
If -a + c < 0 and b + d = 0, then x is in the West region relative to z.
If -a + c = 0 and b + d = 0, then x is Equal to z (this seems unlikely given the initial conditions).
If -a + c > 0 and b + d = 0, then x is in the East region relative to z.
If -a + c < 0 and b + d < 0, then x is in the Southwest region relative to z.
If -a + c = 0 and b + d < 0, then x is in the South region relative to z.
If -a + c > 0 and b + d < 0, then x is in the Southeast region relative to z.

But here's the thing: since y is at position (-a, b) with a, b > 0, and x is East of y, the x-coordinate of x increases by c, but the y-coordinate can vary slightly. The "East" relation generally implies that the y-coordinate doesn't change too much.

So, considering that b > 0 and d is generally small (could be positive, negative, or zero), it's unlikely that b + d becomes negative or zero unless b is very close to 0 and d is negative.

Given the initial conditions and typical interpretations of cardinal direction relations, the most likely relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if -a + c < 0, which means the eastward movement from y doesn't exceed the westward offset of y from z).
- North (if -a + c = 0, which is a specific case).
- Northeast (if -a + c > 0, which means the eastward movement from y exceeds the westward offset of y from z).
- East (if -a + c > 0 and b + d = 0, which is a specific case).

But to be comprehensive, I need to consider all cases: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, West, Northwest, and possibly even Overlapping (if x and z happen to be the same point, though this seems highly unlikely given the conditions).

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's approach it more systematically.

1. y is Northwest of z. This means that if z is at the origin, then y is in the Northwest quadrant, so its coordinates are (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.

2. x is East of y. This means that if y is at position (-a, b), then x is at position (-a + c, b + d) for some c > 0 and d that can be positive, negative, or zero, but is generally small in magnitude.

3. Now, let's determine the position of x relative to z (the origin).

If -a + c < 0, then x is to the west of z. Combined with the y-coordinate, we have:
- If b + d > 0, then x is in the Northwest quadrant relative to z.
- If b + d = 0, then x is directly West of z.
- If b + d < 0, then x is in the Southwest quadrant relative to z.

If -a + c = 0, then x is aligned with z along the east-west axis. Combined with the y-coordinate:
- If b + d > 0, then x is directly North of z.
- If b + d = 0, then x is at the same position as z, which seems unlikely given the initial conditions.
- If b + d < 0, then x is directly South of z.

If -a + c > 0, then x is to the east of z. Combined with the y-coordinate:
- If b + d > 0, then x is in the Northeast quadrant relative to z.
- If b + d = 0, then x is directly East of z.
- If b + d < 0, then x is in the Southeast quadrant relative to z.

Given the given relations, all of the following are possible relations between x and z: Northwest, North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, West, and Southwest. In other words, x could be in any of the 8 cardinal and inter-cardinal directions relative to z.

Actually I don't think that's right, especially since I don't know how large 'c' and 'd' can be. Let me do this more systematically, directly using the notions of cardinal directions.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, we often use a 3x3 grid to partition the space around a reference point, where the central cell represents the reference point itself. This is known as the 9-intersection model.

If we're in a 2D space, and if z is at the origin, then the space is partitioned into 9 regions:
- North (N): Points directly above z.
- Northeast (NE): Points above and to the right of z.
- East (E): Points directly to the right of z.
- Southeast (SE): Points below and to the right of z.
- South (S): Points directly below z.
- Southwest (SW): Points below and to the left of z.
- West (W): Points directly to the left of z.
- Northwest (NW): Points above and to the left of z.
- Equal (EQ): Points that coincide with z.

Now, if y is Northwest of z, then y is in the NW region. Similarly, if x is East of y, then x is in the E region relative to y.

Let's superimpose a 3x3 grid centered at y. Since y is in the NW region relative to z, the 3x3 grid centered at y is shifted to the northwest compared to the grid centered at z.

Now, if x is in the E region relative to y, it means x is directly to the right of y in the 3x3 grid centered at y. If we superimpose this onto the grid centered at z, where could x lie?

Since the grid centered at y is shifted to the northwest compared to the grid centered at z, the E region of y could overlap with the NW, N, NE, E, or even other regions of z's grid, depending on the specific position of y.

Let me try a more direct approach. Let's place z at the origin and y in the NW quadrant. Then, let's define the regions relative to y. Since y is in the NW quadrant, its coordinates are (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.

Now, the E region relative to y would include points to the right of y, which would be points with x-coordinates greater than -a and y-coordinates roughly around b (with a possible small deviation up or down).

The key observation is that, depending on how far y is from z and how far x is from y, x could be in various regions relative to z.

Let's consider extreme cases:
- If y is just slightly to the northwest of z, and x is far to the east of y, then x would be in the NE, E, or SE region relative to z.
- If y is far to the northwest of z, and x is just slightly to the east of y, then x might still be in the NW region relative to z.

Given the infinite possibilities of positions, the relation of x to z could be any of: NW, N, NE, E, SE, or even W (if x is very close to the west-east boundary but still east of y).

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this again.

Let's define the possible positions more rigorously, using the strict cardinal direction relations as defined by the 9-intersection model.

If z is at the origin (0, 0), then the regions around z are defined as:
- N: (0, y) where y > 0
- NE: (x, y) where x > 0, y > 0
- E: (x, 0) where x > 0
- SE: (x, y) where x > 0, y < 0
- S: (0, y) where y < 0
- SW: (x, y) where x < 0, y < 0
- W: (x, 0) where x < 0
- NW: (x, y) where x < 0, y > 0
- EQ: (0, 0)

If y is in the NW region relative to z, then y has coordinates (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.

Similarly, if x is in the E region relative to y, then x has coordinates (-a + c, b) for some c > 0.

Now, let's determine the region of x relative to z. The coordinates of x are (-a + c, b).

If -a + c < 0, then x is in the W or NW region relative to z.
If -a + c = 0, then x is in the N region relative to z.
If -a + c > 0, then x is in the NE or E region relative to z.

Specifically:
- If -a + c < 0 and b > 0, then x is in the NW region relative to z.
- If -a + c = 0 and b > 0, then x is in the N region relative to z.
- If -a + c > 0 and b > 0, then x is in the NE region relative to z.
- If -a + c < 0 and b = 0, then x is in the W region relative to z.
- If -a + c = 0 and b = 0, then x is Equal to z.
- If -a + c > 0 and b = 0, then x is in the E region relative to z.

Since y is in the NW region, its y-coordinate is strictly positive. And since x is in the E region relative to y, its y-coordinate is the same as y's (in the strict 9-intersection model). Therefore, x's y-coordinate is also strictly positive. This eliminates the cases where b = 0.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (if -a + c < 0)
- N (if -a + c = 0)
- NE (if -a + c > 0)

But wait, I'm considering the "East" relation as having the same y-coordinate. I should recognize that the "East" relation is more nuanced. The "East" relation generally means that the primary direction from one point to another is eastward, but there can be slight variations in the north-south direction. 

Actually, let me redo this, accounting for potentially different variants of "cardinal direction relations". In traditional GIS, Cardinal Direction Relations (CDRs) can be defined in different ways, with basic CDRs, CG CDRs, and different variants (cone-based, projection-based, etc.)

Fundamentally, cardinal direction relations partition the space around a reference point or region, potentially into 8 directions plus the reference region itself. But how exactly the partition is done can vary. A common approach is the cone-shaped partition, where the space is divided into 8 cones, each spanning 45 degrees. Another approach is the projection-based partition, where the space is divided into 8 regions based on the x and y coordinates relative to the reference point.

Here, it seems like we're using a projection-based approach, since we're thinking about E, NW, etc. in terms of their coordinates.

In this projection-based approach, given a reference point or region, the space is partitioned as follows:
- N: Points with the same x-coordinate as the reference and a larger y-coordinate.
- NE: Points with a larger x-coordinate and a larger y-coordinate than the reference.
- E: Points with a larger x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate as the reference.
- SE: Points with a larger x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than the reference.
- S: Points with the same x-coordinate as the reference and a smaller y-coordinate.
- SW: Points with a smaller x-coordinate and a smaller y-coordinate than the reference.
- W: Points with a smaller x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate as the reference.
- NW: Points with a smaller x-coordinate and a larger y-coordinate than the reference.
- EQ: Points that coincide with the reference.

Ok, let's assume this is the exact method. Then, given that:
- y is NW of z. This means y has a smaller x-coordinate and a larger y-coordinate than z.
- x is E of y. This means x has a larger x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate as y.

We can determine the relation between x and z.

If z is at the origin (0, 0), then y is at position (-a, b) for some a, b > 0. If x is E of y, then x is at position (-a + c, b) for some c > 0.

Let's determine the position of x relative to z (the origin). The coordinates of x are (-a + c, b).

If -a + c < 0, then x has a smaller x-coordinate than z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the NW region relative to z.

If -a + c = 0, then x has the same x-coordinate as z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the N region relative to z.

If -a + c > 0, then x has a larger x-coordinate than z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the NE region relative to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (if -a + c < 0, i.e., if the increase c in the x-coordinate doesn't offset the initial decrease -a)
- N (if -a + c = 0, i.e., if the increase c in the x-coordinate exactly offsets the initial decrease -a)
- NE (if -a + c > 0, i.e., if the increase c in the x-coordinate more than offsets the initial decrease -a)

So, the answer is that x can be NW, N, or NE relative to z.

Actually, let's check other approaches. Let's consider the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) approach for cardinal directions. In this approach, the space is divided by the minimum bounding rectangle of the reference region. The reference region is at the center, and the 8 cardinal directions are around it.

Using this approach, if y is NW of z, it means y is in the region that's to the northwest of the minimum bounding rectangle of z. Similarly, if x is E of y, it means x is in the region that's to the east of the minimum bounding rectangle of y.

Given these, we're essentially doing the same analysis as before, and the possible relations between x and z remain NW, N, or NE.

Let's try the cone-based approach, where the space is divided into 8 cones, each spanning 45 degrees, with the reference at the apex. In this approach, directions are determined by the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the reference to the point in question.

If y is NW of z using the cone-based approach, it means the angle between the positive x-axis and the line from z to y is between 135 and 180 degrees. Similarly, if x is E of y, the angle between the positive x-axis and the line from y to x is between -22.5 and 22.5 degrees.

Given that y is at a certain angle from z and x is at a certain angle from y, the angle between x and z would be the sum of these angles, modulo 360 degrees.

For y being NW of z, the angle is between 135 and 180 degrees. For x being E of y, the angle is between -22.5 and 22.5 degrees. Summing these angles, we get a range of 112.5 to 202.5 degrees. This corresponds to the W, NW, N, and NE directions in the cone-based approach.

Actually that can't be right. Let me approach this more carefully.

Given our problem, the NW and E cardinal direction relations can be understood as "y is Northwest of z" and "x is East of y", respectively.

I want to make sure I get the correct understanding of the problem:

- Cardinal directions partition the space around a reference entity into 8 cardinal and ordinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) and a overlap/bounding box area.
- The relation "y is Northwest of z" means y is in the northwest cardinal direction region relative to z.
- The relation "x is East of y" means x is in the east cardinal direction region relative to y.

Using these definitions, let's determine the possible relation between x and z.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. The cardinal directions relative to z are:
- N: (0, y) where y > 0
- NE: (x, y) where x > 0, y > 0
- E: (x, 0) where x > 0
- SE: (x, y) where x > 0, y < 0
- S: (0, y) where y < 0
- SW: (x, y) where x < 0, y < 0
- W: (x, 0) where x < 0
- NW: (x, y) where x < 0, y > 0
- BB: (0, 0) (the bounding box or overlap area)

OK given that y is NW of z, y is at a position (-a, b) for some a, b > 0. Note that the position can't be (-a, 0) or (0, b), as those would be W and N, respectively.

Now, the cardinal directions relative to y are:
- N: (-a, b + c) where c > 0
- NE: (-a + d, b + c) where d, c > 0
- E: (-a + d, b) where d > 0
- SE: (-a + d, b - c) where d, c > 0
- S: (-a, b - c) where c > 0
- SW: (-a - d, b - c) where d, c > 0
- W: (-a - d, b) where d > 0
- NW: (-a - d, b + c) where d, c > 0
- BB: (-a, b) (the bounding box or overlap area)

Given that x is E of y, x is at a position (-a + d, b) for some d > 0.

Now, let's determine the position of x relative to z. The coordinates of x are (-a + d, b).

If -a + d < 0, then x is to the west of z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the NW quadrant relative to z. But we need to be more precise. If -a + d = 0, then x is directly North of z. If -a + d > 0, then x is to the east of z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the NE quadrant relative to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (if -a + d < 0)
- N (if -a + d = 0)
- NE (if -a + d > 0)

So, the answer is that x can be NW, N, or NE relative to z.

Wait a sec, I think I should be clearer here. Let me solve this problem in a methodical way.

Let's denote regions using capital letters and their boundaries using lowercase letters. For example, we'll denote a region Z with its boundary as z.

A cardinal direction relation "Y is Northwest of Z" means that region Y is entirely in the northwest cardinal direction of region Z. Similarly, "X is East of Y" means that region X is entirely in the east cardinal direction of region Y.

The question is: what is the cardinal direction relation between regions X and Z?

To determine this, I'll use a method that focuses on the relative positions of the regions.

Let's place region Z somewhere, for simplicity, let's say it's at the origin. The nine cardinal direction tiles (or zones) around Z are:
- NW: points to the northwest of Z
- N: points directly north of Z
- NE: points to the northeast of Z
- W: points directly west of Z
- O: points overlapping with Z
- E: points directly east of Z
- SW: points to the southwest of Z
- S: points directly south of Z
- SE: points to the southeast of Z

Now, given that Y is NW of Z, region Y is entirely in the NW zone relative to Z.

For the nine cardinal direction tiles around Y, a point in the E zone of Y would have a greater x-coordinate than any point in Y, while its y-coordinate would be within the range of y-coordinates of Y.

Given that X is E of Y, region X is entirely in the E zone relative to Y.

Now, we need to determine the zone(s) of X relative to Z. This depends on the exact positions of all three regions. However, there are some general observations we can make.

Since Y is in the NW zone relative to Z, it has a smaller x-coordinate and a larger y-coordinate than any point in Z. Given that X is E of Y, it has a larger x-coordinate than any point in Y, while its y-coordinate is within the range of y-coordinates of Y. This puts X to the right of Y, potentially moving it closer to the vertical line passing through the center of Z.

Let's consider the extreme case where Y is far to the northwest of Z, and X is just slightly to the east of Y. In this case, X would still be in the NW zone relative to Z. On the other hand, if Y is just slightly to the northwest of Z, and X is far to the east of Y, then X would be in the NE zone relative to Z. And if X is just right, it could be directly N of Z.

So, the possible relations between X and Z are:
- NW (if X's x-coordinate is still less than Z's)
- N (if X's x-coordinate is the same as Z's)
- NE (if X's x-coordinate is greater than Z's)

I think this is the correct answer. Given the conditions, X can be NW, N, or NE relative to Z.

Actually, let me check if there's more to consider. If Z is the bounding box, and if Y is NW of Z, it could extend to the west or the north, or just be strictly in the NW direction. Similarly, if X is E of Y, it could extend to the north or south, or be strictly E. 

Given these, can X be in any other direction relative to Z? If we consider a scenario where Y is slightly to the NW of Z (close to the western boundary of Z), and X is far to the east of Y, then X could be E of Z. And if Y is more to the north and close to the western boundary, and X extends to the east and south, it's plausible that X could be SE of Z.

However, I think if we're considering individual regions with non-zero areas, and using the "entirely in a cardinal direction" definition, the possible relations between X and Z are still NW, N, and NE.

Let me start over and be precise. In the cardinal direction model, each region is typically treated as a point for simplicity (usually the centroid). The space around the reference point is then partitioned into 8 direction zones and one overlap/bounding box zone.

Here's the revised solution:

Given that "Y is Northwest of Z" and "X is East of Y", we want to determine the possible cardinal direction relation between X and Z.

Let's place Z at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. The cardinal directions around Z are:
- N: (0, y) where y > 0
- NE: (x, y) where x > 0, y > 0
- E: (x, 0) where x > 0
- SE: (x, y) where x > 0, y < 0
- S: (0, y) where y < 0
- SW: (x, y) where x < 0, y < 0
- W: (x, 0) where x < 0
- NW: (x, y) where x < 0, y > 0
- BB: (0, 0) (the bounding box or overlap area)

Since Y is NW of Z, we know that Y is at a position (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.

The cardinal directions around Y are:
- N: (-a, b + c) where c > 0
- NE: (-a + d, b + c) where d, c > 0
- E: (-a + d, b) where d > 0
- SE: (-a + d, b - c) where d, c > 0
- S: (-a, b - c) where c > 0
- SW: (-a - d, b - c) where d, c > 0
- W: (-a - d, b) where d > 0
- NW: (-a - d, b + c) where d, c > 0
- BB: (-a, b) (the bounding box or overlap area)

Since X is E of Y, we know that X is at a position (-a + d, b) for some d > 0.

To determine the cardinal direction of X relative to Z, we compare their coordinates:

If -a + d < 0, then X is to the west of Z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, X is in the NW direction relative to Z.

If -a + d = 0, then X is on the same vertical line as Z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, X is in the N direction relative to Z.

If -a + d > 0, then X is to the east of Z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, X is in the NE direction relative to Z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between X and Z are:
- NW (if -a + d < 0, i.e., d < a)
- N (if -a + d = 0, i.e., d = a)
- NE (if -a + d > 0, i.e., d > a)

Actually, I just realized that there may be more possible cardinal directions I missed. Let's check if the parameters a, b, and d can be chosen in such a way that X is in other cardinal directions relative to Z.

If we consider regions with non-zero areas and in the context of the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) approach:

When Y is NW of Z, it means the MBR of Y is entirely in the NW zone of the MBR of Z. Similarly, when X is E of Y, the MBR of X is entirely in the E zone of the MBR of Y.

Let's denote the MBR of a region A as [A_min_x, A_max_x] × [A_min_y, A_max_y].

For Y to be NW of Z, we need:
Y_max_x < Z_min_x
Y_min_y > Z_max_y

For X to be E of Y, we need:
X_min_x > Y_max_x
X_min_y ≤ Y_max_y
X_max_y ≥ Y_min_y

Let's now determine the possible relation between X and Z. For X to be in a particular cardinal direction relative to Z, the MBR of X needs to be entirely in that cardinal direction zone of the MBR of Z.

Given the above conditions, we have:
X_min_x > Y_max_x > Z_min_x

So, X cannot be in the W, SW, or NW direction of Z (since its minimum x-coordinate is greater than the minimum x-coordinate of Z).

The y-coordinates of X are bounded by the y-coordinates of Y, which are all greater than the maximum y-coordinate of Z. This means:
X_min_y ≥ Y_min_y > Z_max_y

So, X cannot be in the S, SE, or E direction of Z (since its minimum y-coordinate is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of Z).

The only possible cardinal directions for X relative to Z are:
- N (if X's x-coordinate range overlaps with Z's)
- NE (if X's minimum x-coordinate is greater than Z's maximum x-coordinate)

Actually, no, that's not right. Let's approach this more carefully.

For regions with non-zero areas:

Let's denote the MBR of region Z as [Z_min_x, Z_max_x] × [Z_min_y, Z_max_y].

The cardinal direction tiles around Z are:
- NW: (-∞, Z_min_x) × (Z_max_y, ∞)
- N: [Z_min_x, Z_max_x] × (Z_max_y, ∞)
- NE: (Z_max_x, ∞) × (Z_max_y, ∞)
- W: (-∞, Z_min_x) × [Z_min_y, Z_max_y]
- O: [Z_min_x, Z_max_x] × [Z_min_y, Z_max_y]
- E: (Z_max_x, ∞) × [Z_min_y, Z_max_y]
- SW: (-∞, Z_min_x) × (-∞, Z_min_y)
- S: [Z_min_x, Z_max_x] × (-∞, Z_min_y)
- SE: (Z_max_x, ∞) × (-∞, Z_min_y)

For Y to be NW of Z, the MBR of Y, which is [Y_min_x, Y_max_x] × [Y_min_y, Y_max_y], must be entirely in the NW tile. This means:
Y_max_x < Z_min_x
Y_min_y > Z_max_y

Similarly, for X to be E of Y, the MBR of X, which is [X_min_x, X_max_x] × [X_min_y, X_max_y], must be entirely in the E tile of Y. This means:
X_min_x > Y_max_x
X_min_y ≤ Y_max_y
X_max_y ≥ Y_min_y

Now, let's determine the possible relations between X and Z.

Given that Y_max_x < Z_min_x, and X_min_x > Y_max_x, we have:
X_min_x > Y_max_x > Z_min_x

Now, let's check the possible ranges for X's x-coordinates:
- If X_max_x < Z_min_x, then X is to the west of Z. However, from above, we already know that X_min_x > Z_min_x, so this is a contradiction. X cannot be entirely to the west of Z.
- If X_min_x ≤ Z_max_x and X_max_x ≥ Z_min_x, then X's x-coordinate range overlaps with Z's.
- If X_min_x > Z_max_x, then X is to the east of Z.

Let's now check the possible ranges for X's y-coordinates:
- Since Y_min_y > Z_max_y, and the y-coordinates of X are bounded by the y-coordinates of Y, we can say that X's minimum y-coordinate is greater than Z's maximum y-coordinate. This means X is above Z.

Combining these, the possible cardinal directions for X relative to Z are:
- N (if X's x-coordinate range overlaps with Z's, which is possible if X_min_x ≤ Z_max_x and X_max_x ≥ Z_min_x)
- NE (if X is to the east of Z, which is possible if X_min_x > Z_max_x)
- NW (if X is to the west of Z, which is a contradiction given our conditions)

OK so the possible relations are N and NE. But wait, I previously concluded that the possible relations were NW, N, and NE. Let's resolve this contradiction.

Actually let's be more careful, assuming the problems is referring to the CDR (Cardinal Direction Relations). I think the confusion is due to the way I've been interpreting the problem. 

Let me start fresh with just the 9-tile approach, where the space around a reference object is partitioned into 9 tiles based on the MBR of the reference.

Let's denote the MBR of region Z as [Z_min_x, Z_max_x] × [Z_min_y, Z_max_y].

The nine tiles around Z are:
- NW: (-∞, Z_min_x) × (Z_max_y, ∞)
- N: [Z_min_x, Z_max_x] × (Z_max_y, ∞)
- NE: (Z_max_x, ∞) × (Z_max_y, ∞)
- W: (-∞, Z_min_x) × [Z_min_y, Z_max_y]
- O: [Z_min_x, Z_max_x] × [Z_min_y, Z_max_y]
- E: (Z_max_x, ∞) × [Z_min_y, Z_max_y]
- SW: (-∞, Z_min_x) × (-∞, Z_min_y)
- S: [Z_min_x, Z_max_x] × (-∞, Z_min_y)
- SE: (Z_max_x, ∞) × (-∞, Z_min_y)

For Y to be NW of Z, the MBR of Y, which is [Y_min_x, Y_max_x] × [Y_min_y, Y_max_y], must be entirely in the NW tile. This means:
Y_max_x < Z_min_x
Y_min_y > Z_max_y

For X to be E of Y, the MBR of X, which is [X_min_x, X_max_x] × [X_min_y, X_max_y], must be entirely in the E tile of Y. This means:
X_min_x > Y_max_x
X_min_y ≤ Y_max_y
X_max_y ≥ Y_min_y

Given the above, let's determine the possible x-coordinate relations between X and Z:
Since Y_max_x < Z_min_x, and X_min_x > Y_max_x, we have X_min_x > Z_min_x.
So, X can't be entirely to the west of Z.

Given the possible y-coordinate relations, since Y_min_y > Z_max_y, and X's y-coordinates are bounded by Y's, we have X_min_y ≥ min(Y_min_y, Y_max_y) > Z_max_y. This means X is above Z.

Combining the x and y coordinates, the possible cardinal directions for X relative to Z are:
- N (if X's x-coordinate range overlaps with Z's)
- NE (if X is to the east of Z)

For X to be in the N tile, its x-coordinate range should overlap with Z's. This means X_min_x ≤ Z_max_x and X_max_x ≥ Z_min_x. We've already established that X_min_x > Z_min_x, so the condition becomes X_min_x ≤ Z_max_x. This is possible; for instance, if X_min_x is just slightly greater than Z_min_x, and Z_max_x is significantly greater than Z_min_x, then X can be in the N tile.

For X to be in the NE tile, it should be to the east of Z. This means X_min_x > Z_max_x. This is also possible; for instance, if Y is just slightly to the NW of Z, and X is far to the east of Y, then X can be in the NE tile.

Therefore, given the conditions, the possible cardinal directions for X relative to Z are:
- N
- NE

OK so we've narrowed it down to N and NE. But I'm still missing something because I previously concluded that X can also be NW of Z, which would indicate X is to the west of Z. Let's revisit that argument.

For X to be in the NW tile, its x-coordinates should be less than Z_min_x. This means X_max_x < Z_min_x. But we've already established that X_min_x > Y_max_x and Y_max_x < Z_min_x, which means X_min_x > Z_min_x. This contradicts the condition for X to be in the NW tile. So, X cannot be NW of Z.

OK so the answer is N and NE.

Actually, now I'm thinking about it, I think I've been unnecessarily complicating the problem. Let's revisit the problem:

Given "Y is Northwest of Z" and "X is East of Y", we want to determine the possible cardinal direction relation between X and Z.

Using the 9-tile approach, if Y is NW of Z, it means Y is entirely in the NW tile of Z. This means Y is to the left and above Z.

Similarly, if X is E of Y, it means X is entirely in the E tile of Y. This means X is to the right of Y and at a similar vertical position.

Now, combining these, X is to the right of Y, which is to the left of Z. Depending on how far to the right X is, it can still be to the left of Z (in which case it would be in the NW tile of Z), or it can be at a similar horizontal position as Z (in which case it would be in the N tile of Z), or it can be to the right of Z (in which case it would be in the NE tile of Z).

Let's check this:

For Y to be NW of Z, Y is entirely in the NW tile of Z. This means all points of Y have x-coordinates less than the minimum x-coordinate of Z, and y-coordinates greater than the maximum y-coordinate of Z.

For X to be E of Y, X is entirely in the E tile of Y. This means all points of X have x-coordinates greater than the maximum x-coordinate of Y, and y-coordinates falling within the y-coordinate range of Y.

Now, the relation between X and Z depends on the relative positions of the maximum x-coordinate of Y and the minimum x-coordinate of Z, as well as the y-coordinate ranges of X and Z.

Given that Y is entirely to the left of Z, and X is entirely to the right of Y, X can be to the left, at a similar horizontal position, or to the right of Z. Since Y is entirely above Z, and X is at a similar vertical position as Y, X is also above Z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal directions for X relative to Z are:
- NW (if X is to the left of Z)
- N (if X is at a similar horizontal position as Z)
- NE (if X is to the right of Z)

Let me double-check that X can indeed be to the left of Z. For this to happen, the maximum x-coordinate of X should be less than the minimum x-coordinate of Z. Since X is to the right of Y, its minimum x-coordinate is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of Y. So, for X to be to the left of Z, we need the maximum x-coordinate of X to be less than the minimum x-coordinate of Z, which can happen if the x-coordinate range of X is not too large and if the maximum x-coordinate of Y is not too close to the minimum x-coordinate of Z.

Actually, wait a minute. If Y is entirely to the left of Z (Y_max_x < Z_min_x) and X is entirely to the right of Y (X_min_x > Y_max_x), does that guarantee X is to the right of Z (X_min_x > Z_min_x)? 

Let's see: Y_max_x < Z_min_x and X_min_x > Y_max_x implies X_min_x > Z_min_x. So, X is indeed to the right of Z's left boundary. However, this doesn't guarantee that X is entirely to the right of Z (i.e., X_min_x > Z_max_x).

Actually, wait. X_min_x > Z_min_x doesn't mean X is entirely to the right of Z. It just means X's left boundary is to the right of Z's left boundary. For X to be entirely to the right of Z, we would need X_min_x > Z_max_x.

Given the conditions, X's left boundary is to the right of Z's left boundary, but the position of X's right boundary relative to Z's right boundary is not determined. This means X can overlap with Z horizontally or be entirely to the right of Z.

OK let's double check this whole thing:

1. For Y to be NW of Z:
   Y_max_x < Z_min_x (Y is to the left of Z)
   Y_min_y > Z_max_y (Y is above Z)

2. For X to be E of Y:
   X_min_x > Y_max_x (X is to the right of Y)
   X_min_y ≤ Y_max_y (X's bottom is not above Y's top)
   X_max_y ≥ Y_min_y (X's top is not below Y's bottom)

3. Given the above, let's determine the relation between X and Z:
   Since Y_max_x < Z_min_x and X_min_x > Y_max_x, we know X_min_x > Z_min_x (X's left boundary is to the right of Z's left boundary).
   
   This means X can't be entirely to the left of Z. So, X can't be in the NW, W, or SW tiles of Z.

   Since Y_min_y > Z_max_y and X's y-coordinates are bounded by Y's, we know X_min_y > Z_max_y (X's bottom is above Z's top).
   
   This means X can't be in the W, O, E, SW, S, or SE tiles of Z.

   The only possible tiles for X are N and NE.

OK so I've reaffirmed that the answer is N or NE.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking. Let's simplify this. 

I'm trying to determine the possible cardinal direction relation between X and Z, given "Y is Northwest of Z" and "X is East of Y".

A cardinal direction relation is defined with respect to a MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) of a reference region. When we say "Y is Northwest of Z", it means the MBR of Y is in the Northwest tile of the MBR of Z.

Similarly, when we say "X is East of Y", it means the MBR of X is in the East tile of the MBR of Y.

Let me use a concrete approach. Consider the MBR of Z as [0, 1] × [0, 1]. The cardinal direction tiles around Z are:
- NW: (-∞, 0) × (1, ∞)
- N: [0, 1] × (1, ∞)
- NE: (1, ∞) × (1, ∞)
- W: (-∞, 0) × [0, 1]
- O: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- E: (1, ∞) × [0, 1]
- SW: (-∞, 0) × (-∞, 0)
- S: [0, 1] × (-∞, 0)
- SE: (1, ∞) × (-∞, 0)

For Y to be NW of Z, the MBR of Y is in the NW tile of Z. Let's consider an example: The MBR of Y is [-2, -1] × [2, 3].

Now, for X to be E of Y, the MBR of X is in the E tile of Y. Let's see some examples:
1. The MBR of X is [0, 2] × [2, 3]. In this case, X is in the N tile of Z.
2. The MBR of X is [2, 3] × [2, 3]. In this case, X is in the NE tile of Z.

So, based on the specific MBRs we've chosen, X can be in either the N or NE tile of Z.

But I'm still bothered by my earlier analysis that suggested X could also be in the NW tile of Z. Let me double-check that. For X to be NW of Z, its MBR should be in the NW tile of Z. But since X is E of Y, and Y is NW of Z, this means X is to the right of Y and Y is to the left of Z. If X is to the right of Y, can it still be to the left of Z? Let's see.

Given Y's MBR is [-2, -1] × [2, 3] and Z's MBR is [0, 1] × [0, 1], for X to be E of Y, its MBR should be to the right of Y. This means the left boundary of X should be greater than the right boundary of Y. So, X_min_x > -1.

For X to be NW of Z, its MBR should be in the NW tile of Z. This means the right boundary of X should be less than the left boundary of Z. So, X_max_x < 0.

Combining the two, we get: -1 < X_min_x ≤ X_max_x < 0. This is a valid range, so X can be NW of Z.

Actually, let's double-check this further. The MBR of X, in this case, would be [X_min_x, X_max_x] × [X_min_y, X_max_y] where:
- -1 < X_min_x < X_max_x < 0
- X's y-coordinates should align with Y's. Given Y's MBR is [2, 3], we have 2 ≤ X_min_y ≤ X_max_y ≤ 3.

With these coordinates, X is to the right of Y (satisfying "X is East of Y") and to the left of Z (making it NW of Z).

OK so the possinle cardinal direction relations between X and Z are:
- NW
- N
- NE

Let me recheck this by looking at the problem from another angle.

I'll use a 2D coordinate system. Let's place Z at the origin. The nine tiles around Z are:
- NW: (-∞, 0) × (0, ∞)
- N: [0, 0] × (0, ∞)
- NE: (0, ∞) × (0, ∞)
- W: (-∞, 0) × [-0, 0]
- O: [0, 0] × [-0, 0]
- E: (0, ∞) × [-0, 0]
- SW: (-∞, 0) × (-∞, -0)
- S: [0, 0] × (-∞, -0)
- SE: (0, ∞) × (-∞, -0)

For Y to be NW of Z, it is in the NW tile, which is (-∞, 0) × (0, ∞). For simplicity, let's say Y is at the point (-1, 1).

For X to be E of Y, it is in the E tile of Y, which is (0, ∞) × [0, 0] centered at Y. Translated to the global coordinate system, this is (-1+0, ∞) × [-1+0, -1+0] or (-1, ∞) × [0, 0] centered at the origin. This means X is at some point (a, 1) where a > -1.

Now, let's check the tile of X relative to Z. Since Z is at the origin, the tiles are as given above. The coordinates of X are (a, 1).

If a < 0, then X is in the NW tile of Z.
If a = 0, then X is in the N tile of Z.
If a > 0, then X is in the NE tile of Z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal directions for X relative to Z are:
- NW (if a < 0)
- N (if a = 0)
- NE (if a > 0)

I'll approach this one more time:

If Y is NW of Z, this means:
Y_max_x < Z_min_x (Y is to the left of Z)
Y_min_y > Z_max_y (Y is above Z)

If X is E of Y, this means:
X_min_x > Y_max_x (X is to the right of Y)
X's y-coordinates are within the range of Y's y-coordinates.

Combining the constraints, we have:
Z_min_x > Y_max_x (from the first set of constraints)
X_min_x > Y_max_x (from the second set of constraints)

This means X_min_x > Y_max_x. From this, we can't directly determine the relation between X_min_x and Z_min_x. If X_min_x < Z_min_x, then X is to the left of Z; if X_min_x = Z_min_x, then X's left boundary aligns with Z's left boundary; if X_min_x > Z_min_x, then X is to the right of Z's left boundary.

Similarly, we don't know the relation between X_max_x and Z_max_x, so X could be entirely to the left of Z, overlap with Z, or be entirely to the right of Z horizontally.

However, we do know that Y_min_y > Z_max_y, and since X's y-coordinates are within the range of Y's y-coordinates, we can say X_min_y > Z_max_y. This means X is above Z.

Given the possible horizontal and vertical relations, the possible cardinal directions for X relative to Z are:
- NW (if X is to the left of Z)
- N (if X overlaps with Z horizontally)
- NE (if X is to the right of Z)

Actually, let me revisit the original constraints more precisely. The key constraint here is the relation between X_min_x and Z_min_x. If X_min_x < Z_min_x, then X can be NW of Z. But given that Y_max_x < Z_min_x and X_min_x > Y_max_x, we have X_min_x > Z_min_x, which contradicts the condition for X to be NW of Z.

Actually, that can't be right. Let's revisit the constraints:

If Y is NW of Z, it is in the NW tile of Z, which means:
Y_max_x < Z_min_x (Y is to the left of Z)
Y_min_y > Z_max_y (Y is above Z)

If X is E of Y, it is in the E tile of Y, which means:
X_min_x > Y_max_x (X is to the right of Y)
X's y-coordinates are within the range of Y's y-coordinates.

Combining the first two equations, we get:
X_min_x > Y_max_x > Z_min_x (X's left boundary is to the right of Y's right boundary, which is to the left of Z's left boundary)

Given this contradiction, X cannot be NW of Z.

Actually, hold on. I mixed up the equations. If Y is NW of Z, it is in the NW tile of Z, which means:
Y_max_x < Z_min_x (Y is to the left of Z)
Y_min_y > Z_max_y (Y is above Z)

If X is E of Y, it is in the E tile of Y, which means:
X_min_x > Y_max_x (X is to the right of Y)
X's y-coordinates are within the range of Y's y-coordinates.

Combining the first two equations, we get:
X_min_x > Y_max_x and Y_max_x < Z_min_x
This implies X_min_x > Z_min_x (X's left boundary is to the right of Z's left boundary)

Therefore, X cannot be entirely to the left of Z. This means X cannot be in the NW tile of Z.

Given the constraints, the possible cardinal directions for X relative to Z are:
- N (if X overlaps with Z horizontally)
- NE (if X is to the right of Z)

Wait, that can't be right. The constraint X_min_x > Z_min_x means X's left boundary is to the right of Z's left boundary. This doesn't mean X can't be NW of Z; it just means X can't be entirely to the left of Z. For X to be in the NW tile of Z, its x-coordinates should be less than Z_min_x. So, if X_max_x < Z_min_x, then X is NW of Z. But since X_min_x > Z_min_x, we have X_min_x > Z_min_x and X_max_x < Z_min_x, which is a contradiction.

Alright so the answer is N and NE.

Actually, I realize that in the projection-based model, the "East" cardinal direction for points means the x-coordinate increases while the y-coordinate remains the same. And the "Northwest" cardinal direction means the x-coordinate decreases and the y-coordinate increases.

Let's approach this problem using the classic cardinal direction model for points.

If y is Northwest of z, and we place z at the origin (0, 0), then y is at a position (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.

If x is East of y, then x is at a position (-a + c, b) for some c > 0.

To determine the cardinal direction of x relative to z, we compare their coordinates. x is at position (-a + c, b) and z is at position (0, 0).

If -a + c < 0, then x is to the west of z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the Northwest quadrant relative to z.

If -a + c = 0, then x is directly North of z.

If -a + c > 0, then x is to the east of z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the Northeast quadrant relative to z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- Northwest (if -a + c < 0, i.e., c < a)
- North (if -a + c = 0, i.e., c = a)
- Northeast (if -a + c > 0, i.e., c > a)

OK I think that's the right answer: Northwest, North, or Northeast.

Actually wait. I made yet another mistake. If we place z at the origin, then the "Northwest" cardinal direction means the negative x-direction and the positive y-direction. So, if y is Northwest of z, y is at position (-a, b) for some a, b > 0.

Given that x is East of y, it is at position (-a + c, b) for some c > 0. Now, to determine the relation of x to z, we compare their coordinates. x is at (-a + c, b) and z is at (0, 0).

If -a + c < 0, then x is to the west of z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the Northwest cardinal direction relative to z.

If -a + c = 0, then x's x-coordinate is the same as z's. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the North cardinal direction relative to z.

If -a + c > 0, then x is to the east of z. Combined with the y-coordinate, since b > 0, x is in the Northeast cardinal direction relative to z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are:
- Northwest (if c < a)
- North (if c = a)
- Northeast (if c > a)

Given that a, b, and c are positive variables, all three relations are possible depending on the specific values of a and c.

OK the final answer is: Northwest, North, or Northeast.

Actually no, let me go back to the problem statement, because I'm unsure what model the problem statement is under. The problem is:

"Let East and Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is East of region y and region y is Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Hmm, the phrasing suggests that the problem is about Cardinal Direction Relations (CDRs) between regions (as opposed to points). 

In the context of CDRs for regions, the space is typically partitioned into 9 tiles (8 cardinal and ordinal directions, plus a central "bounding box" or "equal" region) based on the MBR of a reference region. 

When we say "region x is East of region y", it means the MBR of x is entirely in the East tile of the MBR of y. Similarly, when we say "region y is Northwest of region z", it means the MBR of y is entirely in the Northwest tile of the MBR of z.

Let's determine the possible relation between region x and region z.

For simplicity, let's denote the MBR of a region A as [A_min_x, A_max_x] × [A_min_y, A_max_y].

For region y to be Northwest of region z, the MBR of y must be entirely in the Northwest tile of the MBR of z. This means:
y_max_x < z_min_x (y is entirely to the left of z)
y_min_y > z_max_y (y is entirely above z)

For region x to be East of region y, the MBR of x must be entirely in the East tile of the MBR of y. This means:
x_min_x > y_max_x (x is entirely to the right of y)
x_min_y ≤ y_max_y (x is not entirely above y)
x_max_y ≥ y_min_y (x is not entirely below y)

Let's determine the possible relation between x and z by considering their MBRs:

Given that y_max_x < z_min_x (y is entirely to the left of z) and x_min_x > y_max_x (x is entirely to the right of y), we have:
x_min_x > y_max_x > z_min_x (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary)

This means x cannot be entirely to the left of z. Thus, x cannot be in the Southwest, West, or Northwest tile of z.

Given that y_min_y > z_max_y (y is entirely above z) and x_min_y ≤ y_max_y and x_max_y ≥ y_min_y (x's y-coordinates overlap with y's), we know that x is at least partially above z. This means x cannot be entirely below or at the same vertical
