PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is Southeast of region z

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let me think about what it means for one region to be in a certain cardinal direction relative to another:

- If x is Northwest of y, it means x is both North and West of y.
- If y is Southeast of z, it means y is both South and East of z.

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z.

If x is Northwest of y and y is Southeast of z, I need to combine these relations to find out how x is positioned relative to z.

Let's break this down by components:
- North/South component: x is North of y, and y is South of z
- East/West component: x is West of y, and y is East of z

For the North/South component:
If x is North of y, and y is South of z, then the North/South relationship between x and z is not immediately clear. x could be North of z, South of z, or at the same latitude as z.

For the East/West component:
If x is West of y, and y is East of z, then the East/West relationship between x and z is also not immediately clear. x could be East of z, West of z, or at the same longitude as z.

Let me draw this out to visualize it better.

If we have:
```
z
 \
  \
   y
    \
     \
      x
```

In this arrangement:
- x is Northwest of y (down and to the left of y)
- y is Southeast of z (down and to the right of z)
- x appears to be directly South of z

But we could also have:
```
    z
   /
  /
 y
  \
   \
    x
```

In this arrangement:
- x is Northwest of y (up and to the left of y)
- y is Southeast of z (down and to the right of z)
- x appears to be directly West of z

Or even:
```
      z
     /
    /
   y
  /
 /
x
```

In this arrangement:
- x is Northwest of y (up and to the left of y)
- y is Southeast of z (down and to the right of z)
- x appears to be Northwest of z

Actually, I need to be more careful about the directions here. Let me redefine:

- North: positive y-direction
- South: negative y-direction
- East: positive x-direction
- West: negative x-direction

So:
- Northwest: positive y-direction and negative x-direction
- Southeast: negative y-direction and positive x-direction

Now, if x is Northwest of y, then in Cartesian coordinates, if y is at (y_x, y_y), then x is at some point (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x and x_y > y_y.

And if y is Southeast of z, then if z is at (z_x, z_y), then y is at some point (y_x, y_y) where y_x > z_x and y_y < z_y.

Combining these:
- x_x < y_x and y_x > z_x, which means the relationship between x_x and z_x is not fixed (x_x could be less than, equal to, or greater than z_x).
- x_y > y_y and y_y < z_y, which means the relationship between x_y and z_y is not fixed (x_y could be less than, equal to, or greater than z_y).

OK, I think I got confused when trying to visualize it. Let's think about this from the perspective of the cardinal directions.

- If region x is Northwest of region y, then x is both North and West of y.
- If region y is Southeast of region z, then y is both South and East of z.

Now, let's determine what we can say about x with respect to z:

1. North/South component:
   - x is North of y (given: x is Northwest of y)
   - y is South of z (given: y is Southeast of z)
   - This doesn't give us a definite North/South relationship between x and z. Depending on the exact positions, x could be North of z, South of z, or at the same latitude.

2. East/West component:
   - x is West of y (given: x is Northwest of y)
   - y is East of z (given: y is Southeast of z)
   - This doesn't give us a definite East/West relationship between x and z. Depending on the exact positions, x could be East of z, West of z, or at the same longitude.

Based on these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be:
- North (if x is North of z and at the same longitude)
- South (if x is South of z and at the same longitude)
- East (if x is East of z and at the same latitude)
- West (if x is West of z and at the same latitude)
- Northeast (if x is both North and East of z)
- Northwest (if x is both North and West of z)
- Southeast (if x is both South and East of z)
- Southwest (if x is both South and West of z)

Hmm, that's all possible cardinal directions. Let me think again.

Actually, I'm going to step back and approach this problem differently.

Let's define a coordinate system where the center of region y is at the origin (0, 0). Then, since x is Northwest of y, x is in the quadrant where both x-coordinates and y-coordinates are negative. And since z is Southeast of y, z is in the quadrant where both x-coordinates and y-coordinates are positive.

But no, this is wrong. Northwest means North and West, so the y-coordinate should be positive (North) and the x-coordinate should be negative (West). Similarly, Southeast means South and East, so the y-coordinate should be negative (South) and the x-coordinate should be positive (East).

So, if y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- Region x is in the quadrant with negative x-coordinates and positive y-coordinates (the quadrant typically labeled as the second quadrant in mathematics).
- Region z is in the quadrant with positive x-coordinates and negative y-coordinates (the quadrant typically labeled as the fourth quadrant).

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

To be more precise, let's use concrete coordinates for the centers of the regions:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at some point (-a, b) where a and b are positive (since x is Northwest of y)
- z is at some point (c, -d) where c and d are positive (since z is Northwest of y)

Now, the vector from z to x is:
(-a, b) - (c, -d) = (-a-c, b+d)

This means x is:
- a+c units to the West of z
- b+d units to the North of z

So, x is Northwest of z.

But let me double-check this.

I said y is at (0, 0), x is at (-a, b), and z is at (c, -d) where a, b, c, and d are positive.

But wait, I made an error. I said "z is Northwest of y," but according to the problem, y is Southeast of z. Let me correct this.

If y is Southeast of z, then z is Northwest of y. This means:
- If y is at (0, 0), then z is at some point (-c, d) where c and d are positive.

So, the centers of the regions are:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-a, b) where a and b are positive
- z is at (-c, d) where c and d are positive

Now, the vector from z to x is:
(-a, b) - (-c, d) = (-a+c, b-d)

Let's break this down:
- East/West component (-a+c): If a > c, then x is further West than z. If a < c, then x is further East than z. If a = c, then x and z are at the same longitude.
- North/South component (b-d): If b > d, then x is further North than z. If b < d, then x is further South than z. If b = d, then x and z are at the same latitude.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North (if b > d and a = c)
- South (if b < d and a = c)
- East (if a < c and b = d)
- West (if a > c and b = d)
- Northeast (if a < c and b > d)
- Northwest (if a > c and b > d)
- Southeast (if a < c and b < d)
- Southwest (if a > c and b < d)

That's still all the cardinal directions. Let me approach this differently.

Actually, I'm making a fundamental mistake here. The regions x, y, and z are not just points, they are regions with area. So, the cardinal direction relation between two regions is not as simple as comparing their center coordinates.

Let me reset and approach this problem more systematically using the properties of cardinal direction relations.

If region x is Northwest of region y, it means all points of x are Northwest of all points of y. Similarly, if region y is Southeast of region z, it means all points of y are Southeast of all points of z.

Given these constraints, we need to determine what can be said about the relation between x and z.

Since all points of x are Northwest of all points of y, and all points of y are Southeast of all points of z, we can infer something about the relationship between x and z.

Let's think about the x-coordinates first:
- All points of x have x-coordinates less than all points of y (because x is West of y).
- All points of y have x-coordinates greater than all points of z (because y is East of z).
- By transitivity, all points of x have x-coordinates less than all points of z. This means x is West of z.

Now, let's think about the y-coordinates:
- All points of x have y-coordinates greater than all points of y (because x is North of y).
- All points of y have y-coordinates less than all points of z (because y is South of z).
- Here, we cannot establish a transitivity relation. The y-coordinates of points in x relative to points in z can vary.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Let me be more careful with the definitions.

Wait, actually the definition I used isn't quite correct. The cardinal direction relation is typically defined based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of each region. The MBR is the smallest rectangle with sides parallel to the axes that contains the region.

Given this, if region x is Northwest of region y, it means the MBR of x is completely in the Northwest quadrant of the MBR of y. Similarly, if region y is Southeast of region z, the MBR of y is completely in the Southeast quadrant of the MBR of z.

Let's see what we can infer about the relationship between the MBRs of x and z.

Let's denote the MBR of region r as [r_min_x, r_max_x] × [r_min_y, r_max_y], where r_min_x and r_max_x are the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of the MBR, and similarly for y-coordinates.

Given:
- x is Northwest of y, which means x_max_x ≤ y_min_x and y_max_y ≤ x_min_y.
- y is Southeast of z, which means z_max_x ≤ y_min_x and y_max_y ≤ z_min_y.

From these, we can infer:
- x_max_x ≤ y_min_x and z_max_x ≤ y_min_x, but we can't directly compare x_max_x and z_max_x.
- y_max_y ≤ x_min_y and y_max_y ≤ z_min_y, but we can't directly compare x_min_y and z_min_y.

This means we can't definitively establish a unique cardinal direction relation between x and z based solely on the given information.

Hmm, let me approach this differently. I think I need to be more concrete. 

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the basic definitions and see if we can make a clear deduction.

If region x is Northwest of region y, it means x is both North and West of y. Similarly, if region y is Southeast of region z, it means y is both South and East of z.

Now, let's combine these to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

For the East/West component:
- x is West of y (from x is Northwest of y)
- y is East of z (from y is Southeast of z)
- This gives us the constraints: x is West of y and y is East of z.
- We cannot make a definitive statement about the East/West relationship between x and z without more information. x could be East of z, West of z, or x and z could overlap in the East/West direction.

For the North/South component:
- x is North of y (from x is Northwest of y)
- y is South of z (from y is Southeast of z)
- This gives us the constraints: x is North of y and y is South of z.
- Again, we cannot make a definitive statement about the North/South relationship between x and z without more information. x could be North of z, South of z, or x and z could overlap in the North/South direction.

Given these uncertainties, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- or even an overlapping relation (like "partially North")

Actually, let me be a bit more deliberate with my analysis. I think there's a clearer answer if I approach this step-by-step.

Let me use the coordinate constraints again. I'll denote the MBRs as [x_min_x, x_max_x, x_min_y, x_max_y] and similar for y and z.

If x is Northwest of y, it means:
- x_max_x ≤ y_min_x (x is completely to the West of y)
- y_max_y ≤ x_min_y (x is completely to the North of y)

If y is Southeast of z, it means:
- z_max_x ≤ y_min_x (y is completely to the East of z)
- y_max_y ≤ z_min_y (y is completely to the South of z)

Now, we can combine these constraints:
- x_max_x ≤ y_min_x (from x is Northwest of y)
- z_max_x ≤ y_min_x (from y is Southeast of z)

We can infer that both x and z are to the West of y, but we can't determine the East/West relationship between x and z without more information.

Similarly:
- y_max_y ≤ x_min_y (from x is Northwest of y)
- y_max_y ≤ z_min_y (from y is Southeast of z)

We can infer that both x and z are to the North of y, but we can't determine the North/South relationship between x and z without more information.

So, without additional constraints, the cardinal direction relation between x and z could be any of:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- or even overlapping in some way

Ah, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take a step back and consider the problem from a different angle.

We know that:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

Let's think of the "Northwest" and "Southeast" as vectors. The vector from y to x is in the Northwest direction. The vector from z to y is in the Southeast direction.

Given these two vectors, can we determine the vector from z to x?

The vector from z to x is the sum of the vector from z to y and the vector from y to x. In this case, it's the sum of a Southeast vector (from z to y) and a Northwest vector (from y to x).

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this again. Let me reset.

Let's define our cardinal directions:
- North: positive y-direction
- South: negative y-direction
- East: positive x-direction
- West: negative x-direction

So:
- Northwest: positive y-direction and negative x-direction
- Southeast: negative y-direction and positive x-direction

If we place y at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity:
- x is in the Northwest quadrant, say at (-a, b) where a and b are positive.
- z is such that y is Southeast of it, which means z is Northwest of y, say at (-c, d) where c and d are positive.

Now, let's compute the vector from z to x:
(-a, b) - (-c, d) = (-a+c, b-d)

The possible combinations are:
1. If a > c and b > d, then x is West and North of z, making x Northwest of z.
2. If a > c and b < d, then x is West and South of z, making x Southwest of z.
3. If a < c and b > d, then x is East and North of z, making x Northeast of z.
4. If a < c and b < d, then x is East and South of z, making x Southeast of z.
5. If a = c and b > d, then x is directly North of z.
6. If a = c and b < d, then x is directly South of z.
7. If a > c and b = d, then x is directly West of z.
8. If a < c and b = d, then x is directly East of z.

So, based on these possibilities, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest

Hmm, that's not helpful since it's all the cardinal directions. I need to think about this more carefully.

But wait, I think there's another property that I'm missing: the bounding box relationship. When two regions have a cardinal direction relation, it often means that the bounding box of one region is completely in the specified direction of the bounding box of the other. Let's use this property.

If x is Northwest of y, it means the bounding box of x is completely in the Northwest quadrant of the bounding box of y. Similarly, if y is Southeast of z, the bounding box of y is completely in the Southeast quadrant of the bounding box of z.

Let's visualize this:

```
   z
   |
   |
   y
    \
     \
      x
```

In this arrangement, x is Northwest of y and y is Southeast of z. It seems like x can be in any direction relative to z depending on the exact positions.

But wait, I think there's a stricter interpretation. If x is Northwest of y, it's not just that x is in the Northwest quadrant of y, but that every point of x is Northwest of every point of y. Similarly, if y is Southeast of z, every point of y is Southeast of every point of z.

Given this stricter interpretation, what can we say about the direction of x relative to z?

OK, let me draw this out again. Let me actually define the cardinal directions for myself again. Cardinal directions give the relation between two regions. The directions are:

- North: The first region is above the second (higher y-coordinates).
- South: The first region is below the second (lower y-coordinates).
- East: The first region is to the right of the second (higher x-coordinates).
- West: The first region is to the left of the second (lower x-coordinates).
- Northeast: The first region is both North and East of the second.
- Northwest: The first region is both North and West of the second.
- Southeast: The first region is both South and East of the second.
- Southwest: The first region is both South and West of the second.

Now, given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

Let's decompose this:
- Northwest (x to y): x is both North and West of y.
- Southeast (y to z): y is both South and East of z.

Transitively:
- If x is North of y and y is South of z, we can't determine the North/South relationship between x and z without more information.
- If x is West of y and y is East of z, we can't determine the East/West relationship between x and z without more information.

But, I think I was on the right track before with the way I was thinking about it.

Let's put the center of region y at the origin (0,0) for the purpose of visualization. So we have:
- Region y is at (0, 0)
- Region x is Northwest of y, so it's in the quadrant with negative x and positive y values, say at (-a, b) where a and b are positive.
- Region z is such that y is Southeast of it, which means z is Northwest of y, so it's also in the quadrant with negative x and positive y values, say at (-c, d) where c and d are positive.

Now, the relation between x and z depends on the relative values of a, b, c, and d.

If we compute the vector from z to x, we get:
(-a, b) - (-c, d) = (-a + c, b - d)

Now, let's analyze the possible combinations:
1. If a > c and b > d, then x is West and North of z, making x Northwest of z.
2. If a < c and b > d, then x is East and North of z, making x Northeast of z.
3. If a > c and b < d, then x is West and South of z, making x Southwest of z.
4. If a < c and b < d, then x is East and South of z, making x Southeast of z.
5. If a = c and b > d, then x is directly North of z.
6. If a = c and b < d, then x is directly South of z.
7. If a > c and b = d, then x is directly West of z.
8. If a < c and b = d, then x is directly East of z.

(Actually, I had the above correct in my earlier try. I was right the first time.)

So, based on these possibilities, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest

It seems like the direction of x relative to z can be any of the cardinal directions, depending on the exact positions of the regions. But this seems wrong to me.

Let's get back to the problem statement and check if there's anything I might have misunderstood.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

Wait, I misunderstood the second part. If y is Southeast of z, then z is Northwest of y.

So, we have:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region z is Northwest of region y.

Both x and z are in the Northwest quadrant of y. But we can't determine the exact relation between x and z without more information.

OK, after re-reading I actually had it right in the past. Let me just be super precise:

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

From the second statement, we can infer:
- Region z is Northwest of region y.

So both regions x and z are Northwest of region y.

So where is region x in relation to region z? Here, I can't say much about the East/West or North/South components.

Wait, let me think of this as drawing a picture:

If we put region y at the origin, then:
- Region x is Northwest of y, so it's in the second quadrant.
- Region z is such that y is Southeast of it, which means z is also in the second quadrant.

So both x and z are in the second quadrant. The exact relation between x and z depends on their specific positions within that quadrant. 

OK, wait, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me just look at the properties of cardinal directions: 

1. If region A is in direction D of region B, and region B is in direction D of region C, then region A is in direction D of region C. This is the property of transitivity.

2. If region A is in direction D of region B, and region B is in direction D' of region C, where D and D' are not the same, then the relation between region A and region C can vary based on the exact positions.

In our problem, we have:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

Using the second property, since the directions "Northwest" and "Southeast" are not the same (in fact, they are opposites), the relation between region x and region z can vary based on the exact positions.

But, actually, let's try to be a bit more specific. 

If we put region y at the origin, then:
- Region x is Northwest of y, so it's in the second quadrant (negative x, positive y).
- Region z is such that y is Southeast of it, which means z is in the second quadrant (negative x, positive y) of y.

But, now, let's think about the vector from y to x and the vector from y to z.
- Vector from y to x: (some negative value for x, some positive value for y), which points Northwest.
- Vector from y to z: (some negative value for x, some positive value for y), which also points Northwest.

Now, the relation between x and z depends on the exact magnitudes of these vectors.

For instance, if the vector from y to x is (-2, 3) and the vector from y to z is (-1, 2), then x is Southwest of z. But if the vector from y to x is (-1, 3) and the vector from y to z is (-2, 2), then x is Northeast of z.

I know I'm being redundant, but let me just conclude again: the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest

Actually, there's also the "Bounding Box" relation. This relation occurs when one region partially or completely overlaps the other, such that no clear cardinal direction can be specified. 

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- Bounding Box (overlapping)

Actually, the whole issue might be that my understanding of cardinal direction relations isn't entirely correct.

Let's clarify what it means for one region to be in a cardinal direction of another. I believe the most common definition is based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of each region. The MBR is the smallest rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes that completely contains the region.

If region A is in a cardinal direction (e.g., Northwest) of region B, it means the MBR of A is completely in that direction of the MBR of B. For example, if A is Northwest of B, the MBR of A is completely in the Northwest of the MBR of B. This means the MBR of A is both North and West of the MBR of B.

In our problem, we have:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

This means:
- The MBR of x is completely Northwest of the MBR of y.
- The MBR of y is completely Southeast of the MBR of z.

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between the MBR of x and the MBR of z.

If we denote the MBR of a region r as [r_min_x, r_max_x, r_min_y, r_max_y], then:
- x is Northwest of y means x_max_x < y_min_x and y_max_y < x_min_y.
- y is Southeast of z means z_max_x < y_min_x and y_max_y < z_min_y.

From these, we can infer:
- x_max_x < y_min_x (from x is Northwest of y)
- z_max_x < y_min_x (from y is Southeast of z)

This means both x and z are to the West of y, but we can't determine the East/West relationship between x and z without more information.

Similarly:
- y_max_y < x_min_y (from x is Northwest of y)
- y_max_y < z_min_y (from y is Southeast of z)

This means both x and z are to the North of y, but we can't determine the North/South relationship between x and z without more information.

Based on these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North (if x is North of z and they overlap in the East/West direction)
- South (if x is South of z and they overlap in the East/West direction)
- East (if x is East of z and they overlap in the North/South direction)
- West (if x is West of z and they overlap in the North/South direction)
- Northeast (if x is both North and East of z)
- Northwest (if x is both North and West of z)
- Southeast (if x is both South and East of z)
- Southwest (if x is both South and West of z)

Additionally, there's the possibility that the MBR of x and the MBR of z overlap in both the North/South and East/West directions, which would be the "Bounding Box" relation.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- Bounding Box (overlapping)

You know, I think this is the right answer. All possible cardinal directions (the 8 standard ones plus overlapping).

But what, let me see if I can determine if the "Bounding Box" (overlapping) relation is possible.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

From these, we know:
- The MBR of x is completely Northwest of the MBR of y.
- The MBR of y is completely Southeast of the MBR of z.

For the MBR of x and the MBR of z to overlap, there should be some overlap in both the North/South and East/West directions.

Let's visualize this with a specific example:
- Let's say the MBR of y is [10, 20, 10, 20].
- Since x is Northwest of y, the MBR of x might be [0, 5, 25, 30].
- Since y is Southeast of z, the MBR of z might be [0, 5, 25, 30].

In this example, the MBRs of x and z overlap completely. This means the "Bounding Box" relation is indeed possible between x and z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- Bounding Box (overlapping)

Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me restart this analysis. 

If we have:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

Then we know:
- x is in the Northwest quadrant of y.
- y is in the Southeast quadrant of z.

Let me place y at the origin to visualize this. Then:
- x is in the Northwest quadrant (negative x, positive y).
- z is such that y is in its Southeast quadrant. This means y is both South and East of z, which means z is Northwest of y. So, z is also in the Northwest quadrant of y (negative x, positive y).

So, both x and z are in the Northwest quadrant of y. Let's say:
- x is at some point (-a, b) where a and b are positive.
- z is at some point (-c, d) where c and d are positive.

The relation between x and z depends on the values of a, b, c, and d, which can lead to any of the cardinal direction relations or an overlapping relation (Bounding Box).

Hmm, I've gone in circles and my conclusion remains the same. Let me see if I can approach this differently.

Actually, let me just make sure my understanding of the problem is correct once more.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

I believe it's asking for the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z. That is, is x North of z or West of z, or some other direction or relation.

For the cardinal direction relations, I believe they are defined based on the minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the regions. The MBR is the smallest rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes that completely contains the region.

If region A is in a cardinal direction (e.g., Northwest) of region B, it means the MBR of A is completely in that direction of the MBR of B. For example, if A is Northwest of B, the MBR of A is completely in the Northwest of the MBR of B. This means the MBR of A is both North and West of the MBR of B.

In our problem, we have:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

This means:
- The MBR of x is completely Northwest of the MBR of y.
- The MBR of y is completely Southeast of the MBR of z.

Oh, actually, I think I should be more careful. When I say "x is Northwest of y," it doesn't necessarily mean that x is in the Northwest quadrant of y. It means that, on average or considering all points of both regions, x is Northwest of y.

Maybe I should try to break down the cardinal directions more precisely. The 8 cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) divide the 2D space into 8 sectors of 45 degrees each.

Actually, I think it's more appropriate to use the CONTAINS, INSIDE, COVER, and COVEREDBY relations from Region Connection Calculus (RCC) to express the spatial relationships between the MBRs of the regions.

But I'm digressing. Let's get back to the problem. 

Let's place y at the origin for visualization. We know:
- x is Northwest of y, which means x is in the direction of 135 degrees (considering 0 degrees as East and going counterclockwise).
- y is Southeast of z, which means z is Northwest of y. So, z is also in the direction of 135 degrees from y.

Now, the direction of x from z depends on the exact positions. Given that both x and z are in the same general direction from y, the direction of x from z can be any of the 8 cardinal directions or there might be a "Bounding Box" relation if they overlap.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- Bounding Box (overlapping)

This has been my answer throughout. Unless I'm missing something fundamental about the problem, I believe this is the correct conclusion.

Actually, let me be a bit more careful about how I think of the Bounding Box relation. It's not about whether the regions themselves overlap, but whether the bounding boxes (min/max coordinate pairs) that bound the regions entirely overlap. If the regions are surrounded by the same rectangle in one direction, then we can't clearly identify the relation as "North", "East", etc. in that dimension.

So the question becomes: can the bounding boxes of x and z entirely overlap based on the given constraints? 

Let's denote the MBR of a region r as [r_min_x, r_max_x, r_min_y, r_max_y].

Given:
- x is Northwest of y: This means x_max_x < y_min_x and y_max_y < x_min_y.
- y is Southeast of z: This means z_max_x < y_min_x and y_max_y < z_min_y.

From these, we can infer:
- x_max_x < y_min_x (from x is Northwest of y)
- z_max_x < y_min_x (from y is Southeast of z)

This means both x and z are to the West of y, but we can't determine the East/West relationship between x and z without more information.

Similarly:
- y_max_y < x_min_y (from x is Northwest of y)
- y_max_y < z_min_y (from y is Southeast of z)

This means both x and z are to the North of y, but we can't determine the North/South relationship between x and z without more information.

Now, for the bounding boxes of x and z to entirely overlap, we'd need:
- x_min_x = z_min_x
- x_max_x = z_max_x
- x_min_y = z_min_y
- x_max_y = z_max_y

This level of specificity seems unlikely, but it's theoretically possible. So, I'd say "Bounding Box" is a possible relation, but it requires a very specific set of coordinates.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- Bounding Box (overlapping)

Actually, on second thought, for the bounding boxes to "entirely" overlap, they would need to be identical. This seems extremely restrictive, and it's not what the "Bounding Box" relation usually refers to. The "Bounding Box" relation is often about a more relaxed form of overlap, where the two bounding boxes share some area in all dimensions.

But even with this relaxed definition, the "Bounding Box" relation is still a possible relation between x and z.

I'm going to revisit my earlier conclusion, but also try to see if there are any restrictions on the cardinal direction relations.

Let's try to think of this in terms of vectors. If we denote the position of a region by the center of its MBR, then we can represent the cardinal directions as vectors.

If x is Northwest of y, the vector from y to x is in the Northwest direction. Similarly, if y is Southeast of z, the vector from z to y is in the Southeast direction.

Now, the vector from z to x is the sum of the vector from z to y and the vector from y to x. In this case, it's the sum of a Southeast vector (from z to y) and a Northwest vector (from y to x).

The Southeast vector and the Northwest vector are in opposite directions. Depending on their magnitudes, the sum can point in any direction or even be zero (if the magnitudes are equal).

So, based on this vector approach, the cardinal direction relation between x and z can be any of the 8 cardinal directions, or there might be a "Bounding Box" relation if the vectors cancel out.

I'm going to say the answer is:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- Bounding Box

Actually, I think I need to refine the meaning of the Bounding Box relation a bit more. In the context of cardinal direction relations, "Bounding Box" doesn't refer to the identity or overlap of the MBRs, but rather to a relation where the MBR of one region contains the MBR of the other, or the MBRs intersect in a way that doesn't fit neatly into one of the 8 cardinal directions. (But actually, I've been sloppy in using "Bounding Box" this way. I should clarify what Bounding Box means in this context.)

OK, let me actually re-examine the problem one more time, to be extremely clear about the meaning of cardinal direction relations.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z.

What's the possible cardinal direction relation between x and z?

Alright, I need to be precise about what it means for one region to be in a cardinal direction relation with another.

Let's define the MBR of a region r as [r_min_x, r_max_x, r_min_y, r_max_y].

If region A is North of region B, it means A_min_y > B_max_y. (all of A is above all of B)
If region A is South of region B, it means A_max_y < B_min_y. (all of A is below all of B)
If region A is East of region B, it means A_min_x > B_max_x. (all of A is to the right of all of B)
If region A is West of region B, it means A_max_x < B_min_x. (all of A is to the left of all of B)

The composite directions (like Northwest) combine these basic relations. For example, if region A is Northwest of region B, it means A is both North and West of B.

Now, back to our problem:

- x is Northwest of y means x_max_x < y_min_x and x_min_y > y_max_y.
- y is Southeast of z means y_min_x > z_max_x and y_max_y < z_min_y.

From these, we can infer:
- x_max_x < y_min_x (from x is Northwest of y)
- y_min_x > z_max_x (from y is Southeast of z)
- Transitively, x_max_x < z_max_x + (y_min_x - z_max_x) = y_min_x. But this doesn't give us a direct relation between x_max_x and z_max_x.

Similarly:
- x_min_y > y_max_y (from x is Northwest of y)
- y_max_y < z_min_y (from y is Southeast of z)
- Transitively, x_min_y > z_min_y - (z_min_y - y_max_y) = y_max_y. But again, this doesn't give us a direct relation between x_min_y and z_min_y.

So, based on the given constraints, the cardinal direction relation between x and z can be any of the 8 cardinal directions or a relation that doesn't fit neatly into one of these directions (which could be termed as "Bounding Box").

I think I've been a bit confused about the term "Bounding Box" in this context. I think what I'm calling a "Bounding Box" relation is typically called a "partly" or "partly contains" relation in literature, or in some cases, it might be described as regions having some overlapping bounding boxes.

Actually, hold on. I need to check what "Bounding Box" is exactly in the context of cardinal direction relations. Let me think of different possibilities. The possible relation between MBRs in 2D space are:

- Equal: The two MBRs are the same.
- Disjoint: The two MBRs don't overlap.
- Contains: One MBR completely contains the other.
- Inside: One MBR is completely inside the other.
- Overlaps: The two MBRs overlap, but one doesn't completely contain the other.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, the relation is Disjoint for the basic 8 directions. If the relation is not Disjoint, it's often termed as regions "overlapping" or having a "Bounding Box" relation.

So, in light of this, the cardinal direction relation between x and z can be any of the 8 cardinal directions, or "Bounding Box" (if the MBRs overlap).

Given the constraints, can x and z have a "Bounding Box" relation (i.e., can their MBRs overlap)? Let's check:

- x is Northwest of y means x_max_x < y_min_x and x_min_y > y_max_y.
- y is Southeast of z means y_min_x > z_max_x and y_max_y < z_min_y.

For the MBRs of x and z to overlap in the x-direction, we'd need x_min_x < z_max_x and z_min_x < x_max_x. Based on the constraints, we know x_max_x < y_min_x and z_max_x < y_min_x. This means both x_max_x and z_max_x are less than y_min_x, but we can't determine the relation between x_max_x and z_max_x without more information.

Similarly, for the MBRs of x and z to overlap in the y-direction, we'd need x_min_y < z_max_y and z_min_y < x_max_y. Based on the constraints, we know x_min_y > y_max_y and z_min_y > y_max_y. This means both x_min_y and z_min_y are greater than y_max_y, but we can't determine the relation between x_min_y and z_min_y without more information.

So, based on the given constraints, the MBRs of x and z can either be disjoint in one or both directions (leading to one of the 8 cardinal directions) or they can overlap in both directions (leading to a "Bounding Box" relation).

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- Bounding Box (if the MBRs overlap in both directions)

Yes, this is consistent with the answer that I've arrived at through various approaches.

Now that I've explored this from multiple angles, I'm quite confident in my answer. The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- Bounding Box (if the MBRs overlap in both directions)

Actually, in case "Bounding Box" is not a recognized term in the context of cardinal direction relations, I'll rephrase it: the relation could be such that the MBRs of x and z overlap, leading to a relation that doesn't fit neatly into one of the 8 cardinal directions. This might be termed differently in different contexts, but the essence is that the MBRs overlap.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- A relation where the MBRs overlap, which might be termed as "Bounding Box" or something similar in some contexts.

Alright, I've analyzed this problem from multiple angles, and the answer remains consistent.

The cardinal direction relations that could exist between regions x and z based on the given constraints are:
- North
- South
- East
- West
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest
- Bounding Box (or a similar term describing the overlap of MBRs)

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is Southeast of region z

From the second statement, we can infer that z is Northwest of y (the inverse relation of Southeast).

So both x and z are Northwest of y. This means both regions are in the same general direction from y, but their relation to each other could vary depending on their exact positions.

Let's analyze this systematically:

If we place y at the origin (0,0):
- x would be in the Northwest quadrant, at some point (-a,b) where a,b > 0
- z would also be in the Northwest quadrant, at some point (-c,d) where c,d > 0

The relation between x and z depends on the relative values of a,b,c,d, which could result in any of the possible cardinal directions:

- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
- Bounding Box (if their regions overlap)
