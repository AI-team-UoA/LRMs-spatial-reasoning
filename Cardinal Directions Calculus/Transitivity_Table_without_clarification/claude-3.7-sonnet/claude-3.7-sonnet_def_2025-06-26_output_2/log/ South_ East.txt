PROMPT: Let  South and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's break down the problem. We're told that:
- Region x is South of region y.
- Region y is East of region z.

Now we want to know what the possible relations between region x and region z could be.

Let's think about this geometrically. I'll create a coordinate system where:
- North is +y direction
- South is -y direction
- East is +x direction
- West is -x direction

Given this coordinate system:
- If x is South of y, then x is at a lower y-coordinate than y.
- If y is East of z, then y is at a higher x-coordinate than z.

Now, let's try to determine the possible positions of x relative to z.

We know that x is South of y, so x has a lower y-coordinate than y.
We know that y is East of z, so y has a higher x-coordinate than z.

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z in terms of both coordinates.

Let's say:
- z is at position (x_z, y_z)
- y is at position (x_y, y_y)
- x is at position (x_x, y_x)

From the given relations:
- x_y > x_z (y is East of z)
- y_x < y_y (x is South of y)

But we don't know how x_x compares to x_z, or how y_x compares to y_z.

Let's explore possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x could be Southeast of z if x_x > x_z and y_x < y_z.
2. x could be South of z if x_x = x_z and y_x < y_z.
3. x could be Southwest of z if x_x < x_z and y_x < y_z.
4. x could be East of z if x_x > x_z and y_x = y_z.
5. x could be West of z if x_x < x_z and y_x = y_z.
6. x could be Northeast of z if x_x > x_z and y_x > y_z.
7. x could be North of z if x_x = x_z and y_x > y_z.
8. x could be Northwest of z if x_x < x_z and y_x > y_z.

But we need to filter these based on the constraints from the original relations.

Given that x is South of y and y is East of z, let's eliminate the impossible positions:

- y is East of z, so x_y > x_z.
- x is South of y, so y_x < y_y.

From these, we can't directly deduce anything about the relationship between x_x and x_z, or between y_x and y_z. We need to consider all possible arrangements.

Actually, let's approach this slightly differently. Let's plot z at origin (0, 0), and then determine the possible relative positions of x.

If z is at (0, 0), then y must be somewhere in the East of z, so y could be at a position like (1, 0), or (1, 1), or (1, -1), etc. The key is that the x-coordinate of y is positive.

Now, x must be South of y, so the y-coordinate of x must be less than the y-coordinate of y.

Let's consider a few specific positions for y and then determine where x could be:

1. If y is at (1, 0), then x must be at a position like (1, -1), or (0, -1), or (2, -1), etc. The key is that the y-coordinate of x is negative. In this case, x could be Southeast, South, or Southwest of z.

2. If y is at (1, 1), then x could be at positions like (1, 0), (2, 0), (0, 0), etc. The key is that the y-coordinate of x is less than 1. In this case, x could be East, Southeast, or at the same position as z (though this last one is a bit degenerate).

3. If y is at (1, -1), then x must be at a position like (1, -2), (2, -2), (0, -2), etc. The key is that the y-coordinate of x is less than -1. In this case, x would be Southeast, South, or Southwest of z.

From these examples, it looks like x could be East, Southeast, South, or Southwest of z.

Wait, let's be more methodical. I'll define the regions in cardinal direction terms:

- North: (0, y) where y > 0
- Northeast: (x, y) where x > 0 and y > 0
- East: (x, 0) where x > 0
- Southeast: (x, y) where x > 0 and y < 0
- South: (0, y) where y < 0
- Southwest: (x, y) where x < 0 and y < 0
- West: (x, 0) where x < 0
- Northwest: (x, y) where x < 0 and y > 0

Now, if z is at (0, 0), then y must be somewhere in the East, Northeast, or Southeast of z. 

Let's consider each case:

1. If y is East of z, then y is at a position like (a, 0) where a > 0. x must be South of y, so x is at a position like (a, -b) where b > 0. This places x in the Southeast of z.

2. If y is Northeast of z, then y is at a position like (a, b) where a, b > 0. x must be South of y, so x is at a position like (a, c) where c < b. Depending on whether c is positive, zero, or negative, x could be Northeast, East, or Southeast of z.

3. If y is Southeast of z, then y is at a position like (a, -b) where a, b > 0. x must be South of y, so x is at a position like (a, -c) where c > b. This places x in the Southeast of z.

Actually, wait I think I might have a bit of a misconception in how I'm thinking about this. Let me be more careful.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y. This means x is below y. Let's say y is at (x_y, y_y) and x is at (x_x, y_x). Then y_x < y_y. Specifically, if the south boundary of y is at y-coordinate y_y_south, then the north boundary of x must be at y-coordinate y_x_north, where y_x_north <= y_y_south.

- Region y is East of region z. This means y is to the right of z. Let's say z is at (x_z, y_z). Then x_z < x_y. Specifically, if the west boundary of y is at x-coordinate x_y_west, then the east boundary of z must be at x-coordinate x_z_east, where x_z_east <= x_y_west.

Now, I want to find out the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then y is somewhere to the East of z, so y is in the first or fourth quadrant (or on the positive x-axis). Specifically, the western boundary of y has a positive x-coordinate.

Now, x is South of y, so x is below y. Specifically, the northern boundary of x is below the southern boundary of y.

Here's a key insight: the western boundary of y could be as close as you want to the eastern boundary of z. And the northern boundary of x could be as close as you want to the southern boundary of y. So, x could be almost directly South of z, or almost directly East of z, or anywhere in between (Southeast).

Let's think about this a bit more. If y is directly East of z (i.e., y is on the positive x-axis), then x is below y, which places x in the Southeast quadrant relative to z.

If y is slightly above the positive x-axis (Northeast of z), then x could be:
- Below y but still Northeast of z.
- Below y and on the positive x-axis (East of z).
- Below y and in the Southeast quadrant.

If y is slightly below the positive x-axis (Southeast of z), then x is below y, which places x in the Southeast quadrant relative to z.

Let's try to specify the possible positions of x for each position of y, considering the Cardinal directions:

1. If y is East of z (directly on the positive x-axis), then x is South of y, which places x in the Southeast quadrant relative to z.

2. If y is slightly Northeast of z, then x could be:
   - Below y but still Northeast of z.
   - Below y and directly East of z.
   - Below y and Southeast of z.

3. If y is significantly Northeast of z, then x could be:
   - Below y but still Northeast of z.
   - Below y and directly East of z.
   - Below y and Southeast of z.
   - Below y and directly South of z.
   - Below y and Southwest of z.

4. If y is directly North of z (on the positive y-axis), then x could be:
   - Below y but still North of z.
   - Below y and at the same location as z (a degenerate case).
   - Below y and South of z.

5. If y is Northwest of z, then x could be:
   - Below y but still Northwest of z.
   - Below y and directly West of z.
   - Below y and Southwest of z.
   - Below y and directly South of z.
   - Below y and Southeast of z.

6. If y is directly West of z (on the negative x-axis), then x is below y, which places x in the Southwest quadrant relative to z.

7. If y is Southwest of z, then x is below y, which places x in the Southwest quadrant relative to z.

8. If y is directly South of z (on the negative y-axis), then x is below y, which places x in the South direction relative to z.

9. If y is Southeast of z, then x is below y, which places x in the Southeast quadrant relative to z.

Hold on, this can't be right. We are told that y is East of z, so we only need to consider cases 1, 2, and 9 from the above list.

Let me revisit. Given:
- x is South of y.
- y is East of z.

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0). Then y is somewhere to the East of z, which means the x-coordinate of y is positive. Let's consider the possible positions of y:

1. y could be directly East of z, meaning it's on the positive x-axis.
2. y could be in the Northeast quadrant relative to z.
3. y could be in the Southeast quadrant relative to z.

Now, x is South of y, which means the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of y. Let's consider each case:

1. If y is directly East of z (on the positive x-axis with y-coordinate = 0), then x has a y-coordinate < 0. Depending on the x-coordinate of x, it could be:
   - Southeast of z (if the x-coordinate of x is positive).
   - Directly South of z (if the x-coordinate of x is 0).
   - Southwest of z (if the x-coordinate of x is negative).

2. If y is in the Northeast quadrant relative to z, then y has a positive y-coordinate. x, being South of y, could have a y-coordinate that is either positive, zero, or negative. Depending on the x-coordinate of x, it could be:
   - Northeast of z (if the x-coordinate of x is positive and the y-coordinate of x is positive).
   - East of z (if the x-coordinate of x is positive and the y-coordinate of x is 0).
   - Southeast of z (if the x-coordinate of x is positive and the y-coordinate of x is negative).
   - North of z (if the x-coordinate of x is 0 and the y-coordinate of x is positive).
   - At the same location as z (if the x-coordinate of x is 0 and the y-coordinate of x is 0, a degenerate case).
   - South of z (if the x-coordinate of x is 0 and the y-coordinate of x is negative).
   - Northwest of z (if the x-coordinate of x is negative and the y-coordinate of x is positive).
   - West of z (if the x-coordinate of x is negative and the y-coordinate of x is 0).
   - Southwest of z (if the x-coordinate of x is negative and the y-coordinate of x is negative).

3. If y is in the Southeast quadrant relative to z, then y has a negative y-coordinate. x, being South of y, must have a y-coordinate that is more negative. Depending on the x-coordinate of x, it could be:
   - Southeast of z (if the x-coordinate of x is positive).
   - South of z (if the x-coordinate of x is 0).
   - Southwest of z (if the x-coordinate of x is negative).

Hmm, this seems to suggest that x could be in almost any direction relative to z, which doesn't seem intuitive given the original constraints. Actually, wait. The fact that y is East of z means the x-coordinate of y is higher than the x-coordinate of z. But nothing is said about the x-coordinate of x. It could be higher, equal to, or lower than the x-coordinate of y, and by extension, the x-coordinate of z. So, the claim that x could be in almost any direction relative to z might be correct after all!

Umm, actually, let me revisit cardinal directions and be precise about what they mean. I think I might have been imprecise in my understanding.

For two dimensional regions, the cardinal direction relations are typically defined in terms of the bounding boxes of the regions. The bounding box of a region is the smallest rectangle (with sides parallel to the coordinate axes) that contains the region.

Given two regions A and B, the cardinal direction of B relative to A is determined by the position of B's bounding box relative to A's bounding box. The space is divided into 9 tiles by extending the sides of A's bounding box: NW, N, NE, W, O (Overlapping), E, SW, S, SE.

Now, let's apply this understanding to our problem:

- x is South of y: This means the bounding box of x is entirely below the bounding box of y. The northern border of x's bounding box is below or equal to the southern border of y's bounding box.
- y is East of z: This means the bounding box of y is entirely to the right of the bounding box of z. The western border of y's bounding box is to the right of or equal to the eastern border of z's bounding box.

To determine the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z, we need to consider the possible positions of x's bounding box relative to z's bounding box.

Given the constraints, we know that y is East of z and x is South of y. Let's visualize:

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+
          +---+
          | y |
          +---+
          +---+
          | x |
          +---+
```

Here, y is East of z, and x is South of y. In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

But what if y extends northward and overlaps with z vertically?

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+  +---+
          | y |
          +---+
          +---+
          | x |
          +---+
```

In this case, x is still Southeast of z.

What if y extends southward and overlaps with x horizontally?

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+
          +---+
          | y |
          +---+
    +---+
    | x |
    +---+
```

In this case, x is South of z.

What if y extends both northward and southward, overlapping with both z vertically and x horizontally?

```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+  +---+
          | y |
          |   |
    +---+ |   |
    | x | +---+
    +---+
```

In this case, x is Southwest of z.

These examples illustrate that x could be Southeast, South, or Southwest of z, depending on the exact positioning of the regions.

Let me check if there are other possible directions.

What if y overlaps with z horizontally (meaning z's eastern border is to the right of y's western border) and x is directly below z?

```
+---+
| z |
+---+ 
+---+  +---+
| x |  | y |
+---+  +---+
```

In this case, x is South of z.

What if y overlaps with z horizontally, and x is to the left of y but overlaps with z horizontally?

```
+---+
| z |
+---+ 
+---+  +---+
| x |  | y |
+---+  +---+
```

Actually, this can't happen because x is South of y, not West or Southwest of y.

What if y overlaps with z horizontally, and x is to the right of z but still below y?

```
+---+
| z |  +---+
+---+  | y |
      +---+
      | x |
      +---+
```

In this case, x is Southeast of z.

I think I've covered all the possible configurations. Given the constraints, x could be Southeast, South, or Southwest of z.

Actually, let's revisit the definitions of the cardinal directions a bit more rigorously.

Consider two regions A and B. Let's denote the bounding box of A as BBox(A) and the bounding box of B as BBox(B). Let's also denote the projections of these bounding boxes onto the x and y axes as BBox(A).x and BBox(A).y, and BBox(B).x and BBox(B).y, respectively.

Then the cardinal direction relations between A and B can be defined as follows:

- B is North of A if BBox(B).y is above BBox(A).y and BBox(B).x overlaps BBox(A).x.
- B is South of A if BBox(B).y is below BBox(A).y and BBox(B).x overlaps BBox(A).x.
- B is East of A if BBox(B).x is to the right of BBox(A).x and BBox(B).y overlaps BBox(A).y.
- B is West of A if BBox(B).x is to the left of BBox(A).x and BBox(B).y overlaps BBox(A).y.
- B is Northeast of A if BBox(B).x is to the right of BBox(A).x and BBox(B).y is above BBox(A).y.
- B is Northwest of A if BBox(B).x is to the left of BBox(A).x and BBox(B).y is above BBox(A).y.
- B is Southeast of A if BBox(B).x is to the right of BBox(A).x and BBox(B).y is below BBox(A).y.
- B is Southwest of A if BBox(B).x is to the left of BBox(A).x and BBox(B).y is below BBox(A).y.

Now, let's apply these definitions to our problem:

- x is South of y: This means BBox(x).y is below BBox(y).y and BBox(x).x overlaps BBox(y).x.
- y is East of z: This means BBox(y).x is to the right of BBox(z).x and BBox(y).y overlaps BBox(z).y.

To determine the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z, we need to consider the possible positions of BBox(x) relative to BBox(z).

Given the constraints, we have:
- BBox(x).y is below BBox(y).y.
- BBox(x).x overlaps BBox(y).x.
- BBox(y).x is to the right of BBox(z).x.
- BBox(y).y overlaps BBox(z).y.

From these, we can't directly deduce the relation between BBox(x).y and BBox(z).y, or between BBox(x).x and BBox(z).x. We need to consider all possible combinations:

1. If BBox(x).y is below BBox(z).y (or equivalently, BBox(x).y does not overlap BBox(z).y), then:
   - If BBox(x).x is to the right of BBox(z).x (or equivalently, BBox(x).x does not overlap BBox(z).x), then x is Southeast of z.
   - If BBox(x).x overlaps BBox(z).x, then x is South of z.
   - If BBox(x).x is to the left of BBox(z).x (or equivalently, BBox(x).x does not overlap BBox(z).x), then x is Southwest of z.

2. If BBox(x).y overlaps BBox(z).y, then:
   - If BBox(x).x is to the right of BBox(z).x (or equivalently, BBox(x).x does not overlap BBox(z).x), then x is East of z.
   - If BBox(x).x overlaps BBox(z).x, then x overlaps z (a case we haven't considered before).
   - If BBox(x).x is to the left of BBox(z).x (or equivalently, BBox(x).x does not overlap BBox(z).x), then x is West of z.

3. If BBox(x).y is above BBox(z).y (or equivalently, BBox(x).y does not overlap BBox(z).y), then:
   - If BBox(x).x is to the right of BBox(z).x (or equivalently, BBox(x).x does not overlap BBox(z).x), then x is Northeast of z.
   - If BBox(x).x overlaps BBox(z).x, then x is North of z.
   - If BBox(x).x is to the left of BBox(z).x (or equivalently, BBox(x).x does not overlap BBox(z).x), then x is Northwest of z.

OK, now, let's assess whether each of these scenarios is possible given our constraints:

1. BBox(x).y is below BBox(z).y. This is possible. Since BBox(x).y is below BBox(y).y and BBox(y).y overlaps BBox(z).y, it's possible for BBox(x).y to be entirely below BBox(z).y.

2. BBox(x).y overlaps BBox(z).y. This is possible. BBox(y).y overlaps BBox(z).y, and BBox(x).y is below BBox(y).y. If the overlap between BBox(y).y and BBox(z).y extends low enough, and if BBox(x).y is not too far below BBox(y).y, then BBox(x).y can also overlap BBox(z).y.

3. BBox(x).y is above BBox(z).y. This is NOT possible. Since BBox(x).y is below BBox(y).y, and at best BBox(y).y overlaps BBox(z).y, BBox(x).y cannot be entirely above BBox(z).y.

So, of the three main cases, only 1 and 2 are possible, which correspond to the cardinal directions South, Southwest, Southeast, East, West, and the overlapping case.

Now, let's think about the x-coordinate:

BBox(x).x overlaps BBox(y).x (because x is South of y), and BBox(y).x is to the right of BBox(z).x (because y is East of z). This means that BBox(x).x can be to the right of BBox(z).x, can overlap BBox(z).x, or can be to the left of BBox(z).x, as long as it overlaps BBox(y).x.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are: Southeast, South, Southwest, East, and West. Additionally, x and z might overlap (the bounding box case).

Hmm, but wait. There's a geometric constraint we haven't fully considered. BBox(x).x must overlap BBox(y).x. BBox(y).x is to the right of BBox(z).x. So, the left edge of BBox(y).x is to the right of the right edge of BBox(z).x. This means the left edge of BBox(x).x, while it might be to the left of the left edge of BBox(y).x, cannot be to the left of the right edge of BBox(z).x (otherwise, BBox(x).x wouldn't overlap BBox(y).x).

Actually, I need to be more precise about the definitions. Let me redefine the cardinal directions using min and max coordinates:

Let's denote the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of BBox(A) as A.xmin and A.xmax, respectively. Similarly, let's denote the minimum and maximum y-coordinates of BBox(A) as A.ymin and A.ymax.

Then:

- B is North of A if B.ymin >= A.ymax and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates (i.e., B.xmin <= A.xmax and B.xmax >= A.xmin).
- B is South of A if B.ymax <= A.ymin and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
- B is East of A if B.xmin >= A.xmax and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates (i.e., B.ymin <= A.ymax and B.ymax >= A.ymin).
- B is West of A if B.xmax <= A.xmin and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
- B is Northeast of A if B.xmin >= A.xmax and B.ymin >= A.ymax.
- B is Northwest of A if B.xmax <= A.xmin and B.ymin >= A.ymax.
- B is Southeast of A if B.xmin >= A.xmax and B.ymax <= A.ymin.
- B is Southwest of A if B.xmax <= A.xmin and B.ymax <= A.ymin.

Now, let's apply these to our problem:

- x is South of y: This means x.ymax <= y.ymin and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
- y is East of z: This means y.xmin >= z.xmax and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.

Given these constraints, let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z:

Since x is South of y, we have x.ymax <= y.ymin. And since y is East of z, we have y.xmin >= z.xmax. Also, since y is East of z, we have an overlap in the y-coordinates between y and z, meaning y.ymin <= z.ymax and y.ymax >= z.ymin.

But the constraint that x is South of y means there's an overlap in the x-coordinates between x and y, which means x.xmin <= y.xmax and x.xmax >= y.xmin. Given that y.xmin >= z.xmax, we can say x.xmax >= y.xmin >= z.xmax.

Now, let's consider the different cardinal directions for x relative to z:

1. x is Southeast of z:
   This means x.xmin >= z.xmax and x.ymax <= z.ymin.
   Is this possible?
   We know x.xmax >= z.xmax, so it's possible for x.xmin to be >= z.xmax.
   We also know x.ymax <= y.ymin, and if y.ymin <= z.ymin, then x.ymax <= z.ymin.
   So, x can be Southeast of z if y.ymin <= z.ymin.

2. x is South of z:
   This means x.ymax <= z.ymin and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
   Is this possible?
   We know x.ymax <= y.ymin, and if y.ymin <= z.ymin, then x.ymax <= z.ymin.
   The overlap in the x-coordinates means x.xmin <= z.xmax and x.xmax >= z.xmin.
   We know x.xmax >= z.xmax, so x.xmax >= z.xmin is satisfied.
   For x.xmin <= z.xmax, we need x.xmin to be to the left of z.xmax, which is possible.
   So, x can be South of z if y.ymin <= z.ymin.

3. x is Southwest of z:
   This means x.xmax <= z.xmin and x.ymax <= z.ymin.
   Is this possible?
   We know x.xmax >= z.xmax (from earlier deduction), and z.xmax >= z.xmin.
   So, x.xmax >= z.xmin, which contradicts the requirement for x to be Southwest of z.
   Therefore, x cannot be Southwest of z.

4. x is East of z:
   This means x.xmin >= z.xmax and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
   Is this possible?
   We know x.xmax >= z.xmax, so it's possible for x.xmin to be >= z.xmax.
   The overlap in the y-coordinates means x.ymin <= z.ymax and x.ymax >= z.ymin.
   If x.ymax >= z.ymin and x.ymin <= z.ymax, then there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
   So, x can be East of z if the above conditions are met.

5. x is West of z:
   This means x.xmax <= z.xmin and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
   Is this possible?
   We know x.xmax >= z.xmax (from earlier deduction), and z.xmax >= z.xmin.
   So, x.xmax >= z.xmin, which contradicts the requirement for x to be West of z.
   Therefore, x cannot be West of z.

6. x overlaps z:
   This means there's an overlap in both the x and y-coordinates.
   Is this possible?
   For overlap in the x-coordinates, we need x.xmin <= z.xmax and x.xmax >= z.xmin.
   We know x.xmax >= z.xmax, so x.xmax >= z.xmin is satisfied.
   For x.xmin <= z.xmax, we need x.xmin to be to the left of z.xmax, which is possible.
   For overlap in the y-coordinates, we need x.ymin <= z.ymax and x.ymax >= z.ymin.
   If these conditions are met, then x and z can overlap.

7. x is Northeast of z:
   This means x.xmin >= z.xmax and x.ymin >= z.ymax.
   Is this possible?
   We know x.xmax >= z.xmax, so it's possible for x.xmin to be >= z.xmax.
   But we also know x.ymax <= y.ymin, which implies x.ymin <= x.ymax <= y.ymin.
   Given that y has an overlap in the y-coordinates with z, the highest y.ymin can be is z.ymax.
   If y.ymin = z.ymax, then x.ymin <= y.ymin = z.ymax, which means x.ymin <= z.ymax.
   This contradicts the requirement for x to be Northeast of z, which requires x.ymin >= z.ymax.
   Therefore, x cannot be Northeast of z.

8. x is North of z:
   This means x.ymin >= z.ymax and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
   Is this possible?
   Following the logic similar to the Northeast case, x.ymin <= y.ymin <= z.ymax, which contradicts the requirement for x to be North of z.
   Therefore, x cannot be North of z.

9. x is Northwest of z:
   This means x.xmax <= z.xmin and x.ymin >= z.ymax.
   Is this possible?
   We've already shown that x.xmax >= z.xmin, which contradicts the requirement for x to be Northwest of z.
   Therefore, x cannot be Northwest of z.

Based on the above analysis, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are: Southeast, South, East, and the overlapping case.

Actually, let me reconsider the overlapping case. For overlapping to occur, we need an overlap in both the x and y coordinates.

For overlap in the x-coordinates, we need x.xmin <= z.xmax and x.xmax >= z.xmin. Given that x.xmax >= z.xmax (from previous analysis), the condition x.xmax >= z.xmin is automatically satisfied. For x.xmin <= z.xmax, we need to ensure that the left edge of x is to the left of the right edge of z.

For overlap in the y-coordinates, we need x.ymin <= z.ymax and x.ymax >= z.ymin. We know x.ymax <= y.ymin. Given that y has an overlap in the y-coordinates with z, the highest y.ymin can be is z.ymax. If y.ymin = z.ymax, then x.ymax <= y.ymin = z.ymax, which means x.ymax <= z.ymax. For overlap, we also need x.ymax >= z.ymin. This can be true, but it requires a specific arrangement.

So, for the overlapping case to occur, we need a specific arrangement where the top of x touches or is above the bottom of z, and the left of x is to the left of the right of z.

Also, I realize that when I computed possible relations, I didn't consider cases where the regions touched (i.e., the boundaries coincide) as separate cases. But in the cardinal direction framework, touching on a boundary is the same as not having an overlap. So, I think the analysis stands.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are: Southeast, South, East, and the overlapping case (if the specific arrangement is met).

Actually, I just realized that the overlapping case isn't a cardinal direction. It's a different type of topological relation. So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are Southeast, South, and East.

Actually, this is incorrect, because the overlapping case is known as the "Bounding Box" case (or sometimes "Equal"). The "Bounding Box" is when the region is within the bounding box of the other region.

So, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z are Southeast, South, East, and the Bounding Box case (if the specific arrangement is met).

Actually, actually, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me go back to my definition of cardinal directions:

- B is North of A if B.ymin >= A.ymax and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates (i.e., B.xmin <= A.xmax and B.xmax >= A.xmin).
- B is South of A if B.ymax <= A.ymin and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.
- B is East of A if B.xmin >= A.xmax and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates (i.e., B.ymin <= A.ymax and B.ymax >= A.ymin).
- B is West of A if B.xmax <= A.xmin and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
- B is Northeast of A if B.xmin >= A.xmax and B.ymin >= A.ymax.
- B is Northwest of A if B.xmax <= A.xmin and B.ymin >= A.ymax.
- B is Southeast of A if B.xmin >= A.xmax and B.ymax <= A.ymin.
- B is Southwest of A if B.xmax <= A.xmin and B.ymax <= A.ymin.

Let's revisit the overlapping case: Regions A and B overlap if there's an overlap in both the x and y coordinates. So, overlap occurs if:
- A.xmin <= B.xmax and A.xmax >= B.xmin (x-coordinate overlap)
- A.ymin <= B.ymax and A.ymax >= B.ymin (y-coordinate overlap)

And there's a Bounding Box (or Equal) relation if the bounding boxes of the two regions are the same:
- A.xmin = B.xmin and A.xmax = B.xmax
- A.ymin = B.ymin and A.ymax = B.ymax

But I realized that the Bounding Box (or Equal) case is a special case of the overlapping case. It's the case where the regions are identical, or one region is inside another, or they share a boundary.

Since the problem statement asks which could be the possible relations, and it includes "Bounding Box" as one of the options, I will consider it as a separate relation.

So, based on the analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Southeast, South, East, and Bounding Box.

Actually, let me double-check the Southwest case:

For x to be Southwest of z, we need:
- x.xmax <= z.xmin (x is to the left of z)
- x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is below z)

From our analysis, we know x.xmax >= z.xmax (from earlier deduction), and z.xmax >= z.xmin. So, x.xmax >= z.xmin, which contradicts the requirement for x to be Southwest of z.

Wait, I need to reconsider my statement x.xmax >= z.xmax. This was derived from x.xmax >= y.xmin >= z.xmax. But now I doubt its validity.

Since x is South of y, we have an overlap in the x-coordinates, which means x.xmin <= y.xmax and x.xmax >= y.xmin. Given that y is East of z, we have y.xmin >= z.xmax. So, we can say x.xmax >= y.xmin >= z.xmax, which implies x.xmax >= z.xmax.

This means the right edge of x is to the right of the right edge of z. So, x can't be entirely to the left of z, which means x can't be Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Southeast, South, East, and possibly Bounding Box (if the specific arrangement is met).

Actually, I'm doubting the East relation as well. For x to be East of z, we need:
- x.xmin >= z.xmax (x is to the right of z)
- There's an overlap in the y-coordinates, meaning x.ymin <= z.ymax and x.ymax >= z.ymin.

We know x.ymax <= y.ymin. Given that y has an overlap in the y-coordinates with z, the highest y.ymin can be is z.ymax. If y.ymin = z.ymax, then x.ymax <= y.ymin = z.ymax, which means x.ymax <= z.ymax. For an East relation, we also need x.ymax >= z.ymin, which requires a specific arrangement.

So, the East relation is possible only if x.ymax >= z.ymin.

Actually, hold on again. I'm not sure if I've been considering the problem correctly. Let me revisit and reconsider all the constraints step by step. The constraints I have are:
- Region x is South of region y.
- Region y is East of region z.

Let me create arbitrary bounding boxes for regions y and z and then see what constraints these two relations put on the bounding box of region x.

Let's say:
- z's bounding box goes from (z.xmin, z.ymin) to (z.xmax, z.ymax).
- y's bounding box goes from (y.xmin, y.ymin) to (y.xmax, y.ymax).
- x's bounding box goes from (x.xmin, x.ymin) to (x.xmax, x.ymax).

The constraint "y is East of z" means:
- y.xmin >= z.xmax (y is to the right of z)
- There's an overlap in the y-coordinates, meaning y.ymin <= z.ymax and y.ymax >= z.ymin.

The constraint "x is South of y" means:
- x.ymax <= y.ymin (x is below y)
- There's an overlap in the x-coordinates, meaning x.xmin <= y.xmax and x.xmax >= y.xmin.

Now, let's determine the possible positions of x relative to z based on these constraints.

For y to be East of z, y's left edge must be to the right of z's right edge, and there must be an overlap in the y-coordinates. This means y.xmin >= z.xmax, and y.ymin <= z.ymax and y.ymax >= z.ymin. If we simplify to the minimal case where y.xmin = z.xmax, y.ymin = z.ymax, and y.ymax = z.ymin, then y and z are just touching at the corner.

For x to be South of y, x's top edge must be below y's bottom edge, and there must be an overlap in the x-coordinates. This means x.ymax <= y.ymin, and x.xmin <= y.xmax and x.xmax >= y.xmin. If we simplify to the minimal case where x.ymax = y.ymin, x.xmin = y.xmax, and x.xmax = y.xmin, then x and y are just touching at the corner.

Let's visualize these constraints in the minimal case:

```
+---+
| z |
+---+
      +---+
      | y |
      +---+
           +---+
           | x |
           +---+
```

Here, z is at the top-left, y is at the middle, and x is at the bottom-right. In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

But this is just one possible configuration. Let's consider other possible configurations.

The overlap in the y-coordinates between y and z means that y can extend from anywhere between z.ymin and z.ymax. Similarly, the overlap in the x-coordinates between x and y means that x can extend from anywhere between y.xmin and y.xmax.

Hmm, but I now realize that I might be overcomplicating things. 

Let's think of the problem in terms of constraints on the bounds of x relative to z, given the constraints on y relative to z and x relative to y.

1. y is East of z. This means y.xmin >= z.xmax and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
2. x is South of y. This means x.ymax <= y.ymin and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates.

Now let's consider the different possible positions of y relative to z. But wait, I already know y is East of z. So y.xmin >= z.xmax, and y.ymin <= z.ymax and y.ymax >= z.ymin.

Similarly, x is South of y. So x.ymax <= y.ymin, and x.xmin <= y.xmax and x.xmax >= y.xmin.

Hmm, I think it might help to visualize. Let's take a simpler approach and just visualize the regions in 2D space.

```
z:
+-----+
|     |
|     |
+-----+

y:
        +-----+
        |     |
        |     |
        +-----+

x:
        +-----+
        |     |
        |     |
        +-----+
```

In this configuration, z is at the left, y is at the right, and x is directly below y. Given these positions, x is Southeast of z.

But this is just one possible configuration. The constraint "y is East of z" means y can be anywhere to the right of z with some vertical overlap. And the constraint "x is South of y" means x can be anywhere below y with some horizontal overlap.

```
z:
+-----+
|     |
|     |
+-----+

y:
      +-----+
      |     |
      |     |
      +-----+

x:
      +-----+
      |     |
      |     |
      +-----+
```

In this configuration, x is directly below z, which means x is South of z.

```
z:
+-----+
|     |
|     |
+-----+

y:
      +-----+
      |     |
      |     |
      +-----+

x:
+-----+
|     |
|     |
+-----+
```

In this configuration, x is to the left of z horizontally and below z vertically, which means x is Southwest of z.

```
z:
+-----+
|     |
|     |
+-----+

y:
      +-----+
      |     |
      |     |
      +-----+

x:
            +-----+
            |     |
            |     |
            +-----+
```

In this configuration, x is to the right of z horizontally and below z vertically, which means x is Southeast of z.

So based on these visualizations, x can be Southeast, South, or Southwest of z.

But wait, I just recalled my earlier analysis that suggests x can't be Southwest of z. Let me reconsider.

I had deduced that x.xmax >= z.xmax, which means the right edge of x is to the right of the right edge of z. This would make it impossible for x to be entirely to the left of z, which means x can't be Southwest of z.

But I think I made an error in my reasoning. Let's reconsider the constraints:

1. y is East of z: This means y.xmin >= z.xmax and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates.
2. x is South of y: This means x.ymax <= y.ymin and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates, which means x.xmin <= y.xmax and x.xmax >= y.xmin.

Given y.xmin >= z.xmax, and the overlap constraint between x and y, we have x.xmax >= y.xmin >= z.xmax. This means the right edge of x is to the right of the right edge of z. But this doesn't mean x can't be Southwest of z, it just means the right edge of x extends to the right of the right edge of z. The left edge of x (x.xmin) can still be to the left of the left edge of z (z.xmin), which would make x and z have a non-empty x-coordinate overlap.

So, I concede that x can indeed be Southwest of z if the above conditions are met, specifically if x.xmin < z.xmin and x.xmax >= z.xmin (indicating a non-empty x-coordinate overlap).

Actually, no, no—I went back and forth on this point earlier too. For x to be Southwest of z, we need:
- x.xmax <= z.xmin (x is entirely to the left of z)
- x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

But given the constraint x.xmax >= y.xmin >= z.xmax, we have x.xmax >= z.xmax, which means the right edge of x is to the right of the right edge of z. Since z.xmax >= z.xmin, we have x.xmax >= z.xmin, which contradicts the requirement for x to be Southwest of z (which needs x.xmax <= z.xmin).

So, x can't be Southwest of z.

Actually, actually. Let me clarify the definition of Southwest:

B is Southwest of A if B.xmax <= A.xmin AND B.ymax <= A.ymin.

So, for x to be Southwest of z, we need:
- x.xmax <= z.xmin (x is entirely to the left of z)
- x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

Given the constraint x.xmax >= y.xmin and y.xmin >= z.xmax, we get x.xmax >= z.xmax. Given that z.xmax >= z.xmin, we have x.xmax >= z.xmin. This contradicts the requirement for x to be Southwest of z, which requires x.xmax <= z.xmin.

So, x cannot be Southwest of z.

Similarly, x cannot be West of z or Northwest of z because the constraint x.xmax >= z.xmin contradicts the requirement for these relations, which is x.xmax <= z.xmin.

For East of z, we need:
- x.xmin >= z.xmax (x is entirely to the right of z)
- Overlap in the y-coordinates, which means x.ymin <= z.ymax and x.ymax >= z.ymin.

For the x-coordinate constraint, given that x.xmax >= y.xmin and y.xmin >= z.xmax, we can satisfy x.xmin >= z.xmax if x.xmin is chosen appropriately.

For the y-coordinate constraint, we know x.ymax <= y.ymin. If y.ymin <= z.ymax, then x.ymax <= z.ymax. But we also need x.ymax >= z.ymin. If y.ymin <= z.ymin, then we can't guarantee x.ymax >= z.ymin. But if y.ymin > z.ymin, we can place x such that z.ymin <= x.ymax <= y.ymin, ensuring an overlap in the y-coordinates.

So, x can be East of z if y.ymin > z.ymin and x is placed such that z.ymin <= x.ymax <= y.ymin.

For Southeast of z, we need:
- x.xmin >= z.xmax (x is entirely to the right of z)
- x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

As reasoned for the East relation, we can satisfy x.xmin >= z.xmax. For the y-coordinate, we need x.ymax <= z.ymin. Given that x.ymax <= y.ymin, if y.ymin <= z.ymin, then x.ymax <= z.ymin, which satisfies the constraint for Southeast.

So, x can be Southeast of z if y.ymin <= z.ymin.

For South of z, we need:
- Overlap in the x-coordinates, which means x.xmin <= z.xmax and x.xmax >= z.xmin.
- x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

Given the constraint x.xmax >= y.xmin and y.xmin >= z.xmax, we have x.xmax >= z.xmax, which means x.xmax >= z.xmin. So, one part of the x-coordinate overlap constraint is satisfied. For the other part, x.xmin <= z.xmax, we can satisfy it if x.xmin is chosen appropriately.

For the y-coordinate constraint, we need x.ymax <= z.ymin. Given that x.ymax <= y.ymin, if y.ymin <= z.ymin, then x.ymax <= z.ymin, which satisfies the constraint for South.

So, x can be South of z if y.ymin <= z.ymin.

For the Bounding Box (or Equal) relation, we need:
- x.xmin = z.xmin and x.xmax = z.xmax
- x.ymin = z.ymin and x.ymax = z.ymax

But given the constraints, I'm not sure if it's possible for x to have the exact same bounding box as z. Let's reason through this.

Given that y.xmin >= z.xmax and x.xmin <= y.xmax, it's challenging to have x.xmin = z.xmin. However, this might be possible in a degenerate case where z's width is zero. Similarly, for the y-coordinates, given that x.ymax <= y.ymin, it's challenging to have x.ymax = z.ymax. This might be possible in a degenerate case where z's height is zero.

Actually, the Bounding Box (or Equal) relation seems a bit ambiguous in the context of the problem. If it refers to the relation where the bounding boxes are exactly the same, then I'm not sure if it's possible given the constraints. But if it refers to a relation where one region's bounding box is within another's, then it's a different case. In the latter sense, the Bounding Box relation would only be possible if x's bounding box is inside z's, but given that x is South of y and y is East of z, I'm not sure if this can be achieved.

Wait, wait, wait. I've been using "Bounding Box" in a slightly different sense (as "Equal"). In the original problem, "Bounding Box" might be referring to the case where one region's bounding box is entirely inside another's (often called "Inside" or "Contains"). Let's reconsider.

For the Bounding Box (in the sense of "Inside" or "Contains") relation, we would need one of the following:
- x's bounding box is entirely inside z's bounding box.
- z's bounding box is entirely inside x's bounding box.

Given the constraints, I believe neither of these scenarios is feasible. For the first scenario, if x is entirely inside z, then x.xmax <= z.xmax. But we've established that x.xmax >= z.xmax, which is a contradiction. For the second scenario, if z is entirely inside x, then z.xmax <= x.xmax, which is consistent with what we've established. However, we would also need z.xmin >= x.xmin. But given that x.xmin <= y.xmax and y.xmin >= z.xmax, we can have scenarios where x.xmin < z.xmin, which would contradict z.xmin >= x.xmin.

So, the Bounding Box relation (in either interpretation) doesn't seem feasible given the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: Southeast, South, and East.

OK, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let me take a step back.

Given:
- Region x is South of region y.
- Region y is East of region z.

For x to be South of y, the top edge of x must be below the bottom edge of y. For y to be East of z, the left edge of y must be to the right of the right edge of z.

These are minimal constraints, and they allow for a wide range of geometric configurations. I can visualize a few, and from these, I can infer the possible directions of x relative to z.

```
     z       y
+-------+ +-------+
|       | |       |
|       | |       |
+-------+ +-------+
            +-------+
            |       |
            |   x   |
            +-------+
```

In this configuration, x is Southeast of z.

```
     z       y
+-------+ +-------+
|       | |       |
|       | |       |
+-------+ +-------+
     +-------+
     |       |
     |   x   |
     +-------+
```

In this configuration, x is South of z.

```
          z       y
     +-------+ +-------+
     |       | |       |
     |       | |       |
     +-------+ +-------+
+-------+
|       |
|   x   |
+-------+
```

In this configuration, x is Southwest of z.

```
     z       y
+-------+ +-------+
|       | |       |
|       | |       |
+-------+ +-------+
                  +-------+
                  |       |
                  |   x   |
                  +-------+
```

In this configuration, x is East of z (since x is to the right of z, and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates).

Wait, the 4th configuration doesn't seem quite right. In that configuration, x would be Southeast of y. But that contradicts the constraint that x is South of y, which means the top edge of x must be below the bottom edge of y.

So, the 4th configuration should be adjusted. If x is East of z, it must be directly to the right of z (or at least with a vertical overlap) while still being South of y.

And likewise I need to revisit the 3rd configuration. If x is Southwest of z, it could be to the left of both z and y. But that would not guarantee an overlap in the x-coordinates between x and y, which is required for x to be South of y. So, the 3rd configuration (where x is Southwest of z) might not be viable under the given constraints.

Hmm, I need to revisit the definition of the South cardinal direction. For x to be South of y, the bounding box of x must be entirely below the bounding box of y, AND there must be an overlap in the x-coordinates between the two bounding boxes. This overlap ensures that x is not just below y, but is also aligned with y horizontally (to some extent).

So, x is South of y means:
- x.ymax <= y.ymin (x is entirely below y)
- x.xmin <= y.xmax AND x.xmax >= y.xmin (there's an overlap in the x-coordinates)

Similarly, y is East of z means:
- y.xmin >= z.xmax (y is entirely to the right of z)
- y.ymin <= z.ymax AND y.ymax >= z.ymin (there's an overlap in the y-coordinates)

Now, let's revisit the possible directions of x relative to z.

For x to be Southeast of z, we need:
- x.xmin >= z.xmax (x is entirely to the right of z)
- x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

For x to be South of z, we need:
- x.xmin <= z.xmax AND x.xmax >= z.xmin (there's an overlap in the x-coordinates between x and z)
- x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

For x to be Southwest of z, we need:
- x.xmax <= z.xmin (x is entirely to the left of z)
- x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

Let's check if each of these directions is possible given the constraints.

1. Southeast of z:
   - x.xmin >= z.xmax (x is entirely to the right of z)
   - x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

   From the constraint y.xmin >= z.xmax, we can have scenarios where x.xmin >= z.xmax if x and y have the right arrangement, so the first condition is possible. Similarly, from the constraint x.ymax <= y.ymin, we can have scenarios where x.ymax <= z.ymin if y and z have the right arrangement, so the second condition is also possible. Therefore, it's possible for x to be Southeast of z.

2. South of z:
   - x.xmin <= z.xmax AND x.xmax >= z.xmin (there's an overlap in the x-coordinates between x and z)
   - x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

   From the constraints, we know x.xmax >= y.xmin (from the overlap in the x-coordinates between x and y), and y.xmin >= z.xmax (from y being East of z). This gives x.xmax >= z.xmax, which means x.xmax >= z.xmin (since z.xmax >= z.xmin). So, one part of the first condition is satisfied. The other part, x.xmin <= z.xmax, can be satisfied if x is arranged appropriately. The second condition, x.ymax <= z.ymin, can also be satisfied if y and z have the right arrangement. Therefore, it's possible for x to be South of z.

3. Southwest of z:
   - x.xmax <= z.xmin (x is entirely to the left of z)
   - x.ymax <= z.ymin (x is entirely below z)

   From the constraints, we have x.xmax >= y.xmin (from the overlap in the x-coordinates between x and y), and y.xmin >= z.xmax (from y being East of z). This gives x.xmax >= z.xmax, which means x.xmax >= z.xmin (since z.xmax >= z.xmin). This contradicts the first condition for x to be Southwest of z, which requires x.xmax <= z.xmin. Therefore, it's not possible for x to be Southwest of z.

So, the possible directions of x relative to z are Southeast and South.

Wait, I was forgetting about East. Let's check the East direction.

For x to be East of z, we need:
- x.xmin >= z.xmax (x is entirely to the right of z)
- x.ymin <= z.ymax AND x.ymax >= z.ymin (there's an overlap in the y-coordinates between x and z)

From the constraint y.xmin >= z.xmax, we can have scenarios where x.xmin >= z.xmax if x and y have the right arrangement, so the first condition is possible. For the second condition, we need to check if there can be an overlap in the y-coordinates between x and z. From the constraint x.ymax <= y.ymin, we can deduce that the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of y. From the constraint y.ymin <= z.ymax (from the overlap in the y-coordinates between y and z), we can deduce that the bottom edge of y is at or below the top edge of z. This means the top edge of x is at or below the top edge of z, which still allows for a potential overlap in the y-coordinates between x and z. Therefore, it's possible for x to be East of z.

So, the possible directions of x relative to z are Southeast, South, and East.

Actually, let me do yet another visualization to test if East is a possibility.

```
     z
+-------+
|       |
|       |
+-------+  +-------+
             |       |
             |   y   |
             +-------+
             +-------+
             |       |
             |   x   |
             +-------+
```

Here, the South constraint is satisfied because x is directly below y. The East constraint is satisfied because y is directly to the right of z. But x is not East of z; it's Southeast of z.

Let me try a different arrangement:

```
          z
     +-------+
     |       |
     |       |
     +-------+  +-------+
                  |       |

Here, the South constraint is satisfied because x is directly below y. The East constraint is satisfied because y is directly to the right of z. But again, x is Southeast of z, not East of z.

Let me try one more arrangement:

```
          z

     |       |

                  +-------+
                  |       |
                  |   y   |
                  +-------+

                  +-------+
                  |       |
                  |   x   |
                  +-------+
```

In this arrangement, x is South of y, and y is East of z. Given these positions, x is Southeast of z, not East of z.

Actually, I realized I might have made a mistake in my analysis of the East relation. For x to be East of z, there must be an overlap in the y-coordinates between x and z. Given that x is South of y and y is East of z, there are constraints on the y-coordinates of x relative to y, and y relative to z. Specifically, x.ymax <= y.ymin and y.ymin <= z.ymax. These constraints lead to x.ymax <= z.ymax, which means the top edge of x is at or below the top edge of z. However, we also need x.ymin <= z.ymax and x.ymax >= z.ymin for an overlap in the y-coordinates. 

Hmm, actually, if x.ymax <= y.ymin and y.ymin <= z.ymin, it's possible for x.ymax to be less than z.ymin. In this case, there's no overlap in the y-coordinates, which means x is not East of z. 

But if I relaxed the constraint, where I say x.ymax <= y.ymin and y.ymin <= z.ymax (instead of <= z.ymin), it could be possible for x.ymax to be greater than z.ymin (ensuring a non-zero overlap in the y-coordinates). Actually, no. If x.ymax <= y.ymin and y.ymin <= z.ymax, it doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between x.ymax and z.ymin. But wait, we want y.ymin to be greater than z.ymin for this to work. So I agree that East is possible.

OK, so I'll do one more visualization to convince myself.

```

        |   x   |

```

In this arrangement, x is South of y, and y is East of z. Given these positions, x is East of z.

OK, I see the issue. I was assuming that the y-coordinate of the bottom edge of y (y.ymin) would be less than or equal to the y-coordinate of the bottom edge of z (z.ymin). That doesn't have to be true. If the bottom edge of
