PROMPT: Let  Southwest and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem step by step.

We have three regions: x, y, and z.
- x is Southwest of y.
- y is North of z.

We need to determine what relation(s) could possibly hold between x and z.

Let's establish a mental coordinate system to help us reason about this. We can think of North as positive y-direction, South as negative y-direction, East as positive x-direction, and West as negative x-direction. Southwest would be both negative x and negative y directions.

Now, let's think about the positions:
- If y is North of z, then y is at a higher y-coordinate than z. That is, z is South of y.
- If x is Southwest of y, then x is at a lower y-coordinate and a lower x-coordinate than y.

So we have:
- x is at a lower y-coordinate than y (i.e., South of y).
- y is at a higher y-coordinate than z (i.e., North of z).

This means that:
- x is at a lower y-coordinate than y.
- y is at a higher y-coordinate than z.

We can deduce that x is at a lower y-coordinate than z if:
- y is at a y-coordinate that's between x and z.

But we know that y is North of z, so y has a higher y-coordinate than z. And x is Southwest of y, so x has a lower y-coordinate than y. So x must have a lower y-coordinate than z as well.

In terms of x-coordinates:
- x is at a lower x-coordinate than y (i.e., West of y).
- We don't know the relation between y and z in terms of x-coordinates.

Since we don't know the x-coordinate relation between y and z, we can't determine the exact relation between x and z in terms of the x-coordinate.

Let's consider some possibilities:

1. If y is directly North of z (same x-coordinate), then x would be West of y and y would be at the same x-coordinate as z. This would make x West and South of z, which is Southwest.

2. If y is Northeast of z, then y is East of z. Since x is West of y, x could be West of z, or x could be East of z but less East than y. We can't determine with certainty.

3. If y is Northwest of z, then y is West of z. Since x is West of y, x would definitely be West of z.

Hmm, this seems more complex than I initially thought.

Let's revisit the problem. We have:
- x is Southwest of y.
- y is North of z.

Let's think of it in terms of coordinates. If we set z at the origin (0, 0):
- y is North of z, so y is at (0, b) where b > 0.
- x is Southwest of y, so x is at (a, b+c) where a < 0 and c < 0.

This means x is at (a, b+c) and z is at (0, 0).

To determine the relation between x and z, we need to compare their coordinates.
- x has an x-coordinate of a, which is less than 0, so x is West of z.
- x has a y-coordinate of b+c. We know b > 0 and c < 0. If |c| > b, then b+c < 0, which means x is South of z. If |c| < b, then b+c > 0, which means x is North of z. If |c| = b, then b+c = 0, which means x and z are at the same y-coordinate.

So, depending on the exact values, x could be:
- Northwest of z (if b+c > 0).
- West of z (if b+c = 0).
- Southwest of z (if b+c < 0).

Actually wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me rethink this.

If z is at the origin (0, 0):
- y is North of z, so y is at (0, b) where b > 0.
- x is Southwest of y, so x is at (a, c) where a < 0 and c < b.

Hang on, that's still not right. Let me be more precise.

If z is at the origin (0, 0):
- y is North of z, so y is at (0, b) where b > 0.
- x is Southwest of y, so x is at (a, c) where a < 0 and c < b.

This means x is at (a, c) and z is at (0, 0).

To determine the relation between x and z, we need to compare their coordinates.
- x has an x-coordinate of a, which is less than 0, so x is West of z.
- x has a y-coordinate of c. We know c < b, but we don't know if c > 0, c = 0, or c < 0.

If c > 0, then x is Northwest of z.
If c = 0, then x is West of z.
If c < 0, then x is Southwest of z.

Actually, I realized there's a simpler way to approach this.

If y is North of z, then z is South of y.
If x is Southwest of y, then y is Northeast of x.

So, from x's perspective:
- y is to the Northeast.
- z is South of y.

Since z is South of y, and y is Northeast of x, z could be:
- Northeast of x.
- East of x.
- Southeast of x.
- South of x.
- Southwest of x.
- Or even directly in the direction of North or Northwest of x.

Hmm, this doesn't give us a clear answer either.

Let's define a clear coordinate system and think about this.

Let z be at the origin (0, 0):
- y is North of z, so y is at (0, b) where b > 0.
- x is Southwest of y, so x is at (a, c) where a < 0 and c < b.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to compare the coordinates of x (a, c) and z (0, 0).
- a < 0, so x is West of z.
- We need to compare c with 0. If c > 0, x is North of z. If c = 0, x is at the same y-coordinate as z. If c < 0, x is South of z.

I need to be more careful. Let's set up a different approach.

In cardinal directions, Southwest means "South and West."
If x is Southwest of y, it means x is both South of y and West of y.
If y is North of z, it means y is directly above z (in terms of North-South axis).

Let's use a 2D grid system to represent these relations.

If we set z at the origin (0, 0), then y is at (0, 1) (North of z).
If x is Southwest of y, then x is at (-1, 0) (West and South of y).

So, x is at (-1, 0) and z is at (0, 0).

Comparing these coordinates, x is West of z and at the same y-coordinate (neither North nor South). This would make x simply West of z.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. If x is Southwest of y, and y is at (0, 1), then x should be at something like (-1, 0) or even (-1, -1). The key is that "Southwest" means "South and West." So if x is Southwest of y, then x is at a lower y-coordinate and a lower x-coordinate than y.

Let's restart with a clearer understanding.

If we set z at the origin (0, 0), then y is at (0, 1) (North of z).
If x is Southwest of y, then x is at a position where it's both West and South of y. Let's say x is at (-a, 1-b) where a and b are positive.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we compare the coordinates of x (-a, 1-b) and z (0, 0).
- x has an x-coordinate of -a, which is less than 0, so x is West of z.
- x has a y-coordinate of 1-b. We need to compare 1-b with 0. If 1-b > 0, then x is North of z. If 1-b = 0, then x is at the same y-coordinate as z. If 1-b < 0, then x is South of z.

In other words, if b < 1, then x is Northwest of z. If b = 1, then x is West of z. If b > 1, then x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z, based on the given conditions, are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, hang on. There's an issue with this reasoning. If x is Southwest of y, it doesn't necessarily mean that x is exactly at (-a, 1-b). It could be at any point that's both South and West of y. Let me revise my approach.

Let's represent the positions more abstractly. If we consider y as the reference point, then:
- z is South of y.
- x is Southwest of y.

So, from y's perspective, z is directly South and x is Southwest.

Let's consider what this means in terms of the positions of x and z relative to each other. Since both x and z are in the Southern half of the plane with respect to y, but x is also Westward, the possible positions of x relative to z could be:
- Northwest (if x is not too far South compared to how far South z is).
- West (if x is at the same "Southness" as z).
- Southwest (if x is further South than z).

Actually, wait a minute. I think I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. I'll try a different approach.

Let's put z at the origin. Then:
- y is at (0, d) for some d > 0, because y is North of z.
- x is Southwest of y, which means x is at (a, b) where a < 0 (West of y) and b < d (South of y).

Now, the relation of x to z:
- x is at (a, b) and z is at (0, 0).
- If a < 0, then x is West of z.
- If b > 0, then x is North of z.
- If b = 0, then x is neither North nor South of z.
- If b < 0, then x is South of z.

So, the possible directions of x from z could be:
- Northwest (if a < 0 and b > 0).
- West (if a < 0 and b = 0).
- Southwest (if a < 0 and b < 0).

Actually, hang on. Let me reason about this slightly differently using vectors.

Let's represent the cardinal directions as vectors:
- North: (0, 1)
- South: (0, -1)
- East: (1, 0)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northeast: (1, 1)
- Southeast: (1, -1)
- Northwest: (-1, 1)
- Southwest: (-1, -1)

Now, the relation "x is Southwest of y" means that if we go from y to x, we move in the Southwest direction, which is represented by the vector (-1, -1).

Similarly, "y is North of z" means that if we go from z to y, we move in the North direction, which is represented by the vector (0, 1).

Now, to go from z to x, we can first go from z to y and then from y to x. That is, the vector from z to x is the sum of the vectors from z to y and from y to x.

Vector from z to x = Vector from z to y + Vector from y to x
Vector from z to x = (0, 1) + (-1, -1) = (-1, 0)

The vector (-1, 0) corresponds to the West direction. So, based on this analysis, x is West of z.

But wait, this assumes that the vectors are of the same magnitude. The reasoning would be more general if we allowed for scaling.

Let's revisit. If y is North of z, and x is Southwest of y, then:
- Vector from z to y = (0, a) for some a > 0.
- Vector from y to x = (-b, -c) for some b, c > 0.

The vector from z to x is the sum of these:
Vector from z to x = (0, a) + (-b, -c) = (-b, a-c)

Now, to determine the cardinal direction of x from z, we need to consider the signs of the components of this vector.
- If -b < 0, then x is West of z.
- If a-c > 0, then x is North of z.
- If a-c = 0, then x is neither North nor South of z.
- If a-c < 0, then x is South of z.

Given that a, b, and c are all positive, the vector from z to x is (-b, a-c).
- Since -b < 0, x is always West of z.
- If a > c, then x is Northwest of z.
- If a = c, then x is West of z.
- If a < c, then x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z, based on the given conditions, are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, I want to double-check by considering a couple of examples just to ensure my reasoning is correct.

Case 1: Suppose y is directly 1 unit North of z, and x is 1 unit Southwest of y.
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (0, 1)
- x is at (-1, 0)
So, x is West of z.

Case 2: Suppose y is directly 2 units North of z, and x is 1 unit Southwest of y.
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (0, 2)
- x is at (-1, 1)
So, x is Northwest of z.

Case 3: Suppose y is directly 1 unit North of z, and x is 2 units Southwest of y.
- z is at (0, 0)
- y is at (0, 1)
- x is at (-2, -1)
So, x is Southwest of z.

These examples confirm our analysis. Depending on the relative distances, x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z, based on the given conditions, are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, there's a slight issue with my examples. In Case 1 and Case 2, I'm assuming that the Southwest direction is a 45-degree angle from South, which means a 1-unit movement to the West and a 1-unit movement to the South. But this is a simplification. In reality, "Southwest" can refer to any direction between South and West. So, the movement could be any combination of Westward and Southward movements, not necessarily equal.

Let's correct this. If x is Southwest of y, then x is at a point that's both West and South of y, but the exact direction could be anywhere between directly West and directly South.

However, the qualitative analysis we've done still holds. If y is North of z, and x is Southwest of y, then x is West of z, and can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z depending on the specific positions.

Actually, let me still be very precise. We can use a more general representation.

Let z be at the origin (0, 0).
Let y be at (0, d) for some d > 0 (because y is North of z).
Let x be at (-a, d-b) for some a, b > 0 (because x is Southwest of y, which means x is both West and South of y).

Now, the relation of x to z:
- x is at (-a, d-b) and z is at (0, 0).
- Since -a < 0, x is West of z.
- If d-b > 0, then x is North of z.
- If d-b = 0, then x is neither North nor South of z.
- If d-b < 0, then x is South of z.

So, the possible directions of x from z could be:
- Northwest (if a > 0 and d-b > 0).
- West (if a > 0 and d-b = 0).
- Southwest (if a > 0 and d-b < 0).

Given that a, b, and d are all positive, the relative values of d and b determine whether x is North, neither North nor South, or South of z. And since a is positive, x is always West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z, based on the given conditions, are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Therefore, my final answer is: Northwest, West, Southwest.

Actually, wait. I realized that I'm not fully considering the problem statement. The question is asking for the possible relations between x and z. I shouldn't just give a list of possible relations; I should be more precise. 

Let me further refine this answer.

Let z be at the origin (0, 0).
Let y be at (0, d) for some d > 0 (because y is North of z).
Let x be at (-a, d-b) for some a, b > 0 (because x is Southwest of y, which means x is both West and South of y).

The relation of x to z depends on the values of a, b, and d.
- Since -a < 0, x is always West of z.
- If d > b, then d-b > 0, which means x is North of z. So, x is Northwest of z.
- If d = b, then d-b = 0, which means x is neither North nor South of z. So, x is directly West of z.
- If d < b, then d-b < 0, which means x is South of z. So, x is Southwest of z.

Since we're not given specific values for a, b, and d, all three cases are possible based on the given constraints. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if d > b).
- West (if d = b).
- Southwest (if d < b).

So, the possible relations between x and z, based on the given conditions, are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, I think there's an issue with this interpretation of Southwest. It doesn't simply mean a combination of West and South; it means specifically the direction at a 45-degree angle between West and South.

Let's revisit this with a clearer understanding. I think I'm making this more complex than it is. 

The cardinal directions North, South, East, and West refer to specific directions on a compass: North points up, South points down, East points right, and West points left. The compound directions (like Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest) refer to the directions that are at a 45-degree angle between the cardinal directions.

If x is Southwest of y, it means that x is in a direction that's at a 45-degree angle between South and West from y.
If y is North of z, it means that y is directly North of z.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I'm going to place these regions on a simple grid. Let's say:
- z is at the position (0, 0).
- y is at the position (0, 1), since it's North of z.
- x is at the position (-1, 0), since it's Southwest of y.

Based on this, x is at (-1, 0) and z is at (0, 0). Comparing these positions, x is directly West of z.

But wait, I think I need to reconsider what Southwest means again. In cardinal directions, Southwest means a combination of South and West, which doesn't have to be at a 45-degree angle. It just means that x is both South and West of y. Similarly, y being North of z means y is directly above z (higher up).

Let's place these on a grid. If z is at (0, 0):
- y is at (0, a) for some a > 0 (because y is North of z).
- x is at (-b, a-c) for some b, c > 0 (because x is Southwest of y, which means x is both West and South of y).

Now, comparing x at (-b, a-c) and z at (0, 0):
- Since -b < 0, x is West of z.
- If a-c > 0, then x is North of z. So, x is Northwest of z.
- If a-c = 0, then x is neither North nor South of z. So, x is directly West of z.
- If a-c < 0, then x is South of z. So, x is Southwest of z.

Given that a, b, and c are all positive, the relation of x to z depends on the relative values of a and c.

In summary, the possible relations of x to z, based on the given conditions, are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, I still feel like I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take another shot at it.

Direction relations are qualitative, and we want to reason qualitatively. 

If x is Southwest of y, that means:
- x is West of y.
- x is South of y.

If y is North of z, that means:
- y is North of z.

So, what do we know about the relation between x and z?

We know that:
- x is West of y.
- y has the same East-West coordinate as z (since y is directly North of z).

So, x is West of z.

In terms of the North-South relation:
- x is South of y.
- y is North of z.

So, x can be North of z, at the same North-South level as z, or South of z, depending on the relative distances. If the distance from x to y in the South direction is less than the distance from z to y in the South direction, then x is North of z. If they're equal, then x is at the same North-South level as z. If the distance from x to y in the South direction is more than the distance from z to y in the South direction, then x is South of z.

This means x can be Northwest of z, directly West of z, or Southwest of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

The possible relations between x and z, based on the given conditions, are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

ANSWER:

- Northwest
- West
- Southwest
