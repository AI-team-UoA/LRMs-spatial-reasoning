PROMPT: Let  East and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let me think about this problem carefully.

We have two given facts:
1. Region x is East of region y.
2. Region y is West of region z.

And we need to determine the possible relation(s) between region x and region z.

Let's use a coordinate system to think about this problem, where:
- East means increasing x-coordinate
- West means decreasing x-coordinate
- North means increasing y-coordinate
- South means decreasing y-coordinate

Given that region x is East of region y, it means that x is located at a higher x-coordinate than y. 
Given that region y is West of region z, it means that y is located at a lower x-coordinate than z.

Combining these two:
- x is at a higher x-coordinate than y
- y is at a lower x-coordinate than z

From the transitive property, this means that the x-coordinate of x could be:
- Higher than the x-coordinate of z, which means x is East of z
- Equal to the x-coordinate of z, which means x and z are aligned along the East-West axis
- Lower than the x-coordinate of z, which means x is West of z

But there's a problem with the last option. If x is at a higher x-coordinate than y, and y is at a lower x-coordinate than z, then x can't be at a lower x-coordinate than z. This would be a contradiction.

So, we're left with two possibilities:
- x is East of z
- x and z are aligned along the East-West axis

However, regions can also have different y-coordinates, which determine their North-South relations. Since we have no information about the y-coordinates of x, y, and z, x could be:
- North of z
- South of z
- Aligned with z along the North-South axis

Combining the East-West and North-South relationships, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- East of z
- Northeast of z (East and North)
- Southeast of z (East and South)

Actually, let me think about this a bit more carefully. If we don't have any constraints on the y-coordinates of the regions, then their North-South relation is unconstrained. So x could be North, South, or at the same latitude as z.

Given that x is East of y and y is West of z, the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y, and the x-coordinate of y is less than the x-coordinate of z. 

So we have: x_coordinate_of_x > x_coordinate_of_y and x_coordinate_of_y < x_coordinate_of_z.

These two inequalities don't directly constrain the relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z. So, x could be East of z, West of z, or at the same longitude as z.

Combining the possibilities for the East-West and North-South relations, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- East
- West
- North
- South
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southeast
- Southwest

But this is a bit unsatisfying, because we haven't fully utilized the given constraints. Let me re-think this.

Actually, I think I made an error. Let me work through the logic again.

Given:
1. Region x is East of region y.
2. Region y is West of region z.

From 1, we know that the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y: x_x > x_y.
From 2, we know that the x-coordinate of y is less than the x-coordinate of z: x_y < x_z.

Combined, we have: x_x > x_y and x_y < x_z.

From these, we can't directly determine the relation between x_x and x_z. They could be in any order.

Similarly, since we have no information about the y-coordinates, the North-South relationship between x and z is unconstrained.

Given these, the possible relations between x and z could be any of the 8 cardinal and ordinal directions.

Hmm, let's delve deeper. The transitive property might be applicable here.

If we have:
- x is East of y: x_x > x_y
- y is West of z: x_y < x_z

Then, by transitivity, one might think that x_x > x_z, which would mean x is East of z. However, this isn't necessarily true because the first inequality is about x and y, and the second is about y and z. We can't directly combine them to derive a relationship between x and z.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the given information geometrically.

Region x is East of region y means that x is to the right of y on a map (if North is up).
Region y is West of region z means that y is to the left of z on a map.

Now, where can x be relative to z?

x is to the right of y, and y is to the left of z. Does this constrain the relationship between x and z?

Let's imagine y as a reference point. From y, x is to the East, and z is to the East as well (since y is West of z). But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z. x could be further East than z, or z could be further East than x, or they could be at the same East-West position but differ in North-South position.

Given the constraints, the possible positions of x relative to z could be any of the 8 cardinal and ordinal directions.

But I feel like there's something I'm missing. Let me think about this problem in a more direct way.

If region x is East of region y, it means x is to the right of y.
If region y is West of region z, it means y is to the left of z, or equivalently, z is to the right of y.

So, we have x to the right of y, and z to the right of y. Both x and z are to the right of y, but their relative positions to each other are not constrained.

x could be to the right of z, to the left of z, or at the same East-West position as z. Similarly, x could be above, below, or at the same North-South position as z.

Actually, no, let me reconsider. I feel like I'm still not thinking about this completely correctly. Let me try to look at the total constraints of the problem.

Let me define my coordinate system, where I place region y at the origin (0,0). From here, we know that region x is East of region y, meaning that x has a positive x-coordinate: x_x > 0. 

We also know that region y is West of region z, meaning that z has a positive x-coordinate: x_z > 0.

Both x and z are to the East of y, but their relative East-West position is not constrained. x could be further East than z, z could be further East than x, or they could be at the same East-West position.

The North-South relationship is also unconstrained as we don't have any information about the y-coordinates.

Given these, x could be at any of the 8 cardinal and ordinal directions relative to z.

Actually, let's try yet another approach with a different convention. 

Let's say R is a cardinal direction relation. Then x R y means "x is R of y". For example, "x East y" means "x is East of y". We're trying to figure out the possible relations R such that x R z.

We know that x East y and y West z. Equivalently, we can say y East z. So, x East y and y East z.

I think the issue I've been having is that the relation "West" is the inverse of "East", not the same. If y is West of z, then z is East of y, not the other way around.

So, in terms of the East relation, we have:
- x East y
- z East y

This tells us that both x and z are to the East of y, but it doesn't constrain the relative positions of x and z. They could be in any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions relative to each other.

Let me try to visualize this to make it clearer, and use a more precise notation. Let's use E to represent the East relation, and W to represent the West relation.

We know that x E y and y W z. The relation W is the inverse of E, so y W z is equivalent to z E y.

So, we have:
- x E y
- z E y

From the reference point of y, both x and z are to the East. But we don't know their relative positions.

Let's think about specific examples to gain intuition:

1. If x is directly East of y, and z is directly East of y, but x is further East than z, then x would be East of z.
2. If x is directly East of y, and z is directly East of y, but z is further East than x, then x would be West of z.
3. If x is Northeast of y, and z is directly East of y, then x would be North of z.
4. If x is Southeast of y, and z is directly East of y, then x would be South of z.

Ugh, let me try a different approach. In fact, let me just try a concrete example. Let's set y at the origin (0, 0). 

If x is East of y, it could be at a position like (1, 0), (2, 0), or any point with a positive x-coordinate.
If y is West of z, then z is East of y. So z could also be at a position like (1, 0), (2, 0), or any point with a positive x-coordinate.

Given that both x and z can be at positions East of y, the relative position of x with respect to z can be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions.

For instance:
- If x is at (1, 0) and z is at (2, 0), then x is West of z.
- If x is at (2, 0) and z is at (1, 0), then x is East of z.
- If x is at (1, 1) and z is at (1, 0), then x is North of z.
- If x is at (1, -1) and z is at (1, 0), then x is South of z.
- If x is at (2, 1) and z is at (1, 0), then x is Northeast of z.
- If x is at (2, -1) and z is at (1, 0), then x is Southeast of z.
- If x is at (0.5, 1) and z is at (1, 0), then x is Northwest of z.
- If x is at (0.5, -1) and z is at (1, 0), then x is Southwest of z.

So, it seems like the possible relations between x and z could be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions.

Actually, no. I think there's still a constraint I'm missing. The East-West relation is transitive for regions, so if x is East of y and y is East of z, then x is East of z. But in our case, we have x East of y and z East of y. This doesn't give us a direct transitive relation.

Let me try to define this more formally and see if that helps.

Let E(a, b) mean "a is East of b" and W(a, b) mean "a is West of b".

We know that E(x, y) and W(y, z).

By definition, W(a, b) is equivalent to E(b, a). So, W(y, z) is equivalent to E(z, y).

So, we have E(x, y) and E(z, y).

This doesn't directly tell us the relation between x and z using transitivity.

Actually, wait, I think I misunderstood the problem. Let's get back to the original statements:

1. Region x is East of region y.
2. Region y is West of region z.

The second statement, "Region y is West of region z", means that z is to the East of y. So, from y's perspective, both x and z are to its East.

Given this, the possible relations between x and z could be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions, depending on their relative positions.

Hmm, but this doesn't seem right. We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z that can be inferred from the given information. Let me double check a simple case.

Suppose:
- y is at the origin (0, 0)
- x is at (1, 0), which is East of y
- z is at (2, 0), which is East of y (since y is West of z)

In this case, x is West of z. This makes sense. Positions like (1, 0) are East of y, and (2, 0) is also East of y, but (1, 0) is West of (2, 0).

Modifying a bit:
- y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (3, 0), East of y
- z is at (2, 0), East of y

Now, x is East of z. That also makes sense.

Actually let me be more precise. When we say that y is West of z, we can infer that z is East of y. But other orientations might still be possible. For instance, z might be Northeast of y or Southeast of y, but since we're only given that y is West of z, we can most directly infer that z is East of y.

Hmm. Let me reason from the perspective of a bounding box. A region can be East of another region if it's entirely to the right of it. Given our constraints, we know that the left edge of region x is to the right of the right edge of region y. And the left edge of region z is to the right of the right edge of region y.

But this still doesn't constrain the relative positions of regions x and z.

I'm going to reason from first principles. Let's define a bounding box for each region, and use the constraints to determine the possible relations.

Let's say we have a 2D plane. For simplicity, let's denote the bounding box of region r as a rectangle with corners at (min_x_r, min_y_r) and (max_x_r, max_y_r).

Given that x is East of y, we have:
min_x_x > max_x_y (The leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of y)

Given that y is West of z, we have:
max_x_y < min_x_z (The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z)

From these, we can conclude:
min_x_x > max_x_y and max_x_y < min_x_z

This doesn't directly constrain min_x_x relative to min_x_z or max_x_x relative to max_x_z.

So, the relative East-West position of x and z is unconstrained. Similarly, the North-South position is unconstrained.

Given this, the possible cardinal and ordinal direction relations between x and z could be any of the 8: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

Wait, I think I've been overthinking this. I know for sure that min_x_x > max_x_y and max_x_y < min_x_z. From these, we can deduce:
min_x_x > max_x_y > min_x_z - min_x_z.

This is a contradiction, as it says min_x_x > min_x_z - min_x_z, which is min_x_x > 0, which is clearly not a constraint on the relative positions of x and z.

The direct transitive inference isn't possible from the given constraints. Transitivity would work if we had "x East y" and "y East z", but we have "x East y" and "z East y".

OK let me try a concrete counterexample to test if every possible relative orientation is possible.

Suppose y is at the origin (0, 0). Given x East y, we have min_x_x > 0. And given y West z, we have 0 < min_x_z.

Let's place x at (1, 0) and z at (2, 0). Here, x is West of z.
Let's place x at (3, 0) and z at (2, 0). Here, x is East of z.
Let's place x at (2, 1) and z at (2, 0). Here, x is North of z.
Let's place x at (2, -1) and z at (2, 0). Here, x is South of z.
Let's place x at (3, 1) and z at (2, 0). Here, x is Northeast of z.
Let's place x at (3, -1) and z at (2, 0). Here, x is Southeast of z.
Let's place x at (1, 1) and z at (2, 0). Here, x is Northwest of z.
Let's place x at (1, -1) and z at (2, 0). Here, x is Southwest of z.

So it seems like the possible relations between x and z can be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions.

Hmm, I'm not entirely convinced yet. Let's try to approach this from a different angle.

I'll set up a coordinate system centered at y. So y is at the origin (0, 0).

Given x East y, we have x is at a position like (a, b) where a > 0 (i.e., x is to the right of y).
Given y West z, we have z is at a position like (c, d) where c > 0 (i.e., z is to the right of y).

The relative position of x with respect to z depends on the relative values of a, b, c, and d:
- If a > c, then x is to the East of z.
- If a < c, then x is to the West of z.
- If b > d, then x is to the North of z.
- If b < d, then x is to the South of z.

And the combinations give the ordinal directions:
- If a > c and b > d, then x is to the Northeast of z.
- If a > c and b < d, then x is to the Southeast of z.
- If a < c and b > d, then x is to the Northwest of z.
- If a < c and b < d, then x is to the Southwest of z.

Given the constraints, the values of a, b, c, and d can be any positive or negative real numbers (as long as a > 0 and c > 0). This means that the relative position of x with respect to z can be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions.

Just to double check, let's make sure I haven't overlooked anything:

If a = c, then x and z are at the same East-West position. If b > d, then x is to the North of z. If b < d, then x is to the South of z. This would give the North and South cardinal directions, which I've included in my list of 8 directions.

If b = d, then x and z are at the same North-South position. If a > c, then x is to the East of z. If a < c, then x is to the West of z. This would give the East and West cardinal directions, which I've also included in my list of 8 directions.

And if a = c and b = d, then x and z are at the exact same position, which doesn't fit into any of the cardinal or ordinal directions. But this seems like a degenerate case and isn't one of the options in the problem.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest.

Actually, now I think maybe regions in the cardinal system are not points but axis-aligned rectangles. Let me check one more time. 

For any region, define its west, east, south, and north boundaries.

"Region x is East of region y" means the west boundary of x is east of the east boundary of y, i.e., the leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of y.

"Region y is West of region z" means the east boundary of y is west of the west boundary of z, i.e., the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- The west boundary of x is east of the east boundary of y.
- The east boundary of y is west of the west boundary of z.

The constrains might be:
west_x > east_y and east_y < west_z

But now we can deduce: west_x > east_y and east_y < west_z.

OK, and now we can combine these two to get: west_x > west_z.

Actually, no, that's not right. We have west_x > east_y and east_y < west_z. We can't directly combine these to get a relation between west_x and west_z.

Let me try again. We have west_x > east_y and east_y < west_z, which can be rewritten as:
west_x > east_y > west_z - west_z.

But this is a contradiction, as it says west_x > west_z - west_z, which is west_x > 0, which is not a constraint on the relative positions of x and z.

OK, I'm getting myself confused. Let me restart and try a pictorial approach.

We have three regions: x, y, and z. We know that "x is East of y" and "y is West of z".

If x is East of y, then x is completely to the right of y. There's no overlap in the East-West direction.
If y is West of z, then y is completely to the left of z. There's no overlap in the East-West direction.

But this doesn't directly give us a constraint on the relative positions of x and z. It's possible for x to be East of z, West of z, or even overlap with z in the East-West direction.

The answer is any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions, or possibly "Bounding Box" if that refers to an overlap in both East-West and North-South directions.

Actually, I'm going to be a bit more careful. Now we've established that the constraint "Region x is East of region y" means that x is completely to the right of y, with no overlap in the East-West direction. Similarly, "Region y is West of region z" means that y is completely to the left of z, with no overlap.

But what this tells us is that the regions, from left to right, are ordered as: y, then z, and x can be anywhere relative to z. It can be to the left of z, to the right of z, or overlap with z.

It's the lack of information about the North-South relation that gives us the full 8 possible cardinal and ordinal directions for the relation between x and z.

Let me try concrete examples again:

Example 1: y at (0, 0), x at (1, 0), z at (2, 0).
Here, x is West of z.

Example 2: y at (0, 0), x at (3, 0), z at (2, 0).
Here, x is East of z.

Example 3: y at (0, 0), x at (2, 1), z at (2, 0).
Here, x is North of z.

Example 4: y at (0, 0), x at (2, -1), z at (2, 0).
Here, x is South of z.

Example 5: y at (0, 0), x at (3, 1), z at (2, 0).
Here, x is Northeast of z.

Example 6: y at (0, 0), x at (3, -1), z at (2, 0).
Here, x is Southeast of z.

Example 7: y at (0, 0), x at (1, 1), z at (2, 0).
Here, x is Northwest of z.

Example 8: y at (0, 0), x at (1, -1), z at (2, 0).
Here, x is Southwest of z.

Example 9: y at (0, 0), x at (2, 0), z at (2, 0).
Here, x overlaps with z, which might be the "Bounding Box" relation.

Actually, let me be more careful. By "Bounding Box" relation, I'm guessing the problem might be referring to a situation where one region is inside another, or maybe they share the same bounding box.

Oh actually I don't think it's asking about bounding box actually. It's just giving "Bounding Box" as a possible direction relation, which would mean that the two regions overlap or one encloses the other.

I've considered 9 examples, and I've shown that the relation between x and z can be any of: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box (overlap).

But wait, I just reread the problem and noticed that it's asking for "cardinal direction relations" and it gives "Bounding Box" as one of the possible answers. I'm interpreting this to mean that the regions are rectangles (or have rectangular bounding boxes), and the "Bounding Box" relation means that one region is inside the other, or they share the same bounding box.

Let me go back to the question. What are the possible cardinal direction relations that could exist between region x and region z?

Let me define the basic assumptions first:

1. When we say "x is East of y", we mean the western edge of region x is to the east of the eastern edge of region y. In other words, x is completely to the right of y with no overlap in the east-west direction.

2. When we say "y is West of z", we mean the eastern edge of region y is to the west of the western edge of region z. In other words, y is completely to the left of z with no overlap in the east-west direction.

From these, we can determine that the regions are ordered from west to east as: y, then z. The position of x is that it's to the east of y, but its position relative to z is not constrained. It can be to the west of z, to the east of z, or overlap with z in the east-west direction.

Similarly, the north-south relations between x, y, and z are not constrained.

Given this, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be any of: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Bounding Box (if x and z overlap).

Actually, wait, but now I'm not sure my "Bounding Box" relation is the one intended in the problem. It might refer to a situation where one region is inside another, or they have some specific bounding box relation.

Let me double check the possible answers: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

I can show, using examples, that all of these are possible relations between x and z, given the constraints.

Actually, let's be a bit more precise about "Bounding Box" (BB). The definition I found is: region x is the Bounding Box (BB) of region z if x covers z, i.e., x contains z.

But the definition could also be the other way around: z is the Bounding Box of x.

OK so I think I'm still confused about what the "Bounding Box" relation means. But, in the context of cardinal directions, I think it refers to a situation where one region is inside the other. Let's assume this definition.

Actually,the question asks for "the possible relations" and lists "Bounding Box" (BB) as a possible answer. This suggests that the BB relation means neither North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, nor Northwest, but something different. It might refer to a situation where x and z overlap, or one contains the other.

Actually, let me try a different approach. Let's define the exact bounding boxes of the regions. A bounding box is defined by its western, eastern, southern, and northern edges. Let's denote them as w_x, e_x, s_x, n_x for region x, and similarly for y and z.

The constraints are:
w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z.

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are determined by the relative positions of their bounding boxes.

1. North: s_x > n_z and w_x < e_z and e_x > w_z.
2. Northeast: s_x > n_z and w_x > e_z.
3. East: s_x < n_z and n_x > s_z and w_x > e_z.
4. Southeast: n_x < s_z and w_x > e_z.
5. South: n_x < s_z and w_x < e_z and e_x > w_z.
6. Southwest: n_x < s_z and e_x < w_z.
7. West: s_x < n_z and n_x > s_z and e_x < w_z.
8. Northwest: s_x > n_z and e_x < w_z.

The "Bounding Box" relation could mean:
w_x <= w_z and e_x >= e_z and s_x <= s_z and n_x >= n_z,
which means x contains z.

Let's see if these relations can be satisfied given the constraints:
w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z.

It's clear that the East-West relations in 1, 3, 5, and 7 can be satisfied, as they all allow overlap between x and z in the East-West direction. The North-South relations in these cases are unconstrained by our original constraints, so they can all be satisfied.

Relations 2, 4, 6, and 8 can also be satisfied. For 2 and 4, we would have w_x > e_z, which can be true if e_y < w_z < e_z < w_x. For 6 and 8, we would have e_x < w_z, which can be true if e_y < e_x < w_z.

For the "Bounding Box" relation, we would need w_x <= w_z and e_x >= e_z. We can satisfy e_x >= e_z, but can we satisfy w_x <= w_z given that w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z? This would mean w_x > e_y >= e_y and e_y < w_z >= w_x, or w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z >= w_x. This requires w_x <= w_z, which is possible if w_x = w_z.

Actually wait, the problem says region y is West of region z, which I think means e_y < w_z. But the problem also says region x is East of region y, which I think means w_x > e_y. So we have w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z. We can combine these to get w_x > e_y < w_z. But this doesn't directly constrain the relation between w_x and w_z. w_x could be less than, equal to, or greater than w_z. Similarly, the relation between e_x and e_z is unconstrained.

Let's see if we can find configurations for all the possibilities:

1. North: s_x > n_z and w_x < e_z and e_x > w_z.
   This can be satisfied with y at (0, 0), z at (2, 0), and x at (1.5, 3).

2. Northeast: s_x > n_z and w_x > e_z.
   This can be satisfied with y at (0, 0), z at (2, 0), and x at (5, 3).

3. East: s_x < n_z and n_x > s_z and w_x > e_z.
   This can be satisfied with y at (0, 0), z at (2, 0), and x at (5, 0).

4. Southeast: n_x < s_z and w_x > e_z.
   This can be satisfied with y at (0, 0), z at (2, 3), and x at (5, 0).

5. South: n_x < s_z and w_x < e_z and e_x > w_z.
   This can be satisfied with y at (0, 0), z at (2, 3), and x at (1.5, 0).

6. Southwest: n_x < s_z and e_x < w_z.
   This can be satisfied with y at (0, 0), z at (4, 3), and x at (1, 0).

7. West: s_x < n_z and n_x > s_z and e_x < w_z.
   This can be satisfied with y at (0, 0), z at (4, 0), and x at (1, 0).

8. Northwest: s_x > n_z and e_x < w_z.
   This can be satisfied with y at (0, 0), z at (4, 0), and x at (1, 3).

9. Bounding Box (x covers z): w_x <= w_z and e_x >= e_z and s_x <= s_z and n_x >= n_z.
   This is a bit trickier. We need w_x <= w_z, but we also have w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z. So, we need e_y < w_x <= w_z, which is possible. But can we find a configuration that satisfies all these constraints?

   Let's try with y at (0, 0), z at (3, 0), and x at (2, 0), with bounding boxes of size 1x1. In this case, w_y = 0, e_y = 1, w_z = 3, e_z = 4, w_x = 2, e_x = 3.

   We have w_x = 2 > e_y = 1 (x is East of y), and e_y = 1 < w_z = 3 (y is West of z).

   But with this configuration, x is not a bounding box of z, as w_x = 2 is not <= w_z = 3.

   Let's try another configuration. What if z is a point-like region and x is a larger region that contains it?

   Let's try with y at (0, 0), z at (3, 0), and x at (3, 0), with x having a size of 2x2 and y and z being points. In this case, w_y = 0, e_y = 0, w_z = 3, e_z = 3, w_x = 2, e_x = 4, s_x = -1, n_x = 1, s_z = 0, n_z = 0.

   We have w_x = 2 > e_y = 0 (x is East of y), and e_y = 0 < w_z = 3 (y is West of z).

   And x is a bounding box of z, as w_x = 2 <= w_z = 3, e_x = 4 >= e_z = 3, s_x = -1 <= s_z = 0, and n_x = 1 >= n_z = 0.

   So, it's possible for x to be a Bounding Box of z.

   However, I'm not sure if this is the correct interpretation of the "Bounding Box" relation. It could also mean that z is a bounding box of x, or that x and z overlap but neither contains the other.

Actually, no wait. In the configuration where y is at (0, 0), z is at (3, 0), and x is at (3, 0) with x having a size of 2x2, we have w_x = 2, which means x extends 2 units to the left of its center. This means x includes the point (1, 0), which doesn't satisfy the constraint that x is East of y (since 1 is not greater than e_y = 0, but rather 1 > e_y).

Oh wait, that's not right either. If y is a point at (0, 0), then e_y = 0, so w_x = 2 is indeed greater than e_y = 0.

Let me try a different configuration to be more explicit:
Let y be a point at (0, 0), so w_y = e_y = 0.
Let z be a point at (3, 0), so w_z = e_z = 3.
Let x be a rectangle centered at (3, 0) with width 2 and height 2, so w_x = 2, e_x = 4, s_x = -1, n_x = 1.

With this configuration:
w_x = 2 > e_y = 0 (x is East of y)
e_y = 0 < w_z = 3 (y is West of z)
w_x = 2 < w_z = 3 (the western edge of x is to the west of the western edge of z)
e_x = 4 > e_z = 3 (the eastern edge of x is to the east of the eastern edge of z)
s_x = -1 < s_z = 0 (the southern edge of x is to the south of the southern edge of z)
n_x = 1 > n_z = 0 (the northern edge of x is to the north of the northern edge of z)

So, with this configuration, x is a bounding box of z, but it doesn't satisfy the constraint that x is East of y. This is because the bounding box of x extends to the west of z, and z is east of y, so the western edge of x is not to the east of the eastern edge of y.

Let's try yet another configuration:
Let y be a rectangle centered at (0, 0) with width 2 and height 2, so w_y = -1, e_y = 1.
Let z be a point at (3, 0), so w_z = e_z = 3.
Let x be a rectangle centered at (3, 0) with width 2 and height 2, so w_x = 2, e_x = 4, s_x = -1, n_x = 1.

With this configuration:
w_x = 2 > e_y = 1 (x is East of y)
e_y = 1 < w_z = 3 (y is West of z)
w_x = 2 < w_z = 3 (the western edge of x is to the west of the western edge of z)
e_x = 4 > e_z = 3 (the eastern edge of x is to the east of the eastern edge of z)
s_x = -1 < s_z = 0 (the southern edge of x is to the south of the southern edge of z)
n_x = 1 > n_z = 0 (the northern edge of x is to the north of the northern edge of z)

OK but now with this configuration, x is not a Bounding Box of z in the sense that x contains z, because the western edge of x is to the east of the western edge of z. x doesn't contain z; it only overlaps with it.

Wait, maybe I'm confused on how I defined the edges of the regions. Let me redefine:
For a rectangle centered at (c_x, c_y) with width w and height h, the edges are:
west = c_x - w/2
east = c_x + w/2
south = c_y - h/2
north = c_y + h/2

With this definition, let's try again:
Let y be a rectangle centered at (0, 0) with width 2 and height 2, so w_y = -1, e_y = 1, s_y = -1, n_y = 1.
Let z be a rectangle centered at (3, 0) with width 0.5 and height 0.5, so w_z = 2.75, e_z = 3.25, s_z = -0.25, n_z = 0.25.
Let x be a rectangle centered at (3.5, 0) with width 2 and height 2, so w_x = 2.5, e_x = 4.5, s_x = -1, n_x = 1.

With this configuration:
w_x = 2.5 > e_y = 1 (x is East of y)
e_y = 1 < w_z = 2.75 (y is West of z)
And the "Bounding Box" relation between x and z is satisfied, as x contains z:
w_x = 2.5 < w_z = 2.75
e_x = 4.5 > e_z = 3.25
s_x = -1 < s_z = -0.25
n_x = 1 > n_z = 0.25

Actually, no wait. In this example, the western edge of x (w_x = 2.5) is to the west of the western edge of z (w_z = 2.75), so x doesn't contain z. Let me try one more time:

Let y be a rectangle centered at (0, 0) with width 2 and height 2, so w_y = -1, e_y = 1, s_y = -1, n_y = 1.
Let z be a rectangle centered at (3, 0) with width 0.5 and height 0.5, so w_z = 2.75, e_z = 3.25, s_z = -0.25, n_z = 0.25.
Let x be a rectangle centered at (3, 0) with width 2 and height 2, so w_x = 2, e_x = 4, s_x = -1, n_x = 1.

With this configuration:
w_x = 2 > e_y = 1 (x is East of y)
e_y = 1 < w_z = 2.75 (y is West of z)
And the "Bounding Box" relation between x and z is satisfied, as x contains z:
w_x = 2 < w_z = 2.75 (this is the opposite of what we want if we're checking if x contains z)
e_x = 4 > e_z = 3.25
s_x = -1 < s_z = -0.25
n_x = 1 > n_z = 0.25

I'm still not getting the containment relation I want. Let me be very explicit again in my definitions. If region x is a Bounding Box of region z, then:
w_x <= w_z (the western edge of x is to the west or at the same position as the western edge of z)
e_x >= e_z (the eastern edge of x is to the east or at the same position as the eastern edge of z)
s_x <= s_z (the southern edge of x is to the south or at the same position as the southern edge of z)
n_x >= n_z (the northern edge of x is to the north or at the same position as the northern edge of z)

With these definitions, and the constraints that x is East of y and y is West of z, can we have a configuration where x is a Bounding Box of z?

We know that w_x > e_y (the western edge of x is to the east of the eastern edge of y) and e_y < w_z (the eastern edge of y is to the west of the western edge of z).

For x to be a Bounding Box of z, we need w_x <= w_z, which means the western edge of x is to the west of the western edge of z.

But we also have w_x > e_y (the western edge of x is to the east of the eastern edge of y). And we have e_y < w_z (the eastern edge of y is to the west of the western edge of z).

So, we have w_x > e_y < w_z, which means w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z. This doesn't directly constrain the relation between w_x and w_z. It's possible that w_x < w_z, w_x = w_z, or w_x > w_z.

If w_x > w_z, then x can't be a Bounding Box of z. But if w_x <= w_z, then x can be a Bounding Box of z, as long as the other conditions (e_x >= e_z, s_x <= s_z, and n_x >= n_z) are also satisfied.

So, it's possible for x to be a Bounding Box of z, given the constraints that x is East of y and y is West of z.

OK, I think I'm finally seeing my error. Let's just try a specific example to convince myself, and make sure we're defining the boundaries consistently.

For a rectangle centered at (c_x, c_y) with width w and height h, the edges are:
west = c_x - w/2
east = c_x + w/2
south = c_y - h/2
north = c_y + h/2

Let y be a rectangle centered at (0, 0) with width 2 and height 2, so w_y = -1, e_y = 1, s_y = -1, n_y = 1.

Let z be a rectangle centered at (4, 0) with width 2 and height 2, so w_z = 3, e_z = 5, s_z = -1, n_z = 1.

Let x be a rectangle centered at (4, 0) with width 4 and height 4, so w_x = 2, e_x = 6, s_x = -2, n_x = 2.

OK let's check:
- x is East of y: w_x = 2 > e_y = 1. Yep, that's true.
- y is West of z: e_y = 1 < w_z = 3. Yep, that's also true.
- x is a Bounding Box of z: w_x = 2 < w_z = 3, e_x = 6 > e_z = 5, s_x = -2 < s_z = -1, n_x = 2 > n_z = 1. Oh, but the western edge of x is to the west of the western edge of z, so x doesn't contain z if we're using the definition that containment means the edges of the containing region are outside the edges of the contained region.

Wait, I think I flipped the inequality for containment. Let me redo:

For region x to contain region z, the bounding box of x must completely enclose the bounding box of z:
- w_x <= w_z (western edge of x is to the west or at the same position as the western edge of z)
- e_x >= e_z (eastern edge of x is to the east or at the same position as the eastern edge of z)
- s_x <= s_z (southern edge of x is to the south or at the same position as the southern edge of z)
- n_x >= n_z (northern edge of x is to the north or at the same position as the northern edge of z)

With these definitions, let's check if x is a Bounding Box of z:
- w_x = 2 <= w_z = 3 (yes, the western edge of x is to the west of the western edge of z)
- e_x = 6 >= e_z = 5 (yes, the eastern edge of x is to the east of the eastern edge of z)
- s_x = -2 <= s_z = -1 (yes, the southern edge of x is to the south of the southern edge of z)
- n_x = 2 >= n_z = 1 (yes, the northern edge of x is to the north of the northern edge of z)

So, x is a Bounding Box of z (i.e., x contains z). And the constraints that x is East of y and y is West of z are also satisfied. OK, there's no contradiction here, so the Bounding Box relation is a possible answer.

In conclusion, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, given that x is East of y and y is West of z, are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

Actually, wait. I think I'm not understanding what the "Bounding Box" relation means in the context of the problem. The problem is asking for "cardinal direction relations", and the choices are all cardinal or ordinal directions, plus "Bounding Box". This suggests that "Bounding Box" refers to a specific spatial relationship, not any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions.

I wonder if "Bounding Box" might refer to the situation where x and z overlap in both the East-West and North-South directions? Or maybe it's simply the case where the bounding boxes of x and z overlap? Or perhaps it's the case where neither of the 8 cardinal or ordinal direction relations holds, due to overlapping of the regions?

Actually, I'm now thinking that "Bounding Box" in this context might mean "no specific cardinal or ordinal direction", i.e., the situation where the regions overlap in such a way that none of the 8 cardinal or ordinal direction relations holds.

For example, if x and z overlap but neither is fully to the North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, or Northwest of the other, then the relation might be "Bounding Box".

Actually let me try a different approach to understand the problem better. The problem is about cardinal direction relations, which are spatial relations based on the directions of the compass. The possible relations include the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) and the four ordinal directions (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest). 

In the context of spatial reasoning, "Bounding Box" might refer to a specific spatial relationship where one region is contained within the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of another. So, if the MBR of region x completely contains region z, then we might say that the relation is "Bounding Box".

Wait, I think I'm overthinking this. The problem asks for "the possible relations", not "the specific relation", which suggests that multiple relations can hold. The list of options is quite extensive, and I've shown that all of them are possible relations between x and z, given the constraints.

So, the answer to the problem is that the possible relations between x and z could be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions, or "Bounding Box".

Let's just make sure one more time with the cardinal directions. These are:
1. North (N): s_x > n_z.
2. Northeast (NE): s_x > n_z and w_x > e_z.
3. East (E): s_x < n_z and n_x > s_z and w_x > e_z.
4. Southeast (SE): n_x < s_z and w_x > e_z.
5. South (S): n_x < s_z.
6. Southwest (SW): n_x < s_z and e_x < w_z.
7. West (W): s_x < n_z and n_x > s_z and e_x < w_z.
8. Northwest (NW): s_x > n_z and e_x < w_z.
9. Bounding Box (BB): x contains z, i.e., w_x <= w_z, e_x >= e_z, s_x <= s_z, and n_x >= n_z.

Given the constraints:
w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z.

I've shown that all 9 relations can be satisfied, so the answer is that the possible relations are all of them.

Actually, for the North relation, we need s_x > n_z, which says the southern edge of x is to the north of the northern edge of z. This means x is fully to the north of z.

Similarly, for the South relation, we need n_x < s_z, which says the northern edge of x is to the south of the southern edge of z. This means x is fully to the south of z.

I previously thought all 9 relations were possible, but I realize now that I need to check each relation more carefully.

Given the constraints:
w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z.

Let's set y at the origin (0, 0) with a width of 2, so e_y = 1. And let's set z at (4, 0) with a width of a, so w_z = 4 - a/2.

Now, we need:
w_x > 1 and 1 < 4 - a/2.

The second constraint gives a < 6.

Let's choose a = 2, so w_z = 3, e_z = 5.

Now, let's check if we can find a position for x that satisfies each of the 9 relations:

1. North: s_x > n_z (= 1).
   Let's choose x at (3, 3) with width 2 and height 2, so w_x = 2, e_x = 4, s_x = 2, n_x = 4.
   We have w_x = 2 > e_y = 1 (satisfied), and s_x = 2 > n_z = 1 (satisfied).
   So, the North relation is possible.

2. Northeast: s_x > n_z (= 1) and w_x > e_z (= 5).
   Let's choose x at (7, 3) with width 2 and height 2, so w_x = 6, e_x = 8, s_x = 2, n_x = 4.
   We have w_x = 6 > e_y = 1 (satisfied), s_x = 2 > n_z = 1 (satisfied), and w_x = 6 > e_z = 5 (satisfied).
   So, the Northeast relation is possible.

3. East: s_x < n_z (= 1) and n_x > s_z (= -1) and w_x > e_z (= 5).
   Let's choose x at (7, 0) with width 2 and height 1, so w_x = 6, e_x = 8, s_x = -0.5, n_x = 0.5.
   We have w_x = 6 > e_y = 1 (satisfied), s_x = -0.5 < n_z = 1 (satisfied), n_x = 0.5 > s_z = -1 (satisfied), and w_x = 6 > e_z = 5 (satisfied).
   So, the East relation is possible.

4. Southeast: n_x < s_z (= -1) and w_x > e_z (= 5).
   Let's choose x at (7, -3) with width 2 and height 2, so w_x = 6, e_x = 8, s_x = -4, n_x = -2.
   We have w_x = 6 > e_y = 1 (satisfied), n_x = -2 < s_z = -1 (satisfied), and w_x = 6 > e_z = 5 (satisfied).
   So, the Southeast relation is possible.

5. South: n_x < s_z (= -1).
   Let's choose x at (3, -3) with width 2 and height 2, so w_x = 2, e_x = 4, s_x = -4, n_x = -2.
   We have w_x = 2 > e_y = 1 (satisfied), and n_x = -2 < s_z = -1 (satisfied).
   So, the South relation is possible.

6. Southwest: n_x < s_z (= -1) and e_x < w_z (= 3).
   Let's choose x at (1.5, -3) with width 1, height 2, so w_x = 1, e_x = 2, s_x = -4, n_x = -2.
   We have w_x = 1 = e_y = 1 (not satisfied). Hmm, let's adjust and choose e_y = 0.9 (making the width of y slightly less than 2).
   Now, with w_x = 1, we have w_x = 1 > e_y = 0.9 (satisfied), n_x = -2 < s_z = -1 (satisfied), and e_x = 2 < w_z = 3 (satisfied).
   So, the Southwest relation is possible.

7. West: s_x < n_z (= 1) and n_x > s_z (= -1) and e_x < w_z (= 3).
   Let's choose x at (1.5, 0) with width 1, height 1, so w_x = 1, e_x = 2, s_x = -0.5, n_x = 0.5.
   Again, adjusting e_y to 0.9, we have w_x = 1 > e_y = 0.9 (satisfied), s_x = -0.5 < n_z = 1 (satisfied), n_x = 0.5 > s_z = -1 (satisfied), and e_x = 2 < w_z = 3 (satisfied).
   So, the West relation is possible.

8. Northwest: s_x > n_z (= 1) and e_x < w_z (= 3).
   Let's choose x at (1.5, 3) with width 1, height 2, so w_x = 1, e_x = 2, s_x = 2, n_x = 4.
   Again, adjusting e_y to 0.9, we have w_x = 1 > e_y = 0.9 (satisfied), s_x = 2 > n_z = 1 (satisfied), and e_x = 2 < w_z = 3 (satisfied).
   So, the Northwest relation is possible.

9. Bounding Box (BB): w_x <= w_z (= 3), e_x >= e_z (= 5), s_x <= s_z (= -1), and n_x >= n_z (= 1).
   Let's choose x at (4, 0) with width 6, height 4, so w_x = 1, e_x = 7, s_x = -2, n_x = 2.
   We have w_x = 1 > e_y = 0.9 (satisfied), w_x = 1 <= w_z = 3 (satisfied), e_x = 7 >= e_z = 5 (satisfied), s_x = -2 <= s_z = -1 (satisfied), and n_x = 2 >= n_z = 1 (satisfied).
   So, the Bounding Box relation is possible.

So, all 9 relations are possible.

Actually, wait a second. I think there's still confusion about the Bounding Box relation. In the context of cardinal direction relations, "Bounding Box" typically refers to a situation where one region overlaps with another, but neither is fully to the North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, or Northwest of the other.

The definition I've been using (w_x <= w_z, e_x >= e_z, s_x <= s_z, and n_x >= n_z) actually corresponds to a situation where x contains z. But in the context of cardinal direction relations, the "Bounding Box" relation might refer to a situation where the regions overlap in such a way that none of the 8 cardinal or ordinal direction relations holds.

Actually, I think "Bounding Box" might just mean a specific type of overlap where neither region is completely to the North, Northeast, East, etc. of the other. It's a situation where the regions overlap in such a way that they don't have a clear directional relationship.

I'm feeling a little uncertain about the exact definition of the "Bounding Box" relation in this context. But, I've shown that 8 of the 9 relations (the 8 cardinal and ordinal directions) are definitely possible. And, if "Bounding Box" refers to a specific type of overlap, then it's also possible.

So, the answer to the problem is that the possible relations between x and z could be any of the 9 options listed.

Actually, let me triple check the answer, in case I missed something. Let me focus on just the constraint w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z:

- w_x > e_y is the constraint from "x is East of y".
- e_y < w_z is the constraint from "y is West of z".

These don't directly constrain the relation between region x and region z. We've shown that all of the 8 cardinal and ordinal directions, as well as the "Bounding Box" relation (however it's defined), are possible relations between x and z.

Oh wait, I need to be careful when computing the edges of the regions. The western edge isn't just c_x - w/2, but actually it's more complex if the regions are not regular rectangles. But we don't have any information about the shapes of the regions, so I'll assume they are rectangles.

Let's assume "Bounding Box" means that the bounding box of x contains the bounding box of z (which is one possible definition of "Bounding Box").

To summarize, I've shown that all of the 8 cardinal and ordinal directions, as well as the "Bounding Box" relation, are possible relations between x and z, given the constraints that x is East of y and y is West of z.

So, the answer to the problem is that the possible relations between x and z could be any of the 9 options listed.

Actually, let's just triple check if the Bounding Box (containment) relation is possible. Given w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z, can we have w_x <= w_z?

We have w_x > e_y and e_y < w_z. If e_y < w_x and e_y < w_z, then both w_x and w_z are to the east of e_y. This means w_x and w_z can be in any order (less than, equal to, or greater than). So, it's possible for w_x to be less than or equal to w_z, which is a necessary condition for the Bounding Box relation.

Similarly, for the other conditions (e_x >= e_z, s_x <= s_z, and n_x >= n_z), there's no constraint from the original problem that would make them impossible to satisfy.

So, the Bounding Box relation is indeed a possible relation between x and z.

OK, so I'm confident that the answer to the problem is that the possible relations between x and z could be any of the 9 options listed: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

Actually one more sanity check.

If we try a specific example: let y be a rectangle centered at the origin, and let's places both x and z East of y, such that:
- x is East of y (w_x > e_y)
- y is West of z (e_y < w_z)

Now, depending on the specific placement of x and z (both of which are East of y), the relation between x and z can be any of the 8 cardinal or ordinal directions, or a "Bounding Box" relation.

OK so I've convince myself that indeed all of those relation are possible between x and z.

North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box.

ANSWER:

Looking at the problem:
- Region x is East of region y
- Region y is West of region z

These constraints tell us the relative positions, but they don't fully determine the relationship between x and z.

If I draw this out, what we know is:
- x must be completely to the east of y (no overlap in east-west direction)
- y must be completely to the west of z (no overlap in east-west direction)

This means y is positioned furthest west, z is positioned east of y, but x's position relative to z is not constrained. The x region could be positioned in any direction relative to z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z could be:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- South
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
- Bounding Box

All cardinal directions are possible depending on where x is placed relative to z.
