PROMPT: Let North and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about the question. We have three regions: x, y, and z.

We know that:
- x is North of y
- y is South of z

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

First, let's understand the cardinal direction relations in a 2D space:
- North: x is directly above y
- South: x is directly below y
- East: x is directly to the right of y
- West: x is directly to the left of y
- Northeast: x is above and to the right of y
- Northwest: x is above and to the left of y
- Southeast: x is below and to the right of y
- Southwest: x is below and to the left of y

Now, let's analyze the given conditions:
- If x is North of y, it means x is above y.
- If y is South of z, it means y is below z, which is equivalent to saying z is above y.

So, we have:
- x is above y
- z is above y

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z? 

Let me visualize this situation. We know y is below both x and z, but we don't know the relative positions of x and z with respect to each other in terms of left-right positioning. 

Here are some possibilities:

1. x could be North of z: This would mean x is directly above z.
2. x could be South of z: This would mean x is directly below z.
3. x could be Northeast of z: This would mean x is above and to the right of z.
4. x could be Northwest of z: This would mean x is above and to the left of z.
5. x could be East of z: This would mean x is directly to the right of z.
6. x could be West of z: This would mean x is directly to the left of z.
7. x could be Southeast of z: This would mean x is below and to the right of z.
8. x could be Southwest of z: This would mean x is below and to the left of z.

Now, let me check each of these possibilities to see if they are consistent with our given conditions:

1. x could be North of z: If x is directly above z, and z is above y, then x would be far above y. This is consistent with x being North of y.

2. x could be South of z: If x is directly below z, but still above y, this is also consistent with x being North of y.

3. x could be Northeast of z: If x is above and to the right of z, and z is above y, then x would be far above and to the right of y. This is consistent with x being North of y.

4. x could be Northwest of z: If x is above and to the left of z, and z is above y, then x would be far above and to the left of y. This is consistent with x being North of y.

5. x could be East of z: If x is directly to the right of z, and both x and z are above y, this is consistent with x being North of y.

6. x could be West of z: If x is directly to the left of z, and both x and z are above y, this is consistent with x being North of y.

7. x could be Southeast of z: If x is below and to the right of z, we need to check if x can still be above y (since x is North of y). If z is far above y, then x can be below z but still above y. So, this is possible under certain conditions.

8. x could be Southwest of z: Similarly, if x is below and to the left of z, we need to check if x can still be above y. Again, if z is far above y, then x can be below z but still above y. So, this is also possible under certain conditions.

Hmm, I realize I'm not thinking about this correctly. Let's try a different approach.

If x is North of y, it means x is directly above y, without any East or West component.
If y is South of z, it means y is directly below z, which is equivalent to saying z is directly above y, without any East or West component.

Given these, let's think about the relationship between x and z.

We know:
- x is directly above y
- z is directly above y

So, x and z are both directly above y. This means they are vertically aligned with y. 

Now, there are three possibilities for the relationship between x and z:
1. x is above z: This would mean x is North of z.
2. x is below z: This would mean x is South of z.
3. x and z are at the same vertical level but are horizontally separated: This would mean x is East of z (if x is to the right of z) or x is West of z (if x is to the left of z).

But wait, this doesn't seem right either. If x and z are both directly above y, they would be in the same vertical line, so they can't be East or West of each other.

Hmm, let me reconsider. Maybe I need to understand the cardinal directions in the context of regions more clearly.

In the context of regions, cardinal direction relations might be defined based on the relative positions of the regions as a whole, rather than specific points.

For example, if region x is North of region y, it might mean that every point in region x is above some point in region y, but not necessarily directly above.

Let me rethink this. The cardinal directions North, South, East, and West can define a partitioning of the 2D space around a reference region. 

For instance, if we consider region y as the reference, the space around it can be divided into 9 regions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the reference region itself (often denoted as Bounding Box or similar).

In our case, we're told that x is in the North region relative to y, and y is in the South region relative to z.

Hmm, I think I misunderstood the nature of North and South relations for regions. Let me think:

In qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations for regions are typically defined based on the minimal bounding rectangle of regions.

Let's denote the minimum bounding rectangle of a region r as MBR(r). The MBR is the smallest rectangle (with sides parallel to the axes) that contains the entire region.

If region x is North of region y, it means that the south boundary of MBR(x) is greater than or equal to the north boundary of MBR(y).

Similarly, if region y is South of region z, it means that the north boundary of MBR(y) is less than or equal to the south boundary of MBR(z).

Given these two conditions, can we determine the relation between x and z?

From x is North of y, we have: south(MBR(x)) ≥ north(MBR(y)).
From y is South of z, we have: north(MBR(y)) ≤ south(MBR(z)).

Combining these, we get: south(MBR(x)) ≥ north(MBR(y)) ≤ south(MBR(z)).

This doesn't directly give us the relation between x and z. It just tells us that the south boundary of x is greater than or equal to the north boundary of y, and the north boundary of y is less than or equal to the south boundary of z.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. Let's simplify.

If we know that x is North of y, it means x is above y.
If we know that y is South of z, it means y is below z, or equivalently, z is above y.

So, we have:
- x is above y
- z is above y

With just this information, we can't definitively say the relation between x and z. It could be any of:
- x is North of z (x is above z)
- x is South of z (x is below z)
- x is East of z (x is to the right of z)
- x is West of z (x is to the left of z)
- x is Northeast of z (x is above and to the right of z)
- x is Northwest of z (x is above and to the left of z)
- x is Southeast of z (x is below and to the right of z)
- x is Southwest of z (x is below and to the left of z)
- x and z are overlapping in their bounding boxes

I think the answer is that without additional constraints, the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully.

When we say "x is North of y," in the context of cardinal direction relations for regions, it typically means that every point in region x is above some point in region y. Similarly, when we say "y is South of z," it means every point in region y is below some point in region z.

So, if x is North of y and y is South of z, does this impose any constraints on the relation between x and z?

Let's consider a scenario where:
- x is entirely above y (North)
- y is entirely below z (South)

Given these, x and z can be arranged in several ways:

1. x could be entirely above z (x is North of z).
2. x could be entirely below z (x is South of z).
3. x could be to the right of z (x is East of z).
4. x could be to the left of z (x is West of z).
5. x could be above and to the right of z (x is Northeast of z).
6. x could be above and to the left of z (x is Northwest of z).
7. x could be below and to the right of z (x is Southeast of z).
8. x could be below and to the left of z (x is Southwest of z).
9. x and z could overlap in some way (this would be a more complex relation, often denoted as "Bounding Box" or similar).

So, without additional constraints, the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap.

Hmm, but I think I've been too general. Let's think more precisely based on the usual definitions of cardinal direction relations.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, cardinal direction relations for regions are often defined using a concept called "projection-based relations." Here, the 2D space is divided into 9 tiles based on the bounding box of a reference region.

Using this, if region x is North of region y, it means the entire region x lies in the North tile of region y. Similarly, if region y is South of region z, it means the entire region y lies in the South tile of region z.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z.

From "x is North of y," we know that the entire region x is in the North tile of y.
From "y is South of z," we know that the entire region y is in the South tile of z.

Let's visualize this:

For "x is North of y", y is our reference and x is entirely in the North tile of y.

```
|---|---|---|
| x | x | x |  <- North tile (where x is)
|---|---|---|
|   | y |   |  <- Reference (y)
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
```

For "y is South of z", z is our reference and y is entirely in the South tile of z.

```
|---|---|---|
|   | z |   |  <- Reference (z)
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| y | y | y |  <- South tile (where y is)
|---|---|---|
```

Combining these two, we get:

```
|---|---|---|
| x | x | x |  <- North tile of y (where x is)
|---|---|---|
|   | y |   |  <- Reference for x and South tile of z (where y is)
|---|---|---|
|   | z |   |  <- Reference for y
|---|---|---|
```

Looking at this combined visualization, we can say that x is in the North tile of y, and y is in the South tile of z. But the relation between x and z isn't immediately clear.

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let's restate the problem:
We have: "x is North of y" and "y is South of z". We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's define the cardinal direction relations more precisely:
- x is North of y: The y-coordinate of the bottom of x is greater than or equal to the y-coordinate of the top of y.
- y is South of z: The y-coordinate of the top of y is less than or equal to the y-coordinate of the bottom of z.

Using these definitions, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

From "x is North of y," we have: y_bottom(x) ≥ y_top(y).
From "y is South of z," we have: y_top(y) ≤ y_bottom(z).

Combining these, we get: y_bottom(x) ≥ y_top(y) ≤ y_bottom(z).

This doesn't give us a direct relation between x and z in terms of their y-coordinates. It just tells us that the bottom of x is above the top of y, and the top of y is below the bottom of z.

Given this, the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions, depending on the specific positions of x and z in the 2D space.

Ok, I think I'm getting confused because I'm trying to reason too abstractly.

Let's use a simple example with coordinate values.

Assume we have the following regions defined by their bounding boxes (specifying top-left and bottom-right corners):

y: (10, 10) to (20, 20)

Given that:
- x is North of y: This means x is somewhere above y.
- y is South of z: This means y is somewhere below z.

There are multiple possibilities for x and z, such as:

x: (10, 30) to (20, 40) [x is directly above y]
z: (10, 30) to (20, 40) [z is directly above y]

In this case, x and z occupy the same space, so their relation would be "Bounding Box" (or identical).

Let's consider another example:

x: (10, 30) to (20, 40) [x is directly above y]
z: (30, 30) to (40, 40) [z is above and to the right of y]

In this case, x is to the left of z, so the relation would be "West".

We can come up with many more examples, and depending on the specific positions of x and z, the relation between them could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap.

So, the answer to the question is that without additional constraints, the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap, which is typically represented as "Bounding Box" in cardinal direction relations for regions.

Actually, wait. I think I understand the problem in a different way now. Let's be more careful in defining the cardinal direction relations for regions.

In the context of qualitative spatial reasoning and cardinal direction relations for regions, we use a concept called the "direction relation matrix" or "9-intersection model."

For two regions, A and B, the space is divided into 9 tiles based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of region B. These tiles are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the MBR of B itself (often denoted as Bounding Box).

If we say "A is North of B," it means the entire region A lies in the North tile of region B's partition.

Similarly, if we say "B is South of C," it means the entire region B lies in the South tile of region C's partition.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z.

From "x is North of y," we know that the entire region x is in the North tile of y's partition.
From "y is South of z," we know that the entire region y is in the South tile of z's partition.

Let's visualize this:

For "x is North of y":
```
|---|---|---|
| x | x | x |  <- North tile of y (where x is)
|---|---|---|
|   | y |   |  <- MBR of y
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |  <- South tile of y
|---|---|---|
```

For "y is South of z":
```
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |  <- North tile of z
|---|---|---|
|   | z |   |  <- MBR of z
|---|---|---|
| y | y | y |  <- South tile of z (where y is)
|---|---|---|
```

Now, trying to combine these two, we get:

```
|---|---|---|
| x | x | x |  <- North tile of y (where x is)
|---|---|---|
|   | y |   |  <- MBR of y and South tile of z (where y is)
|---|---|---|
|   | z |   |  <- MBR of z
|---|---|---|
```

From this combined visualization, we can see that x is in the North tile of y, and y is in the South tile of z. 

Given this arrangement, we can deduce that x and z can have any of the following relations:
- x is North of z
- x is Northeast of z
- x is Northwest of z
- x can also be East or West of z, depending on their specific horizontal positions
- x can also be bounding box with z (i.e., x and z can overlap)
- x can also be South, Southeast, or Southwest of z, but only in specific cases where z extends far up and x is positioned appropriately.

Actually, we don't know z's exact position. We only know it's in the south of y, not its exact position. So if y is South of z, then can x be South of z as well?

Let's explore: If y is in the South tile of z, it means z is positioned above y. And if x is in the North tile of y, it means x is positioned above y. But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z.

I need to reason carefully here. If y is South of z, then z is North of y. And if x is North of y, then both x and z are in the northern direction from y.

Let's consider a vertical arrangement:
```
   x
   
   y
   
   z
```

In this case, x is North of z. But x and z could also be arranged horizontally or diagonally.

For instance, consider:
```
   x          z
   
   
   
        y
```

In this scenario, x is West of z.

Let me reason through the possibilities systematically.

If x is North of y, it means x is above y.
If y is South of z, it means y is below z, or equivalently, z is above y.

So, we have:
- x is above y
- z is above y

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. x is North of z: This is possible if x is directly above z.
2. x is South of z: This is possible if x is below z (but still above y).
3. x is East of z: This is possible if x is to the right of z.
4. x is West of z: This is possible if x is to the left of z.
5. x is Northeast of z: This is possible if x is above and to the right of z.
6. x is Northwest of z: This is possible if x is above and to the left of z.
7. x is Southeast of z: This is possible if x is below and to the right of z (but still above y).
8. x is Southwest of z: This is possible if x is below and to the left of z (but still above y).
9. x and z can overlap or have a more complex relation, which might be denoted as "Bounding Box" or similar.

So, the answer is that without additional constraints, the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap (Bounding Box).

Thinking about this more carefully, let's visualize the constraints in a different way.

If x is North of y, it means x is entirely in the North tile of y's partition.
If y is South of z, it means y is entirely in the South tile of z's partition.

Let's denote the cardinal direction tiles of a region r as N(r), NE(r), E(r), SE(r), S(r), SW(r), W(r), NW(r), and BB(r) for North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Bounding Box, respectively.

From "x is North of y," we have x ⊆ N(y).
From "y is South of z," we have y ⊆ S(z).

The questions is: given these constraints, what is the relation between x and z?

Let's try a different approach. If we go from a topocentric frame of reference, we can set y as our origin. So we want to know, if y is at the origin (0, 0), x is somewhere in the North direction from y, and z is somewhere in the North direction from y, what's the relation between x and z?

Actually, from the information given, we've been told that y is South of z, which is equivalent to saying z is North of y. So, both x and z are in the North direction from y.

Given that both x and z are in the North direction from y, their relative positions with respect to each other can be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap, depending on their specific positions in the North tile of y.

I think that the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap.

Let me be even more precise though. The typical definition of cardinal directions for regions is based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the reference region. Let's denote the MBR of a region r as MBR(r).

For the relation "x is North of y", it means the projection of MBR(x) on the x-axis (east-west axis) has some overlap with the projection of MBR(y) on the x-axis, and the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(x) is greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(y).

Similarly, for the relation "y is South of z", it means the projection of MBR(y) on the x-axis has some overlap with the projection of MBR(z) on the x-axis, and the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(y) is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(z).

Given these definitions, can we determine the relation between x and z?

Let's denote:
- x_min(r) and x_max(r): the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of MBR(r).
- y_min(r) and y_max(r): the minimum and maximum y-coordinates of MBR(r).

From "x is North of y", we have:
- x_min(x) ≤ x_max(y) and x_max(x) ≥ x_min(y) (projection overlap on x-axis)
- y_min(x) ≥ y_max(y) (x is above y)

From "y is South of z", we have:
- x_min(y) ≤ x_max(z) and x_max(y) ≥ x_min(z) (projection overlap on x-axis)
- y_max(y) ≤ y_min(z) (y is below z)

Combining these, we get:
- x_min(x) ≤ x_max(y) and x_max(x) ≥ x_min(y) (projection overlap between x and y on x-axis)
- x_min(y) ≤ x_max(z) and x_max(y) ≥ x_min(z) (projection overlap between y and z on x-axis)
- y_min(x) ≥ y_max(y) (x is above y)
- y_max(y) ≤ y_min(z) (y is below z)

From these constraints, can we determine the relation between x and z?

There's no direct constraint that relates the x-coordinates of x and z. The only thing we can say for certain is that both x and z have projection overlaps with y on the x-axis, but this doesn't guarantee a projection overlap between x and z.

I'm not sure I can definitively answer without more constraints.

Let me think again, more simply. The cardinal directions in this problem seem to be defined as:
- A is North of B: A is directly above B.
- A is South of B: A is directly below B.

Given:
- x is North of y (x is directly above y)
- y is South of z (y is directly below z, or equivalently, z is directly above y)

What is the relation between x and z?

If we visualize this, we have z directly above y, and x directly above y. This doesn't fix the relative positions of x and z with respect to each other. 

For example:
- x could be directly above z (x is North of z)
- x could be directly below z (x is South of z)
- x could be to the right of z (x is East of z)
- x could be to the left of z (x is West of z)
- x could be above and to the right of z (x is Northeast of z)
- x could be above and to the left of z (x is Northwest of z)
- x could be below and to the right of z (x is Southeast of z)
- x could be below and to the left of z (x is Southwest of z)
- x and z could be in the same position (x is Bounding Box with z)

So, the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap (Bounding Box).

Actually, wait, let me reconsider my understanding of cardinal directions in the context of the question. 

When we say "region x is North of region y," it's not just that x is directly above y, but rather that x is in the northern direction from y. Similarly, "region y is South of region z" means y is in the southern direction from z.

In a 2D Cartesian plane, if we define the directions based on the four quadrants (with a reference region at the center), we have:
- North: y-coordinate increases, x-coordinate remains the same
- South: y-coordinate decreases, x-coordinate remains the same
- East: x-coordinate increases, y-coordinate remains the same
- West: x-coordinate decreases, y-coordinate remains the same
- Northeast: both x and y coordinates increase
- Northwest: x-coordinate decreases, y-coordinate increases
- Southeast: x-coordinate increases, y-coordinate decreases
- Southwest: both x and y coordinates decrease

Given these definitions, let's analyze the given information:
- If x is North of y, it means x is directly above y (higher y-coordinate, same x-coordinate).
- If y is South of z, it means y is directly below z (lower y-coordinate, same x-coordinate), or equivalently, z is directly above y.

So, we have:
- x is directly above y
- z is directly above y

I realize I've been inconsistent in my reasoning. Let me be clearer.

My interpretation of "region x is North of region y" is that every point in region x is in the northern direction (or above) with respect to at least one point in region y.

Given:
- x is North of y (every point in x is above at least one point in y)
- y is South of z (every point in y is below at least one point in z)

Can we determine the relation between x and z?

I'm stuck again. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider a simple example to clarify my thinking.
Assume the regions are defined by their bounding boxes (specifying bottom-left and top-right corners):

y: (1, 1) to (3, 3)

Now, given that x is North of y, one possible position for x could be:
x: (1, 4) to (3, 6)

And given that y is South of z, one possible position for z could be:
z: (1, 4) to (3, 6)

In this case, x and z occupy the same space, so their relation would be "Bounding Box" (or identical).

Alternatively, z could be:
z: (4, 4) to (6, 6)

In this case, x is to the left of z, so the relation would be "West".

Or, z could be:
z: (2, 7) to (4, 9)

In this case, x is to the southwest of z, so the relation would be "Southwest".

Given the wide range of possible positions for x and z while still satisfying the given constraints, it seems that the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap (Bounding Box).

Actually, let me re-read the original problem again to clarify.

Ok so we have three regions x, y, and z. We're told that:
- x is North of y
- y is South of z

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

I've been arguing that the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap. Let me double-check this by considering all possible cardinal direction relations and see if any can be ruled out.

1. North: x is North of z. This is possible if x is farther north than z.
2. South: x is South of z. This is possible if x is south of z but still north of y.
3. East: x is East of z. This is possible if x is to the east of z.
4. West: x is West of z. This is possible if x is to the west of z.
5. Northeast: x is Northeast of z. This is possible if x is to the northeast of z.
6. Northwest: x is Northwest of z. This is possible if x is to the northwest of z.
7. Southeast: x is Southeast of z. This is possible if x is to the southeast of z but still north of y.
8. Southwest: x is Southwest of z. This is possible if x is to the southwest of z but still north of y.
9. Bounding Box: x and z overlap. This is possible if x and z are in the same position.

So, all cardinal direction relations are possible for the relation between x and z, given the constraints.

Here's my final answer: Given that x is North of y and y is South of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be any of: North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, or Bounding Box.

Wait, wait, I see a problem with my reasoning. Let's think about this again.

Given that x is North of y, we know that every point in x is above every point in y. This is because, in cardinal direction relations, "North" means the region is entirely in the northern direction from the reference region.

Similarly, given that y is South of z, we know that every point in y is below every point in z.

Given these constraints, is it possible for x to be South of z?

Let's use an example to check. If x is South of z, it means every point in x is below every point in z. But we also know that every point in x is above every point in y, and every point in y is below every point in z. This creates a contradiction.

The contradiction arises from the transitivity of the "above" relation. If x is above y and y is below z, then x cannot be below z (or equivalently, x cannot be South of z).

Similarly, is it possible for x to be Southeast or Southwest of z?

If x is Southeast of z, it means every point in x is below and to the right of every point in z. But we've established that x cannot be below z, so x cannot be Southeast of z.

Similarly, x cannot be Southwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: North, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, or Bounding Box.

I think I need to be even more careful here. Let's think about the definition of cardinal direction relations and what they mean in the context of regions.

In the context of regions, cardinal direction relations are often defined using the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle (with sides parallel to the axes) that contains the entire region.

Now, let's define the cardinal direction relations:
- A is North of B: The MBR of A is entirely above the MBR of B.
- A is South of B: The MBR of A is entirely below the MBR of B.
- A is East of B: The MBR of A is entirely to the right of the MBR of B.
- A is West of B: The MBR of A is entirely to the left of the MBR of B.
- A is Northeast of B: The MBR of A is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of B.
- A is Northwest of B: The MBR of A is entirely above and to the left of the MBR of B.
- A is Southeast of B: The MBR of A is entirely below and to the right of the MBR of B.
- A is Southwest of B: The MBR of A is entirely below and to the left of the MBR of B.
- A is Bounding Box with B: The MBRs of A and B overlap.

Given:
- x is North of y: The MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y.
- y is South of z: The MBR of y is entirely below the MBR of z, or equivalently, the MBR of z is entirely above the MBR of y.

Now, can we determine the relation between x and z?

From the given information, we know that the MBR of x is above the MBR of y, and the MBR of z is above the MBR of y. This doesn't provide a direct relationship between the MBRs of x and z.

For instance, the MBR of x could be entirely above the MBR of z (x is North of z), or the MBR of z could be entirely above the MBR of x (x is South of z). Similarly, the MBRs of x and z could have various other relative positions, leading to different cardinal direction relations.

Actually, I think I was right in my earlier reasoning. If x is North of y, it means the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y. And if y is South of z, it means the MBR of y is entirely below the MBR of z, or equivalently, the MBR of z is entirely above the MBR of y.

So, the MBR of x is above the MBR of y, and the MBR of z is above the MBR of y. But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between the MBRs of x and z. The MBRs of x and z could have various relative positions, leading to different cardinal direction relations.

Let's think about this more carefully. The cardinal directions in 2D space can be visualized as follows:

```
|NW |N  |NE |
|---|---|---|
|W  |BB |E  |
|---|---|---|
|SW |S  |SE |
```

If x is North of y, it means x is in the N tile with respect to y. And if y is South of z, it means y is in the S tile with respect to z.

Let me visualize the different possibilities for x and z:

1. x is North of z (N):
```
| x |
|---|
| z |
|---|
| y |
```

2. x is South of z (S):
```
| z |
|---|
| x |
|---|
| y |
```

3. x is East of z (E):
```
| z | x |
|---|---|
|   | y |
```

4. x is West of z (W):
```
| x | z |
|---|---|
|   | y |
```

5. x is Northeast of z (NE):
```
|   | x |
|---|---|
| z |   |
|---|---|
|   | y |
```

6. x is Northwest of z (NW):
```
| x |   |
|---|---|
|   | z |
|---|---|
|   | y |
```

7. x is Southeast of z (SE):
```
| z |   |
|---|---|
|   | x |
|---|---|
|   | y |
```

8. x is Southwest of z (SW):
```
|   | z |
|---|---|
| x |   |
|---|---|
|   | y |
```

9. x and z are Bounding Box (BB):
```
| x/z |
|----|
|  y  |
```

Let's check if all of these are consistent with the given constraints:
- x is North of y: x is in the N tile with respect to y.
- y is South of z: y is in the S tile with respect to z.

In all the diagrams, x is indeed in the N tile with respect to y, and y is in the S tile with respect to z. But diagram 2 is concerning. It seems to show that x is South of z, but I questioned earlier if this is a possible relation.

Let's reconsider. If x is South of z, it means the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of z. But we also know that the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is entirely below the MBR of z.

Can the MBR of x be both entirely above the MBR of y and entirely below the MBR of z? 

Let's use coordinates to check. Let the MBRs be:
MBR(y): (0, 0) to (1, 1)
MBR(z): (0, 3) to (1, 4)
MBR(x): (0, 2) to (1, 3)

In this case, MBR(x) is indeed entirely above MBR(y) (x is North of y) and entirely below MBR(z) (x is South of z). So, it's possible for x to be South of z.

Similarly, x can be Southeast or Southwest of z, as long as the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y and has the appropriate position relative to the MBR of z.

Actually I'm not sure if x being "above" y really implies that x is "North" of y. Let me clarify the definitions of cardinal direction relations for regions.

In the context of regions in a 2D space, cardinal direction relations are often defined using a concept called the "direction relation matrix" or "9-intersection model." This divides the space into 9 tiles based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a reference region.

For two regions, A and B, if we say "A is North of B," it means A is entirely in the North tile of B's partition. The North tile is the area that's directly above B's MBR and has the same width as B's MBR.

Similarly, if we say "B is South of C," it means B is entirely in the South tile of C's partition. The South tile is the area that's directly below C's MBR and has the same width as C's MBR.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z.

From "x is North of y," we know that x is entirely in the North tile of y's partition.
From "y is South of z," we know that y is entirely in the South tile of z's partition.

If we visualize this, we have:

```
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|   | x |   |  <- North tile of y (where x is)
|---|---|---|
|   | y |   |  <- MBR of y
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |
```

And:

```
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|   | z |   |  <- MBR of z
|---|---|---|
|   | y |   |  <- South tile of z (where y is)
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |
```

Combining these, we get:

```
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|   | z |   |  <- MBR of z
|---|---|---|
|   | x |   |  <- North tile of y (where x is)
|---|---|---|
|   | y |   |  <- MBR of y and South tile of z (where y is)
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |
```

In the image above, x is positioned between y and z.

This implies that x can be in the South tile of z, making the relation "x is South of z."

However, x doesn't have to be in this specific position. For instance, x could be in the North tile of z, the East tile of z, the West tile of z, or any of the other tiles. The only constraint is that x is in the North tile of y.

Given the nature of the cardinal direction relations for regions, the possible relations between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest) or an overlap (Bounding Box).

I just realized that there's also a "Bounding Box" relation, which is not the same as the MBR. The "Bounding Box" relation is often used to denote cases where two regions have some form of overlap or one region is contained within the other.

Ok, let me be precise. In qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction relations for regions are often defined using the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the regions. The space is then divided into 9 tiles based on the MBR of a reference region. These tiles are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and the MBR itself (often denoted as Bounding Box or O for "Overlap").

For two regions, A and B, if we say "A is North of B," it means A is entirely in the North tile of B's partition. Similar definitions apply for the other cardinal directions.

Given:
- x is North of y: x is entirely in the North tile of y's partition.
- y is South of z: y is entirely in the South tile of z's partition.

From these, we can deduce that y is in the South tile of z, and x is in the North tile of y. But the relation between x and z isn't directly given by these constraints.

Let's reason through this systematically. If y is in the South tile of z, it means the MBR of y is directly below the MBR of z. And if x is in the North tile of y, it means the MBR of x is directly above the MBR of y.

In this arrangement, the MBR of x is directly above the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is directly below the MBR of z. But this doesn't uniquely define the position of the MBR of x relative to the MBR of z.

Actually, let me clarify a bit. When I say "the MBR of x is directly above the MBR of y," I don't mean it's immediately adjacent. I mean that the x-projection of the MBR of x has some overlap with the x-projection of the MBR of y, and the MBR of x is above the MBR of y.

The same applies for "the MBR of y is directly below the MBR of z." It means the x-projection of the MBR of y has some overlap with the x-projection of the MBR of z, and the MBR of y is below the MBR of z.

Given these interpretations, we get:
- The x-projection of the MBR of x has some overlap with the x-projection of the MBR of y, and the MBR of x is above the MBR of y.
- The x-projection of the MBR of y has some overlap with the x-projection of the MBR of z, and the MBR of y is below the MBR of z.

But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between the x-projections of the MBRs of x and z. The x-projection of the MBR of x might have an overlap with the x-projection of the MBR of z, but it doesn't have to.

This lack of a direct relationship means that the MBRs of x and z can have various relative positions, leading to different cardinal direction relations.

Actually I'm tired of going around in circles. Let me think one more time carefully.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

If region x is North of region y, it means x is above y. And if region y is South of region z, it means y is below z. So, we have x above y and y below z.

Now, the position of x relative to z could be:
1. x is also above z, making x North of z.
2. x is below z, making x South of z.
3. x is to the right of z, making x East of z.
4. x is to the left of z, making x West of z.
5. x is above and to the right of z, making x Northeast of z.
6. x is above and to the left of z, making x Northwest of z.
7. x is below and to the right of z, making x Southeast of z.
8. x is below and to the left of z, making x Southwest of z.
9. x and z have some form of overlap, making the relation "Bounding Box."

So, the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap.

But then again, let me check:
Is x being South of z possible? Yes. Given that x is North of y and y is South of z, x and z could be positioned in such a way that x is below z (but still above y).

Is x being Southeast or Southwest of z possible? Yes, for the same reason as above.

Is x being North, Northeast, or Northwest of z possible? Yes. Given that x is North of y and y is South of z, x and z could be positioned in such a way that x is above z.

Is x being East or West of z possible? Yes. Given that x is North of y and y is South of z, x and z could be positioned in such a way that they are horizontally aligned.

Is x being Bounding Box with z possible? Yes. Given that x is North of y and y is South of z, x and z could be positioned in such a way that they overlap.

It's possible that we can have ANY of the directions. Let me try one more example:

Suppose:
- Region x is North of region y, with no overlap in x-coordinates (x and y are in a straight line above each other). 
- Region y is South of region z, with no overlap in x-coordinates (y and z are in a straight line below each other).

In this specific scenario, x and z are also in a straight line above each other. This would make x North of z.

But what if:
- Region x is North of region y, with a rightward shift (x is above and to the right of y).
- Region y is South of region z, with a leftward shift (y is below and to the left of z).

In this scenario, x would be Southeast of z.

So, depending on the specific positions of the regions, the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap.

So, our final answer is: the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z could be any of the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest) or an overlap (Bounding Box).

Actually, wait, let me try to reason through this using more mathematical definitions.

Let's define the cardinal direction relations more mathematically. For two regions, A and B, with their respective minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) denoted as MBR(A) and MBR(B), we have:

- A is North of B: MBR(A) and MBR(B) overlap in the x-direction, and the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(A) is greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(B).
- A is South of B: MBR(A) and MBR(B) overlap in the x-direction, and the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(A) is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(B).
- A is East of B: MBR(A) and MBR(B) overlap in the y-direction, and the minimum x-coordinate of MBR(A) is greater than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of MBR(B).
- A is West of B: MBR(A) and MBR(B) overlap in the y-direction, and the maximum x-coordinate of MBR(A) is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of MBR(B).
- A is Northeast of B: The minimum x-coordinate of MBR(A) is greater than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of MBR(B), and the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(A) is greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(B).
- A is Northwest of B: The maximum x-coordinate of MBR(A) is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of MBR(B), and the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(A) is greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(B).
- A is Southeast of B: The minimum x-coordinate of MBR(A) is greater than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of MBR(B), and the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(A) is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(B).
- A is Southwest of B: The maximum x-coordinate of MBR(A) is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of MBR(B), and the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(A) is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(B).
- A is Bounding Box with B: MBR(A) and MBR(B) overlap both in the x-direction and y-direction.

Given:
- x is North of y: MBR(x) and MBR(y) overlap in the x-direction, and the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(x) is greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(y).
- y is South of z: MBR(y) and MBR(z) overlap in the x-direction, and the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(y) is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(z).

From these, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

The key observation is that MBR(x) and MBR(y) overlap in the x-direction, and MBR(y) and MBR(z) overlap in the x-direction. But this doesn't guarantee that MBR(x) and MBR(z) overlap in the x-direction. They might or might not.

Similarly, I know that the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(x) is greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(y), and the maximum y-coordinate of MBR(y) is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of MBR(z). But this doesn't uniquely define the relative y-coordinates of MBR(x) and MBR(z). MBR(x) might be above, below, or at the same level as MBR(z).

Given the nature of the given constraints, the relation between x and z could be any of the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest) or an overlap (Bounding Box), depending on the specific positions of the regions.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z could be any of: North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, or Bounding Box.

Let me check one more time...

So we're asking about the possible relations between x and z.

We know:
- x is North of y
- y is South of z

I'm going to use the mathematical definitions we've defined:

From "x is North of y":
- MBR(x) and MBR(y) overlap in the x-direction.
- min_y(MBR(x)) ≥ max_y(MBR(y)).

From "y is South of z":
- MBR(y) and MBR(z) overlap in the x-direction.
- max_y(MBR(y)) ≤ min_y(MBR(z)).

From these, we can deduce:
- min_y(MBR(x)) ≥ max_y(MBR(y)) ≤ min_y(MBR(z)).

But this doesn't give us a clear relation between min_y(MBR(x)) and min_y(MBR(z)) or between min_y(MBR(x)) and max_y(MBR(z)).

So, from the given constraints, we can't determine a unique cardinal direction relation between x and z. It could be any of the cardinal directions or an overlap.

Actually, let me just go with a clear example:

Suppose the coordinates of the MBRs are:
- MBR(y): (3, 3) to (7, 7)
- MBR(z): (3, 10) to (7, 14)
- MBR(x): (3, 8) to (7, 9)

In this case, x is North of y (min_y(MBR(x)) = 8 ≥ max_y(MBR(y)) = 7) and y is South of z (max_y(MBR(y)) = 7 ≤ min_y(MBR(z)) = 10).

But now, x is South of z (max_y(MBR(x)) = 9 ≤ min_y(MBR(z)) = 10).

However, if we change the coordinates of MBR(x) to (3, 15) to (7, 18), x would be North of z (min_y(MBR(x)) = 15 ≥ max_y(MBR(z)) = 14).

Similarly, by adjusting the x-coordinates of the MBRs, we can make x East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, or Southwest of z. And by having MBR(x) overlap with MBR(z), we can have the Bounding Box relation.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z could be any of: North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, or Bounding Box.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is South of region z

In cardinal direction reasoning, when we say "x is North of y," it means x is positioned above y. Similarly, "y is South of z" means y is positioned below z.

From these facts, we know:
- x is above y
- z is above y

However, this doesn't give us a fixed relationship between x and z. Depending on their exact positions, x and z could have any of these relations:

- North: If x is positioned above z
- South: If x is positioned below z (but still above y)
- East: If x is to the right of z
- West: If x is to the left of z
- Northeast: If x is above and to the right of z
- Northwest: If x is above and to the left of z
- Southeast: If x is below and to the right of z (but still above y)
- Southwest: If x is below and to the left of z (but still above y)
- Bounding Box: If x and z overlap

Therefore, all possible cardinal direction relations could exist between region x and region z.
