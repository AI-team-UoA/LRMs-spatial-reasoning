PROMPT: Let  Northwest and  South be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is  South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step-by-step:

We have the following given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

Let's think about what these mean in terms of coordinates:

1. If x is Northwest of y, then x is both to the north and to the west of y. In other words, x is in the top-left quadrant relative to y.

2. If y is South of z, then y is directly below z. In other words, z is directly above y.

Now we need to determine the possible relations between x and z based on these constraints.

Let's consider a coordinate system where:
- North means increasing y-coordinate
- East means increasing x-coordinate

So:
- Northwest means decreasing x-coordinate and increasing y-coordinate
- South means decreasing y-coordinate (with no change in x-coordinate)

If region x is Northwest of region y, then:
- x's x-coordinate < y's x-coordinate
- x's y-coordinate > y's y-coordinate

If region y is South of region z, then:
- y's x-coordinate = z's x-coordinate
- y's y-coordinate < z's y-coordinate

From these, we can deduce:
- x's x-coordinate < y's x-coordinate = z's x-coordinate
  (So x is West of z)
- For the y-coordinates, we know x's y-coordinate > y's y-coordinate and y's y-coordinate < z's y-coordinate
  But this doesn't give us a definitive relation between x's y-coordinate and z's y-coordinate.

If x's y-coordinate < z's y-coordinate, then x is Southwest of z.
If x's y-coordinate = z's y-coordinate, then x is West of z.
If x's y-coordinate > z's y-coordinate, then x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Let me double-check by thinking about the relative positions in a different way:

If x is Northwest of y and y is South of z, then z is directly above y, while x is to the top-left of y.

To visualize:

Z
|
Y
/ \
X   

(This is a very crude diagram, but X is to the bottom-left of Y, and Z is above Y)

From this perspective, x can be:
- Northwest of z (if x is far enough to the northwest of y that it's still northwest of z)
- West of z (if x is more west than northwest of y, such that it's directly west of z)
- Southwest of z (if x is so far west and only slightly north of y that it ends up southwest of z)

So, my answer still stands: The possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Hmm, let me double-check this because I'm not sure. I think I need to be more careful with the coordinates.

Let's establish a basic coordinate system, where:
- North means increasing y-coordinate
- East means increasing x-coordinate

If region x is Northwest of region y, then:
- x is to the west and north of y
- x.x < y.x
- x.y > y.y

If region y is South of region z, then:
- y is to the south of z
- y.x = z.x
- y.y < z.y

From these, we can deduce:
- x.x < y.x = z.x, so x is to the west of z
- x.y > y.y and y.y < z.y, but we can't directly compare x.y and z.y

Actually, let's think about the possible configurations in a different way.

Given:
- x is Northwest of y
- y is South of z

So, z is North of y, which means z is directly above y.

Now, if x is Northwest of y, x is in the top-left quadrant relative to y.

The relationship between x and z depends on how far North and how far West x is from y, relative to how far North z is from y.

If x is significantly North of y (more than the distance between y and z) and not too far West, then x would be Northwest of z.

If x is only slightly North of y (less than the distance between y and z) and significantly West, then x would be Southwest of z.

If x is at the same latitude as z (i.e., the same y-coordinate) and West of y (and hence West of z), then x would be West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Let's just double-check with a concrete example. 

Imagine a simple grid system:

(0,2) --- (1,2) --- (2,2)
  |         |         |
(0,1) --- (1,1) --- (2,1)
  |         |         |
(0,0) --- (1,0) --- (2,0)

Let's say z is at (1,2) and y is at (1,1) (so y is South of z).

Now, x could be at:
- (0,2): This would make x West of z.
- (0,1): This would make x Southwest of z.
- (0,0): This would make x Southwest of z.

But wait, if x is Northwest of y, then x should be in the top-left quadrant relative to y. So, x could be at (0,2).

Actually, I need to think about this more carefully.

If y is at (1,1) and z is at (1,2), then x being Northwest of y means x could be at:
- (0,2): This would make x West of z.

This doesn't seem to cover all the possibilities. Let me try a slightly different approach.

Let's use a more general representation:

- y is at position (y_x, y_y)
- z is at position (z_x, z_y)
- x is at position (x_x, x_y)

Given:
- x is Northwest of y, so x_x < y_x and x_y > y_y
- y is South of z, so y_x = z_x and y_y < z_y

From these, we know:
- x_x < y_x = z_x, so x is West of z.
- x_y > y_y and y_y < z_y, but we need to compare x_y and z_y to determine the North-South relationship between x and z.

If x_y > z_y, then x is North of z, making the relation Northwest.
If x_y = z_y, then x is at the same latitude as z, making the relation West.
If x_y < z_y, then x is South of z, making the relation Southwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Actually, let's use concrete coordinates to check this.

If y is at (0, 0):

1. If z is at (0, 1) (directly North of y):
   - x being Northwest of y means x is at (x_x, x_y) where x_x < 0 and x_y > 0.
   - For x to be Northwest of z, we need x_x < 0 and x_y > 1.
   - For x to be West of z, we need x_x < 0 and x_y = 1.
   - For x to be Southwest of z, we need x_x < 0 and x_y < 1.

   Given that x_y > 0 (because x is Northwest of y), if x_y < 1, then x would indeed be Southwest of z.

So, from this concrete example, it seems that x can be Northwest, West, or Southwest of z, confirming our earlier deduction.

To further convince myself, let's draw the cardinal directions:

```
NW   N   NE
 \   |   /
  \  |  /
   \ | /
W----+----E
   / | \
  /  |  \
 /   |   \
SW   S   SE
```

If y is at the center (+), and z is to the North (N) of y, then x is to the Northwest (NW) of y.

Now, the position of x relative to z depends on how far North and how far West x is from y.

If x is significantly North of y (more than the distance between y and z) and not too far West, then x would be Northwest of z.

If x is only slightly North of y (less than the distance between y and z) and significantly West, then x would be Southwest of z.

If x is at the same latitude as z (i.e., the same distance North from y as z is) and West of y (and hence West of z), then x would be West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Let me just be super careful one last time. I need to pay attention to the fact that we're looking at regions, not points, so the cardinal direction relations have specific definitions.

Let's use the standard definitions for cardinal direction relations between regions:

1. Region A is North of Region B if every point in A is above the northernmost point in B.
2. Region A is Northwest of Region B if every point in A is both to the left of the leftmost point in B and above the northernmost point in B.
3. And so on for the other cardinal directions.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

Using the definitions:
- Every point in x is both to the left and above some point in y.
- Every point in y is below some point in z.

From these, we can deduce:
- Every point in x is to the left of some point in y, which means x is to the west of z as well.
- We can't make a direct deduction about the North-South relationship between x and z because it depends on the relative positions.

If the northernmost point of x is above the southernmost point of z, then x could be Northwest of z.
If the northernmost point of x is at the same level as the southernmost point of z, then x could be West of z.
If the northernmost point of x is below the southernmost point of z, then x could be Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Actually I think I'm overthinking. Let's stick to the standard definitions you gave and just think about the possible relations.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y (x is both to the left and above y)
- Region y is South of region z (y is directly below z)

In terms of the x-coordinate (East-West position):
- x is to the left of y (x.x < y.x)
- y is at the same x-coordinate as z (y.x = z.x)
- Therefore, x is to the left of z (x.x < z.x)

In terms of the y-coordinate (North-South position):
- x is above y (x.y > y.y)
- y is below z (y.y < z.y)
- The relationship between x.y and z.y is not determined.

If x.y > z.y, then x is above z, making the relation Northwest.
If x.y = z.y, then x is at the same y-coordinate as z, making the relation West.
If x.y < z.y, then x is below z, making the relation Southwest.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

I think this is the correct answer. Northwest, West, and Southwest are the possible relations between region x and region z.

But I'm still not 100% convinced, mainly because the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let's use a more visual approach.

Imagine we have a map with regions x, y, and z. If y is South of z, then z is directly above y. If x is Northwest of y, then x is in the top-left quadrant relative to y.

Here's a simple visualization:

```
    z
    |
    |
x---y
```

In this diagram, x is Northwest of y, and y is South of z. Looking at the relation between x and z, it seems like x could be:
- West of z (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- Southwest of z (if x is below z)
- Northwest of z (if x is above z)

I think the answer stands: Northwest, West, and Southwest are the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let me visualize it one more time to make sure. I'll use a coordinate system where North is towards the top, East is towards the right, etc.

First, let me try to establish a concrete example:

Let's say:
- Region y is at position (0, 0).
- Region z is at position (0, 1) (directly North of y).
- Region x is at position (-1, 1) (Northwest of y).

In this case, x is to the West of z.

Let's try another position for x:
- Region x is at position (-1, 2) (still Northwest of y).

In this case, x is to the Northwest of z.

And one more:
- Region x is at position (-1, 0.5) (still Northwest of y).

In this case, x is to the Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

I'm now convinced that this is the correct answer.

Actually, I think I should be a bit more careful about defining the cardinal direction relations. Let me use the most standard definitions:

For points:
- A is North of B if A is directly above B (same x-coordinate, larger y-coordinate).
- A is Northwest of B if A is both to the left and above B (smaller x-coordinate, larger y-coordinate).
- Similarly for other cardinal directions.

For regions (using the minimum bounding rectangle):
- Region A is North of Region B if the lowest point in A is above the highest point in B.
- Region A is Northwest of Region B if the easternmost point of A is to the left of the westernmost point of B AND the lowest point in A is above the highest point in B.
- Similarly for other cardinal directions.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

Using the definitions for regions:
- The easternmost point of x is to the left of the westernmost point of y AND the lowest point in x is above the highest point in y.
- The highest point in y is below the lowest point in z.

From these, we can deduce:
- The easternmost point of x is to the left of the westernmost point of y, which is to the left of or the same as the westernmost point of z. So, the easternmost point of x is to the left of the westernmost point of z.
- The lowest point in x is above the highest point in y, but we can't make a direct comparison between the lowest point in x and the lowest point in z based on the given information.

For x to be Northwest of z, the lowest point in x must be above the highest point in z.
For x to be West of z, the easternmost point of x must be to the left of the westernmost point of z, and the regions must overlap in the North-South direction.
For x to be Southwest of z, the highest point in x must be below the lowest point in z.

Given the constraints, it seems that x can be:
- Northwest of z
- West of z
- Southwest of z

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Alright, I'm convinced that this answer is correct. So the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, I just had a nagging feeling that I'm missing something about the West relation. I think I'm conflating the cardinal direction relation "West" with a more general idea of being to the left.

Let me clarify the definitions once more:

- Region A is North of Region B if the southernmost point of A is north of the northernmost point of B.
- Region A is South of Region B if the northernmost point of A is south of the southernmost point of B.
- Region A is East of Region B if the westernmost point of A is east of the easternmost point of B.
- Region A is West of Region B if the easternmost point of A is west of the westernmost point of B.

- Region A is Northwest of Region B if the southernmost point of A is north of the northernmost point of B AND the easternmost point of A is west of the westernmost point of B.
- Similarly for the other combined cardinal directions.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

Using these definitions:
- The southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y AND the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y.
- The northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z.

From these, we can deduce:
- The easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y, which is the same as or to the left of the westernmost point of z. So, the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z.
- The southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y, which is south of the southernmost point of z. The relationship between the southernmost point of x and the southernmost point of z is not determined based on the given information.

If the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of z, then x is Northwest of z.
If the southernmost point of x is not north of the northernmost point of z AND the northernmost point of x is not south of the southernmost point of z, then x is West of z.
If the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, then x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

But let's double check with some specific configurations:

Let's consider the y-coordinate (North-South position) first:
- For x to be Northwest or West of y, the southernmost point of x must be north of the northernmost point of y.
- For y to be South of z, the northernmost point of y must be south of the southernmost point of z.

This means the northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z, and the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y.

So, we have: southernmost point of z > northernmost point of y > southernmost point of x.

But this doesn't tell us the relationship between the southernmost point of x and the northernmost point of z, which is crucial for determining if x is Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

If the southernmost point of x > northernmost point of z, then x is Northwest of z.
If the southernmost point of x < northernmost point of z AND northernmost point of x > southernmost point of z, then x is West of z.
If the northernmost point of x < southernmost point of z, then x is Southwest of z.

Given the constraints:
- southernmost point of z > northernmost point of y > southernmost point of x, we can't conclusively say which of the three relations is true for x and z without additional information.

Let's consider a concrete example:

Let's say:
- Region z spans from (0, 5) to (1, 6).
- Region y spans from (0, 3) to (1, 4).
- Region x spans from (1, 0) to (2, 2).

In this case, x is Northwest of y, and y is South of z. But x is Southwest of z.

Let's try another:

- Region z spans from (0, 5) to (1, 6).
- Region y spans from (0, 3) to (1, 4).
- Region x spans from (-2, 5.5) to (-1, 7).

In this case, x is Northwest of y, y is South of z, and x is Northwest of z.

And another:

- Region z spans from (0, 5) to (1, 6).
- Region y spans from (0, 3) to (1, 4).
- Region x spans from (-2, 4) to (-1, 5.5).

In this case, x is Northwest of y, y is South of z, and x is West of z.

These examples confirm that the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Hmm, wait. Let me be doubly sure about the West relation, because I think I'm getting confused about it. If x is west of z, then the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z. That means the regions are separated horizontally.

OK let me take a step back. Let's re-use the standard definitions from above.

- Region A is North of Region B if the southernmost point of A is north of the northernmost point of B.
- Region A is South of Region B if the northernmost point of A is south of the southernmost point of B.
- Region A is East of Region B if the westernmost point of A is east of the easternmost point of B.
- Region A is West of Region B if the easternmost point of A is west of the westernmost point of B.
- Region A is Northwest of Region B if A is both North of B and West of B.
- Region A is Southwest of Region B if A is both South of B and West of B.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y (x is both North of y and West of y)
- Region y is South of region z (y is South of z)

From these, we can deduce:
- Since x is West of y, the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y.
- Since y is South of z, the northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z.
- We also know that x is North of y, so the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y.

Given that the northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z, and the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y, we can say that:
southernmost point of z > northernmost point of y > southernmost point of x.

But, as we discussed earlier, this doesn't tell us the relationship between the southernmost point of x and the northernmost point of z, which is crucial for determining if x is Northwest, West, or Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z could be:
- Northwest (if the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of z)
- West (if x and z overlap in the North-South direction but are separate in the East-West direction)
- Southwest (if the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z)

The examples I gave earlier confirm these possibilities.

I'm still a bit uncertain about the West relation, so let me think it through once more.

For x to be West of z, the easternmost point of x must be west of the westernmost point of z, AND x and z must overlap in the North-South direction.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

We've established that the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z.

For x and z to overlap in the North-South direction:
- The northernmost point of x must be north of the southernmost point of z.
- The southernmost point of x must be south of the northernmost point of z.

Given the constraints, it's possible for x and z to overlap in the North-South direction. Hence, it's possible for x to be West of z.

Actually, ok let's use the compass direction definition that I had previously. I will repeat it here to clarify:

For regions:
- Region A is North of Region B if the lowest point in A is above the highest point in B.
- Region A is South of Region B if the highest point in A is below the lowest point in B.
- Region A is East of Region B if the leftmost point in A is to the right of the rightmost point in B.
- Region A is West of Region B if the rightmost point in A is to the left of the leftmost point in B.
- Region A is Northwest of Region B if A is both North of B and West of B.
- Region A is Southwest of Region B if A is both South of B and West of B.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y (x is both North of y and West of y)
- Region y is South of region z (y is South of z, which means y is below z)

From these, we know:
- x is to the left of y (the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y).
- x is above y (the lowest point in x is above the highest point in y).
- y is below z (the highest point in y is below the lowest point in z).

Now we want to determine the relationship between x and z.

For the East-West direction:
- Since x is to the left of y, and y is in the same East-West position as z (as we deduced from y being South of z), we can say that x is to the left of z. So, x is West of z in terms of the East-West position.

For the North-South direction:
- x is above y (the lowest point in x is above the highest point in y).
- y is below z (the highest point in y is below the lowest point in z).
- From these, we can't determine the exact North-South relationship between x and z. It could be:
  - x is above z (the lowest point in x is above the highest point in z).
  - x and z overlap in the North-South direction.
  - x is below z (the highest point in x is below the lowest point in z).

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest (if x is both to the left and above z).
- West (if x is to the left of z and they overlap in the North-South direction).
- Southwest (if x is both to the left and below z).

Given the constraints, these are the three possible relations between x and z.

Hmm wait, I think I misunderstood the definition of "West" again. Let me revise.

Hmm, I think I initially misunderstood the "West" relation again. Let me clarify.

For regions:
- Region A is North of Region B if the southernmost point of A is north of the northernmost point of B.
- Region A is South of Region B if the northernmost point of A is south of the southernmost point of B.
- Region A is East of Region B if the westernmost point of A is east of the easternmost point of B.
- Region A is West of Region B if the easternmost point of A is west of the westernmost point of B.
- Region A is Northwest of Region B if A is both North of B and West of B.
- Region A is Southwest of Region B if A is both South of B and West of B.

With these definitions, regions that are North, South, East, or West of each other don't overlap in the respective dimension.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y (x is both North of y and West of y)
- Region y is South of region z (y is South of z)

From these, we know:
- x is West of y, so the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y.
- x is North of y, so the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y.
- y is South of z, so the northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z.

For the East-West direction:
- Since x is West of y, the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y.
- We don't have direct information about the East-West relationship between y and z from the given information. But since y is South of z, they could overlap in the East-West direction or have a more specific relationship.

For the North-South direction:
- x is North of y, so the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y.
- y is South of z, so the northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z.
- From these, we can deduce that the southernmost point of z is north of the northernmost point of y, which is north of the southernmost point of x. But this doesn't tell us the relationship between the northernmost point of x and the southernmost point of z.

Hmm, let me try a more visual approach again.

If y is South of z, then z is directly above y. If x is Northwest of y, then x is to the top-left of y.

Here's a visualization:
```
    z
    |
    |
x---y
```

From this visualization, x could be:
- Northwest of z (if x is both to the left and above z).
- West of z (if x is to the left of z and at the same vertical position).
- Southwest of z (if x is to the left and below z).

But I'm not sure if this visualization is entirely accurate for the relations I've defined. Let me try with more precise coordinates.

Let me be very precise about the definitions:

- If y is South of z, then the northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z. This means there's no overlap in the North-South direction.
- If x is Northwest of y, then the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y (no overlap in the East-West direction) AND the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y (no overlap in the North-South direction).

So, let's imagine some regions with their coordinates (representing the bounding rectangles):

- Region z: [west: 0, east: 1, south: 5, north: 6]
- Region y: [west: 0, east: 1, south: 3, north: 4]
- Region x: [west: -2, east: -1, south: 4.5, north: 5.5]

In this case, x is Northwest of y, and y is South of z. And x is Northwest of z.

Let's try another:

- Region z: [west: 0, east: 1, south: 5, north: 6]
- Region y: [west: 0, east: 1, south: 3, north: 4]
- Region x: [west: -2, east: -1, south: 3.5, north: 4.5]

In this case, x is Northwest of y, y is South of z, and x is West of z.

And another:

- Region z: [west: 0, east: 1, south: 5, north: 6]
- Region y: [west: 0, east: 1, south: 3, north: 4]
- Region x: [west: -2, east: -1, south: 2.5, north: 3.5]

In this case, x is Northwest of y, y is South of z, and x is Southwest of z.

Given these examples, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Let's double check...

OK, I think I finally got it. If region y is South of region z, then the northernmost point of region y is south of the southernmost point of region z. If region x is Northwest of region y, then the easternmost point of region x is west of the westernmost point of region y, AND the southernmost point of region x is north of the northernmost point of region y.

Given that the northernmost point of region y is south of the southernmost point of region z, and the southernmost point of region x is north of the northernmost point of region y, then 
southernmost point of z > northernmost point of y > southernmost point of x.

But this doesn't tell us the specific relationship between region x and region z. It's possible for:
- Region x to be Northwest of region z (if the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of z).
- Region x to be West of region z (if the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z, and there's an overlap in the North-South direction).
- Region x to be Southwest of region z (if the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z).

Let's visualize with coordinates:

If region z is at (0, 0) to (1, 1), and region y is at (0, -2) to (1, -1), then region y is South of region z.

If region x is at (-2, -0.5) to (-1, 0.5), then region x is Northwest of region y.

In this scenario, region x is West of region z (as they are at the same vertical level but x is to the left).

If region x is at (-2, 0.5) to (-1, 1.5), then region x is Northwest of region y and also Northwest of region z.

If region x is at (-2, -1.5) to (-1, -0.5), then region x is Northwest of region y but Southwest of region z.

These examples confirm that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Actually, wait, I think I'm being too pedantic. Let me take a step back and ensure that the definitions are correct.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, it's common to define the relations as follows:

- Region A is North of Region B if all points in A are north of all points in B.
- Region A is South of Region B if all points in A are south of all points in B.
- Region A is East of Region B if all points in A are east of all points in B.
- Region A is West of Region B if all points in A are west of all points in B.
- Region A is Northwest of Region B if all points in A are northwest of all points in B (i.e., both north and west).
- Similarly for the other combined cardinal directions.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y (all points in x are both north and west of all points in y).
- Region y is South of region z (all points in y are south of all points in z).

From these, we know:
- All points in x are west of all points in y.
- All points in x are north of all points in y.
- All points in y are south of all points in z.

For the East-West direction:
- All points in x are west of all points in y.
- Region y can be at any East-West position relative to region z, as long as all points in y are south of all points in z.

If region y is directly below region z (i.e., they have the same East-West coordinates), then all points in x would be west of all points in z.

For the North-South direction:
- All points in x are north of all points in y.
- All points in y are south of all points in z.
- This doesn't tell us the direct North-South relationship between x and z.

If all points in x are north of all points in z, then x would be Northwest of z.
If some points in x are at the same North-South level as points in z, but all points in x are west of all points in z, then x would be West of z.
If all points in x are south of all points in z, but all points in x are west of all points in z, then x would be Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Actually, we can also think of it using a different definition (which is what I tried to use earlier): the 9-intersection model, where regions are replaced with their minimum bounding rectangles, and the cardinal directions are defined based on the relative positions of these rectangles.

OK let's be as clear as possible. 

In the context of cardinal direction relations between regions, the common practice is to replace regions with their minimum bounding rectangles and then define the cardinal directions based on the relative positions of these rectangles.

For two rectangles A and B:
- A is North of B if the southernmost point of A is north of the northernmost point of B.
- A is South of B if the northernmost point of A is south of the southernmost point of B.
- A is East of B if the westernmost point of A is east of the easternmost point of B.
- A is West of B if the easternmost point of A is west of the westernmost point of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North of B and West of B.
- Similarly for the other combined cardinal directions.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

From these, we know:
- The easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y.
- The southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y.
- The northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z.

For the East-West direction:
- The easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y.
- We don't have direct information about the East-West relationship between y and z. However, for y to be directly South of z, they should have the same East-West coordinates (or at least overlap).

If y and z have the same East-West coordinates, then the easternmost point of x would be west of the westernmost point of z, making x West of z in the East-West direction.

For the North-South direction:
- The southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y.
- The northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z.
- From these, we can't determine the exact North-South relationship between x and z.

If the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of z, then x would be North of z in the North-South direction.
If the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, then x would be South of z in the North-South direction.
If neither of the above is true, then x and z would overlap in the North-South direction.

Combining the East-West and North-South relationships:
- If x is West of z in the East-West direction and North of z in the North-South direction, then x is Northwest of z.
- If x is West of z in the East-West direction and overlaps with z in the North-South direction, then x is West of z.
- If x is West of z in the East-West direction and South of z in the North-South direction, then x is Southwest of z.

Given the constraints, these are the three possible relations between x and z.

I'm confident that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

I think this is the right answer, but what if the "South" relation doesn't necessarily mean "directly South"? Let's double-check to ensure that our understanding is correct.

In the context of cardinal direction relations, "South" means all points in one region are south of all points in the other region, not necessarily "directly South." The same goes for the other cardinal directions.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y (all points in x are both north and west of all points in y).
- Region y is South of region z (all points in y are south of all points in z).

From these, we know:
- All points in x are west of all points in y.
- All points in x are north of all points in y.
- All points in y are south of all points in z.

For the East-West direction:
- All points in x are west of all points in y.
- If y is "directly South" of z, then y and z would have the same East-West position. In this case, all points in x would be west of all points in z.
- If y is not "directly South" but just "South" of z, then y could be in any East-West position relative to z as long as all points in y are south of all points in z. In this case, the East-West relationship between x and z would be less constrained.

For the North-South direction:
- All points in x are north of all points in y.
- All points in y are south of all points in z.
- From these, we can deduce that the southernmost point of z is north of the northernmost point of y, which is north of the southernmost point of x. But this doesn't tell us the relationship between the northernmost point of x and the southernmost point of z.

Looking back, I think I was confused about the semantics of how "South" is defined in the context of cardinal direction relations. Is it "all points in one region are south of all points in the other," or is it "the centroid of one region is south of the centroid of the other"? I think the former is more common in GIS and the latter in everyday usage, so I'm going to use the former.

Let's clarify:

If "South" means "all points in one region are south of all points in the other," then:
- Region y is South of region z (all points in y are south of all points in z).
- The East-West relationship between y and z is not constrained by the "South" relation. Y could be directly below z or have a different East-West position.

If y could have any East-West position relative to z (as long as all points in y are south of all points in z), then the East-West relationship between x and z becomes less clear.

OK, let's be as meticulous and careful as possible. I'll define the cardinal direction relations:

- A is North of B if the southernmost point of A is north of the northernmost point of B.
- A is South of B if the northernmost point of A is south of the southernmost point of B.
- A is East of B if the westernmost point of A is east of the easternmost point of B.
- A is West of B if the easternmost point of A is west of the westernmost point of B.
- A is Northwest of B if A is both North of B and West of B.
- A is Southwest of B if A is both South of B and West of B.
- ... and so on for the other combined cardinal directions.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

From these, we know:
- The easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of y (since x is West of y).
- The southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y (since x is North of y).
- The northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z (since y is South of z).

For the East-West relationship between y and z:
- The "South" relation doesn't constrain the East-West relationship, so y and z could overlap in the East-West dimension (i.e., have the same or overlapping X-coordinates).
- If y and z overlap in the East-West dimension (which is the assumption we've been using), then the easternmost point of x is west of the westernmost point of z (derived from the easternmost point of x being west of the westernmost point of y, and y and z having overlapping X-coordinates).

For the North-South relationship between x and z:
- The southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of y (since x is North of y).
- The northernmost point of y is south of the southernmost point of z (since y is South of z).
- This chain doesn't definitively determine the North-South relationship between x and z.

Considering all possible scenarios:
- If the southernmost point of x is north of the northernmost point of z, then x is North of z.
- If the northernmost point of x is south of the southernmost point of z, then x is South of z.
- If neither of the above is true, then x and z overlap in the North-South dimension.

Combining the East-West and North-South relationships:
- If x is West of z (which we've established) and North of z, then x is Northwest of z.
- If x is West of z and overlaps with z in the North-South dimension, then x is West of z.
- If x is West of z and South of z, then x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Wait wait wait. I think I've been complicating things way too much. The problem is straightforward. Since the problem is for possible answer, I just need to examine all the possibilities. One more time.

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the Northwest relation between x and y, we know that x is both to the north and west of y.
From the South relation between y and z, we know that y is to the south of z.

For the East-West direction:
- x is to the west of y.
- The East-West relation between y and z is not specified in the problem.
- If y is west of z or has the same East-West position as z, then x would also be west of z.
- If y is east of z, then the East-West relation between x and z becomes more complex.

For the North-South direction:
- x is to the north of y.
- y is to the south of z.
- Comparing x and z in the North-South direction, there are three possibilities:
  - x is to the north of z (if x is far enough to the north).
  - x is to the south of z (if x is not far enough to the north).
  - x is at the same North-South position as z.

Combining the East-West and North-South possibilities, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is to the north and west of z).
- North (if x is to the north of z and has the same East-West position).
- Northeast (if x is to the north and east of z).
- West (if x is to the west of z and has the same North-South position).
- East (if x is to the east of z and has the same North-South position).
- Southwest (if x is to the south and west of z).
- South (if x is to the south of z and has the same East-West position).
- Southeast (if x is to the south and east of z).
- Bounding Box (if x and z have the same North-South and East-West positions, i.e., they are the same region).

Hmm, on second thought. Actually, let's be clear. In standard cardinal direction relations, "South" does not just mean "at a lower latitude." It means "directly below," without any East-West displacement. Similarly, "Northwest" means "diagonally at the top-left," not just "at a higher latitude and lower longitude."

Given:
- Region x is Northwest of region y.
- Region y is South of region z.

Using the standard interpretations of cardinal directions:

For the East-West direction:
- x is to the west of y.
- y has the same East-West position as z (since y is directly south of z).
- Therefore, x is to the west of z.

For the North-South direction:
- x is to the north of y.
- y is to the south of z.
- Comparing x and z in the North-South direction, there are three possibilities:
  - x is to the north of z (if x is far enough to the north).
  - x is at the same North-South position as z.
  - x is to the south of z (if x is not far enough to the north).

Combining the East-West and North-South possibilities, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is to the north and west of z).
- West (if x is to the west of z and has the same North-South position).
- Southwest (if x is to the south and west of z).

Let me check with a concrete example. Let's imagine:

- Region z is at position (0, 2).
- Region y is at position (0, 0).
- Region x is at position (-2, 1).

In this scenario, x is Northwest of y, and y is South of z. Looking at the relation between x and z, x is to the west of z and at a lower latitude, making it Southwest of z.

Let's try another:

- Region z is at position (0, 2).
- Region y is at position (0, 0).
- Region x is at position (-2, 3).

In this case, x is Northwest of y, y is South of z, and x is Northwest of z.

And one more:

- Region z is at position (0, 2).
- Region y is at position (0, 0).
- Region x is at position (-2, 2).

Here, x is Northwest of y, y is South of z, and x is West of z.

These examples confirm that the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, I need to clarify this problem. Reading the problem again, it's asking me to identify the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z. Given the constraints:

- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

The answer should be the set of all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, given the constraints. The precise cardinal direction relations depend on the exact positions of the regions, which aren't specified. So I need to enumerate all possible cardinal directions that x and z could have.

From the constraints, what we know is:
- x is Northwest of y.
- y is South of z.

From the Northwest relation between x and y, we know that x is both to the north and west of y. From the South relation between y and z, we know that y is directly below z. From these, we can infer:
- x is to the west of z.
- The North-South relationship between x and z is not uniquely determined.

Given that x is to the west of z, and considering all possible North-South relationships:
- x can be Northwest of z (if x is also to the north of z).
- x can be West of z (if x is at the same latitude as z).
- x can be Southwest of z (if x is to the south of z).

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

I'm confident that this is the correct answer.

And to be triple sure:

If region x is Northwest of region y and region y is South of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

- North: This is not possible because we know x is west of z.
- Northeast: This is not possible because we know x is west of z.
- East: This is not possible because we know x is west of z.
- Southeast: This is not possible because we know x is west of z.
- South: This is not possible because we know x is west of z.
- Southwest: This is possible if x is west of z and south of z.
- West: This is possible if x is west of z and at the same latitude as z.
- Northwest: This is possible if x is west of z and north of z.
- Bounding Box: This is not possible because we know x is west of z.

So out of the options, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:
- Region x is Northwest of region y
- Region y is South of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's analyze this step by step:

From "x is Northwest of y":
- x is both north and west of y

From "y is South of z":
- y is directly below z (which means z is directly north of y)

Since y is directly south of z, they have the same east-west positioning.

Combining these facts:
- x is west of y, and y has the same east-west position as z, so x must be west of z
- For the north-south relationship, there are three possibilities:
  1. If x is far enough north, it could be north of z (Northwest relation)
  2. If x is at the same latitude as z, it would be directly west (West relation)
  3. If x isn't far enough north, it could be south of z (Southwest relation)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest
