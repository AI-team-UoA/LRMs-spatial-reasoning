PROMPT: Let  West and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  West of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's denote the cardinal direction relations: 
- West (W)
- North (N)
- East (E)
- South (S)
- Northeast (NE)
- Northwest (NW)
- Southeast (SE)
- Southwest (SW)
- Bounding Box (BB)

We know:
- x is West of y
- y is North of z

Now let's think about the possible relation between x and z.

Let's consider coordinate positions. Let's say:
- y is at position (0, 0)
- x is to the West of y, so x could be at (-a, 0) where a > 0
- z is to the South of y, so z could be at (0, -b) where b > 0

Now we need to determine the relation between x and z, which are at positions (-a, 0) and (0, -b) respectively.

To determine the cardinal direction of z from x:
- z is to the right of x (East direction), because z's x-coordinate (0) is greater than x's x-coordinate (-a)
- z is below x (South direction), because z's y-coordinate (-b) is less than x's y-coordinate (0)

When combining East and South, we get Southeast (SE).

However, let's verify this by checking different possible positions of x, y, and z within their constraints:

1. If y is at (0, 0), x could be at (-1, 0) and z could be at (0, -1). Then z is Southeast of x.
2. If y is at (0, 0), x could be at (-1, 0) and z could be at (0, -2). Again, z is Southeast of x.

Wait, let me reconsider this. The problem statement says "x is West of y" and "y is North of z". These are cardinal directions, so:

- If x is West of y, then x is directly to the left of y on the same horizontal line.
- If y is North of z, then y is directly above z on the same vertical line.

Given these constraints:
- If y is at (0, 0)
- x is at (-a, 0) where a > 0
- z is at (0, -b) where b > 0

So the position of x is (-a, 0) and the position of z is (0, -b).

The relative position of z from x is:
- z is to the right of x (East direction)
- z is below x (South direction)

Combining these, z is to the Southeast of x, or equivalently, x is to the Northwest of z.

But actually, I need to consider that cardinal direction relations can have some variations. Let me reconsider.

Given:
- x is West of y
- y is North of z

Let's denote the positions with coordinates:
- y can be at (0, 0)
- If x is West of y, x can be anywhere in the region to the left of y, so x can be at (-a, c) where a > 0 and c can be any value.
- If y is North of z, z can be anywhere in the region below y, so z can be at (d, -b) where b > 0 and d can be any value.

So now we have:
- x at (-a, c)
- z at (d, -b)

The relation between x and z depends on the specific values of a, b, c, and d:

- If d > -a and c > -b, then x is Northwest of z.
- If d < -a and c > -b, then x is Northeast of z.
- If d > -a and c < -b, then x is Southwest of z.
- If d < -a and c < -b, then x is Southeast of z.
- If d = -a and c > -b, then x is directly North of z.
- If d = -a and c < -b, then x is directly South of z.
- If d > -a and c = -b, then x is directly West of z.
- If d < -a and c = -b, then x is directly East of z.

Wait, I think I'm over-complicating this. Let's go back to the basic definitions.

If we're considering idealized regions (like points or squares), then:
- If x is West of y, then the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y, and the y-coordinates are the same.
- If y is North of z, then the y-coordinate of y is greater than the y-coordinate of z, and the x-coordinates are the same.

So, if y is at (0, 0), then x is at (-a, 0) and z is at (0, -b) for some positive a and b.

The relation between x and z is determined by comparing their coordinates:
- The x-coordinate of x (-a) is less than the x-coordinate of z (0), so x is to the West of z in the x-direction.
- The y-coordinate of x (0) is greater than the y-coordinate of z (-b), so x is to the North of z in the y-direction.

Combining these, x is to the Northwest of z.

Actually, wait, I don't think I'm getting this right still. Let me take a step back.

If x is West of y, then the entire region x is to the left of the entire region y. And if y is North of z, then the entire region y is above the entire region z.

Given these constraints, where could region x be in relation to region z?

Let's consider a simplified case where the regions are rectangles.

If:
- Region y is at the center.
- Region x is to the left of y (West).
- Region z is below y (South of y, which means y is North of z).

Then region x can be:
- Directly to the left of z (West of z).
- Above and to the left of z (Northwest of z).
- Below and to the left of z (Southwest of z).

It depends on the exact positions and sizes of the regions.

Actually, let me use a different approach. Since regions have size, I'll try to analyze this in terms of the possible positions of points within the regions.

Let's denote points in the regions:
- For any point p in region x, p is West of all points in region y.
- For any point q in region y, q is North of all points in region z.

Given a point p in region x and a point r in region z, what can we say about the relation between p and r?

We know:
- p is West of all points in y.
- All points in y are North of r.

But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between p and r. 

Let me try this with specific examples. 

Imagine:
- Region y is a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (0, 0) and top-right at (1, 1).
- Region x is another unit square, west of y, with its bottom-left corner at (-2, 0) and top-right at (-1, 1).
- Region z is another unit square, south of y, with its bottom-left corner at (0, -2) and top-right at (1, -1).

Given these positions:
- Points in x are at coordinates (-2 to -1, 0 to 1).
- Points in z are at coordinates (0 to 1, -2 to -1).

For any point p in x and any point r in z:
- p's x-coordinate (-2 to -1) is less than r's x-coordinate (0 to 1), so p is West of r in the x-direction.
- p's y-coordinate (0 to 1) is greater than r's y-coordinate (-2 to -1), so p is North of r in the y-direction.

Combining these, p is Northwest of r, which means region x is Northwest of region z.

But now, let's see if there are other possible configurations.

What if region z extends to the west? For instance, imagine:
- Region y is a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (0, 0) and top-right at (1, 1).
- Region x is another unit square, west of y, with its bottom-left corner at (-2, 0) and top-right at (-1, 1).
- Region z is a rectangular region, south of y, with its bottom-left corner at (-3, -2) and top-right at (1, -1).

Now, for points in x (-2 to -1, 0 to 1) and points in z (-3 to 1, -2 to -1):
- Some points in x have x-coordinates (-2 to -1) that are greater than some points in z (-3 to -2), which means x is not strictly West of z; it's West of some parts and East of others.
- All points in x have y-coordinates (0 to 1) greater than all points in z (-2 to -1), so x is North of z in the y-direction.

This suggests that in this configuration, region x can be North of region z.

Let's try another:
- Region y is a unit square with its bottom-left corner at (0, 0) and top-right at (1, 1).
- Region x is another unit square, west of y, with its bottom-left corner at (-2, 0) and top-right at (-1, 1).
- Region z is a rectangular region, south of y, with its bottom-left corner at (-1, -2) and top-right at (1, -1).

For points in x (-2 to -1, 0 to 1) and points in z (-1 to 1, -2 to -1):
- All points in x have x-coordinates (-2 to -1) less than or equal to the x-coordinates of some points in z (-1 to 1), which means x can be West of z or overlap with z in the x-direction.
- All points in x have y-coordinates (0 to 1) greater than all points in z (-2 to -1), so x is North of z in the y-direction.

So, region x can be Northwest or North of region z in this case.

I think I understand the possible relations now. Given the constraints, region x can be:

1. Northwest of region z (if x is strictly to the left of z).
2. North of region z (if x and z overlap in the x-direction).
3. West of region z (if x and z overlap in the y-direction).
4. Bounding Box of region z (if x and z overlap in both x and y directions).

Let me review the last possibility again. Actually, for the "Bounding Box" relation, one region would need to fully contain the other. Given the constraints (x is West of y and y is North of z), it's not possible for x to fully contain z or vice versa. So the Bounding Box relation isn't possible here.

So, given the constraints (x is West of y and y is North of z), the possible relations between region x and region z are:

1. Northwest
2. North
3. West
4. Bounding Box (let me double check if this is possible)

Actually, to double check the bounding box, let's see if it's possible for x to contain z or vice versa.

For x to contain z:
- x would need to extend both to the east of y and to the south of y. But since x is West of y, it can't extend to the east of y. So x can't contain z.

For z to contain x:
- z would need to extend both to the west of y and to the north of y. But since z is South of y, it can't extend to the north of y. So z can't contain x.

So, a Bounding Box relation between x and z isn't possible given the constraints.

I think I'm also doubting the possibility of the "West" relation. Let's check:
- For x to be West of z, all points in x would need to be strictly to the left of all points in z.
- But given that y is North of z, z is below y. 
- And given that x is West of y, x is to the left of y.

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me start fresh and consider the spatial relationships more clearly.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

Let's visualize this spatially, considering the simplest possible cases first.

The constraint "x is West of y" means that x is entirely to the left of y. The constraint "y is North of z" means that y is entirely above z.

So, x is to the left of y, and z is below y. Now, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

In the simplest configuration (where x, y, and z are adjacent), x would be to the left and above z, which means x is Northwest of z.

But what if the regions aren't adjacent or have different sizes?

Consider the following cases:

1. **x and z don't overlap in the x-direction and y-direction**:
   - In this case, x is to the left of z (in the x-direction) and above z (in the y-direction), so x is Northwest of z.

2. **x and z overlap in the x-direction but not in the y-direction**:
   - If x extends to the right into the same x-coordinates as z, then x is still above z but partially overlaps it in the x-direction. In this case, x is North of z.

3. **x and z overlap in the y-direction but not in the x-direction**:
   - If z extends upwards into the same y-coordinates as x, then x is still to the left of z but partially overlaps it in the y-direction. In this case, x is West of z.

4. **x and z overlap in both the x-direction and y-direction**:
   - This would mean that x and z share some space, which isn't a standard cardinal direction. It might be considered as "x and z intersect" or something similar. But given that "Bounding Box" is listed as a possible answer, we should check if this is what it refers to.

Actually, the "Bounding Box" relation typically means that one region is a bounding box of another, i.e., one region fully contains the other. Given the constraints, as I checked earlier, it's not possible for x to contain z or vice versa. So, the Bounding Box relation isn't a valid possibility here.

Let's also check if I missed any other possible standard cardinal direction relationship:

- **Northeast**: This would mean x is to the right and above z. But given that x is West of y and y is to the left of z, x can't be to the right of z. So, x can't be Northeast of z.

- **Southeast**: This would mean x is to the right and below z. But given that x is West of y (so x is to the left of y) and y is North of z (so y is above z), x is to the left of z and can be either above, at the same level, or below z in the y-direction. If x is below z in the y-direction, then x would be Southwest of z, not Southeast. So, x can't be Southeast of z.

- **South**: This would mean x is directly below z (same x-coordinates but lower y-coordinates). But given that x is West of y, x has lower x-coordinates than y. And given that y is North of z, z has lower y-coordinates than y. So, x has lower x-coordinates than y, and z has lower y-coordinates than y. This doesn't constrain the y-coordinates of x in relation to z. If x's y-coordinates are lower than z's, then x would be Southwest of z, not South. So, x can't be South of z.

Hmm, wait I think I'm making an error when considering the "South" relationship. Let me re-evaluate.

Actually, wait I think I can simplify this. Let me consider a diagram.

When we say:
- Region x is West of region y: This means x is to the left of y in the east-west axis.
- Region y is North of region z: This means y is above z in the north-south axis.

```
 x | y
---|---
   | z
```

In this simple diagram, x is West of y and y is North of z. Looking at the relation between x and z, x is to the left and at the same level as z, which would make x Northwest of z. But this is just one possible configuration.

What if z extends to the left?

```
 x | y
---|---
 z | z
```

Now, x is directly above a part of z, which would make x North of z.

What if x extends downward?

```
 x | y
---|---
 x | z
```

In this case, x is directly to the left of z, which would make x West of z.

What if both x extends downward and z extends to the left?

```
 x | y
---|---
 x/z| z
```

Here, x and z overlap or share a region. This isn't a standard cardinal direction but might be considered as an "Intersection".

Actually, this could also be represented as a different kind of diagram:

```
   |
 x | y
---|---
 x/z| z
   |
```

In the upper-left, region x is northwest of region z. In the upper-right, there's no direct relationship (it's the position of region y). In the lower-left, regions x and z share a region or intersect. In the lower-right, region z is southeast of region x.

Given that regions x and z can overlap as shown, the possible relations between them, in the context of standard cardinal directions, could be:

1. **Northwest** (if x is entirely to the left and above z).
2. **North** (if x is entirely above z but overlaps with z in the east-west axis).
3. **West** (if x is entirely to the left of z but overlaps with z in the north-south axis).
4. **Overlap or Intersection** (if x and z share a region).

Out of these, the first three are standard cardinal directions, and the fourth isn't. But again, if "Bounding Box" is listed as a possible answer and refers to an overlap, then it's a valid possibility. Otherwise, given the constraints, the Bounding Box relation (where one region fully contains the other) isn't possible.

Let me re-check the other cardinal directions to ensure I haven't missed any.

For x to be **Northeast** of z, x would need to be to the right and above z. Given that x is West of y (so x is to the left of y) and y is North of z (so y is above z), x is to the left and potentially above z. So, x can't be Northeast of z.

For x to be **East** of z, x would need to be directly to the right of z. Given that x is West of y, x is to the left of y. So, x can't be East of z.

For x to be **Southeast** of z, x would need to be to the right and below z. Given that x is West of y, x is to the left of y. So, x can't be Southeast of z.

For x to be **South** of z, x would need to be directly below z. Given that y is North of z, z is below y. And given that x is West of y, x is to the left of y. These constraints don't directly determine the vertical relationship between x and z. If x and z share the same x-coordinates (which is possible if z extends to the left beyond the leftmost boundary of y and x extends to the right beyond the rightmost boundary of y), then x could be below z, making x South of z.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused again. Let me reconsider the simple diagram:

```
 x | y
---|---
   | z
```

Here, x is West of y and y is North of z. In this configuration, x is to the left and above z, which makes x Northwest of z. But, I need to consider other possible configurations.

But if z can extend left so much so that it's directly to the south of x, then yes, potentially x could be North of z. Similarly, if x extends down far enough that it's directly to the west of z, then x could be West of z.

What if both x extends downward and z extends to the left such that they overlap?

```
 x | y
---|---
 x/z| z
```

In this case, regions x and z overlap or share a region. 

But let's go back to the prompt: "Which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

I've so far identified:
1. Northwest (a definite possibility)
2. North (possible if z extends to the left)
3. West (possible if x extends downward)
4. Overlap (possible if both x extends downward and z extends to the left)

But I'm not sure if "Overlap" corresponds to "Bounding Box" or any of the listed cardinal directions in the prompt. Let me revisit.

Actually, I realize I've been thinking about this in a restrictive way. Let's consider more general positions.

Given:
- x is West of y.
- y is North of z.

These conditions ensure that:
- x is entirely to the left of y in the east-west axis.
- y is entirely above z in the north-south axis.

But they don't constrain:
- The position of x in the north-south axis.
- The position of z in the east-west axis.

This means:
- x can be above, at the same level, or below y in the north-south axis.
- z can be to the left, at the same level, or to the right of y in the east-west axis.

Given these freedoms, let's consider all possible relations between x and z based on their positions in both axes:

1. **East-west axis**:
   - If z is entirely to the right of x, then x is West of z.
   - If z overlaps with x in the east-west axis, then there's no strict east-west relation.
   - If z is entirely to the left of x, then x is East of z. But, given that x is West of y and y is aligned with or to the right of z, x must be to the left of z, or at most, they overlap. So, x can't be East of z.

2. **North-south axis**:
   - If x is entirely above z, then x is North of z.
   - If x overlaps with z in the north-south axis, then there's no strict north-south relation.
   - If x is entirely below z, then x is South of z. 

Combining these, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. **Northwest** (if x is to the left and above z).
2. **North** (if x is above z but overlaps with z in the east-west axis).
3. **West** (if x is to the left of z but overlaps with z in the north-south axis).
4. **Southwest** (if x is to the left and below z).
5. **South** (if x is below z but overlaps with z in the east-west axis).

(6. **Overlap** or **Intersection** if x and z share a region. But, as mentioned, I'm not sure if this corresponds to any of the listed cardinal directions in the prompt).

Let me check if each of these is possible given the constraints:

1. **Northwest**: This is possible if x is to the left of y and above z. For instance, if x is at the same level as y (in the north-south axis) and y is above z, then x is above z.
2. **North**: This is possible if x is above z but overlaps with z in the east-west axis. For instance, if z extends to the left beyond the leftmost boundary of y and x extends to the right beyond the leftmost boundary of z, they can overlap in the east-west axis. And if x is at the same level as y (in the north-south axis) and y is above z, then x is above z.
3. **West**: This is possible if x is to the left of z but overlaps with z in the north-south axis. For instance, if x extends downward below the upper boundary of z and z doesn't extend to the left beyond the rightmost boundary of x, they can overlap in the north-south axis.
4. **Southwest**: This is possible if x is to the left and below z. For instance, if x extends downward below the lower boundary of z and z doesn't extend to the left beyond the rightmost boundary of x, x can be below z.
5. **South**: This is possible if x is below z but overlaps with z in the east-west axis. For instance, if x extends downward below the lower boundary of z and z extends to the left beyond the leftmost boundary of y and x extends to the right beyond the leftmost boundary of z, they can overlap in the east-west axis and x can be below z.

So, all five of these relations are theoretically possible given the constraints.

Now, I'm reconsidering this problem and the possible relations. We are given these constraints:
- Region x is West of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

I want to consider the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, I need to clarify what "West" and "North" mean in the context of this problem. These are cardinal direction relations:
- "x is West of y" means all points in x are directly to the west of some point in y.
- "y is North of z" means all points in y are directly to the north of some point in z.

With these clarifications, let me think about the possible relation between x and z. I'm going to use a simple grid for clarity. Let's place y at the center, x to the west of y, and z to the south of y. For simplicity, I'll represent the regions with single characters:

```
 x y
   z
```

Here, x is west of y, and y is north of z. In this configuration, x is northwest of z. But there could be other configurations depending on the exact positions and sizes of the regions.

Let's consider different shapes and positions of x, y, and z. The only constraints are that x is west of y and y is north of z.

1. If x and z are aligned in the north-south direction, then x is to the west of z.
```
x y
x z
```

2. If x is to the west and does not extend as far south as z, then x is to the northwest of z.
```
x y
  z
```

3. If x extends further south than z, then x is to the southwest of z.
```
x y
x
  z
```

4. If x extends north more than west, and z extends west more than south, there could be a situation where x is to the north of z.
```
  x
x y
  z
```

5. If x extends south more than west, and z extends west more than south, there could be a situation where x is to the south of z.
```
  x
x y
z
  z
```

6. If x extends both north and south significantly, and z extends west significantly, there could be a situation where x is to the west, north, and south of z (i.e., x surrounds z on three sides). This isn't a standard cardinal direction but could be seen as a bounding box-like relation.
```
x x
x y
x z
```

7. Similarly, if z extends significantly west and north, and x extends significantly south, there could be a situation where z is to the east, south, and west of x (i.e., z surrounds x on three sides). Again, not a standard cardinal direction.
```
  x
x y
z z
```

Given these configurations, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z appear to be:
- West
- Northwest
- Southwest
- North
- South

Additionally, there could be non-standard configurations where x and z share a more complex spatial relationship, but these would not be described using the traditional cardinal directions.

Actually, I may still be overthinking this. Let me focus only on the standard cardinal direction relationships that could potentially exist between x and z, given the constraints that x is west of y and y is north of z.

Looking at the possible configurations:
1. **Northwest**: x is to the northwest of z. This is possible if x is positioned strictly to the west and north of z.
2. **North**: x is to the north of z. This is possible if x extends east enough to be directly north of some parts of z.
3. **Northeast**: x is to the northeast of z. Given that x is west of y, and y is north of z, it's impossible for x to be to the east of z. So, x cannot be to the northeast of z.
4. **East**: x is to the east of z. Again, given that x is west of y, it cannot be to the east of z. So, x cannot be to the east of z.
5. **Southeast**: x is to the southeast of z. Given that x is west of y, it cannot be to the east of z. So, x cannot be to the southeast of z.
6. **South**: x is to the south of z. This is possible if x extends far enough south to be below z.
7. **Southwest**: x is to the southwest of z. This is possible if x is positioned strictly to the west and south of z.
8. **West**: x is to the west of z. This is possible if x is positioned strictly to the west of z, at the same level in terms of north-south.
9. **Bounding Box**: One region fully contains the other. Given the constraints, it's not immediately clear if this is possible, but let me check.

For the Bounding Box relation, let's consider the two possibilities:
- x contains z: For this, x would need to extend as far east as the easternmost part of z, and as far south as the southernmost part of z. But if x is west of y, it can't extend as far east as y, let alone z (which can be east of y). So, x can't fully contain z.
- z contains x: For this, z would need to extend as far west as the westernmost part of x, and as far north as the northernmost part of x. But if y is north of z, z can't extend as far north as y, let alone x (which can be north of y). So, z can't fully contain x.

So, the Bounding Box relation is not possible.

Actually, wait. I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the basic definitions.

Given:
- x is West of y.
- y is North of z.

For cardinal direction relations:
- If region A is West of region B, all of region A is strictly to the west (left) of all of region B.
- If region A is North of region B, all of region A is strictly to the north (above) of all of region B.

Given these definitions:
- All of region x is strictly to the west of all of region y.
- All of region y is strictly to the north of all of region z.

Visually, these regions could be arranged as:
```
x y
  z
```

So, where is region x in relation to region z?

From the diagram, x is to the northwest of z. But is this the only possible relation? Let's check.

For x to be strictly West of z, all of x would need to be strictly to the west of all of z. This is possible if x and z are aligned in the north-south direction, like:
```
x y
x z
```

In this configuration, x is West of z.

For x to be strictly North of z, all of x would need to be strictly to the north of all of z. This is possible if x and z are aligned in the east-west direction, like:
```
x y
  z
```

And z extends to the west so that it's directly below x:
```
x y
z z
```

In this configuration, x is North of z.

For x to be strictly South of z, all of x would need to be strictly to the south of all of z. Given that y is North of z, all of z is strictly to the south of all of y. And given that x is West of y, all of x is strictly to the west of all of y. These constraints don't directly determine if x can be strictly to the south of z. If z extends significantly west and x extends significantly south, there could be a configuration like:
```
  y
x z
x
```

In this configuration, x is Southwest of z, not strictly South.

In fact, for x to be strictly South of z, all of x would need to be strictly to the south of all of z, which means z would be strictly to the north of all of x. But given that y is North of z, z is to the south of y. So, z can't be to the north of anything that's to the west of y, which includes x. Thus, x can't be strictly South of z.

For x to be strictly Southwest of z, all of x would need to be strictly to the southwest (bottom-left) of all of z. This seems possible in a configuration like:
```
    y
  z
x
```

In this configuration, x is Southwest of z.

For x to be strictly Northwest of z, all of x would need to be strictly to the northwest (top-left) of all of z. This is possible in a configuration like:
```
x y
    z
```

In this configuration, x is Northwest of z.

For x to be strictly Northeast of z, all of x would need to be strictly to the northeast (top-right) of all of z. Given that x is West of y, all of x is strictly to the west of all of y. So, x can't be to the east of anything that's to the south of y, which includes z. Thus, x can't be strictly Northeast of z.

For x to be strictly East of z, all of x would need to be strictly to the east of all of z. As explained for Northeast, x can't be strictly East of z.

For x to be strictly Southeast of z, all of x would need to be strictly to the southeast (bottom-right) of all of z. As explained for East, x can't be to the east of z, so it can't be Southeast either.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **North**
- **Southwest**

Wait, I need to double-check Southwest. Given that y is North of z, all of z is strictly to the south of all of y. And given that x is West of y, all of x is strictly to the west of all of y. If z is to the south of y and x is to the west of y, then x and z don't have a direct east-west relationship. x could be to the west, east, or overlap with z in the east-west direction. Similarly, x and z don't have a direct north-south relationship. x could be to the north, south, or overlap with z in the north-south direction.

Actually, I think I need to step back. Let's think of the cardinal directions as relative to the center of a region.

We are told that region x is West of region y. From the center of y, the direction to the center of x is West.

Similarly, region y is North of region z. From the center of z, the direction to the center of y is North.

Now we need to figure out the direction from the center of z to the center of x.

Using these relations:
- The center of x is to the West of the center of y.
- The center of y is to the North of the center of z.

Given these, the center of x is to the Northwest of the center of z. But the question is about the possible relations, so I should consider if there are other possible configurations.

Oh, a second. I think I've been overly restricting the problem. The cardinal direction relations "West" and "North" describe the spatial relation between two regions, but they don't constrain the regions to be in specific shapes or only be composed of contiguous cells.

So let's think in terms of the possible cardinal directions between the centers of region x and region z, given the constraints:
- The center of x is to the West of the center of y.
- The center of y is to the North of the center of z.

We want to find the possible direction from the center of z to the center of x.

Given the two constraints, the center of x is somewhere to the west of the center of y, and the center of y is somewhere to the north of the center of z. This means the center of x is to the northwest of the center of z in a general sense. But the exact cardinal direction depends on the specific positions of the centers.

For the center of x to be:
- **West** of the center of z, it would need to be directly to the left. This is possible if the center of x is at the same "latitude" as the center of z.
- **North** of the center of z, it would need to be directly above. This is possible if the center of x is at the same "longitude" as the center of z.
- **Northwest** of the center of z, it would need to be both to the left and above. This is the general case given the constraints.
- **Northeast** of the center of z, it would need to be to the right and above. But since the center of x is to the west of the center of y, and the center of y is to the north of the center of z, the center of x can't be to the right (east) of the center of z. So, the center of x can't be Northeast of the center of z.
- **East** of the center of z, it would need to be directly to the right. As explained for Northeast, the center of x can't be to the right (east) of the center of z. So, the center of x can't be East of the center of z.
- **Southeast** of the center of z, it would need to be to the right and below. As explained for East, the center of x can't be to the right (east) of the center of z. So, the center of x can't be Southeast of the center of z.
- **South** of the center of z, it would need to be directly below. This depends on the specific positions. If the center of x is directly to the west of the center of y, and the center of y is directly to the north of the center of z, then the center of x would be to the northwest of the center of z, not directly South. For the center of x to be South of the center of z, it would need to be below the center of z. But given the constraints, this doesn't seem possible in a general sense. However, if the regions have specific configurations, it might be possible.
- **Southwest** of the center of z, it would need to be to the left and below. Again, this depends on the specific positions. If the center of x is to the west of the center of y, and the center of y is to the north of the center of z, then the center of x would typically be to the northwest of the center of z. But if the west direction from the center of y to the center of x is strong enough compared to the north direction from the center of z to the center of y, the center of x could be Southwest of the center of z.

In a general sense, the possible cardinal directions from the center of z to the center of x appear to be:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **North**
- **Southwest** (depending on the specific configurations)

I have to add that, in the context of cardinal direction relations, it's common to describe the relation between two regions based on the relative positions of their centers. But if the regions have complex shapes, the relation might be more nuanced. The question is asking for the possible relations, so I've considered different possibilities.

Alright, in summary, I've found that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **North**
- **Southwest**

Let me double check the Southwest case. The center of x is to the west of the center of y, and the center of y is to the north of the center of z. Now, the question is: can the center of x be to the southwest of the center of z?

Let's represent this with coordinates. Let the center of z be at (0, 0), the center of y be at (0, 1) (i.e., one unit north of z), and the center of x be at (-1, 0) (i.e., one unit west of y). In this configuration, the center of x is at the same latitude as the center of z, which makes it west of the center of z, not southwest.

Now, let's try a different configuration. Let the center of z be at (0, 0), the center of y be at (0, 2) (i.e., two units north of z), and the center of x be at (-1, 1) (i.e., one unit west and one unit south of y). In this configuration, the center of x is still at a higher latitude than the center of z, which makes it northwest of the center of z, not southwest.

For the center of x to be southwest of the center of z, it would need to be at a lower latitude than the center of z. But since the center of y is to the north of the center of z, and the center of x is to the west of the center of y, the center of x would typically be at a higher or at most the same latitude as the center of z, not a lower one.

Actually, I don't think the southwest case is possible. Let me check again:

If the center of z is at (0, 0), the center of y must be at (0, a) where a > 0 (since y is north of z). Now, the center of x must be at (-b, a) where b > 0 (since x is west of y). Given these positions, the center of x is at (-b, a), which is to the northwest of the center of z if a > 0 (which it is, given the constraint). If a = 0, then the center of x would be directly west of the center of z. But it can't be southwest.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **North**

Ah, I think I have been overthinking this problem. When the problem asks for "possible relations", it's asking for cardinal direction relations that are possible, and not all the relations that are definitive.

Gievn the constraints:
- x is West of y.
- y is North of z.

The constraint "x is West of y" means that x is to the left of y in the east-west direction. Similarly, "y is North of z" means that y is above z in the north-south direction. Now, I want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Since y is north of z, y is above z. Since x is west of y, x is to the left of y. If y is north of z and x is west of y, intuitively, x should be northwest of z, west of z, or north of z. But let's check these possibilities.

Let's represent the relations with coordinates for clarity. Assume:
- The center of z is at (0, 0).
- The center of y is at (a, b) where b > 0 (since y is north of z).
- The center of x is at (a - c, b + d) where c > 0 (since x is west of y) and d can be any value.

Now, let's check the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. If d > 0, the center of x is at (a - c, b + d), which is to the northwest of the center of z at (0, 0).
2. If d = 0, the center of x is at (a - c, b), which is still to the northwest of the center of z.
3. If d < 0 but |d| < b, the center of x is at (a - c, b - |d|), which is still to the northwest of the center of z.
4. If d < 0 and |d| = b, the center of x is at (a - c, 0), which is directly to the west of the center of z.
5. If d < 0 and |d| > b, the center of x is at (a - c, b - |d|), which is to the southwest of the center of z.

I'm mistaken in point 1 and 2. Let me reconsider.

If the center of z is at (0, 0), the center of y at (a, b), and the center of x at (a - c, b + d), then:

- x is northwest of z if a - c < 0 and b + d > 0.
- x is west of z if a - c < 0 and b + d = 0.
- x is southwest of z if a - c < 0 and b + d < 0.
- x is north of z if a - c = 0 and b + d > 0.
- x is at the same position as z if a - c = 0 and b + d = 0.
- x is south of z if a - c = 0 and b + d < 0.
- x is northeast of z if a - c > 0 and b + d > 0.
- x is east of z if a - c > 0 and b + d = 0.
- x is southeast of z if a - c > 0 and b + d < 0.

Given the constraints:
- y is north of z, so the center of y is at (a, b) where b > 0.
- x is west of y, so the center of x is at (a - c, b + d) where c > 0 and d can be any value.

For the center of x to be at position (a - c, b + d) relative to the center of z at (0, 0):
- If a - c < 0 (which is possible if a < c) and b + d > 0 (which is guaranteed if d ≥ 0, and also possible if d < 0 but |d| < b), then x is northwest of z.
- If a - c < 0 (possible if a < c) and b + d = 0 (possible if d = -b), then x is west of z.
- If a - c < 0 (possible if a < c) and b + d < 0 (possible if d < 0 and |d| > b), then x is southwest of z.
- If a - c = 0 (possible if a = c) and b + d > 0 (guaranteed if d ≥ 0, and also possible if d < 0 but |d| < b), then x is north of z.
- If a - c = 0 (possible if a = c) and b + d = 0 (possible if d = -b), then x is at the same position as z.
- If a - c = 0 (possible if a = c) and b + d < 0 (possible if d < 0 and |d| > b), then x is south of z.
- If a - c > 0 (possible if a > c) and b + d > 0 (guaranteed if d ≥ 0, and also possible if d < 0 but |d| < b), then x is northeast of z.
- If a - c > 0 (possible if a > c) and b + d = 0 (possible if d = -b), then x is east of z.
- If a - c > 0 (possible if a > c) and b + d < 0 (possible if d < 0 and |d| > b), then x is southeast of z.

Given the constraint that x is west of y, we have c > 0. Thus:
- If a < c, then a - c < 0, and x can be northwest, west, or southwest of z (depending on the value of d).
- If a = c, then a - c = 0, and x can be north, at the same position, or south of z (depending on the value of d).
- If a > c, then a - c > 0, and x can be northeast, east, or southeast of z (depending on the value of d).

But, wait. I'm overlooking a significant constraint. The center of y is at (a, b) with b > 0 (since y is north of z). But a can be any value. For simplicity, I'll consider a = 0, which means the center of y is directly north of the center of z. In this case, the center of x is at (-c, b + d) (since x is west of y), where c > 0.

For the center of x to be at position (-c, b + d) relative to the center of z at (0, 0):
- If b + d > 0, then x is northwest of z.
- If b + d = 0, then x is west of z.
- If b + d < 0, then x is southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **Southwest**

Wait, let me check my work. I think I've been making an error:

If the center of z is at (0, 0) and the center of y is at (a, b) with b > 0 (since y is north of z), then the center of x is at (a - c, b + d) (since x is west of y), where c > 0 and d can be any value. But, the constraint "x is west of y" doesn't restrict the north-south position of x; it only ensures that x is to the left of y in the east-west direction. So, d can be any value.

For the center of x to be at position (a - c, b + d) relative to the center of z at (0, 0):
- If a - c < 0 and b + d > 0, then x is northwest of z.
- If a - c < 0 and b + d = 0, then x is west of z.
- If a - c < 0 and b + d < 0, then x is southwest of z.
- If a - c = 0 and b + d > 0, then x is north of z.
- If a - c = 0 and b + d = 0, then x is at the same position as z.
- If a - c = 0 and b + d < 0, then x is south of z.
- If a - c > 0 and b + d > 0, then x is northeast of z.
- If a - c > 0 and b + d = 0, then x is east of z.
- If a - c > 0 and b + d < 0, then x is southeast of z.

Now, let's see which of these are possible given the constraints.

Since y is north of z, the center of y is at (a, b) with b > 0. But a can be any value. For simplicity, let's consider a = 0, which means the center of y is directly north of the center of z. In this case, the center of x is at (-c, b + d) (since x is west of y), where c > 0 and d can be any value.

For the center of x to be at position (-c, b + d) relative to the center of z at (0, 0):
- If b + d > 0, then x is northwest of z.
- If b + d = 0, then x is west of z.
- If b + d < 0, then x is southwest of z.

So, for this specific configuration, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **Southwest**

Now, let's consider a different configuration. If a > 0 (the center of y is to the northeast of the center of z), the center of x is at (a - c, b + d), where c > 0 (since x is west of y) and d can be any value.

For the center of x to be at position (a - c, b + d) relative to the center of z at (0, 0):
- If a - c < 0, then x is to the west of z in the east-west direction. And if b + d > 0, x is to the north of z in the north-south direction. Combining these, x is northwest of z.
- If a - c < 0 and b + d = 0, then x is west of z.
- If a - c < 0 and b + d < 0, then x is southwest of z.
- If a - c = 0 and b + d > 0, then x is north of z.
- If a - c = 0 and b + d = 0, then x is at the same position as z.
- If a - c = 0 and b + d < 0, then x is south of z.
- If a - c > 0 and b + d > 0, then x is northeast of z.
- If a - c > 0 and b + d = 0, then x is east of z.
- If a - c > 0 and b + d < 0, then x is southeast of z.

Given the constraint that x is west of y (so c > 0), the possible relations depend on the value of a:
- If a < c, then a - c < 0, and x can be northwest, west, or southwest of z (depending on the value of d).
- If a = c, then a - c = 0, and x can be north, at the same position, or south of z (depending on the value of d).
- If a > c, then a - c > 0, and x can be northeast, east, or southeast of z (depending on the value of d).

Now, let's cross-check with our initial constraints. Since y is north of z, the center of y is at (a, b) with b > 0. And since x is west of y, the center of x is at (a - c, b + d) with c > 0.

Given these, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **Northwest** (if a - c < 0 and b + d > 0, which is possible for various values of a, b, c, and d).
- **West** (if a - c < 0 and b + d = 0, which is possible if d = -b).
- **Southwest** (if a - c < 0 and b + d < 0, which is possible if d < -b).
- **North** (if a - c = 0 and b + d > 0, which is possible if a = c and d > -b).
- **South** (if a - c = 0 and b + d < 0, which is possible if a = c and d < -b).
- **Northeast** (if a - c > 0 and b + d > 0, which is possible if a > c and d > -b).
- **East** (if a - c > 0 and b + d = 0, which is possible if a > c and d = -b).
- **Southeast** (if a - c > 0 and b + d < 0, which is possible if a > c and d < -b).

Wait, I think I've been over-complicating the issue with the possibility of overlaps. Ah, I know what the problem is. I'm treating the cardinal directions as center-based when they're relation-based. In the context of the problem, "x is West of y" means the entire region x is to the west of the entire region y. Similarly, "y is North of z" means the entire region y is to the north of the entire region z.

Given this clarification, let's reconsider. If the entire region x is to the west of the entire region y, and the entire region y is to the north of the entire region z, what are the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z?

Since x is entirely to the west of y, and y is entirely to the north of z, x is to the west of something that's to the north of z. This doesn't directly determine the cardinal direction relation between x and z.

The possible relations depend on the specific positions of the regions. Let's consider a few examples:

1. If x is directly to the west of y and at the same latitude, and y is directly to the north of z and at the same longitude, then x is to the northwest of z. (e.g we place them in a diagonal)
2. If x extends southward such that it's at the same latitude as z, then x can be directly to the west of z. (i.e. forming an L-shape with the given constraints)
3. If z extends westward such that it's at the same longitude as x, then x can be directly to the north of z. (i.e. forming an upside-down L shape with the given constraints)

Given these considerations, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z appear to be:
- **Northwest**
- **West**
- **North**

Ok, I think I have my answer. Let me re-summarize.

Given the constraints:
- Region x is West of region y.
- Region y is North of region z.

The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- **Northwest** (if x is to the northwest of z).
- **West** (if x is directly to the west of z).
- **North** (if x is directly to the north of z).

These are the only valid possibilities given the constraints. For completeness, I've checked all eight cardinal directions plus the bounding box relation. But I only found Northwest, West, and North to be possible.

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations given, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is West of region y
- Region y is North of region z

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

- Northwest (if x is diagonally above and to the left of z)
- North (if x is directly above z, which can happen if z extends westward)
- West (if x is directly to the left of z, which can happen if x extends southward)

These are the only possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given the constraints.
