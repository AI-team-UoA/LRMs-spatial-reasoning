PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

We have region $x$ that is Southwest of region $y$, and region $y$ that is East of region $z$.

Let's think about the cardinal directions. Southwest means that $x$ is both to the south and to the west of $y$. East means that $y$ is to the east of $z$.

So we have:
- $x$ is south and west of $y$
- $y$ is east of $z$

We want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$.

If $y$ is east of $z$, then $z$ is west of $y$. 

Let's think about this visually, with a basic coordinate system where north is up, east is right, south is down, and west is left.

If $y$ is east of $z$, then $z$ is to the left of $y$. And if $x$ is southwest of $y$, then $x$ is to the bottom-left of $y$.

So $z$ is to the left of $y$, and $x$ is to the bottom-left of $y$. Now, how does $x$ relate to $z$?

If $z$ is directly to the left of $y$, and $x$ is to the bottom-left of $y$, then $x$ would be to the south of $z$. But if $z$ is far enough to the left and slightly up compared to $y$, then $x$ could be to the southeast of $z$.

Let's try to work this out more precisely. Let's use a simple coordinate system, where North corresponds to the positive $y$-axis, East corresponds to the positive $x$-axis, South corresponds to the negative $y$-axis, and West corresponds to the negative $x$-axis.

Let's say that $y$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$. 

Since $x$ is southwest of $y$, $x$ is at a position like $(-a, -b)$ where $a, b > 0$. That is, $x$ is in the third quadrant relative to $y$.

Since $z$ is west of $y$, $z$ is at a position like $(-c, 0)$ where $c > 0$. That is, $z$ is directly to the left of $y$.

Now, to determine the relationship between $x$ and $z$, we need to look at the position of $x$ relative to $z$. The position of $x$ relative to $z$ would be $(-a, -b) - (-c, 0) = (-a + c, -b) = (c - a, -b)$.

If $c > a$, then $x$ is to the east of $z$.
If $c < a$, then $x$ is to the west of $z$.
If $c = a$, then $x$ is directly north/south of $z$.

Since $b > 0$, $x$ is to the south of $z$ in all cases.

So, depending on the exact positions, $x$ could be Southeast of $z$ (if $c > a$), South of $z$ (if $c = a$), or Southwest of $z$ (if $c < a$).

Actually, let's clarify the meaning of "East" in "region $y$ is East of region $z$". Typically, in cardinal directions, "East" means "strictly to the east", i.e., $y$ is strictly to the right of $z$. But it's also common to allow some variation in the north-south direction, as long as the east-west component is dominant. So, "East" could mean that $y$ is somewhere in the northeastern to southeastern quadrant relative to $z$.

Let's re-do this analysis, considering the possibility that "East" allows for some variation in the north-south direction. So, if $y$ is east of $z$, then $y$ is at a position like $(c, d)$ relative to $z$, where $c > 0$ and $d$ can be positive, negative, or zero.

Similarly, if $x$ is southwest of $y$, then $x$ is at a position like $(-a, -b)$ relative to $y$, where $a, b > 0$.

Now, to find the position of $x$ relative to $z$, we need to compose these two transformations. First, $y$ is at position $(c, d)$ relative to $z$. Then, $x$ is at position $(-a, -b)$ relative to $y$. So, $x$ is at position $(c, d) + (-a, -b) = (c - a, d - b)$ relative to $z$.

Now, we need to determine the cardinal direction of $x$ relative to $z$ based on this position.

If $c - a > 0$ and $d - b < 0$, then $x$ is to the southeast of $z$.
If $c - a < 0$ and $d - b < 0$, then $x$ is to the southwest of $z$.
If $c - a = 0$ and $d - b < 0$, then $x$ is to the south of $z$.
If $c - a > 0$ and $d - b = 0$, then $x$ is to the east of $z$.
If $c - a < 0$ and $d - b = 0$, then $x$ is to the west of $z$.
If $c - a = 0$ and $d - b = 0$, then $x$ is at the same position as $z$ (unlikely given the constraints).

Actually, let me rethink this more carefully. Let's place $z$ at the origin and use the convention that the positive $y$-axis points north, and the positive $x$-axis points east.

If $y$ is East of $z$, then $y$ is at a position $(a, 0)$ for some $a > 0$. That is, $y$ is directly to the east of $z$.

If $x$ is Southwest of $y$, then $x$ is at a position $(-b, -c)$ relative to $y$, for some $b, c > 0$. That is, $x$ is to the southwest of $y$.

So, the position of $x$ relative to $z$ is: $(a, 0) + (-b, -c) = (a - b, -c)$.

The question is: what cardinal direction is $(a - b, -c)$ from the origin $(0, 0)$?

If $a - b > 0$, then $x$ is to the east of $z$.
If $a - b < 0$, then $x$ is to the west of $z$.
If $a - b = 0$, then $x$ is directly north/south of $z$.

Since $c > 0$, $x$ is to the south of $z$ in all cases.

So, depending on the exact positions, $x$ could be Southeast of $z$ (if $a > b$), South of $z$ (if $a = b$), or Southwest of $z$ (if $a < b$).

Actually, I'm now realizing that I have been implicitly assuming that "East" means "directly east", with no north/south component. But in reality, when we say one region is East of another, we often mean that the center of the region is in that direction. This can often be a mix of directions, especially if the region has an irregular shape. Let's handle this case with more nuance.

If we say that "$y$ is East of $z$", it typically means that to go from $z$ to $y$, you need to go eastward, but you might also need to go a bit north or south. In other words, the east-west displacement is larger or predominant compared to the north-south displacement.

Likewise, if "$x$ is Southwest of $y$", it means that to go from $y$ to $x$, you need to go southwestward, which means going both south and west. The ratio of the south displacement to the west displacement could vary, as long as both are significant.

Given these interpretations, let's see what we can say about the relationship between $x$ and $z$.

We know that $y$ is East of $z$, so $y$ is predominantly to the east of $z$ (may have a slight north or south component). And $x$ is Southwest of $y$, so $x$ is both to the south and to the west of $y$.

To go from $z$ to $x$, we'd first go from $z$ to $y$ (predominantly eastward), and then from $y$ to $x$ (southwestward). The combined displacement could be in various directions, depending on the exact positions of the three regions.

Let's consider a few possibilities.

1. If $y$ is directly East of $z$ (no north-south component), and $x$ is directly Southwest of $y$ (equal south and west components), then $x$ would be Southeast of $z$ if the eastward displacement from $z$ to $y$ is greater than the westward displacement from $y$ to $x$. Otherwise, $x$ would be South or Southwest of $z$.

2. If $y$ is Northeast of $z$ (more east than north), and $x$ is Southwest of $y$ (equal south and west components), then the relationship between $x$ and $z$ would depend on the exact magnitudes of the displacements. $x$ could be East, Southeast, South, or even Northeast of $z$.

3. If $y$ is Southeast of $z$ (more east than south), and $x$ is Southwest of $y$ (equal south and west components), then $x$ would likely be South, Southeast, or Southwest of $z$.

It gets complex to enumerate all possibilities, especially if we allow for varying ratios of north-south to east-west displacement. 

Actually I've been making things too complicated. Let's go back to the original statement. We have regions, and cardinal directions between them.

If we have region $y$ is East of region $z$, I should interpret this as a constraint on where $y$ can be located, relative to region $z$. The constraint is: $y$ is in the East direction from $z$. This is a fairly strong constraint, as East refers to a specific cardinal direction.

Similarly, if region $x$ is Southwest of region $y$, then $x$ is in the Southwest direction from $y$. Again, this is a fairly specific direction.

Now, let's try to visualize this. Let's place $z$ at the origin. If $y$ is East of $z$, then $y$ is somewhere along the positive $x$-axis (assuming East corresponds to the positive $x$-axis). If $x$ is Southwest of $y$, then to go from $y$ to $x$, we move in the Southwest direction, which means moving both West (negative $x$ direction) and South (negative $y$ direction).

So, if we go from $z$ to $y$ by moving East, and then from $y$ to $x$ by moving Southwest, the overall movement from $z$ to $x$ would depend on the relative magnitudes of these movements.

I'm making this too complicated. The problem is asking for the *possible* relations between region $x$ and region $z$. So I need to consider all possible scenarios.

Let's think of this problem in a different way. Let's establish a Cartesian coordinate system, where the origin is arbitrary. East corresponds to the positive $x$-axis, North corresponds to the positive $y$-axis, West corresponds to the negative $x$-axis, and South corresponds to the negative $y$-axis.

If region $y$ is East of region $z$, then the center of $y$ is at a position $(z_x + a, z_y + b)$ relative to the center of $z$ at $(z_x, z_y)$, where $a > 0$ and $b$ is small enough that the overall direction is considered "East". Typically, this would mean $|b| < a$, so the East-West displacement is more significant than the North-South displacement.

If region $x$ is Southwest of region $y$, then the center of $x$ is at a position $(y_x - c, y_y - d)$ relative to the center of $y$ at $(y_x, y_y)$, where $c, d > 0$ and both are significant enough that the overall direction is considered "Southwest".

Now, the center of $x$ relative to the center of $z$ would be at:
$(z_x + a, z_y + b) + (-c, -d) = (z_x + a - c, z_y + b - d)$

So, the displacement from $z$ to $x$ is $(a - c, b - d)$.

The cardinal direction from $z$ to $x$ would depend on the signs and relative magnitudes of $a - c$ and $b - d$:

- If $a - c > 0$ and $b - d > 0$, then $x$ is Northeast of $z$.
- If $a - c > 0$ and $b - d < 0$, then $x$ is Southeast of $z$.
- If $a - c < 0$ and $b - d > 0$, then $x$ is Northwest of $z$.
- If $a - c < 0$ and $b - d < 0$, then $x$ is Southwest of $z$.
- If $a - c > 0$ and $b - d = 0$, then $x$ is East of $z$.
- If $a - c < 0$ and $b - d = 0$, then $x$ is West of $z$.
- If $a - c = 0$ and $b - d > 0$, then $x$ is North of $z$.
- If $a - c = 0$ and $b - d < 0$, then $x$ is South of $z$.

But there's another constraint. I mentioned that $|b| < a$ for $y$ to be considered East of $z$, and both $c$ and $d$ are significant for $x$ to be considered Southwest of $y$. Let's use this to narrow down the possibilities.

Given that $y$ is East of $z$, we might have $b$ slightly positive (Northeast-ish), zero (directly East), or slightly negative (Southeast-ish). But the dominant direction is East, so $a$ is significantly positive and larger in magnitude than $b$.

Given that $x$ is Southwest of $y$, both $c$ and $d$ are significantly positive.

Now, the displacement from $z$ to $x$ is $(a - c, b - d)$:

- The East-West component is $a - c$. Since $a$ is significantly positive (for $y$ to be East of $z$) and $c$ is significantly positive (for $x$ to be Southwest of $y$), $a - c$ could be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the relative magnitudes of $a$ and $c$.
- The North-South component is $b - d$. Since $b$ is constrained by $|b| < a$ (for $y$ to be East of $z$) and $d$ is significantly positive (for $x$ to be Southwest of $y$), $b - d$ is likely to be negative. The only exception might be if $b$ is very positive (i.e., $y$ is quite Northeast of $z$) and $d$ is not too large, but this seems like a marginal case.

Given these considerations, the most likely cardinal directions from $z$ to $x$ would be:

- Southeast (if $a > c$ and $b - d < 0$)
- South (if $a = c$ and $b - d < 0$)
- Southwest (if $a < c$ and $b - d < 0$)

In the marginal case where $b$ is very positive (i.e., $y$ is quite Northeast of $z$) and $d$ is not too large, we might also have:

- East (if $a > c$ and $b = d$)
- Northeast (if $a > c$ and $b > d$)
- West (if $a < c$ and $b = d$)
- Northwest (if $a < c$ and $b > d$)

But these seem less likely given the typical interpretations of "East" and "Southwest".

Now, let's take a more practical view and determine the most likely directions.

If $y$ is East of $z$, then in the standard cardinal direction nomenclature, the direction from $z$ to $y$ is predominantly eastward, with possibly a slight northward or southward component. Let's simplify and say $y$ is directly east of $z$.

If $x$ is Southwest of $y$, then the direction from $y$ to $x$ is both southward and westward. The exact ratio of south to west might vary, but both components are significant. Let's simplify and say $x$ is 45 degrees southwest of $y$.

Given these simplifications, if $y$ is directly east of $z$ and $x$ is 45 degrees southwest of $y$, the direction from $z$ to $x$ would depend on the distances. If the distance from $z$ to $y$ is greater than the distance from $y$ to $x$ in the east-west direction, then $x$ would be southeast of $z$. If the distances are equal in the east-west direction, then $x$ would be directly south of $z$. If the distance from $y$ to $x$ in the east-west direction is greater than the distance from $z$ to $y$, then $x$ would be southwest of $z$.

For a better approach, let's specify the actual possible cardinal directions in the question and find their combinations.

Hmm, let me think of this more directly. We have the following constraints:
- $y$ is east of $z$
- $x$ is southwest of $y$

So $y$ is in the east direction from $z$, and $x$ is in the southwest direction from $y$. What are the possible directions from $z$ to $x$?

Let's think of east as a vector pointing to the right, and southwest as a vector pointing down and to the left. If we start at $z$, go east to $y$, and then southwest to $x$, the resulting direction from $z$ to $x$ depends on the relative magnitudes of these vectors.

If the eastward displacement from $z$ to $y$ is greater than the westward displacement from $y$ to $x$, then $x$ is to the east of $z$. If they're equal, $x$ is neither east nor west of $z$. If the westward displacement from $y$ to $x$ is greater, then $x$ is to the west of $z$.

Since $x$ is southwest of $y$, the direction from $y$ to $x$ includes a southward component. So, regardless of the east-west relationship between $x$ and $z$, $x$ is to the south of $z$.

So, the possible directions from $z$ to $x$ are:
- Southeast (if $x$ is to the east of $z$ and to the south of $z$)
- South (if $x$ is neither east nor west of $z$ but to the south of $z$)
- Southwest (if $x$ is to the west of $z$ and to the south of $z$)

I'm looking for the possible directional relations. Since I'm thinking of directions as vectors or displacements, and considering the variability in the exact positions of regions, it seems like the possible directional relations from $z$ to $x$ are indeed Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Let me double check. Here we need to consider how the east-west and north-south displacements from $z$ to $y$ and from $y$ to $x$ combine.

East-West Displacement:
- From $z$ to $y$: Eastward (positive)
- From $y$ to $x$: Westward (negative)
- Net from $z$ to $x$: Depends on the relative magnitudes. If the eastward displacement is greater, then the net is eastward. If they're equal, the net is zero. If the westward displacement is greater, then the net is westward.

North-South Displacement:
- From $z$ to $y$: Potentially slight northward (positive) or southward (negative), but mostly neutral because the dominant direction is east.
- From $y$ to $x$: Southward (negative)
- Net from $z$ to $x$: Predominantly southward, because the southward displacement from $y$ to $x$ is significant and the north-south displacement from $z$ to $y$ is minimal.

Given these, the possible cardinal directions from $z$ to $x$ are:
- Southeast (if the net east-west displacement is eastward and the net north-south displacement is southward)
- South (if the net east-west displacement is zero and the net north-south displacement is southward)
- Southwest (if the net east-west displacement is westward and the net north-south displacement is southward)

I'm having some difficulty, so I'm going to try a slightly different approach. Let's visually plot some possible configurations to see what's feasible.

Let's place $z$ at the origin (0, 0).

Since $y$ is East of $z$, $y$ could be at positions like (1, 0), (1, 0.5), or (1, -0.5). The key is that the $x$-coordinate is positive and significantly larger than the absolute value of the $y$-coordinate.

Since $x$ is Southwest of $y$, if $y$ is at (1, 0), then $x$ could be at positions like (0, -1), (0.5, -1), or (0, -0.5). The key is that both the $x$ and $y$ coordinates decrease from $y$ to $x$.

Given these constraints, let's calculate the direction from $z$ to $x$ for a few examples:

1. If $y$ is at (1, 0) and $x$ is at (0, -1), then the displacement from $z$ to $x$ is (0, -1), which is South.
2. If $y$ is at (1, 0) and $x$ is at (0.5, -1), then the displacement from $z$ to $x$ is (0.5, -1), which is Southeast.
3. If $y$ is at (1, 0) and $x$ is at (-0.5, -1), then the displacement from $z$ to $x$ is (-0.5, -1), which is Southwest.

Based on these examples, I see that the direction from $z$ to $x$ can be Southeast, South, or Southwest, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Now, let's try with different positions for $y$:

4. If $y$ is at (1, 0.5) and $x$ is at (0, -0.5), then the displacement from $z$ to $x$ is (0, -0.5), which is South.
5. If $y$ is at (1, 0.5) and $x$ is at (0.5, -0.5), then the displacement from $z$ to $x$ is (0.5, -0.5), which is Southeast.
6. If $y$ is at (1, 0.5) and $x$ is at (-0.5, -0.5), then the displacement from $z$ to $x$ is (-0.5, -0.5), which is Southwest.

Again, the possible directions from $z$ to $x$ are Southeast, South, or Southwest.

I guess we might be able to achieve other directions if we "stretch" the cardinal directions a bit. For instance, if "East" includes a strong northward component and "Southwest" has a minimal westward component, we might get a direction close to Northeast. But given the standard interpretations of cardinal directions, Southeast, South, and Southwest seem to be the most plausible options.

Actually I just realized that if y is far enough northeast of z, and x is southwest of y but not too far southwest, x might end up being east or northeast of z. But I'm going to go with the core, expected interpretations and say:

The possible directions from $z$ to $x$ are:
1. Southeast
2. South
3. Southwest

Let me be really systematic:

Given:
- Region $y$ is East of region $z$.
- Region $x$ is Southwest of region $y$.

We want to find: What are the possible directional relations between region $x$ and region $z$?

Let's set up a coordinate system:
- North is the positive $y$-axis.
- East is the positive $x$-axis.
- South is the negative $y$-axis.
- West is the negative $x$-axis.

Let's place region $z$ at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity.

1. "Region $y$ is East of region $z$" means that the center of region $y$ is at $(z_x + a, z_y + b)$ = $(a, b)$ where $a > 0$ and $|b| << a$ (or $|b| < a$ if we want to be more generous). The exact value of $b$ could be slightly positive (making $y$ slightly Northeast of $z$), zero (making $y$ directly East of $z$), or slightly negative (making $y$ slightly Southeast of $z$).

2. "Region $x$ is Southwest of region $y$" means that the center of region $x$ is at $(y_x - c, y_y - d)$ = $(a - c, b - d)$ where $c, d > 0$. The values of $c$ and $d$ are both significant, indicating a combined Southward and Westward displacement.

Now, the displacement from $z$ to $x$ is $(a - c, b - d)$. The cardinal direction from $z$ to $x$ depends on the signs of $(a - c)$ and $(b - d)$, as well as their relative magnitudes:

- If $a - c > 0$ and $b - d > 0$, then $x$ is Northeast of $z$.
- If $a - c > 0$ and $b - d < 0$, then $x$ is Southeast of $z$.
- If $a - c < 0$ and $b - d > 0$, then $x$ is Northwest of $z$.
- If $a - c < 0$ and $b - d < 0$, then $x$ is Southwest of $z$.
- If $a - c > 0$ and $b - d = 0$, then $x$ is East of $z$.
- If $a - c < 0$ and $b - d = 0$, then $x$ is West of $z$.
- If $a - c = 0$ and $b - d > 0$, then $x$ is North of $z$.
- If $a - c = 0$ and $b - d < 0$, then $x$ is South of $z$.

Specifically:
- $a$ is positive and significant (since $y$ is East of $z$).
- $b$ is relatively small in magnitude (since $y$ is primarily East of $z$), but could be positive, negative, or zero.
- $c$ and $d$ are both positive and significant (since $x$ is Southwest of $y$).

Given that $d$ is significant and positive, and $b$ is relatively small in magnitude, it's likely that $b - d < 0$. This eliminates Northeast, Northwest, North, and East, for example, from the possible directions.

The possible values of $a - c$ depend on the relative magnitudes of $a$ (which is significant due to "East") and $c$ (which is significant due to "Southwest"):
- If $a > c$, then $a - c > 0$, making the direction Eastward.
- If $a < c$, then $a - c < 0$, making the direction Westward.
- If $a = c$, then $a - c = 0$, making the direction neither Eastward nor Westward.

Given that $b - d < 0$ (indicating a Southward direction), and considering the possible values of $a - c$, the possible cardinal directions from $z$ to $x$ are:
- Southeast (if $a > c$ and $b - d < 0$)
- South (if $a = c$ and $b - d < 0$)
- Southwest (if $a < c$ and $b - d < 0$)

So, the possible directions from $z$ to $x$ are: Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Actually, let's make sure I've exhausted all possibilities. 

One thing I didn't fully consider is the constraint that $|b| << a$ (or at least $|b| < a$). But even if we take the extreme case, say $b \approx a$, this would make $y$ almost Northeast of $z$. Then, depending on the values of $c$ and $d$ (both of which are positive due to "Southwest"), $x$ could still be in various directions from $z$.

Now, let's actually rethink the possibilities without pre-constraining them, so we can be super thorough.

Given:
- $y$ is at position $(a, b)$ relative to $z$ at the origin.
- $x$ is at position $(a - c, b - d)$ relative to $z$.

For $y$ to be East of $z$:
- $a > 0$ (eastward component)
- $|b| < a$ (east-west displacement dominates north-south displacement)

For $x$ to be Southwest of $y$:
- $c > 0$ (westward component)
- $d > 0$ (southward component)
- Both $c$ and $d$ are significant in magnitude.

Now, let's consider the possible directions from $z$ to $x$ based on the values of $a - c$ and $b - d$:

1. Northeast: $a - c > 0$ and $b - d > 0$. 
   - $a - c > 0$ implies $a > c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d > 0$ implies $b > d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and greater than $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| < a$ (due to East). So, if $b$ is significant but still less than $a$, and $d$ is smaller than $b$, then $x$ could indeed be Northeast of $z$.

2. East: $a - c > 0$ and $b - d = 0$.
   - $a - c > 0$ implies $a > c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d = 0$ implies $b = d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and equal to $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| < a$ (due to East). So, if $b$ (and hence $d$) is significant but still less than $a$, then $x$ could indeed be East of $z$.

3. Southeast: $a - c > 0$ and $b - d < 0$.
   - $a - c > 0$ implies $a > c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d < 0$ implies $b < d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this is easily satisfied for most values of $b$ and $d$ within the constraints.

4. South: $a - c = 0$ and $b - d < 0$.
   - $a - c = 0$ implies $a = c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d < 0$ implies $b < d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this is easily satisfied for most values of $b$ and $d$ within the constraints.

5. Southwest: $a - c < 0$ and $b - d < 0$.
   - $a - c < 0$ implies $a < c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d < 0$ implies $b < d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this is easily satisfied for most values of $b$ and $d$ within the constraints.

6. West: $a - c < 0$ and $b - d = 0$.
   - $a - c < 0$ implies $a < c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d = 0$ implies $b = d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and equal to $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| < a$ (due to East). So, if $b$ (and hence $d$) is significant but still less than $a$, and $c$ is greater than $a$, then $x$ could indeed be West of $z$.

7. Northwest: $a - c < 0$ and $b - d > 0$.
   - $a - c < 0$ implies $a < c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d > 0$ implies $b > d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and greater than $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| < a$ (due to East). So, if $b$ is significant but still less than $a$, $d$ is smaller than $b$, and $c$ is greater than $a$, then $x$ could indeed be Northwest of $z$.

8. North: $a - c = 0$ and $b - d > 0$.
   - $a - c = 0$ implies $a = c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d > 0$ implies $b > d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and greater than $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| < a$ (due to East). So, if $b$ is significant but still less than $a$, and $d$ is smaller than $b$, then $x$ could indeed be North of $z$.

It turns out that, under specific circumstances, all the cardinal directions from $z$ to $x$ are possible. However, I'm concerned that I'm pushing the boundaries of the cardinal direction constraints, so I should be more careful:

For "East" to be the primary cardinal direction, $a$ (the eastward displacement) should be significantly larger than $|b|$ (the north-south displacement). Given that "East" is a primary cardinal direction, it's usual to have $|b| << a$. If we generously allow $|b| \leq \frac{a}{2}$, which is still more conservative than I've been so far, then this would be a reasonable constraint. And similarly, for "Southwest" to be the primary cardinal direction, both $c$ (the westward displacement) and $d$ (the southward displacement) should be significant. A common convention might be to have $c$ and $d$ be within a factor of 2 or 3 of each other, so neither dominates too much. Let's say $\frac{1}{3} \leq \frac{c}{d} \leq 3$.

Given these constraints, what are the possible cardinal directions from $z$ to $x$?

For $y$ to be East of $z$:
- $a > 0$ (eastward component)
- $|b| \leq \frac{a}{2}$ (east-west displacement dominates north-south displacement)

For $x$ to be Southwest of $y$:
- $c > 0$ (westward component)
- $d > 0$ (southward component)
- $\frac{1}{3} \leq \frac{c}{d} \leq 3$ (neither westward nor southward displacement dominates too much)

Now, let's check each of the potential cardinal directions:

1. Northeast: $a - c > 0$ and $b - d > 0$.
   - $a - c > 0$ implies $a > c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d > 0$ implies $b > d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and greater than $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| \leq \frac{a}{2}$ (due to East). So, for $x$ to be Northeast of $z$, we'd need $0 < d < b \leq \frac{a}{2}$ and $c < a$. This seems tight but is possibly achievable.

2. East: $a - c > 0$ and $b - d = 0$.
   - $a - c > 0$ implies $a > c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d = 0$ implies $b = d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and equal to $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| \leq \frac{a}{2}$ (due to East). So, for $x$ to be East of $z$, we'd need $0 < b = d \leq \frac{a}{2}$ and $c < a$. This seems achievable.

3. Southeast: $a - c > 0$ and $b - d < 0$.
   - $a - c > 0$ implies $a > c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d < 0$ implies $b < d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this constraint is easily satisfied, especially if $b$ is negative (i.e., $y$ is Southeast of $z$) or if $b$ is positive but smaller than $d$.

4. South: $a - c = 0$ and $b - d < 0$.
   - $a - c = 0$ implies $a = c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d < 0$ implies $b < d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this constraint is easily satisfied, especially if $b$ is negative (i.e., $y$ is Southeast of $z$) or if $b$ is positive but smaller than $d$.

5. Southwest: $a - c < 0$ and $b - d < 0$.
   - $a - c < 0$ implies $a < c$, which is possible if $c$ is larger than $a$.
   - $b - d < 0$ implies $b < d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this constraint is easily satisfied, especially if $b$ is negative (i.e., $y$ is Southeast of $z$) or if $b$ is positive but smaller than $d$.

6. West: $a - c < 0$ and $b - d = 0$.
   - $a - c < 0$ implies $a < c$, which is possible if $c$ is larger than $a$.
   - $b - d = 0$ implies $b = d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and equal to $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| \leq \frac{a}{2}$ (due to East). So, for $x$ to be West of $z$, we'd need $0 < b = d \leq \frac{a}{2}$ and $c > a$. This seems achievable.

7. Northwest: $a - c < 0$ and $b - d > 0$.
   - $a - c < 0$ implies $a < c$, which is possible if $c$ is larger than $a$.
   - $b - d > 0$ implies $b > d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and greater than $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| \leq \frac{a}{2}$ (due to East). So, for $x$ to be Northwest of $z$, we'd need $0 < d < b \leq \frac{a}{2}$ and $c > a$. This seems tight but is possibly achievable.

8. North: $a - c = 0$ and $b - d > 0$.
   - $a - c = 0$ implies $a = c$, which is possible.
   - $b - d > 0$ implies $b > d$. Given that $d > 0$ (due to Southwest), this would require $b$ to be positive and greater than $d$. But we also have the constraint that $|b| \leq \frac{a}{2}$ (due to East). So, for $x$ to be North of $z$, we'd need $0 < d < b \leq \frac{a}{2}$ and $c = a$. This seems tight but is possibly achievable.

Given these considerations, it appears that all eight cardinal directions from $z$ to $x$ are plausible under specific configurations. However, some directions (like Southeast, South, and Southwest) would be more commonly achieved given the constraints of "East" and "Southwest", and some (like Northeast, North, and Northwest) would require more specific configurations.

Let's, just to be absolutely sure, check with a concrete example to see if all of them are truly feasible. I'll use the constraints:
- $|b| \leq \frac{a}{2}$ (for "East")
- $\frac{1}{3} \leq \frac{c}{d} \leq 3$ (for "Southwest")

Let's also pick specific values to see:

For "East", let's set $a = 10$ and $b = 5$ (so $y$ is at (10, 5) relative to $z$). This satisfies $|b| \leq \frac{a}{2}$.

For "Southwest", we need to select values of $c$ and $d$ such that both are positive and $\frac{1}{3} \leq \frac{c}{d} \leq 3$.

Now, let's check each cardinal direction:

1. Northeast: We need $a - c > 0$ and $b - d > 0$. With $a = 10$ and $b = 5$, we'd need $c < 10$ and $d < 5$. Let's set $c = 6$ and $d = 2$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 3$, which satisfies the "Southwest" constraint. The resulting position of $x$ relative to $z$ is $(10 - 6, 5 - 2) = (4, 3)$, which is indeed in the Northeast direction.

2. East: We need $a - c > 0$ and $b - d = 0$. With $a = 10$ and $b = 5$, we'd need $c < 10$ and $d = 5$. Let's set $c = 5$ and $d = 5$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 1$, which satisfies the "Southwest" constraint. The resulting position of $x$ relative to $z$ is $(10 - 5, 5 - 5) = (5, 0)$, which is indeed in the East direction.

3. Southeast: We need $a - c > 0$ and $b - d < 0$. With $a = 10$ and $b = 5$, we'd need $c < 10$ and $d > 5$. Let's set $c = 6$ and $d = 8$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 0.75$, which satisfies the "Southwest" constraint. The resulting position of $x$ relative to $z$ is $(10 - 6, 5 - 8) = (4, -3)$, which is indeed in the Southeast direction.

4. South: We need $a - c = 0$ and $b - d < 0$. With $a = 10$ and $b = 5$, we'd need $c = 10$ and $d > 5$. Let's set $c = 10$ and $d = 8$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 1.25$, which satisfies the "Southwest" constraint. The resulting position of $x$ relative to $z$ is $(10 - 10, 5 - 8) = (0, -3)$, which is indeed in the South direction.

5. Southwest: We need $a - c < 0$ and $b - d < 0$. With $a = 10$ and $b = 5$, we'd need $c > 10$ and $d > 5$. Let's set $c = 15$ and $d = 8$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 1.875$, which satisfies the "Southwest" constraint. The resulting position of $x$ relative to $z$ is $(10 - 15, 5 - 8) = (-5, -3)$, which is indeed in the Southwest direction.

6. West: We need $a - c < 0$ and $b - d = 0$. With $a = 10$ and $b = 5$, we'd need $c > 10$ and $d = 5$. Let's set $c = 15$ and $d = 5$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 3$, which satisfies the "Southwest" constraint. The resulting position of $x$ relative to $z$ is $(10 - 15, 5 - 5) = (-5, 0)$, which is indeed in the West direction.

7. Northwest: We need $a - c < 0$ and $b - d > 0$. With $a = 10$ and $b = 5$, we'd need $c > 10$ and $d < 5$. Let's set $c = 15$ and $d = 3$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 5$, which actually does not satisfy the "Southwest" constraint. It seems more challenging to achieve the Northwest direction with our constraints. Let's try again with different values.

   Let's set $c = 12$ and $d = 4$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 3$, which just barely satisfies the "Southwest" constraint. The resulting position of $x$ relative to $z$ is $(10 - 12, 5 - 4) = (-2, 1)$, which is indeed in the Northwest direction.

8. North: We need $a - c = 0$ and $b - d > 0$. With $a = 10$ and $b = 5$, we'd need $c = 10$ and $d < 5$. Let's set $c = 10$ and $d = 3$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 3.33$, which is just outside of our "Southwest" constraint. It seems a bit tight.

   Let's try with $c = 9$ and $d = 3$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} = 3$, which satisfies the "Southwest" constraint. But the resulting position of $x$ relative to $z$ is $(10 - 9, 5 - 3) = (1, 2)$, which is in the Northeast direction, not North.

   Let's adjust to $c = 10$ and $d = 3.3$. This gives $\frac{c}{d} \approx 3$, which satisfies the "Southwest" constraint. The resulting position of $x$ relative to $z$ is $(10 - 10, 5 - 3.3) = (0, 1.7)$, which is indeed in the North direction.

After checking all eight cardinal directions, it seems that all of them are indeed achievable under certain conditions, though some (like North) required careful tuning of parameters.

I'm going to say that, in theory, all eight cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) are possible directional relations between region $x$ and region $z$. But the practical achievability of some directions (like North, Northeast, and Northwest) requires specific configurations of regions with potentially less realistic constraints. I think the most expected directions are Southeast, South, Southwest, since they were most naturally achievable under the given constraints.

Let me do a last check:

In a more realistic interpretation of the problem, if $y$ is East of $z$ and $x$ is Southwest of $y$, the most likely cardinal directions from $z$ to $x$ would be:

- South
- Southeast
- Southwest

These directions are more naturally achieved and would be the most common outcomes in practical scenarios.

However, with more specific arrangements and if we consider broader interpretations of the cardinal directions, other directions like East, West, Northeast, Northwest, and North are technically possible, but less likely.

So the most direct answer is: South, Southeast, Southwest. Though the full spectrum of cardinal directions is technically achievable under specific configurations. It just depends on how tightly we interpret the cardinal direction constraints.

Actually, I realize I'm overthinking this (perhaps due to the specific constrains of the problem).  Let me look at the question again and be more direct with my answer.

The question is: "Let Southwest and East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is Southwest of region y and region y is East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

I am asked for the possible relations between $x$ and $z$. If $y$ is East of $z$ and $x$ is Southwest of $y$, by composing these directions, the most natural outcomes for the direction from $z$ to $x$ are South, Southeast, and Southwest.

However, as I've shown, under specific configurations, other cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Northwest, West) can also be achieved. It depends on the exact positions of the regions and how strictly we interpret the cardinal direction constraints.

Given that the question asks for the possible relations, and not necessarily the most likely ones, my answer is: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest. But it's worth noting that South, Southeast, and Southwest are the most intuitively expected outcomes.

Actually, I realize I've been overthinking this. I should just return the list of possibilities: Southeast, South, Southwest. Because those are the most likely, and unless I'm told I need to enumerate all possible things, I shouldn't.

So, to the question "If region x is Southwest of region y and region y is East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" my answer is: Southeast, South, Southwest.

But now I'm second-guessing myself. Let me double check.

Actually, let me find a configuration where we have direction X from $z$ to $x$, and check if it's consistent with the constraints:

For Northeast:
- The configuration would have $x$ at a position like $(+, +)$ relative to $z$. If we set $y$ at a position like $(2, 1)$ (which is East of $z$), and $x$ at a position like $(1, 2)$ (which is Southwest of $y$, even though that's a very horizontal "Southwest"), then $x$ would be at $(2, 1) + (-1, 1) = (1, 2)$ relative to $z$, which is indeed Northeast.

Let me try to be a bit more careful, by fully constraining the cardinal directions. For y to be East of z, we should have y located in the quadrant between Northeast and Southeast, but closer to East than to either of those. For x to be Southwest of y, we should have x located in the quadrant between South and West, but equidistant from those two.

Now, with these constraints, we want to decide which locations are possible for $x$ with respect to $z$.

Here's a simple approach I can try: if $z$ is at the origin, $y$ is at some point along the positive x-axis, and $x$ is at a location that's southwest of that point, then I can draw that out, and determine the possible directions from $z$ to $x$.

Let's actually use the "standard" definitions of the cardinal directions. If we say y is East of z, we mean that y is in the East direction from z, not Northeast or Southeast. Similarly, if x is Southwest of y, we mean that x is in the Southwest direction from y, not South or West.

Given these, if y is at a position $(+, 0)$ relative to z, and x is at a position $(-a, -a)$ relative to y (for some $a > 0$), then $x$ is at a position $(+ - a, -a)$ relative to z. If the positive value (from the East direction) is greater than $a$, then $x$ is Southeast of $z$. If the positive value is equal to $a$, then $x$ is South of $z$. If the positive value is less than $a$, then $x$ is Southwest of $z$.

So, with the "standard" interpretations of the cardinal directions, the possible directional relations between $x$ and $z$ are Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Whew, that confirms my original answer! I am going to say that the possible relations are Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Actually, I was overthinking things a bit. With the standard interpretations of cardinal directions, the possible directional relations between $x$ and $z$ are indeed Southeast, South, and Southwest.

Southeast
