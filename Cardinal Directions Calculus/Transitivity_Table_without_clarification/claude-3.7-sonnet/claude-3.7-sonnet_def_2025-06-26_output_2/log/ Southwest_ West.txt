PROMPT: Let  Southwest and  West be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Southwest of region y and region y is  West of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's consider what it means for region x to be Southwest of region y. Southwest is a cone-shaped region in the southwest direction. So x is located in the southwest direction from y.

Let's also consider what it means for region y to be West of region z. West is a cone-shaped region in the west direction. So y is located in the west direction from z.

So we have:
- x is Southwest of y
- y is West of z

Now we need to determine the possible cardinal direction relation between x and z.

Let's think step by step. I'll introduce a coordinate system where the positive x-axis points East and the positive y-axis points North.

If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- x would be in the Southwest quadrant, so x would have coordinates (-a, -b) for some positive values a and b.
- z would be in the East direction from y, so z would have coordinates (c, 0) for some positive value c.

But since the problem states that y is West of z, I need to adjust my reference point. 

If z is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- y would be in the West direction from z, so y would have coordinates (-c, 0) for some positive value c.
- x would be in the Southwest direction from y, so x would have coordinates (-c-a, -b) for some positive values a and b.

Now, relative to z at the origin, x is at (-c-a, -b), which is in the Southwest quadrant. So one possible relation is that x is Southwest of z.

But let's think more carefully. Southwest is a specific cone-shaped region, and West is another cone-shaped region. The exact relation between x and z depends on the precise angles and how these regions are defined.

Let's consider a more precise definition. Suppose we define:
- West: Points with angles between 135° and 225° (where 0° is East, 90° is North, etc.)
- Southwest: Points with angles between 225° and 315°

Now, if y is West of z, it means y is somewhere in the cone from 135° to 225° relative to z. And if x is Southwest of y, it means x is somewhere in the cone from 225° to 315° relative to y.

Depending on where exactly y is within the West cone relative to z, and where exactly x is within the Southwest cone relative to y, the relation between x and z could vary.

If y is exactly West of z (at 180°), and x is exactly Southwest of y (at 270°), then x would be in the Southwest direction from z.

If y is at the border between West and Southwest relative to z (at 225°), and x is in the Southwest direction from y, then x could be in the South or Southwest direction from z, depending on the exact angle.

If y is at the border between West and Northwest relative to z (at 135°), and x is in the Southwest direction from y, then x could be in the West or Southwest direction from z, depending on the exact angle.

So I think the possible relations between x and z could be West, Southwest, or South. Let me try to confirm this with a more rigorous analysis.

Actually, I need to be more systematic about this. Let me consider the cardinal direction relations as regions in the 2D plane:

- North (N): The cone from 45° to 135°
- Northeast (NE): The cone from 0° to 45°
- East (E): The cone from 315° to 45°
- Southeast (SE): The cone from 270° to 315°
- South (S): The cone from 225° to 270°
- Southwest (SW): The cone from 180° to 225°
- West (W): The cone from 135° to 180°
- Northwest (NW): The cone from 90° to 135°

Now, if y is West of z, it means y is in the cone from 135° to 180° relative to z. And if x is Southwest of y, it means x is in the cone from 180° to 225° relative to y.

Now I need to consider how to combine these directions. If I place y at different positions within the West cone relative to z, and then place x at different positions within the Southwest cone relative to y, what are the possible positions of x relative to z?

I think I need to be more careful about the definitions of cardinal directions. Let me use a slightly different convention where cardinal directions are defined as follows:

- North (N): The region where the angle is 90°
- Northeast (NE): The region where the angle is between 0° and 90°
- East (E): The region where the angle is 0°
- Southeast (SE): The region where the angle is between 0° and -90°
- South (S): The region where the angle is -90°
- Southwest (SW): The region where the angle is between -90° and 180°
- West (W): The region where the angle is 180°
- Northwest (NW): The region where the angle is between 90° and 180°

No, this doesn't seem right either. The definition of cardinal directions in terms of angles is not standard. Let me revise my approach.

I'll think of cardinal directions in terms of quadrants and axes:

- North (N): The positive y-axis
- Northeast (NE): The first quadrant (positive x, positive y)
- East (E): The positive x-axis
- Southeast (SE): The fourth quadrant (positive x, negative y)
- South (S): The negative y-axis
- Southwest (SW): The third quadrant (negative x, negative y)
- West (W): The negative x-axis
- Northwest (NW): The second quadrant (negative x, positive y)

Actually, I'm starting to get confused due to different conventions. Let me start over with a clearer definition.

In the cardinal direction system, space is divided into 9 regions: the 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) and the "bounding box" (B), which is the region that overlaps with the original region.

For simplicity, let me only focus on the problem at hand, which is the composition of Southwest and West. I'll define these directions as follows:

- West (W): The region where the x-coordinate is negative and the y-coordinate is 0
- Southwest (SW): The region where both the x-coordinate and y-coordinate are negative

Now, if y is West of z, it means that y is in the West region relative to z, so y has a negative x-coordinate and a y-coordinate of 0 relative to z.

And if x is Southwest of y, it means that x is in the Southwest region relative to y, so x has negative x and y coordinates relative to y.

Combining these, we find that x has a negative x-coordinate and a negative y-coordinate relative to z, which means x is in the Southwest region relative to z.

But wait, I've been thinking about this in terms of points, not regions. Regions have extended areas, so I need to think about how regions can relate to each other in terms of cardinal directions.

In the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) theory, we often use the notion of minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) to define cardinal direction relations between regions. In this approach, cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) are defined as regions in the plane after dividing it by the MBR of the reference region.

But for this problem, we can use the relationship between reference points (refpoints) of the regions for simplicity. The refpoint of a region can be any point considered representative of the region (e.g., its centroid).

So, if the refpoint of y is West of the refpoint of z, and the refpoint of x is Southwest of the refpoint of y, then the refpoint of x is Southwest of the refpoint of z. This gives us the Southwest relation as one possibility.

But, considering that regions have extent, and depending on the exact shapes and positions of the regions, the relation between x and z could potentially be West or South as well.

Let me reason through this more carefully.

If region y is West of region z, it means that the entirety of y lies in the western half-plane of z. That is, y is entirely to the west of z.

If region x is Southwest of region y, it means that the entirety of x lies in the southwestern quadrant of y. That is, x is entirely to the southwest of y.

So x is southwest of y, and y is west of z. Let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z.

Since y is west of z, y is to the left of z. And since x is southwest of y, x is to the left and below y. So x is to the left and below z, which means x is in the southwest quadrant of z. Therefore, x is Southwest of z.

But wait, let me reconsider. Let's be precise about the definitions:

- West (W): The region where the x-coordinate is less than the reference and the y-coordinate is within the y-range of the reference
- Southwest (SW): The region where the x-coordinate is less than the reference and the y-coordinate is less than the y-range of the reference

Now, if y is West of z, it means that all of y is to the left of z, and at least partly at the same height as z.

If x is Southwest of y, it means that all of x is to the left of y and all of x is below y.

So, relative to z, x is definitely to the left (because it's to the left of y, which is to the left of z). And x is below y, which is at the same height as z, so x is below z. This places x in the Southwest quadrant relative to z.

Actually, I'm getting confused because I'm trying to use different definitions of cardinal directions (half-planes, quadrants, etc.). Let me try a different approach.

In the context of RCC (Region Connection Calculus), cardinal directions are often defined using the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) of the regions. The MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region and has sides parallel to the x and y axes.

Given two regions A and B, the cardinal direction relation from A to B is determined by the relative position of B's MBR with respect to A's MBR. The space is divided into 9 tiles by A's MBR: the 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) and the "bounding box" (B), which is the region that overlaps with A's MBR.

So, if region y is West of region z, it means that y's MBR is entirely to the left of z's MBR. And if region x is Southwest of region y, it means that x's MBR is entirely to the left and below y's MBR.

This means that x's MBR is to the left of y's MBR, which is to the left of z's MBR. So x's MBR is to the left of z's MBR. And x's MBR is below y's MBR, which is at the same height or partially overlapping in height with z's MBR. This means that x's MBR could be below z's MBR, or it could partially overlap in height with z's MBR.

If x's MBR is both to the left and below z's MBR, then x is Southwest of z. But if x's MBR is to the left of z's MBR and partially overlaps in height with z's MBR, then x is West of z.

Wait, there's something off here. Let me check the definition of West and Southwest in the cardinal direction system:

- West (W): The region to the left of the reference region
- Southwest (SW): The region to the left and below the reference region

So if y is West of z, it means that y is entirely to the left of z. And if x is Southwest of y, it means that x is entirely to the left and below y.

Now, if x is to the left and below y, and y is to the left of z, then x is to the left of z. And since x is below y, and y is not specified to be above or below z, it's possible that x is below z, in which case x is Southwest of z. But it's also possible that x is at the same height as z, in which case x is West of z.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. For y to be in the West cone of z, we require that y is directly west of z. But for x to be in the southwest cone of y, we need x to be to the left and below y. Since y is directly west of z (at the same latitude), and x is to the left and below y, x must be to the left and below z. This places x in the southwest cone of z. So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

Actually, let me double check something. In the RCC framework, the cardinal directions are defined by the MBRs of the regions, not by the fact that one region is directly west of another. So, when we say "y is West of z", it doesn't necessarily mean that y is directly west of z (at the same latitude), it means that y's MBR is to the left of z's MBR. They could still overlap in the north-south direction.

Let me start with a clean slate and use a systematic approach. For simplicity, I'll represent regions x, y, and z as their MBRs, which are rectangles.

If y is West of z, it means that y's MBR is entirely to the left of z's MBR. In other words, the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z.

If x is Southwest of y, it means that x's MBR is both to the left and below y's MBR. In other words, the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y, and the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of y.

Now, let's see what this tells us about the relation between x and z:

1. The rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y (since x is Southwest of y).
2. The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z (since y is West of z).

From 1 and 2, it follows that the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z. So x is to the left of z.

Also, the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of y (since x is Southwest of y). But we don't know the exact vertical relation between y and z, except that they may overlap in the vertical direction (since y is West of z).

If the bottommost point of y is above the topmost point of z, then the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of y, which is above the topmost point of z, so the topmost point of x is above the topmost point of z. But this would mean that x is to the left of z but not necessarily below it, so x could be West of z.

If the bottommost point of y is at the same height as the topmost point of z, then the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of y, which is at the same height as the topmost point of z, so the topmost point of x is below the topmost point of z. But again, this doesn't guarantee that x is below z, so x could be West of z.

But there are other cases where the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of z, which would place x both to the left and below z, so x would be Southwest of z.

In summary, depending on the exact vertical relation between y and z, and the exact vertical relation between x and y, the relation between x and z could be either West or Southwest.

Hmm, but I think I'm still getting confused. Let me try a different approach using a simple 2D coordinate system, where the positive x-axis points East and the positive y-axis points North.

In this system:
- A region is West of the reference if its x-coordinates are less than the reference's x-coordinates.
- A region is Southwest of the reference if its x-coordinates are less than the reference's x-coordinates and its y-coordinates are less than the reference's y-coordinates.

So if y is West of z, it means that y's x-coordinates are less than z's x-coordinates. And if x is Southwest of y, it means that x's x-coordinates are less than y's x-coordinates and x's y-coordinates are less than y's y-coordinates.

From these, we can deduce that x's x-coordinates are less than z's x-coordinates. And x's y-coordinates are less than y's y-coordinates, but we don't know the relation between y's y-coordinates and z's y-coordinates. So, depending on this relation, x's y-coordinates could be less than z's y-coordinates, or they could be in the same range, or they could be greater.

If x's y-coordinates are less than z's y-coordinates, then x is Southwest of z.
If x's y-coordinates are in the same range as z's y-coordinates, then x is West of z.
If x's y-coordinates are greater than z's y-coordinates, then x is Northwest of z.

But wait, for x to be Northwest of z, we would need x's y-coordinates to be greater than z's y-coordinates. But since x's y-coordinates are less than y's y-coordinates, and for x to be Northwest of z, y's y-coordinates would need to be greater than z's y-coordinates, the only way this could happen is if there's a specific relationship between the y-coordinates, which isn't specified in the problem.

Let me re-re-think this, now with a direct approach, and understand the cardinal directions just as I described above, where the positive x-axis points East and the positive y-axis points North. And for each cardinal direction:

- North (N): The region where the y-coordinate is greater than the reference and the x-coordinate is in the same range as the reference.
- Northeast (NE): The region where the x-coordinate is greater than the reference and the y-coordinate is greater than the reference.
- East (E): The region where the x-coordinate is greater than the reference and the y-coordinate is in the same range as the reference.
- Southeast (SE): The region where the x-coordinate is greater than the reference and the y-coordinate is less than the reference.
- South (S): The region where the y-coordinate is less than the reference and the x-coordinate is in the same range as the reference.
- Southwest (SW): The region where the x-coordinate is less than the reference and the y-coordinate is less than the reference.
- West (W): The region where the x-coordinate is less than the reference and the y-coordinate is in the same range as the reference.
- Northwest (NW): The region where the x-coordinate is less than the reference and the y-coordinate is greater than the reference.

For simplicity, let's consider the regions as single points. If region y is at point (0, 0), and region z is at point (1, 0), then y is West of z. And if region x is at point (-1, -1), then x is Southwest of y. Relative to z, x is at point (-2, -1), which is to the left and below z, so x is Southwest of z.

But if region z is at point (1, 1), then y is West of z (since y is at (0, 0)), and x is still Southwest of y. Relative to z, x is at point (-1, -1), which is to the left and below z, so x is Southwest of z.

What if region z is at point (1, -1)? Then y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. Relative to z, x is at point (-1, -1), which is to the left of z, but at the same height, so x is West of z.

And if region z is at point (1, -2)? Then y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y. Relative to z, x is at point (-1, 0), which is to the left of z, and above z, so x is Northwest of z.

So it looks like the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, West, or Northwest.

Actually, I made a mistake in my calculation. If y is at (0, 0) and z is at (1, -2), then x is at (-1, -1) relative to y, so x is at (-1, -1) in the absolute reference frame. Then relative to z at (1, -2), x is at (-2, 1), which is Northwest of z.

Now I'm starting to doubt my understanding of the cardinal directions. Let me double check.

Actually, the issue might be in my understanding of what it means for a region to be West of another. If region y is West of region z, it doesn't necessarily mean that y is directly west of z (at the same latitude). It means that y's MBR is entirely to the left of z's MBR, but they could overlap in the north-south direction.

So, when we say "y is West of z", it means that y's x-coordinates are less than z's x-coordinates, but y's y-coordinates could be less than, equal to, or greater than z's y-coordinates.

And when we say "x is Southwest of y", it means that x's x-coordinates are less than y's x-coordinates and x's y-coordinates are less than y's y-coordinates.

With these definitions, if y is West of z, and x is Southwest of y, we can deduce that x's x-coordinates are less than z's x-coordinates. But the relation between x's y-coordinates and z's y-coordinates depends on the relation between y's y-coordinates and z's y-coordinates, which is not specified in the problem.

If y's y-coordinates are the same as z's y-coordinates, and x's y-coordinates are less than y's y-coordinates, then x's y-coordinates are less than z's y-coordinates, so x is Southwest of z.

If y's y-coordinates are less than z's y-coordinates, and x's y-coordinates are less than y's y-coordinates, then x's y-coordinates are less than z's y-coordinates, so x is Southwest of z.

If y's y-coordinates are greater than z's y-coordinates, then the relation between x's y-coordinates and z's y-coordinates depends on the specific values. If x's y-coordinates are less than z's y-coordinates, then x is Southwest of z. If x's y-coordinates are the same as z's y-coordinates, then x is West of z. If x's y-coordinates are greater than z's y-coordinates, then x is Northwest of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, West, and Northwest. But we can narrow this down further by understanding the exact definition of West and Southwest.

Actually, let me revisit the definitions of the cardinal directions once more. The cardinal direction system divides the space into 9 tiles based on the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the reference region. The 9 tiles are the 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) and the "bounding box" (B), which is the region that overlaps with the reference's MBR.

Given a reference region R, another region S is:
- North (N) of R if its MBR is above R's MBR
- Northeast (NE) of R if its MBR is above and to the right of R's MBR
- East (E) of R if its MBR is to the right of R's MBR
- Southeast (SE) of R if its MBR is below and to the right of R's MBR
- South (S) of R if its MBR is below R's MBR
- Southwest (SW) of R if its MBR is below and to the left of R's MBR
- West (W) of R if its MBR is to the left of R's MBR
- Northwest (NW) of R if its MBR is above and to the left of R's MBR
- Bounding box (B) of R if its MBR overlaps with R's MBR

With these definitions, if y is West of z, it means that y's MBR is to the left of z's MBR. And if x is Southwest of y, it means that x's MBR is below and to the left of y's MBR.

So, x's MBR is to the left of y's MBR, which is to the left of z's MBR. This means that x's MBR is to the left of z's MBR. And x's MBR is below y's MBR. But we don't know the vertical relation between y's MBR and z's MBR. So depending on this relation, x's MBR could be below z's MBR, or it could overlap with z's MBR vertically, or it could be above z's MBR.

If x's MBR is below z's MBR, then x is Southwest of z.
If x's MBR overlaps with z's MBR vertically, then x is West of z.
If x's MBR is above z's MBR, then x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Hmm I'm getting a bit stuck here, let me draw this out precisely. Let's try to specify the regions as MBRs (Minimum Bounding Rectangles) with explicit coordinates to help us understand the possible relationships.

Let's say the MBR of y is given by the rectangle with corners at (y_left, y_bottom) and (y_right, y_top).

Similarly, the MBR of z is given by the rectangle with corners at (z_left, z_bottom) and (z_right, z_top).

Now, for y to be West of z, we need y_right < z_left, meaning that the rightmost edge of y is to the left of the leftmost edge of z.

And, for x to be Southwest of y, we need both x_right < y_left (x is to the left of y) and x_top < y_bottom (x is below y).

Now, let's see what constraints these give us on the relationship between x and z:

From x_right < y_left and y_right < z_left, we can deduce that x_right < z_left, which means that x is to the left of z.

From x_top < y_bottom, we get a constraint on the vertical relationship between x and y. But to determine the vertical relationship between x and z, we would need to know the relationship between y_bottom and z_bottom (or y_top and z_top), which is not given.

If y_bottom > z_top, then y is completely above z. In this case, from x_top < y_bottom, we can deduce that x_top < z_top, which means that x is either below z or at the same height as z. Since x is to the left of z, the relation could be either Southwest or West.

If y_bottom <= z_top and y_top >= z_bottom, then y and z overlap in the vertical direction. In this case, x could be below z (Southwest relation), at the same height as z (West relation), or above z (Northwest relation), depending on the specific values.

If y_top < z_bottom, then y is completely below z. In this case, from x_top < y_bottom, we can deduce that x_top < z_bottom, which means that x is below z. Since x is also to the left of z, the relation is Southwest.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be Southwest, West, or Northwest.

Actually hold on. Let me reconsider the exact definitions of the cardinal directions for clarity:

North (N): y_bottom > ref_top (the entire region is above the reference)
Northeast (NE): y_bottom > ref_top and x_left > ref_right (the entire region is above and to the right of the reference)
East (E): x_left > ref_right (the entire region is to the right of the reference)
Southeast (SE): y_top < ref_bottom and x_left > ref_right (the entire region is below and to the right of the reference)
South (S): y_top < ref_bottom (the entire region is below the reference)
Southwest (SW): y_top < ref_bottom and x_right < ref_left (the entire region is below and to the left of the reference)
West (W): x_right < ref_left (the entire region is to the left of the reference)
Northwest (NW): y_bottom > ref_top and x_right < ref_left (the entire region is above and to the left of the reference)

With these definitions, if y is West of z, then y_right < z_left. And if x is Southwest of y, then x_top < y_bottom and x_right < y_left.

So we have:
y_right < z_left
x_top < y_bottom
x_right < y_left

From y_right < z_left and x_right < y_left, we can deduce that x_right < z_left, which means that x is West of z.

But being West of z doesn't fully describe the relationship, since x could also be below z (making it Southwest of z), or it could be above z (making it Northwest of z), or it could overlap with z vertically (making it just West of z).

Actually, no—while x is to the left of z (i.e., x_right < z_left), we don't have enough information to determine the vertical relationship between x and z. The only vertical relationship we know is that x is below y (i.e., x_top < y_bottom). But we don't know the vertical relationship between y and z.

So let's consider the different possibilities for the vertical relationship between y and z:

1. y could be above z (i.e., y_bottom > z_top)
2. y could overlap with z vertically (i.e., y_bottom <= z_top and y_top >= z_bottom)
3. y could be below z (i.e., y_top < z_bottom)

Let's consider each case:

Case 1: y is above z. Since x is below y, but we don't know if x is below z, at the same height as z, or above z, the relation between x and z could be Southwest, West, or Northwest.

Case 2: y overlaps with z vertically. Since x is below y, but we don't know if x is below z, at the same height as z, or above z, the relation between x and z could be Southwest, West, or Northwest.

Case 3: y is below z. Since x is below y, and y is below z, we know that x is below z. So the relation between x and z is Southwest.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Actually, wait. West and Northwest can't happen. Let me think this through again. 

We have:
y_right < z_left
x_top < y_bottom
x_right < y_left

Let's also define the MBR of x with corners at (x_left, x_bottom) and (x_right, x_top).

To determine the relation between x and z, we need to compare x_right with z_left, and x_top with z_bottom.

From the given constraints, we know that x_right < z_left, so x is to the left of z.

Now, for the vertical relationship, we know that x_top < y_bottom. But to determine the relation between x_top and z_bottom, we need to know the relation between y_bottom and z_bottom, which is not given.

Actually, since y is West of z, it means that y_right < z_left. The West relation doesn't constrain the vertical positions of y and z, so y could be above, below, or at the same height as z.

So, depending on the vertical positions of y and z, and the exact value of x_top, the relation between x and z could be:
- Southwest (if x is below z)
- West (if x is at the same height as z)
- Northwest (if x is above z)

Wait, I think I've been overthinking this. The cardinal direction system does not impose the constraint that y_right < z_left for y to be West of z. Instead, it only requires that y is in the West tile of z, which means that y is to the left of z's MBR and it could be above, below, or at the same height as z.

But I think that's exactly what I've been saying. For y to be West of z, y must be to the left of z (i.e., y_right < z_left). The vertical relationship between y and z is not constrained by the West relation.

Hmm, I'm getting caught in a loop here. Ok, let me just restate: y is West of z means that y is to the left of z, and there's no constraint on the vertical relationship. x is Southwest of y means that x is to the left of y and below y.

Given that y is to the left of z, and x is to the left of y, we know that x is to the left of z. And given that x is below y, but without knowing the vertical relationship between y and z, we can't determine the vertical relationship between x and z. So the relation between x and z could be Southwest, West, or Northwest, depending on the vertical positions of y and z relative to each other.

Hmm, I think I'm now confused about the exact definitions. Let me see from the start. The cardinal directions are defined by the MBR of the reference region. Let's assume we are working with a standard MBR system where:

- North (N): The region is completely above the reference.
- Northeast (NE): The region is completely above and to the right of the reference.
- East (E): The region is completely to the right of the reference.
- Southeast (SE): The region is completely below and to the right of the reference.
- South (S): The region is completely below the reference.
- Southwest (SW): The region is completely below and to the left of the reference.
- West (W): The region is completely to the left of the reference.
- Northwest (NW): The region is completely above and to the left of the reference.

For this problem, the constraints we have:
- y is West of z: y is completely to the left of z.
- x is Southwest of y: x is completely to the left and below y.

Given these, we want to determine the possible relations between x and z. Now, if we try to visualize our scenario:

1. If z is placed arbitrarily (say at the origin), then y must be somewhere to the left of z.
2. Given y's position, x must be somewhere to the left and below y.

Now, let's consider the relation between x and z. We know x is to the left of y, which is to the left of z, so x is to the left of z. But the vertical relation is less clear:

- If y is above z (y_bottom > z_top), then x, being below y, could still be above, at the same level, or below z. So the relation could be Northwest, West, or Southwest.
- If y is at the same level as z (y_bottom <= z_top and y_top >= z_bottom), then x, being below y, would be below z. So the relation would be Southwest.
- If y is below z (y_top < z_bottom), then x, being below y, would definitely be below z. So the relation would be Southwest.

This means the relation between x and z could be Northwest, West, or Southwest.

Actually, I think I was overthinking the problem. To reiterate:

1. If region y is West of region z, it means that y is entirely to the left of z.
2. If region x is Southwest of region y, it means that x is entirely to the left and below y.

Given these, we know that x is to the left of y, which is to the left of z. So x is to the left of z.

For the vertical relation, we know that x is below y. But we don't have direct information about the vertical relation between y and z, or by extension, between x and z.

- If y is above z, then x could be above, at the same level, or below z, leading to a relation of Northwest, West, or Southwest.
- If y is at the same level as z, then x, being below y, would be below z, making the relation Southwest.
- If y is below z, then x, being below y, would be below z, making the relation Southwest.

So the relation between x and z could be Southwest, West, or Northwest.

Actually I think I now found my mistake. I messed up the semantics of y is at the "same level" of z. Let me be precise:

For y to be strictly West of z, it means that y is to the left of z, and the vertical extents of y and z overlap. That is, y_right < z_left and !(y_top < z_bottom) and !(y_bottom > z_top). And for x to be strictly Southwest of y, it means that x is to the left and below y. That is, x_right < y_left and x_top < y_bottom.

Now, if y is West of z and x is Southwest of y, then x is to the left of z (since x is to the left of y, which is to the left of z). And x is below y. But we can't immediately tell if x is below z, because the vertical relation between y and z depends on the exact positions.

If y overlaps with z vertically, then parts of y are at the same height as parts of z. But other parts of y could be above or below z. Since x is below y, and parts of y are at the same height as z, x is likely below z. But without knowing the exact vertical extents, we can't be certain.

Hmm, but this seems weird. The cardinal direction West is a cone-shaped region, not a rectangle. So I think my definitions might still be off. I'm going to rethink the definition of West and Southwest.

Maybe a better way to think about it is to use the centroid of the regions. Let's denote the centroids as follows:

- Centroid of x: (x_cx, x_cy)
- Centroid of y: (y_cx, y_cy)
- Centroid of z: (z_cx, z_cy)

For y to be West of z, it means that y_cx < z_cx and y_cy is "approximately" equal to z_cy. And for x to be Southwest of y, it means that x_cx < y_cx and x_cy < y_cy.

Given these, we can deduce that x_cx < z_cx. And if y_cy is approximately equal to z_cy, and x_cy < y_cy, then x_cy < z_cy. This would make x Southwest of z.

Hmm, this doesn't seem right either, since West doesn't mean that the centroids must be at the same latitude.

Actaully, I realize that my interpretation was correct the first time. It's better to think of cardinal directions as regions defined in relation to a reference object. These regions are often defined using the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) of the reference:

- North (N): The region above the MBR of the reference.
- Northeast (NE): The region above and to the right of the MBR of the reference.
- East (E): The region to the right of the MBR of the reference.
- Southeast (SE): The region below and to the right of the MBR of the reference.
- South (S): The region below the MBR of the reference.
- Southwest (SW): The region below and to the left of the MBR of the reference.
- West (W): The region to the left of the MBR of the reference.
- Northwest (NW): The region above and to the left of the MBR of the reference.

With these definitions, if y is West of z, it means that y is in the West region of z, which means that y is to the left of z (i.e., y_right < z_left). Similarly, if x is Southwest of y, it means that x is in the Southwest region of y, which means that x is to the left and below y (i.e., x_right < y_left and x_top < y_bottom).

Now, given that y is West of z and x is Southwest of y, we want to determine the region of z in which x is located. We know that x is to the left of y, which is to the left of z, so x is to the left of z (i.e., x_right < z_left).

For the vertical relation, we know that x is below y (i.e., x_top < y_bottom), but we don't have direct information about the vertical relation between y and z. So the vertical relation between x and z depends on the vertical relation between y and z.

If y is above z (i.e., y_bottom > z_top), then x, being below y, could be above, at the same level, or below z. So the relation between x and z could be Northwest, West, or Southwest.
If y overlaps with z vertically (i.e., y_bottom <= z_top and y_top >= z_bottom), then the relation between x and z depends on the exact vertical positions. If x is below z, then the relation is Southwest. If x is at the same level as z, then the relation is West. If x is above z, then the relation is Northwest.
If y is below z (i.e., y_top < z_bottom), then x, being below y, is below z. So the relation is Southwest.

So, in general, the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Actually, what if we take cardinal directions to be relations that provide a partial ordering between regions, rather than absolute positions. That is, if y is West of z, then y is to the left of z (i.e., y_right < z_left). And if x is Southwest of y, then x is to the left and below y (i.e., x_right < y_left and x_top < y_bottom).

Then, if y is West of z and x is Southwest of y, we can deduce that x is to the left of z (i.e., x_right < z_left). But we can't immediately determine the vertical relation between x and z without knowing the vertical relation between y and z.

I keep going in circles. I'm going to take a step back and try a different approach.

Let me think about this in terms of the relative positions of the regions in a 2D coordinate system. Given that region x is Southwest of region y, and region y is West of region z, we want to know the possible relations between region x and region z.

I'll define the cardinal directions as follows:
- North (N): The region is directly above the reference.
- Northeast (NE): The region is above and to the right of the reference.
- East (E): The region is directly to the right of the reference.
- Southeast (SE): The region is below and to the right of the reference.
- South (S): The region is directly below the reference.
- Southwest (SW): The region is below and to the left of the reference.
- West (W): The region is directly to the left of the reference.
- Northwest (NW): The region is above and to the left of the reference.

Given these definitions, we have:
- y is West of z: y is directly to the left of z.
- x is Southwest of y: x is below and to the left of y.

So, we know that y is to the left of z, and x is to the left of y. This means that x is to the left of z.

Also, we know that x is below y, but we don't know the vertical relation between y and z. y could be above, below, or at the same level as z.

If y is above z, and x is below y, then x could be above, below, or at the same level as z. So the relation between x and z could be Northwest, Southwest, or West, respectively.
If y is at the same level as z, and x is below y, then x is below z. So the relation is Southwest.
If y is below z, and x is below y, then x is below z. So the relation is Southwest.

So the relation between x and z could be Northwest, West, or Southwest.

OK wait, if y is West of z, that doesn't mean that y is exactly directly to the left of z (i.e., with the same vertical coordinate). That's an incorrect interpretation of "West". West means the region is to the left of the reference, which doesn't constrain the vertical relationship at all.

Let me be very explicit. The cardinal directions are often defined in terms of the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) of the regions, where the MBR is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region and has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

For a region to be West of a reference, it means that the region's MBR is entirely to the left of the reference's MBR. For a region to be Southwest of a reference, it means that the region's MBR is entirely to the left and below the reference's MBR.

To make this even more explicit, let me define the exact relations in terms of the corners of the MBRs. If the MBR of a region is given by the rectangle with corners at (left, bottom) and (right, top), then:

For y to be West of z: y_right < z_left
For x to be Southwest of y: x_right < y_left and x_top < y_bottom

Given these, and the fact that y is West of z and x is Southwest of y, we have:
y_right < z_left
x_right < y_left and x_top < y_bottom

From y_right < z_left and x_right < y_left, we can deduce that x_right < z_left, which means that x is to the left of z. But the vertical relation between x and z depends on the vertical relation between y and z, which is not constrained by y being West of z.

Depending on the vertical positions of y and z, and the exact value of x_top, x could be below, at the same level, or above z. So the relation between x and z could be Southwest, West, or Northwest, respectively.

In fact, I've spent too long on this problem. I'll now just consider the different cardinal directions.

- North (N): y_bottom > ref_top
- Northeast (NE): y_bottom > ref_top and y_left > ref_right
- East (E): y_left > ref_right
- Southeast (SE): y_top < ref_bottom and y_left > ref_right
- South (S): y_top < ref_bottom
- Southwest (SW): y_top < ref_bottom and y_right < ref_left
- West (W): y_right < ref_left
- Northwest (NW): y_bottom > ref_top and y_right < ref_left

Or, equivalently, the cardinal directions can be determined using the centroids of the regions:

- North (N): The centroid of the region is directly above the centroid of the reference.
- Northeast (NE): The centroid of the region is above and to the right of the centroid of the reference.
- East (E): The centroid of the region is directly to the right of the centroid of the reference.
- Southeast (SE): The centroid of the region is below and to the right of the centroid of the reference.
- South (S): The centroid of the region is directly below the centroid of the reference.
- Southwest (SW): The centroid of the region is below and to the left of the centroid of the reference.
- West (W): The centroid of the region is directly to the left of the centroid of the reference.
- Northwest (NW): The centroid of the region is above and to the left of the centroid of the reference.

Actually, I'm not going to use the centroid for interpretation because that is sensitive to the region's shape. I'll stick with the MBRs, which are sensitive only to the extremities of the region.

For x to be Southwest of y (denoted as SW(x,y)), it means that:
- x_right < y_left (i.e. x is to the left of y)
- x_top < y_bottom (i.e. x is below y)

For y to be West of z (denoted as W(y,z)), it means that:
- y_right < z_left (i.e. y is to the left of z)

These two relationships allow us to establish that x_right < z_left (i.e. x is to the left of z). But this isn't enough to fully specify the relation between x and z because we don't know the vertical relationship.

The relation could be:
- SW(x,z) if x_top < z_bottom (i.e. x is below z)
- W(x,z) if x_bottom <= z_top and x_top >= z_bottom (i.e. x and z overlap vertically)
- NW(x,z) if x_bottom > z_top (i.e. x is above z)

But we can narrow down the possibilities based on the given relationships. Since x is below y (i.e. x_top < y_bottom), and y's vertical relationship with z is not constrained, we have the following cases:

1. If y is above z (i.e. y_bottom > z_top), then x, being below y, could be above, at the same level, or below z. So the relation could be NW(x,z), W(x,z), or SW(x,z).
2. If y overlaps with z vertically (i.e. y_bottom <= z_top and y_top >= z_bottom), then x, being below y, could be at the same level or below z. So the relation could be W(x,z) or SW(x,z).
3. If y is below z (i.e. y_top < z_bottom), then x, being below y, is below z. So the relation is SW(x,z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Finally, I'm a bit doubtful that the Northwest direction is possible, because for x to be Northwest of z, it would need to be above z. But given that x is below y, and we don't have information about the relative heights of y and z, it's not clear if x could be above z. Actually, it can.

If y_bottom > z_top (i.e. y is above z), and x_top < y_bottom (i.e. x is below y), but x_bottom > z_top, then x is above z. So the relation would be Northwest.

So the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually, using the standard definitions of cardinal directions, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, and Southwest. I think my final answer is correct. Due to the constraints of the problem, we know that x is to the left of z. But the vertical relation between x and z depends on the vertical relation between y and z, which is not constrained by y being West of z.

(And by vertical I mean the North-South axis; and by horizontal I mean the East-West axis)

So the answer is: Northwest, West, Southwest. That is my final answer. Actually you know what, let me double check. 

So we have:
- x is Southwest of y: x is to the left and below y.
- y is West of z: y is to the left of z.

Let's denote the locations of regions x, y, and z using a coordinate system, where the positive x-axis points East, and the positive y-axis points North. For simplicity, let's represent each region as a point at its centroid.

The fact that x is Southwest of y means that x_x < y_x and x_y < y_y.
The fact that y is West of z means that y_x < z_x.

Combining these, we get x_x < z_x, which means x is to the left of z. But the vertical relation between x and z depends on the vertical relation between y and z, which is not constrained by y being West of z.

If y_y > z_y (i.e., y is to the north of z), then x_y < y_y, but we don't know if x_y is greater than, less than, or equal to z_y. If x_y > z_y, then x is Northwest of z. If x_y = z_y, then x is West of z. If x_y < z_y, then x is Southwest of z.

If y_y = z_y (i.e., y is at the same latitude as z), then x_y < y_y = z_y, which means x is to the south of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the left of z, this makes x Southwest of z.

If y_y < z_y (i.e., y is to the south of z), then x_y < y_y < z_y, which means x is to the south of z. Combined with the fact that x is to the left of z, this makes x Southwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Actually actually - I'm now very confused because I think I'm overthinking this problem.  What I have been doing in the last few paragraphs is correct, I think. Let's just formulate it as simply as possible. Actually I think the problem is that I have gone back and forth on the exact definitions of the cardinal directions. OK, so the correct understanding is:

North: The region is above the reference.
Northeast: The region is above and to the right of the reference.
East: The region is to the right of the reference.
Southeast: The region is below and to the right of the reference.
South: The region is below the reference.
Southwest: The region is below and to the left of the reference.
West: The region is to the left of the reference.
Northwest: The region is above and to the left of the reference.

The fact that y is West of z means that y is to the left of z. The vertical relationship between y and z is not constrained by this. The fact that x is Southwest of y means that x is to the left and below y. This means that x is to the left of z (because x is to the left of y, which is to the left of z). But the vertical relationship between x and z depends on the vertical relationship between y and z, which is not constrained by y being West of z.

If y is above z, then x, being below y, could be above, at the same level, or below z. So the relation could be Northwest, West, or Southwest.
If y is at the same level as z, then x, being below y, is below z. So the relation is Southwest.
If y is below z, then x, being below y, is below z. So the relation is Southwest.

So the relation between x and z could be Northwest, West, or Southwest.

OK, so my final answer is: Northwest, West, Southwest.

ANSWER:

To answer this question, I need to determine what cardinal direction relation region x has with region z, given that x is Southwest of y and y is West of z.

Let's analyze what these relations tell us:

- Southwest: Being southwest of a region means being to the left and below that region
- West: Being west of a region means being directly to the left of that region

Given information:
- x is Southwest of y → x is to the left and below y
- y is West of z → y is to the left of z (with no constraint on vertical position)

From these facts:
- Since x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z, then x is definitely to the left of z
- The vertical relationship between x and z depends on the vertical relationship between y and z (which isn't constrained)

Possible scenarios:
1. If y is higher than z: x could be above, at the same level, or below z
2. If y is at the same level as z: x would be below z
3. If y is lower than z: x would be below z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Southwest
- West
- Northwest
