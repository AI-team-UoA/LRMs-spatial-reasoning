PROMPT: Let North and  Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about this. If I'm given that:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let me visualize this in a simple coordinate system.

If region y is Southwest of region z, then z is Northeast of y. So z is both to the north and to the east of y.

Now, x is North of y. So x is to the north of y.

So we have:
- x is North of y
- z is Northeast of y

Let's think about where x could be in relation to z:

1. If x is directly North of y, and z is Northeast of y, then x would be Northwest of z.

2. But wait - let me think more carefully. The cardinal directions can encompass areas, not just exact directions.

If y is Southwest of z, then z is in the Northeast quadrant from y.
If x is North of y, then x is in the North half-plane from y.

So, x could be anywhere in the North half-plane relative to y, and z is in the Northeast quadrant relative to y.

Let's visualize this more carefully:

- If x is directly North of y, and z is directly Northeast of y, then x is Northwest of z.
- If x is slightly Northeast of y (but still North), and z is far Northeast of y, then x could be West of z.
- If x is very far North of y, and z is just slightly Northeast of y, then x could be North of z.
- If x is far Northeast of y, and z is just slightly Northeast of y, then x could be Northeast of z.

So it seems like x could be Northwest, West, North, or Northeast of z, depending on the exact positions.

But wait, I think I need to reconsider. Let me use a simpler approach.

If region y is Southwest of region z, this means:
- z is both to the North and to the East of y.

If region x is North of region y, this means:
- x is to the North of y.

So both x and z are to the North of y, but z is also to the East of y.

Let me draw this out:

```
   N
   |
   |
W--+--E
   |
   |
   S
```

Let's say y is at the origin (0, 0).
If x is North of y, then x could be at coordinates like (0, 1), where the second coordinate is positive, indicating North.
If z is Northeast of y, then z could be at coordinates like (1, 1), where both coordinates are positive, indicating Northeast.

Now, let's consider the relative position of x compared to z.
If x is at (0, 1) and z is at (1, 1), then x is to the West of z. So x is West of z.
If x is at (0, 2) and z is at (1, 1), then x is to the North and West of z. So x is Northwest of z.
If x is at (-1, 1) and z is at (1, 1), then x is to the West of z. So x is West of z.

It seems like x could be West or Northwest of z.

But I'm not covering all possibilities. Let me re-examine the constraints.

If region y is Southwest of region z, this means:
- z is both to the North and to the East of y.

If region x is North of region y, this means:
- x is to the North of y.

The North relation means x is directly North of y, or it can be in the Northwest or Northeast quadrants as long as it's above y.

Let me use a more detailed coordinate system:

```
NW  N  NE
  \ | /
W---+---E
  / | \
SW  S  SE
```

If y is at the center, then:
- x can be in the NW, N, or NE regions from y.
- z is in the NE region from y.

So, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- If x is in the NW region from y, and z is in the NE region from y, then x is to the West or Northwest of z.
- If x is in the N region from y, and z is in the NE region from y, then x is to the West or Northwest of z.
- If x is in the NE region from y, and z is in the NE region from y, then x could be West, Northwest, North, Northeast, or East of z, depending on their exact positions.

This is getting complex, and I'm not sure if I'm approaching it correctly. Let me try another angle.

Actually, let me use a formal cardinal direction system. In the standard 8-direction system:

1. North (N)
2. Northeast (NE)
3. East (E)
4. Southeast (SE)
5. South (S)
6. Southwest (SW)
7. West (W)
8. Northwest (NW)

If y is Southwest of z, then z is Northeast of y.
If x is North of y, then y is South of x.

Now, using coordinate geometry:
If y is at the origin (0, 0):
- z can be at any point in the Northeast quadrant, like (a, b) where a, b > 0.
- x can be at any point in the North half-plane, like (c, d) where d > 0.

The relation between x and z depends on the relative values of a, b, c, and d.

Let's see:
- If c < a, then x is to the West of z.
- If c > a, then x is to the East of z.
- If c = a, then x and z have the same East-West position.

- If d < b, then x is to the South of z.
- If d > b, then x is to the North of z.
- If d = b, then x and z have the same North-South position.

This gives the cardinal direction relation:
- If c < a and d < b, then x is Southwest of z.
- If c < a and d = b, then x is West of z.
- If c < a and d > b, then x is Northwest of z.
- If c = a and d < b, then x is South of z.
- If c = a and d = b, then x and z are at the same position.
- If c = a and d > b, then x is North of z.
- If c > a and d < b, then x is Southeast of z.
- If c > a and d = b, then x is East of z.
- If c > a and d > b, then x is Northeast of z.

However, we have the constraints that z is Northeast of y and x is North of y. Using our coordinates:
- z is at (a, b) where a, b > 0.
- x is at (c, d) where d > 0.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- If c < a and d < b, then x is Southwest of z. However, for x to be North of y, d > 0. For x to be Southwest of z, c < a and d < b. Since a, b > 0 (z is Northeast of y), it's possible for d to be both > 0 and < b. So, x can be Southwest of z.
- If c < a and d = b, then x is West of z. Again, this is consistent with the constraints. So, x can be West of z.
- If c < a and d > b, then x is Northwest of z. This is also consistent. So, x can be Northwest of z.
- If c = a and d < b, then x is South of z. For x to be South of z, d < b. For x to be North of y, d > 0. Again, since b > 0, it's possible for d to be both > 0 and < b. So, x can be South of z.
- If c = a and d = b, then x and z are at the same position. This would mean x is also Northeast of y, which isn't directly given but isn't inconsistent with x being North of y. So, x can be at the same position as z.
- If c = a and d > b, then x is North of z. This is consistent. So, x can be North of z.
- If c > a and d < b, then x is Southeast of z. For x to be Southeast of z, c > a and d < b. For x to be North of y, d > 0. These are consistent. So, x can be Southeast of z.
- If c > a and d = b, then x is East of z. This is consistent. So, x can be East of z.
- If c > a and d > b, then x is Northeast of z. This is also consistent. So, x can be Northeast of z.

But actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it more systematically.

Let me look at the scenario again:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z, which means z is Northeast of y

If y is at the origin (0, 0):
- For x to be North of y, x is at (c, d) where c can be any real number and d > 0.
- For z to be Northeast of y, z is at (a, b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to compare the coordinates of x and z.

Wait, I think I've been making an error. The cardinal direction "North" doesn't mean any point in the North half-plane; it's specifically the North direction. Similarly, "Northeast" is specifically the Northeast direction. Let's be more precise:

If y is at the origin (0, 0):
- For x to be North of y, x is at (0, d) where d > 0.
- For z to be Northeast of y, z is at (a, a) where a > 0 (assuming a 45-degree angle for Northeast).

With these coordinates, x is at (0, d) and z is at (a, a).
- If d < a, then x is to the West and South of z, which corresponds to the Southwest direction.
- If d = a, then x is directly to the West of z.
- If d > a, then x is to the West and North of z, which corresponds to the Northwest direction.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Wait, I've made another error. The directions should be interpreted more broadly:

If y is at the origin (0, 0):
- For x to be North of y, x is at (c, d) where d > 0 and c is any value (this represents the entire North half-plane).
- For z to be Northeast of y, z is at (a, b) where a, b > 0 (this represents the entire Northeast quadrant).

Given these coordinates, the relation between x and z can be:
- If c < a and d < b, then x is Southwest of z. 
- If c < a and d = b, then x is West of z.
- If c < a and d > b, then x is Northwest of z.
- If c = a and d < b, then x is South of z.
- If c = a and d = b, then x is at the same position as z.
- If c = a and d > b, then x is North of z.
- If c > a and d < b, then x is Southeast of z.
- If c > a and d = b, then x is East of z.
- If c > a and d > b, then x is Northeast of z.

But we also know that for x to be North of y, d > 0. And for z to be Northeast of y, a, b > 0.

Actually, I'm overcomplicating the problem. Let me start over with a clearer approach.

Let's define the 9 cardinal direction relations:
- North (N): The target is directly above the reference.
- Northeast (NE): The target is both to the right and above the reference.
- East (E): The target is directly to the right of the reference.
- Southeast (SE): The target is both to the right and below the reference.
- South (S): The target is directly below the reference.
- Southwest (SW): The target is both to the left and below the reference.
- West (W): The target is directly to the left of the reference.
- Northwest (NW): The target is both to the left and above the reference.
- Equals (EQ): The target and reference are at the same position.

Given that x is North of y and y is Southwest of z, I need to find the possible relations between x and z.

I'll use a systematic approach. If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, x is at (0, d) where d > 0.
- For y to be Southwest of z, z is at (a, b) where a, b > 0.

So, x is at (0, d) and z is at (a, b). The relation between x and z depends on the relative values of d, a, and b.

Hmm, let's use a different notation. Let's represent the position using Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) and express the cardinal direction relations in terms of the relationships between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

For x to be North of y:
- x.minX ≤ y.maxX and y.minX ≤ x.maxX (x and y overlap in the x dimension)
- x.minY > y.maxY (x is strictly above y)

For y to be Southwest of z:
- y.maxX < z.minX (y is strictly to the left of z)
- y.maxY < z.minY (y is strictly below z)

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

For the x dimension:
- From "x is North of y", we know x.minX ≤ y.maxX and y.minX ≤ x.maxX.
- From "y is Southwest of z", we know y.maxX < z.minX.

Combining these, we get:
- x.minX ≤ y.maxX < z.minX.

This implies x.minX < z.minX, which means x is at least partially to the left of z.

For the y dimension:
- From "x is North of y", we know x.minY > y.maxY.
- From "y is Southwest of z", we know y.maxY < z.minY.

Combining these, we get:
- x.minY > y.maxY and y.maxY < z.minY.

This doesn't allow us to directly infer the relation between x.minY and z.minY. It's possible that x.minY > z.minY (x is above z), x.minY = z.minY (x is at the same vertical position as z), or x.minY < z.minY (x is below z).

So, based on these constraints, x could be:
- Northwest of z (if x.minY > z.minY)
- West of z (if x.minY = z.minY)
- Southwest of z (if x.minY < z.minY)

Actually, let me approach this differently.

If I represent the positions of x, y, and z in a grid:

```
  ..x.. 
  ..... 
  .....   
  ..y.. 
  .....
```

Where x is North of y. But then, if y is Southwest of z, z would be to the northeast of y:

```
  ..x..   ..z
  .....   ....
  .....   ....
  ..y..   ....
  .....   ....
```

Now, the relation between x and z depends on their relative positions. From the diagram, it appears that x is to the left of z, so x is either Northwest, West, or Southwest of z depending on the relative y-coordinates of x and z.

But I think I'm overcomplicating the problem again.

Let's use a basic grid representation. If y is at (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, x is at (0, 1).
- For z to be Northeast of y, z is at (1, 1).

Given these positions, x is at (0, 1) and z is at (1, 1). The relation between x and z is that x is to the left of z, which corresponds to the West direction.

But this is an oversimplification. In reality, "North" and "Northeast" represent regions in the 2D plane. Let's approach it differently.

If y is at the origin, then:
- For x to be North of y, x is in the North region, which includes all points directly above y.
- For z to be Northeast of y, z is in the Northeast region, which includes all points above and to the right of y.

The relationship between x and z can be inferred by comparing these regions.

The North region of y intersects with the west half of the Northeast region of y. This means x and z could be in positions where x is to the left of z, making x West of z. X could also be in positions where it's above z, making it North of z. Or x could be below z, making it South of z. Etc.

Actually, I'm starting to confuse myself. Let me take a step back and think of this in a more straightforward way.

Alright. Let's represent the cardinal directions with the following coordinates, with the origin as the reference point:

- North (N): (0, 1)
- Northeast (NE): (1, 1)
- East (E): (1, 0)
- Southeast (SE): (1, -1)
- South (S): (0, -1)
- Southwest (SW): (-1, -1)
- West (W): (-1, 0)
- Northwest (NW): (-1, 1)

Given that x is North of y and y is Southwest of z, we can represent this as:
- The position of x relative to y is (0, 1).
- The position of y relative to z is (-1, -1).

To find the position of x relative to z, we can add the relative positions:
(0, 1) + (-1, -1) = (-1, 0).

This corresponds to the West (W) direction. So, x is West of z.

However, I'm not sure if this approach is universally correct for qualitative spatial reasoning.

Let's reconsider this problem. If we have three points on a 2D plane, the cardinal direction between any two points is determined by the angle between the line connecting them and the positive y-axis.

Hmm, this seems like a question of composition of cardinal direction relations. If R1 is the relation from y to x and R2 is the relation from z to y, then we want to find the possible relations R3 from z to x, given that R1 is "North" and R2 is "Northeast".

Actually, I've been making an error. If y is Southwest of z, then from z's perspective, y is in the Southwest direction. So, the relation from z to y is "Southwest".

Let me rethink this.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

What I'm looking for is the relation from z to x.

Using composition of cardinal direction relations:
- If y is Southwest of z, then from z's perspective, y is in the Southwest direction.
- If x is North of y, then from y's perspective, x is in the North direction.

Composing these, from z's perspective, x would be in the West or Northwest direction.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct way to compose cardinal direction relations.

Wait, let me re-read the problem. It asks for the relation between region x and region z. If x is North of y and y is Southwest of z, then what is the relation from x to z, not from z to x.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

What is the relation from x to z?

If y is Southwest of z, then z is Northeast of y.
If x is North of y, then y is South of x.

So, we have:
- z is Northeast of y
- y is South of x

Composing these, z can be East, Southeast, or South of x. Or equivalently, x can be West, Northwest, or North of z.

Hmm, but I'm not confident in this result.

Let me try another approach using spatial coordinates:

Let's place y at the origin (0, 0).
If x is North of y, then x can be at positions like (0, 1), (-1, 1), or (1, 1). Generally, x is at (a, b) where b > 0.
If z is Northeast of y, then z can be at positions like (1, 1), (2, 1), or (1, 2). Generally, z is at (c, d) where c, d > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to compare their coordinates.

If x is at (a, b) and z is at (c, d), then:
- If a < c, then x is to the left of z.
- If a > c, then x is to the right of z.
- If a = c, then x is vertically aligned with z.

- If b < d, then x is below z.
- If b > d, then x is above z.
- If b = d, then x is horizontally aligned with z.

The cardinal direction from x to z depends on these comparisons:
- If a < c and b < d, then x is Southwest of z.
- If a < c and b = d, then x is West of z.
- If a < c and b > d, then x is Northwest of z.
- If a = c and b < d, then x is South of z.
- If a = c and b = d, then x and z are at the same position.
- If a = c and b > d, then x is North of z.
- If a > c and b < d, then x is Southeast of z.
- If a > c and b = d, then x is East of z.
- If a > c and b > d, then x is Northeast of z.

However, the constraints are:
- x is at (a, b) where b > 0 (x is North of y).
- z is at (c, d) where c, d > 0 (z is Northeast of y).

Given these constraints, which of the above cardinal directions are possible for the relation from x to z?

For x to be Southwest of z, a < c and b < d. Since c, d > 0 and b > 0, this is possible.
For x to be West of z, a < c and b = d. Since c, d > 0 and b > 0, this is possible.
For x to be Northwest of z, a < c and b > d. Since c, d > 0 and b > 0, this is possible.
For x to be South of z, a = c and b < d. Since c, d > 0 and b > 0, this is possible.
For x and z to be at the same position, a = c and b = d. Since c, d > 0 and b > 0, this is possible.
For x to be North of z, a = c and b > d. Since c, d > 0 and b > 0, this is possible.
For x to be Southeast of z, a > c and b < d. Since c, d > 0 and b > 0, this is possible.
For x to be East of z, a > c and b = d. Since c, d > 0 and b > 0, this is possible.
For x to be Northeast of z, a > c and b > d. Since c, d > 0 and b > 0, this is possible.

It seems like all nine cardinal directions are possible for the relation from x to z. But this doesn't seem right. Maybe the problem is more constrained than I thought?

Hmm, let me redo the analysis with a more careful approach.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

Let's place y at the origin (0, 0).
If x is North of y, then x is at a position directly above y. So x is at (0, b) where b > 0.
If y is Southwest of z, then z is at a position that is directly to the northeast of y. So z is at (c, d) where c, d > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to compare their coordinates.

If x is at (0, b) and z is at (c, d), then:
- x is to the left of z since 0 < c.
- x can be above, below, or at the same height as z, depending on the relative values of b and d.

So, the cardinal direction from x to z can be:
- Northwest (if b > d)
- West (if b = d)
- Southwest (if b < d)

Let's double-check this conclusion. If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- x is at (0, b) where b > 0 (direct North of y).
- z is at (c, d) where c, d > 0 (direct Northeast of y).

From x's perspective, z is to the right. Depending on the relative values of b and d, z can be above, below, or at the same height as x.

So, the possible cardinal directions from x to z are:
- If b > d, z is to the lower right of x, which means z is Southeast of x. From x's perspective, z is Southeast.
- If b = d, z is directly to the right of x, which means z is East of x. From x's perspective, z is East.
- If b < d, z is to the upper right of x, which means z is Northeast of x. From x's perspective, z is Northeast.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. From x's perspective, z is Southeast, East, or Northeast. But the problem is asking for the relation from x to z. So, the relation from x to z can be Southeast, East, or Northeast.

Actually, I'm getting confused with the phrasing. Let me clarify the direction of the relation.

The problem states:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

And I need to find the relation from x to z. The correct way to read "x is North of y" is that from x's perspective, y is South. And the correct way to read "y is Southwest of z" is that from y's perspective, z is Northeast.

So, from x's perspective, y is South. From y's perspective, z is Northeast. This means, from x's perspective, z is somewhere in the East to Southeast range.

But this doesn't match my earlier spatial reasoning, which suggests the relation from x to z can be Southeast, East, or Northeast.

Let me reconsider.

Actually, I was misinterpreting the directions. The correct way to read "x is North of y" is that from y's perspective, x is North. And the correct way to read "y is Southwest of z" is that from z's perspective, y is Southwest.

Using this interpretation, if y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- x is at (0, b) where b > 0 (North of y).
- z is at (c, d) where c, d > 0 (Northeast of y).

From x's perspective, z is at a position (c, d-b) relative to x. The cardinal direction from x to z depends on the sign of d-b:
- If d-b > 0, z is to the upper right of x, which means z is Northeast of x. From x's perspective, z is Northeast.
- If d-b = 0, z is directly to the right of x, which means z is East of x. From x's perspective, z is East.
- If d-b < 0, z is to the lower right of x, which means z is Southeast of x. From x's perspective, z is Southeast.

So, the possible relations from x to z are Northeast, East, and Southeast.

Hmm, I'm still not confident in my answer. Let me approach this differently.

Actually, I'm not sure my approach is completely correct. The problem is asking for the possible relations between region x and region z, which could be more complex than I've been considering. 

Let me think about this again but in a more general setting.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

Let me interpret these cardinal directions based on the relative positions of the Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) of the regions.

For x to be North of y:
- x's MBR is strictly above y's MBR.
- x's MBR overlaps with y's MBR in the east-west direction.

For y to be Southwest of z:
- y's MBR is strictly to the left of z's MBR.
- y's MBR is strictly below z's MBR.

Based on these constraints, what can we infer about the relative position of x's MBR and z's MBR?

In the east-west direction:
- From "x is North of y", x's MBR overlaps with y's MBR.
- From "y is Southwest of z", y's MBR is strictly to the left of z's MBR.

These constraints don't give us a definitive east-west relationship between x and z. X could be to the left, right, or overlapping with z in the east-west direction.

In the north-south direction:
- From "x is North of y", x's MBR is strictly above y's MBR.
- From "y is Southwest of z", y's MBR is strictly below z's MBR.

These constraints don't give us a definitive north-south relationship between x and z. X could be above, below, or overlapping with z in the north-south direction.

I think I should reconsider my approach. Let me use a more formal approach based on the composition of cardinal direction relations.

Ok, I'm going to simplify and approach the problem differently. Let's refer to a composition table for cardinal direction relations. 

The composition R1(x, y) and R2(y, z) gives the possible R3(x, z). 

Given:
- R1(x, y) = "North"
- R2(y, z) = "Southwest"

I want to find the possible values of R3(x, z).

Hmm, I don't have a reference composition table on hand. Let me try to derive it for this specific case.

If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, x is in the North half-plane, which can be represented as x = (x1, x2) where x2 > 0.
- For y to be Southwest of z, z is in the Northeast quadrant from y, which can be represented as z = (z1, z2) where z1, z2 > 0.

Given these constraints, the relation between x and z depends on the relative values of x1, x2, z1, and z2.

- If x1 < 0 and x2 < z2, then x is in the Northwest of z.
- If x1 < 0 and x2 = z2, then x is directly West of z.
- If x1 < 0 and x2 > z2, then x is in the Southwest of z.
- If x1 = 0 and x2 < z2, then x is directly North of z.
- ... and so on.

But I'm getting confused with all the cases. Let me simplify.

Actually, the problem is asking for the possible relations, not the definitive relation. So, I need to determine all possible relative positions of x and z given the constraints.

From the constraints:
- x is in the North half-plane from y, which means x = (x1, x2) where x2 > 0.
- z is in the Northeast quadrant from y, which means z = (z1, z2) where z1, z2 > 0.

There are no constraints on the east-west position of x relative to y. X could be to the east, west, or directly above y. Similarly, there's no constraint on the exact position of z within the Northeast quadrant.

Given these degrees of freedom, x and z can have various relative positions:
- x could be to the east, west, or at the same east-west position as z.
- x could be above, below, or at the same north-south position as z.

This means x could be North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, or Northwest of z. In other words, any of the 8 cardinal directions is possible for the relation from x to z.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. There should be some constraints on the relation from x to z given the relations between x and y, and between y and z.

Let me reconsider the problem from a different angle. 

Alright, let me approach this using a Spatial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (SCSP) framework. In this framework, regions are represented by variables, and constraints are specified on the relations between these variables.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

I'll use the standard 9 cardinal directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Equal (EQ).

The first constraint says that the relation from x to y is North. The second constraint says that the relation from y to z is Southwest.

Using the SCSP framework, I need to determine the possible relations from x to z that are consistent with these constraints.

Now, let's think step by step. The cardinal direction from one region to another is determined by the relative positions of their centroids.

If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, the centroid of x is at (x1, x2) where x2 > 0 and x1 can be any value.
- For y to be Southwest of z, the centroid of z is at (z1, z2) where z1, z2 > 0.

Given these coordinates, the cardinal direction from x to z is determined by the relative values of x1, x2, z1, and z2.

- If x1 < z1 and x2 < z2, then x is Southwest of z.
- If x1 = z1 and x2 < z2, then x is South of z.
- If x1 > z1 and x2 < z2, then x is Southeast of z.
- If x1 < z1 and x2 = z2, then x is West of z.
- If x1 = z1 and x2 = z2, then x is Equal to z (they are at the same position).
- If x1 > z1 and x2 = z2, then x is East of z.
- If x1 < z1 and x2 > z2, then x is Northwest of z.
- If x1 = z1 and x2 > z2, then x is North of z.
- If x1 > z1 and x2 > z2, then x is Northeast of z.

Are all of these possibilities consistent with the given constraints? Let's check.

From the constraints:
- x1 can be any value and x2 > 0.
- z1, z2 > 0.

Based on these:
- For x to be Southwest of z, x1 < z1 and x2 < z2. Since z1, z2 > 0, it's possible for x1 to be any value such that x1 < z1, and x2 can be any value such that 0 < x2 < z2. This is consistent.
- For x to be South of z, x1 = z1 and x2 < z2. Since z1 > 0, it's possible for x1 = z1, and x2 can be any value such that 0 < x2 < z2. This is consistent.
- For x to be Southeast of z, x1 > z1 and x2 < z2. Since z1, z2 > 0, it's possible for x1 to be any value such that x1 > z1, and x2 can be any value such that 0 < x2 < z2. This is consistent.
- For x to be West of z, x1 < z1 and x2 = z2. Since z1, z2 > 0, it's possible for x1 to be any value such that x1 < z1, and x2 = z2. This is consistent.
- For x to be Equal to z, x1 = z1 and x2 = z2. Since z1, z2 > 0, it's possible for x1 = z1 and x2 = z2. This is consistent.
- For x to be East of z, x1 > z1 and x2 = z2. Since z1, z2 > 0, it's possible for x1 to be any value such that x1 > z1, and x2 = z2. This is consistent.
- For x to be Northwest of z, x1 < z1 and x2 > z2. Since z1, z2 > 0, it's possible for x1 to be any value such that x1 < z1, and x2 to be any value such that x2 > z2. This is consistent.
- For x to be North of z, x1 = z1 and x2 > z2. Since z1, z2 > 0, it's possible for x1 = z1 and x2 to be any value such that x2 > z2. This is consistent.
- For x to be Northeast of z, x1 > z1 and x2 > z2. Since z1, z2 > 0, it's possible for x1 to be any value such that x1 > z1, and x2 to be any value such that x2 > z2. This is consistent.

So, all 9 cardinal directions are possible for the relation from x to z. 

But wait, I'm not sure if this answer is right. Let me step back and reconsider. 

I just had an insight. I'm checking if the coordinates of x and z can be set such that x has a certain cardinal direction relation to z. But I'm not checking if these coordinates are consistent with the given constraints: x is North of y and y is Southwest of z.

Let me re-evaluate.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, the centroid of x is at (x1, x2) where x2 > 0 and x1 can be any value.
- For y to be Southwest of z, the centroid of z is at (z1, z2) where z1, z2 > 0.

Now, I need to check if each possible cardinal direction from x to z is consistent with these coordinates.

Actually, let me rethink the entire problem. I think there's a more direct way to approach it.

If y is Southwest of z, then z is Northeast of y. This means z is in the Northeast quadrant with respect to y.

If x is North of y, then x is in the North half-plane with respect to y.

The question is: Given the positions of x and z with respect to y, what are the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z?

Let's visualize this:

```
  NW  N  NE
   \  |  /
    \ | /
 W -- + -- E
    / | \
   /  |  \
  SW  S  SE
```

If y is at the '+', then:
- z is in the NE quadrant from y.
- x is somewhere in the N, NW, or NE regions from y.

The possible relations from x to z depend on their relative positions.

Actually, I think the confusion stems from the fact that the cardinal directions are not just points but regions in the 2D plane. Let me reconsider the problem with a clearer understanding.

In the 8-direction model, the cardinal directions partition the 2D plane into 8 regions around a reference point: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, x is in the North region from y. This means x is at (x1, x2) where x2 > 0 and -ε < x1 < ε for some small ε. Essentially, x is directly above y.
- For y to be Southwest of z, z is in the Northeast region from y. This means z is at (z1, z2) where z1, z2 > 0. Essentially, z is in the upper right quadrant from y.

Given these coordinates, the cardinal direction from x to z is determined by the relative values of x1, x2, z1, and z2.

For x to be in the North region from y, x1 should be close to 0. For z to be in the Northeast region from y, z1 and z2 should be positive. This means z is to the right of x, so x is to the left of z. Depending on the exact values of x2 and z2, x can be above, below, or at the same height as z.

So, the possible cardinal directions from x to z are:
- Northwest (if x2 > z2)
- West (if x2 = z2)
- Southwest (if x2 < z2)

But this conclusion assumes a strict 8-direction model. If I consider a more relaxed model, other directions might be possible.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let's clarify the definition of the cardinal directions:

- North (N): (0, 1)
- Northeast (NE): (1, 1)
- East (E): (1, 0)
- Southeast (SE): (1, -1)
- South (S): (0, -1)
- Southwest (SW): (-1, -1)
- West (W): (-1, 0)
- Northwest (NW): (-1, 1)

These are not just regions but specific directions.

If I'm told:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

Then, using a strict interpretation:
- If y is at the origin (0, 0), then x is at (0, 1) and z is at (1, 1).
- Relative to x, z is at (1, 0), which corresponds to the East direction.

So, x is East of z.

But wait, I've been mixing interpretations. If "North" means exactly (0, 1) in direction, then "Southwest" would mean exactly (-1, -1) in direction. Given these, the relation from x to z would be from (0, 1) to (1, 1), which is (1, 0) in direction, i.e., East.

But if "North" and "Southwest" refer to regions, then the answer would be different. 

I just realized, if y is at the origin (0, 0), and we are strict about the directions. Then:
- If z is to the northeast of y, then z is at (a, a) for some a > 0.
- If x is to the north of y, then x is at (0, b) for some b > 0.

The relation from x to z is from (0, b) to (a, a), which is (a, a-b). The cardinal direction of this vector depends on the relative values of a and b:
- If a > 0 and a-b > 0, then x is Southeast of z.
- If a > 0 and a-b = 0, then x is East of z.
- If a > 0 and a-b < 0, then x is Northeast of z.

So, the possible relations from x to z are Southeast, East, and Northeast.

But I think I'm still mixing interpretations. 

Let me be clear. If I consider the standard cardinal direction relations:
- North (N)
- Northeast (NE)
- East (E)
- Southeast (SE)
- South (S)
- Southwest (SW)
- West (W)
- Northwest (NW)

And if I'm told:
- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

Then, the question is: What are the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z?

Actually, let me go back to a definitation. In the standard 8-direction model, the cardinal directions are defined in terms of the relative positions of the centroids of two regions:

- North (N): The centroid of the target is directly above the centroid of the reference.
- Northeast (NE): The centroid of the target is both to the right and above the centroid of the reference.
- East (E): The centroid of the target is directly to the right of the centroid of the reference.
- Southeast (SE): The centroid of the target is both to the right and below the centroid of the reference.
- South (S): The centroid of the target is directly below the centroid of the reference.
- Southwest (SW): The centroid of the target is both to the left and below the centroid of the reference.
- West (W): The centroid of the target is directly to the left of the centroid of the reference.
- Northwest (NW): The centroid of the target is both to the left and above the centroid of the reference.

If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, the centroid of x is at (0, b) where b > 0.
- For y to be Southwest of z, the centroid of z is at (a, c) where a, c > 0.

Given these coordinates, the relation from x to z is from (0, b) to (a, c), or in other words, from x's perspective, z is at (a, c-b).

The cardinal direction of the vector (a, c-b) depends on the relative values of a and c-b:
- If a > 0 and c-b > 0, then x is Southeast of z.
- If a > 0 and c-b = 0, then x is East of z.
- If a > 0 and c-b < 0, then x is Northeast of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are Southeast, East, and Northeast.

Wait, I realized I keep mixing my directions again. If x is North of y, then from y's perspective, x is in the North direction. If y is Southwest of z, then from z's perspective, y is in the Southwest direction.

So, if y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- x is at (0, b) where b > 0 (North of y).
- z is at (a, c) where a, c > 0 (Northeast of y).

From x's perspective, z is at (a, c-b). The cardinal direction of this vector depends on the relative values of a and c-b:
- If a > 0 and c-b > 0, then z is Northeast of x. Equivalently, x is Southwest of z.
- If a > 0 and c-b = 0, then z is East of x. Equivalently, x is West of z.
- If a > 0 and c-b < 0, then z is Southeast of x. Equivalently, x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Actually I think I have been correct a few times. Let me reconsider once more. Given:

- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

The question is asking for the possible relations between x and z.

If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, x is at (0, b) where b > 0. This means x is directly above y.
- For y to be Southwest of z, z is at (a, c) where a, c > 0. This means z is in the northeast quadrant from y.

Given these positions, x is at (0, b) and z is at (a, c). The relation from x to z depends on the relative values of b and c.

From x's perspective, z is at (a, c-b). The cardinal direction of this vector depends on the values of a and c-b:
- If a > 0 and c-b > 0, then z is Northeast of x, which means x is Southwest of z.
- If a > 0 and c-b = 0, then z is East of x, which means x is West of z.
- If a > 0 and c-b < 0, then z is Southeast of x, which means x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are Southwest, West, and Northwest.

To double-check: 
- If b < c, then x is below z, which means x is Southwest of z.
- If b = c, then x is at the same height as z, which means x is West of z.
- If b > c, then x is above z, which means x is Northwest of z.

I'm pretty confident now that the answer is Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Actually, I realized I've been making a mistake in how I describe the direction from x to z. The direction from x to z is the direction in which z is from x, not the other way around. So:
- If a > 0 and c-b > 0, then z is Northeast of x, not x is Southwest of z.
- If a > 0 and c-b = 0, then z is East of x, not x is West of z.
- If a > 0 and c-b < 0, then z is Southeast of x, not x is Northwest of z.

I guess the problem is asking for the direction from x to z, the correct answer would be Northeast, East, and Southeast. If the problem is asking for the direction from z to x, the answer would be Southwest, West, and Northwest.

Actually, I keep getting confused with the phrasing. Let me revisit the problem statement: "Let North and Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

The problem is asking for the possible "relations between region x and region z." This means I need to determine the cardinal directions that describe the relative position of region z from region x, i.e., the direction from x to z.

Using the same coordinate system: If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, x is at (0, b) where b > 0. This means x is directly above y.
- For y to be Southwest of z, z is at (a, c) where a, c > 0. This means z is in the northeast quadrant from y.

From x's perspective, z is at (a, c-b). The cardinal direction of this vector depends on the values of a and c-b:
- If a > 0 and c-b > 0, then z is Northeast of x.
- If a > 0 and c-b = 0, then z is East of x.
- If a > 0 and c-b < 0, then z is Southeast of x.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are Northeast, East, and Southeast.

To double-check:
- If b < c, then z is above x, which means z is Northeast of x.
- If b = c, then z is at the same height as x, which means z is East of x.
- If b > c, then z is below x, which means z is Southeast of x.

Alright, I think the answer is Northeast, East, and Southeast, which means that region z can be Northeast, East, or Southeast of region x. 

Wait, but I think I am misinterpreting the problem. When I say the relation between region x and region z, I think I can choose the reference direction.

I guess I'll stick with how I previously interpreted the problem. Given:

- x is North of y
- y is Southwest of z

The question is asking for the possible relations between x and z.

If y is at the origin (0, 0), then:
- For x to be North of y, x is at (0, b) where b > 0. This means x is directly above y.
- For y to be Southwest of z, z is at (a, c) where a, c > 0. This means z is in the northeast quadrant from y.

Given these positions, x is at (0, b) and z is at (a, c). The relation from x to z depends on the relative values of b and c.

To determine the relation from x to z, I need to find the direction in which z is from x, which is given by the vector from x to z: (a, c-b). The cardinal direction of this vector depends on the values of a and c-b:
- If a > 0 and c-b > 0, then z is Northeast of x.
- If a > 0 and c-b = 0, then z is East of x.
- If a > 0 and c-b < 0, then z is Southeast of x.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are Northeast, East, and Southeast.

To determine the relation from z to x, I need to find the direction in which x is from z, which is given by the vector from z to x: (-a, b-c). The cardinal direction of this vector depends on the values of -a and b-c:
- If -a < 0 and b-c > 0, then x is Northwest of z.
- If -a < 0 and b-c = 0, then x is West of z.
- If -a < 0 and b-c < 0, then x is Southwest of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from z to x are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

I'm stuck on whether to provide the relation from x to z or from z to x. 

Okay, let me reread the problem. It says "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?". Given the phrasing "between region x and region z", I'm inclined to provide both directions. But since the problem is framed in terms of "region x is North of region y and region y is Southwest of region z", I think I should provide the relation from x to z to be consistent.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are Northeast, East, and Southeast. In other words, region z can be to the Northeast, East, or Southeast of region x.

Actually, I need to make sure the problem formulation: "Let North and Southwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is Southwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?" The key is that it says "which could the possible relations" which means I should list all possible, and there are two possible directions for the possible relations, so that's ok. But I should settle on one.

Given how the problem is phrased, with region x and region y, and region y and region z, I should be determining the relation from region x to region z, which is consistent with the direction of the given relations.

So, I'll stick with my final answer: the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are Northeast, East, and Southeast.

Hmm, I've been going back and forth, and I'm getting a bit confusing. Let me simplify.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Southwest of region z.

I want to find the possible cardinal direction relations from region x to region z.

If I place region y at the origin (0, 0), then region x is directly above y, which means x is at (0, b) where b > 0. And region z is in the northeast quadrant from y, which means z is at (a, c) where a, c > 0.

From region x's perspective, region z is at (a, c-b). The cardinal direction of this vector depends on the values of a and c-b:
- If a > 0 and c-b > 0, then z is Northeast of x.
- If a > 0 and c-b = 0, then z is East of x.
- If a > 0 and c-b < 0, then z is Southeast of x.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from region x to region z are Northeast, East, and Southeast.

To visualize (top view with North upwards):
```
  ..x..
  .....
  ..y..
  .....   ..z
```

From this visual, it's clear that region z is in the East to Northeast to Southeast range from region x, depending on the exact position of z relative to x.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- East
- Northeast
- Southeast

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is Southwest of region z

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze their relative positions.

If I place region y at the origin (0,0):
- Region x would be directly north of y, at coordinates like (0,b) where b > 0
- Region z would be northeast of y, at coordinates like (a,c) where a,c > 0

From region x's perspective, region z is at position (a,c-b). The relation depends on the values of c and b:
- If c > b: z is Northeast of x
- If c = b: z is East of x
- If c < b: z is Southeast of x

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
