PROMPT: Let North and  Northwest be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Northwest of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

In this problem, we have three regions x, y, and z, and we're given the following information:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

The question asks for the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Let's analyze the constraints we're given:

1. x is North of y:
   This means that x is located directly above y.

2. y is Northwest of z:
   This means that y is located to the northwest of z, which means y is diagonally above and to the left of z.

Now, I'll try to figure out where x could be in relation to z:

If x is directly north of y, and y is to the northwest of z, then x is generally in the northern direction from z. However, we need to determine more precisely where x is in relation to z.

Let's think about this in terms of a grid, where:
- Going North means moving up.
- Going Northwest means moving up and to the left.

If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then y is to the northwest, let's say at position (-1, 1). And if x is north of y, then x is at position (-1, 2).

From z's perspective, x is at position (-1, 2). This is northwest of z, but with a stronger northern component. So it seems like x could be Northwest of z.

But let's check this more systematically. Let's denote positions as (x-coordinate, y-coordinate) where increasing y means going north, and increasing x means going east.

If z is at (0, 0):
- y is Northwest of z, so y is at (-a, a) for some positive a. Let's use a = 1 for simplicity, so y is at (-1, 1).
- x is North of y, so x is at (-1, 1+b) for some positive b. Let's use b = 1 for simplicity, so x is at (-1, 2).

Now, from z's perspective, x is at position (-1, 2). Is this Northwest of z? Yes, because it's both to the north and to the west of z.

Actually, I think I need to be more precise about how "North" and "Northwest" are defined in terms of the angles between points.

In the cardinal direction model, "North" typically refers to a region that is directly or predominantly above another region. "Northwest" refers to a region that is diagonally above and to the left.

Let's denote the angle between two points (relative to the horizontal) as θ. 
- North: 90° (or a sector around 90°, maybe 67.5° to 112.5°)
- Northwest: 135° (or a sector around 135°, maybe 112.5° to 157.5°)

If z is at (0, 0):
- y is at some position that is Northwest of z, so the angle is around 135°.
- x is at some position that is North of y, so the angle is around 90° from y.

From these constraints, x could be at various positions, but it's generally going to be in the northern direction from z, possibly with a western component.

Let's try to be even more precise by considering the traditional 8-way cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.

These directions are separated by 45°. So:
- North: 90° ± 22.5° (67.5° to 112.5°)
- Northeast: 45° ± 22.5° (22.5° to 67.5°)
- East: 0° ± 22.5° (337.5° to 22.5°)
- Southeast: 315° ± 22.5° (292.5° to 337.5°)
- South: 270° ± 22.5° (247.5° to 292.5°)
- Southwest: 225° ± 22.5° (202.5° to 247.5°)
- West: 180° ± 22.5° (157.5° to 202.5°)
- Northwest: 135° ± 22.5° (112.5° to 157.5°)

Given that y is Northwest of z, the angle from z to y is around 135°. If x is North of y, the angle from y to x is around 90°.

Hmm, I'm still having a hard time pinpointing exactly where x is in relation to z. Let me approach this differently.

If we place z at the origin (0, 0), then y is in the Northwest direction, so it's in the region where both the x-coordinate is negative and the y-coordinate is positive. Let's say y is at point (-a, b), where a and b are positive.

Now, x is North of y, so it's directly above y. That means x is at point (-a, b+c), where c is positive.

From z's perspective, x is at (-a, b+c). Is this North, Northwest, or some other direction from z?

For it to be North, the angle would need to be close to 90°. The angle is arctan((b+c)/(-a)), which is not going to be exactly 90° unless a is very small compared to b+c.

For it to be Northwest, the angle would need to be close to 135°. The angle is arctan((b+c)/(-a)), which could be close to 135° depending on the values of a, b, and c.

Let me try to be more systematic. In the cardinal direction model, "North" typically means that the y-coordinate is much larger than the x-coordinate, and "Northwest" means both coordinates are significant but the y-coordinate is positive and the x-coordinate is negative.

If y is Northwest of z, then y has a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate, both of significant magnitude.

If x is North of y, then x has the same x-coordinate as y, but a larger y-coordinate.

So from z's perspective, x has a negative x-coordinate (like y) and a positive y-coordinate (larger than y's). This puts x in the Northwest direction from z, but perhaps with a stronger northern component than y has.

Let me try to approach this problem for a third time, hopefully more clearly:

If we place z at the origin (0, 0) on a Cartesian plane, then the eight cardinal directions from z can be represented as follows:
- North: (0, 1)
- Northeast: (1, 1)
- East: (1, 0)
- Southeast: (1, -1)
- South: (0, -1)
- Southwest: (-1, -1)
- West: (-1, 0)
- Northwest: (-1, 1)

Now, if y is Northwest of z, then y is in the direction of (-1, 1) from z. That means y is at some point (-a, b), where a and b are positive.

If x is North of y, then x is in the direction of (0, 1) from y. That means x is at point (-a, b+c), where c is positive.

From z's perspective, x is at (-a, b+c). Is this North, Northwest, or some other direction from z?

Let's calculate the angle:
angle = arctan((b+c)/(-a)) = arctan(-(b+c)/a)

For it to be North, the angle would need to be close to 90°, which happens when (b+c)/a is very large.
For it to be Northwest, the angle would need to be close to 135°, which happens when (b+c)/a is close to 1.

So, depending on the values of a, b, and c, x could be either North or Northwest of z.

But wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about it more intuitively:

If y is Northwest of z, that means y is to the northwest (diagonally up and to the left) of z.
If x is North of y, that means x is directly above y.

Now, if x is directly above y, and y is to the northwest of z, then x is generally in the northern direction from z, but still to the left. This seems like it's Northwest of z as well, but possibly with a stronger northern component.

Actually, I realize I've been overthinking this problem. Let's approach it more directly:

If y is Northwest of z, that means y is both to the North and to the West of z.
If x is North of y, that means x is to the North of y (and not to the East or West).

Combining these:
- x is to the North of y, which is to the North of z. So, x is to the North of z.
- y is to the West of z, and x is neither to the East nor to the West of y. So, x is to the West of z.

If x is both to the North and to the West of z, then x is to the Northwest of z.

But wait, that's not quite right. If y is Northwest of z, that doesn't necessarily mean y is to the North of z. It means y is in the Northwest direction from z, which is a specific direction (diagonally up and to the left).

Ok, let's go back to the basics. in 2D space, North means positive y-axis (up), West means negative x-axis (left), Northwest means both negative x and positive y (diagonal up-left).

Let's establish the coordinates again:
- If z is at (0, 0), then y is at some point (-a, b), where a and b are positive, because y is Northwest of z.
- If x is North of y, then x is at some point (-a, b+c), where c is positive.

From z's perspective, x is at (-a, b+c).

For x to be North of z, it would need to be at (0, d) for some positive d, which isn't the case because x has a negative x-coordinate.

For x to be Northwest of z, it would need to be at some point (-e, f) where e and f are positive. And that is the case, because x is at (-a, b+c) where a, b, and c are positive.

So, based on the coordinates, x is Northwest of z.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this problem. Let's try to solve it using the reasoning directly.

If y is Northwest of z, then y is in the Northwest cone of z, i.e., y is above and to the left of z.
If x is North of y, then x is in the North cone of y, i.e., x is directly above y.

From these two statements, we know that:
1. y is above and to the left of z.
2. x is directly above y.

So x is above y, which is above z. This means x is above z. And x is directly above y, which is to the left of z. This means x is to the left of z. So x is above and to the left of z, which means x is in the Northwest cone of z.

But wait, let me be more careful about "above". If y is Northwest of z, then y is above z, but it's not directly above z. Instead, y is diagonally above z, to the left.

Now, if x is North of y, then x is directly above y. So x is above y, which is above z. But because y is not directly above z, x is not directly above z either. In fact, x is directly above a point that is to the left of z, which means x is to the left of z as well.

So x is above and to the left of z, which means x is in the Northwest cone of z. Therefore, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Actually, wait. I'm not being careful enough in my reasoning. Let's try again with a concrete example:

Imagine a grid, where going North means going up, and going West means going left.
- Let's say z is at position (0, 0).
- If y is Northwest of z, then y might be at position (-1, 1).
- If x is North of y, then x is at position (-1, 2).

Now, from z's perspective, x is at position (-1, 2). Is this North or Northwest of z?

North would be along the positive y-axis, so points like (0, 1), (0, 2), etc. But x is at (-1, 2), which is not on the y-axis; it's to the left of the y-axis. So x is not directly North of z.

Northwest would be diagonally up and to the left, points like (-1, 1), (-2, 2), etc. Is (-1, 2) considered Northwest? It's to the left and above, but it's not at a 45-degree angle. But the cardinal direction "Northwest" doesn't necessarily mean a 45-degree angle; it means a direction that's generally to the northwest.

Let me check the mathematical definition. The eight cardinal directions are:
- North: Angle is 90° (or close to it)
- Northeast: Angle is 45° (or close to it)
- East: Angle is 0° (or close to it)
- Southeast: Angle is 315° (or close to it)
- South: Angle is 270° (or close to it)
- Southwest: Angle is 225° (or close to it)
- West: Angle is 180° (or close to it)
- Northwest: Angle is 135° (or close to it)

For the point (-1, 2) relative to (0, 0), the angle is arctan(2/(-1)) = arctan(-2) ≈ 117°. This is closest to 135° (Northwest), but it's also close to 90° (North). In the traditional eight-way cardinal directions, it would be considered Northwest.

Actually, let's double check this calculation:
The angle is arctan(y/x) = arctan(2/(-1)) = arctan(-2). But arctan(-2) isn't 117°. Let me calculate it again.

arctan(-2) ≈ -63.4° or 296.6° (in the standard coordinate system where 0° is to the right, and angles increase counterclockwise).

But in the cardinal direction model, 0° is to the right (East), 90° is up (North), 180° is to the left (West), and 270° is down (South).

So, the angle for the point (-1, 2) relative to (0, 0) is 180° - 63.4° = 116.6°, which is closest to 135° (Northwest).

So, the relation between x and z is Northwest.

Actually, I'm approaching this problem too rigidly. Let's think about it in terms of regions rather than specific points.

In the cardinal direction model, regions are divided into the nine tiles (the eight cardinal directions plus the central tile). The relation "North" means that the region is in the North tile, and the relation "Northwest" means that the region is in the Northwest tile.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

If region y is Northwest of region z, then y is in the Northwest tile from z. And if region x is North of region y, then x is in the North tile from y.

It's not necessarily the case that x is Northwest of z. It depends on the specific shapes and positions of the regions. Let's try to find a case where x is North of z, and a case where x is Northwest of z.

Case 1: Suppose z is a square at the origin, y is a square to the northwest of z, and x is a long horizontal rectangle directly north of y, extending both to the east and west of y. In this case, x would still be Northwest of z, but a portion of x could also be North of z.

Wait, actually, I'm confused. I was conflating "North of" with "in the North tile". Let me be more careful.

In the cardinal direction model, "North of" typically means that the entire region is in the North tile. Similarly, "Northwest of" means that the entire region is in the Northwest tile.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

If y is Northwest of z, then y is entirely in the Northwest tile from z. And if x is North of y, then x is entirely in the North tile from y.

Now, the question is: where is x in relation to z?

Here's what we know:
- y is in the Northwest tile from z.
- x is in the North tile from y.

For x to be in the North tile from y, it means that x has the same x-coordinate(s) as y, but a larger y-coordinate. Since y is in the Northwest tile from z, it means y has a smaller x-coordinate and a larger y-coordinate than z.

So, x has a smaller x-coordinate than z and a larger y-coordinate. This puts x in the Northwest tile from z.

Actually, wait. Let me try to think about this with a clearer model in mind.

Let's understand better what it means for a region to be North or Northwest of another region:

- Region x is North of region y: This means the entire region x is in the North direction from region y. The North direction is typically a cone of angle 45° on either side of the straight North. So, if I'm sitting at any point in region y, then every point in region x is within 45° to the left or right of due North from me.

- Region y is Northwest of region z: Similarly, this means every point in region y is in the Northwest direction from every point in region z. The Northwest direction is a cone of angle 45° on either side of the straight Northwest.

Now, given these two constraints, let's try to determine the possible directions from region z to region x.

Constraint 1: If I'm at any point in region y, then every point in region x is within 45° to the left or right of due North from me.

Constraint 2: If I'm at any point in region z, then every point in region y is within 45° to the left or right of due Northwest from me.

If I combine these constraints, and consider a ray from a point in region z, passing through a point in region y, and then to a point in region x, I get:
- From z to y, the ray is in the Northwest direction.
- From y to x, the ray is in the North direction.

If I extend the ray from z to x, it's not necessarily directly North or directly Northwest, but somewhere in between or a combination of these directions.

Ah, I think there's a more direct way to approach this.

In a cardinal direction model, the 8 cardinal directions are usually defined by a partition of the plane into 8 cone-shaped regions (plus a central region). For simplicity, let's think of these directions as dividing the 360° around a point into 8 equal sectors, each of 45°.

If region y is Northwest of region z, it means that y is located entirely in the Northwest sector as seen from z. This sector spans from 112.5° to 157.5° (where 0° is East, 90° is North, etc.).

If region x is North of region y, it means that x is located entirely in the North sector as seen from y. This sector spans from 67.5° to 112.5°.

Now, to determine the relation between regions x and z, we need to see in which sector x falls when viewed from z. The challenge is that the sectors are defined relative to the viewing point, so the North sector from y is different from the North sector from z.

Let's approach this problem differently again:

If y is Northwest of z, then y is in the Northwest cone of z. And if x is North of y, then x is in the North cone of y.

Given this, what cone is x in, from z's perspective?

Let's place z at the origin and see. If y is Northwest of z, then y is in the cone spanning from 112.5° to 157.5°. Let's say y is at (approximately) (-1, 1).

If x is North of y, then x is in the cone spanning from 67.5° to 112.5° from y. That means x is around (-1, 2).

From z's perspective, x is at approximately (-1, 2). The angle from z to x is approximately arctan(2/(-1)), which is about 117°. This puts x in the Northwest cone from z's perspective.

But if y was at, say, (-1, 10), and x was at (-1, 11), then the angle from z to x would be closer to 90°, which would put x in the North cone from z's perspective.

So, depending on the exact positions of y and x, the relation between x and z could be either North or Northwest.

But I should also be precise about the model I'm using. I've been assuming that the cardinal directions are defined by a partition of the plane into 8 cone-shaped regions. But if we're being completely strict, points directly on the border between two cones have an ambiguous cardinal direction. But this is a technicality.

Actually, I think I need to be specific about the underlying formal cardinal direction model. My answer might depend on this model. There's a standard model with 9 basic relations (8 cardinal directions plus a "bounding box"), and there's also the model based on cone-shaped regions which I've been discussing.

Let me go with the cone-shaped regions approach, which is more intuitive. In this model, the plane is divided into 8 cone-shaped regions, each corresponding to a cardinal direction.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

For x to be North of y, it means that every point in x is in the North cone when viewed from any point in y. And for y to be Northwest of z, it means that every point in y is in the Northwest cone when viewed from any point in z.

The question is: In which cone is every point in x, when viewed from any point in z?

I don't think I can give a definitive answer without more information about the shapes and positions of the regions. But I can say that, for certain configurations, x would be Northwest of z, and for others, x could be North of z.

Actually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let's use the traditional interpretation of cardinal directions in a geographical or spatial context.

If region y is to the northwest of region z, and region x is to the north of region y, then the most logical conclusion is that region x is somewhere between north and northwest of region z, but probably closer to northwest.

But wait, I need to be precise. Let's say we're using the standard cardinal direction model with 9 basic relations (8 cardinal directions plus a "bounding box").

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

If we apply transitivity rules, what is the relation between regions x and z?

From the standard cardinal direction calculus, if A is North of B and B is Northwest of C, then A can be either North, Northwest, or even Northeast of C, depending on the specific shapes and positions.

Actually, there's a standard cardinal direction calculus that defines composition tables for cardinal direction relations. According to this calculus, the composition of "North" and "Northwest" is typically {N, NW}, meaning that if A is North of B and B is Northwest of C, then A is either North of C or Northwest of C (or a combination of both). This makes intuitive sense.

Actually, I think I've been approaching this the wrong way. The cardinal direction relations partition the plane into the 9 tiles (8 cardinal directions plus the central tile), and these tiles are essentially the possible relations. But the question is not asking for the exact relation, but for the possible relations.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

What's the possible relation between regions x and z?

From the standard cardinal direction calculus, the composition of "North" and "Northwest" is typically {N, NW}, meaning that if x is North of y and y is Northwest of z, then x is either North of z or Northwest of z (or a combination of both).

So the possible relations between x and z are: North or Northwest.

Actually, this is still not precise. I need to use the cardinal direction calculus more formally. Specifically, I need to use the composition table for cardinal direction relations.

The composition of two cardinal direction relations r1 and r2 is the set of possible relations between two objects a and c, given that the relation between a and b is r1, and the relation between b and c is r2.

For the cardinal direction calculus, the composition of North (N) and Northwest (NW) is typically:
N o NW = {N, NW}

This means that if x is North of y, and y is Northwest of z, then x can be either North of z, or Northwest of z.

Let's try to visualize this with a grid. We'll place z at the origin (0, 0), and explore where y and x can be:

- If y is Northwest of z, then y might be at (-1, 1).
- If x is North of y, then x might be at (-1, 2).

From z's perspective, x is at (-1, 2). This is still in the Northwest cone from z, though it's closer to the North direction than y is.

But if y was at, say, (-0.1, 1), and x was at (-0.1, 2), then x would be very close to the North direction from z.

In the extreme case, if y was directly Northwest of z, but very far away (e.g., at (-1000, 1000)), and x was just slightly North of y (e.g., at (-1000, 1001)), then from z's perspective, the direction to x would be almost indistinguishable from the direction to y, and both would be considered Northwest.

But in the opposite extreme, if y was just barely Northwest of z (e.g., at (-0.001, 1)), and x was far North of y (e.g., at (-0.001, 1000)), then from z's perspective, the direction to x would be very close to due North.

So, the relation between x and z can be either North or Northwest.

Actually, I'm going to use a slightly more technical approach. Let's use the cone-shaped regions model, where the 8 cardinal directions are defined by eight cones:

- North (N): 67.5° to 112.5° (centered at 90°)
- Northeast (NE): 22.5° to 67.5° (centered at 45°)
- East (E): 337.5° to 22.5° (centered at 0°)
- Southeast (SE): 292.5° to 337.5° (centered at 315°)
- South (S): 247.5° to 292.5° (centered at 270°)
- Southwest (SW): 202.5° to 247.5° (centered at 225°)
- West (W): 157.5° to 202.5° (centered at 180°)
- Northwest (NW): 112.5° to 157.5° (centered at 135°)

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

For x to be North of y, it means that the angle from any point in y to any point in x is between 67.5° and 112.5°. And for y to be Northwest of z, it means that the angle from any point in z to any point in y is between 112.5° and 157.5°.

The question is: What's the angle from any point in z to any point in x?

If we draw a line from a point in z to a point in y, and then to a point in x, the angle from z to y is between 112.5° and 157.5° (Northwest), and the angle from y to x is between 67.5° and 112.5° (North).

The angle from z to x will depend on the specific positions of the three points. But if y is far from z and x is close to y, then the angle from z to x will be close to the angle from z to y, which is between 112.5° and 157.5° (Northwest).

And if y is close to z and x is far from y, then the angle from z to x will be close to the angle from z to y plus the angle from y to x, which would be between 67.5° + 112.5° and 112.5° + 157.5°, or between 180° and 270°. But this doesn't seem right.

Let me try again. To be more precise, I'll consider some specific points and trace the rays.

Suppose z is at the origin, y is at (-1, 1), and x is at (-1, 2).

The angle from z to y is arctan(1/(-1)) = -45° or 135° (in the standard coordinate system where 0° is to the right, and angles increase counterclockwise). This is in the Northwest direction.

The angle from y to x is 90° (directly North). This is in the North direction.

The angle from z to x is arctan(2/(-1)) = -63.4° or 116.6°. This is in the Northwest direction, but it's very close to the border with the North direction (which is at 112.5°).

Now, let's try another example. Suppose z is at the origin, y is at (-0.1, 1), and x is at (-0.1, 2).

The angle from z to y is arctan(1/(-0.1)) = -84.3° or 95.7°. This is in the North direction.

Wait, that's not right. If y is at (-0.1, 1), then it's to the Northwest of z. Let me check this calculation again.

The angle from z to y is arctan(1/(-0.1)) = arctan(-10) ≈ -84.3° or 275.7° (in the standard coordinate system). In the cardinal direction model, this is 180° - 84.3° = 95.7°, which is in the North direction.

But this doesn't match our constraint that y is Northwest of z. Let me think about this more carefully.

In the cardinal direction model, Northwest is typically defined as the direction between West and North. If z is at the origin, then y should be in the top-left quadrant to be Northwest of z.

If y is at (-0.1, 1), it is in the top-left quadrant, but it's very close to the y-axis. The angle from z to y is arctan(1/(-0.1)) = arctan(-10) ≈ -84.3° or 275.7° (in the standard coordinate system). In the cardinal direction model, this corresponds to an angle of 180° - 84.3° = 95.7°.

For y to be Northwest of z, the angle should be between 112.5° and 157.5°. But 95.7° is in the North cone, not the Northwest cone. So, y at (-0.1, 1) is not Northwest of z; it's North of z.

Let me try another example where y is truly Northwest of z. Suppose z is at the origin, y is at (-1, 1), and x is at (-1, 2).

The angle from z to y is arctan(1/(-1)) = arctan(-1) = -45° or 315° (in the standard coordinate system). In the cardinal direction model, this corresponds to an angle of 180° - 45° = 135°, which is in the Northwest cone.

The angle from y to x is 90° (directly North). This is in the North cone.

The angle from z to x is arctan(2/(-1)) = arctan(-2) ≈ -63.4° or 296.6° (in the standard coordinate system). In the cardinal direction model, this corresponds to an angle of 180° - 63.4° = 116.6°, which is in the Northwest cone, but very close to the border with the North cone.

So, based on these specific points, x is Northwest of z.

But, as I've shown, the angle from z to x can vary depending on the specific positions of z, y, and x. If y is far to the Northwest of z and x is just slightly to the North of y, then x would be solidly in the Northwest cone from z's perspective. But if y is just slightly to the Northwest of z (close to the border with the North cone) and x is far to the North of y, then x could be in the North cone from z's perspective.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North or Northwest.

I think that's right. Let me just double check this answer with another approach:

Imagine the eight basic cardinal directions as the eight regions you get when you draw the positive and negative x and y axes, and the two diagonals. From z's perspective, y is in the Northwest region. From y's perspective, x is in the North region.

If x is in the North region from y's perspective, it means x has the same x-coordinate as y, but a larger y-coordinate. Since y is in the Northwest region from z's perspective, y has a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate, from z's perspective.

So, x has a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate from z's perspective, which means x is either in the Northwest region or the North region from z's perspective.

Let me check if x can actually be in the North region from z's perspective. For this to be the case, x would need to have a zero x-coordinate from z's perspective. But if y is in the Northwest region, it has a negative x-coordinate. And if x is in the North region from y's perspective, it has the same x-coordinate as y, which is negative. So, x must have a negative x-coordinate from z's perspective, which means it can't be in the North region from z's perspective.

Wait, I think I've been modeling the cardinal directions incorrectly. Let me try again.

In the cardinal direction model, the eight directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) are often defined by dividing the plane into eight cone-shaped regions. If you consider a point p and another point q, the direction from p to q is determined by the angle of the ray from p to q.

For instance, if the angle is between 337.5° and 22.5° (close to 0°), the direction is East. If it's between 67.5° and 112.5° (close to 90°), the direction is North.

Given this model, let's consider our problem:
- If y is Northwest of z, then the angle from z to y is between 112.5° and 157.5°.
- If x is North of y, then the angle from y to x is between 67.5° and 112.5°.

To determine the direction from z to x, we need to find the angle of the ray from z to x.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's approach it slightly differently.

Given the above model of cardinal directions, it's clear that the direction from z to x can depend on the exact positions of z, y, and x. However, we can still determine the possible directions.

If y is Northwest of z, the angle from z to y is between 112.5° and 157.5°. 
If x is North of y, the angle from y to x is between 67.5° and 112.5°.

For x to be North of z, the angle from z to x would need to be between 67.5° and 112.5°. This is possible if y is just slightly to the Northwest of z (close to the 112.5° boundary) and x is directly North of y, or if x is far enough North of y to make the angle from z to x within the North range.

For x to be Northwest of z, the angle from z to x would need to be between 112.5° and 157.5°. This is possible if y is solidly Northwest of z and x is just slightly North of y, or if y is far enough Northwest of z to make the angle from z to x within the Northwest range regardless of how far North x is from y.

So, the possible directions from z to x are: North or Northwest.

But, again, this depends on the exact positions of z, y, and x. For some configurations, x could be in the North direction from z, and for others, x could be in the Northwest direction from z.

North or Northwest seem to be the only possible answers, given the constraints. I can't find a way for x to be in any other direction from z given that y is Northwest of z and x is North of y.

To double check, let's go through all 8 cardinal directions and see if they're possible:
- North: Yes, as discussed.
- Northeast: No, because if y is Northwest of z, then y has a negative x-coordinate from z's perspective. And if x is North of y, it has the same x-coordinate as y, which is negative. So, x must have a negative x-coordinate from z's perspective, which means it can't be in the Northeast direction.
- East: No, for the same reason as Northeast.
- Southeast: No, for the same reason as Northeast.
- South: No, because if y is Northwest of z, then y has a positive y-coordinate from z's perspective. And if x is North of y, it has a larger y-coordinate than y, which is also positive. So, x must have a positive y-coordinate from z's perspective, which means it can't be in the South direction.
- Southwest: No, because if y is Northwest of z, then y has a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate from z's perspective. And if x is North of y, it has the same x-coordinate as y (negative) and a larger y-coordinate (positive). So, x must have a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate from z's perspective, which means it can't be in the Southwest direction.
- West: No, because if y is Northwest of z, then y has a positive y-coordinate from z's perspective. And if x is North of y, it has a larger y-coordinate than y, which is also positive. So, x must have a positive y-coordinate from z's perspective, which means it can't be in the West direction.
- Northwest: Yes, as discussed.

So, the possible directions from z to x are: North or Northwest.

So, the possible cardinal directions that describe the relationship between region x and region z are North and Northwest.

But wait, I think I'm forgetting about some other relations in a cardinal direction model. In addition to the 8 basic cardinal directions, there's also the possibility of a "bounding box" relationship, especially when dealing with regions. Should I check if "bounding box" is a possible relation between x and z?

In the standard cardinal direction model for regions, two regions are related by one of the 9 basic relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and EQ (equal or bounding box). The EQ relation holds when one region is inside the minimum bounding rectangle of the other.

In our case, region y is Northwest of region z, and region x is North of region y. Can region x be in the bounding box of region z? I don't think so. If y is Northwest of z, it means y is outside the bounding box of z. And if x is North of y, it means x is outside the bounding box of y. So, x should also be outside the bounding box of z.

Actually, I'm not sure if EQ is actually defined as a "bounding box" relation. EQ typically means "equal" in the sense that the two regions have the same extent. The "bounding box" relation is often used when we're comparing a point to a region, not a region to a region. For region-to-region relations, I believe the standard is to relate the two regions based on the direction of one's bounding box relative to the other's.

Given that, and since we're strictly working with regions, the "bounding box" isn't a separate relation, and there are only 8 possible basic cardinal directions. As we've shown, the possible directions from z to x are: North or Northwest.

I realize I may have been overthinking this problem, but I wanted to be thorough. The answer is: the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are North and Northwest.

Actually, let me try one more time with the standard cardinal direction model for regions.

In the standard cardinal direction model for regions, we relate two regions based on the position of one's minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) relative to the other's MBR. There are 9 basic relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and O (overlap or bounding box).

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

For x to be North of y, the MBR of x must be entirely above the MBR of y (in terms of y-coordinates) and there must be a vertical overlap of their x-extents. And for y to be Northwest of z, the MBR of y must be entirely above and to the left of the MBR of z, with no overlap of their x-extents or y-extents.

If y is Northwest of z, and x is North of y, then x is certainly to the north (in terms of y-coordinates) of z. The question is about the x-coordinate relation. Since y is to the left of z (in terms of x-coordinates), and x overlaps with y in terms of x-coordinates, x could be to the left of z, or it could have some overlap with z in terms of x-coordinates. This gives us two possibilities:
- If x is entirely to the left of z (in terms of x-coordinates), then x is Northwest of z.
- If x has some overlap with z in terms of x-coordinates, then x is North of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North or Northwest.

I think the question is asking for all the possible relations, and the answer is: North and Northwest.

Actually, one more approach to be thorough. Let's use the formal definition of cardinal direction relations for regions.

In the 9-intersection model of cardinal directions for regions, the relation between two regions x and z is determined by the intersection of x with the 9 tiles formed by z's bounding box: NW, N, NE, W, O, E, SW, S, SE. Here, O represents the tile that corresponds to the bounding box of z.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

If x is North of y, then x intersects only the North tile of y. And if y is Northwest of z, then y intersects only the Northwest tile of z.

The question is: Which tiles of z does x intersect?

If y is in the Northwest tile of z, and x is in the North tile of y, then x can intersect either the Northwest tile of z, the North tile of z, or both, depending on the exact shapes and positions of the regions.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: North, Northwest, or North-Northwest (meaning x intersects both the North and Northwest tiles of z).

But since I don't think "North-Northwest" is one of the standard cardinal direction relations, I think the answer is: North and Northwest.

Actually, I'm confused. Let me try once more. I'll use the basic 9-tile approach:

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

If we draw the 9 tiles for region y (based on its bounding box), then x is entirely in the North tile of y. And if we draw the 9 tiles for region z, then y is entirely in the Northwest tile of z.

If we want to determine the relation between x and z, we need to see which of the 9 tiles of z the region x intersects.

If y is in the Northwest tile of z, and x is in the North tile of y, then x can potentially intersect the Northwest, North, or both tiles of z.

But the reason I'm confused is that, in the basic cardinal direction model, the relation between two regions is determined by which of the 9 tiles of one region the other region intersects. If a region intersects multiple tiles, the relation is typically considered to be a disjunction of the basic relations. For instance, if region x intersects both the North and Northwest tiles of region z, the relation is often denoted as "N + NW" or "N ∪ NW".

Regardless, if the question is asking for the possible basic cardinal direction relations that can hold between region x and region z, I think the answer is: North and Northwest.

To double-check, here are the coordinates for a specific configuration:
- Let z be at (0, 0) with a small extent, say a rectangle from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
- Let y be at (-3, 3) with a small extent, say a rectangle from (-4, 2) to (-2, 4). This places y entirely in the Northwest tile of z.
- Let x be at (-3, 6) with a small extent, say a rectangle from (-4, 5) to (-2, 7). This places x entirely in the North tile of y.

From z's perspective, x is at approximately (-3, 6). The angle from z to x is approximately arctan(6/(-3)), which is about 117°. This puts x in the Northwest cone from z's perspective.

Now, let's try another configuration:
- Let z be at (0, 0) with a large extent, say a rectangle from (-5, -5) to (5, 5).
- Let y be at (-10, 10) with a small extent, say a rectangle from (-11, 9) to (-9, 11). This places y in the Northwest tile of z.
- Let x be a very wide region, say a rectangle from (-20, 15) to (10, 20). This places x in the North tile of y.

From z's perspective, the leftmost part of x is at (-20, 15). This is clearly in the Northwest tile of z. But the rightmost part of x is at (10, 15), which is in the Northeast tile of z. So, x intersects the Northwest, North, and Northeast tiles of z.

Wait, this doesn't match our constraints. If x is in the North tile of y, it means the x-coordinates of x should be within the x-coordinates of y. In our case, y has x-coordinates from -11 to -9, so x should have x-coordinates from -11 to -9 as well. If we adjust x to be a rectangle from (-11, 15) to (-9, 20), then it's in the North tile of y.

From z's perspective, x is now at approximately (-10, 17.5). The angle from z to x is approximately arctan(17.5/(-10)), which is about 120°. This puts x in the Northwest cone from z's perspective.

Actually, I think I've been mixing the definition of "North" between the 9-tile approach and the cone approach. Let me clarify.

In the 9-tile approach, a region x is North of region y if x is entirely contained in the North tile of y's bounding box. The North tile extends infinitely in the North direction, but it's bounded by the x-coordinates of y's bounding box.

In the cone approach, a region x is North of region y if, for any point p in x and any point q in y, the angle from q to p is between 67.5° and 112.5° (centered at 90°).

Given:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is Northwest of region z.

In the 9-tile approach:
If y is in the Northwest tile of z, it means y is above and to the left of z. If x is in the North tile of y, it means x is above y, but within the x-extent of y. Since y is to the left of z, and x is within the x-extent of y, x is also to the left of z. So, x is in the Northwest tile of z.

But this seems wrong. Let me try with a specific example. If z's bounding box is from (-1, -1) to (1, 1), then the Northwest tile of z includes all points (x, y) where x < -1 and y > 1. If y's bounding box is from (-3, 2) to (-2, 3), then the North tile of y includes all points (x, y) where -3 <= x <= -2 and y > 3. So, if x is in the North tile of y, it's position would be (-3 <= x <= -2, y > 3). From z's perspective, such a position is clearly in the Northwest tile of z, because it's above and to the left of z.

But what if z's bounding box is from (-10, -10) to (10, 10)? The Northwest tile of z includes all points (x, y) where x < -10 and y > 10. If y's bounding box is from (-15, 15) to (5, 20), then y is indeed in the Northwest tile of z. The North tile of y includes all points (x, y) where -15 <= x <= 5 and y > 20. If x is in the North tile of y, its x-coordinate could be between -15 and 5, and its y-coordinate would be greater than 20. If x's x-coordinate is between -15 and -10, then x is in the Northwest tile of z. But if x's x-coordinate is between -10 and 5, then x intersects the North tile of z. So, in this case, x could be either Northwest of z, North of z, or it could intersect both the Northwest and North tiles of z.

So, it seems like the possible relations between x and z in the 9-tile approach are: Northwest, North, or a combination of both.

In the cone approach:
If y is in the Northwest cone of z, it means the angle from z to y is between 112.5° and 157.5°. If x is in the North cone of y, it means the angle from y to x is between 67.5° and 112.5°. The angle from z to x depends on the specific positions of z, y, and x. If y is far to the Northwest of z and x is just slightly to the North of y, then x would be in the Northwest cone from z's perspective. But if y is just slightly to the Northwest of z and x is far to the North of y, then x could be in the North cone from z's perspective.

So, in the cone approach, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest or North.

Given these two approaches, and considering the original problem statement, I think the possible relations between region x and region z are: North, Northwest, or a combination of both.

But if we're strictly asked for the possible basic cardinal direction relations, the answer would be: North and Northwest.

In conclusion, the answer is North and Northwest.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

North
Northwest
