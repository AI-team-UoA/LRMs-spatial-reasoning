PROMPT: Let North and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem using spatial reasoning.

We have the following given:
- Region x is North of region y. This means y is South of x.
- Region y is Southeast of region z. This means z is Northwest of y.

Now I need to determine what is the possible relation between x and z.

Let's place this on a grid to visualize. Let's say that:
- North means moving up on the grid (increasing y-coordinate)
- South means moving down on the grid (decreasing y-coordinate)
- East means moving right on the grid (increasing x-coordinate)
- West means moving left on the grid (decreasing x-coordinate)
- Southeast means moving down and right (decreasing y-coordinate, increasing x-coordinate)
- Northwest means moving up and left (increasing y-coordinate, decreasing x-coordinate)
- Northeast means moving up and right (increasing y-coordinate, increasing x-coordinate)
- Southwest means moving down and left (decreasing y-coordinate, decreasing x-coordinate)

So if we place z at the origin (0, 0), then y would be somewhere to the southeast of z. Let's say y is at (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0. This means y is a units east and b units south of z.

Now, x is to the north of y. So x would be at (a, -b+c) where c > 0. This means x is c units north of y.

So x is at (a, -b+c) and z is at (0, 0).

To determine the relation between x and z, I need to compare their coordinates.
- x is a units east of z (since a > 0)
- x is (-b+c) units north of z. If -b+c > 0, then x is north of z. If -b+c < 0, then x is south of z. If -b+c = 0, then x is at the same "latitude" as z.

So there are three cases:
1. If -b+c > 0, then x is northeast of z (since it's both north and east).
2. If -b+c < 0, then x is southeast of z (since it's both south and east).
3. If -b+c = 0, then x is directly east of z.

But wait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let me try again, thinking more carefully about the cardinal directions.

Actually, let's define more precisely what we mean by "North", "Southeast", etc. 

North: y-coordinate increases, x-coordinate stays the same
South: y-coordinate decreases, x-coordinate stays the same
East: x-coordinate increases, y-coordinate stays the same
West: x-coordinate decreases, y-coordinate stays the same
Northeast: both x and y coordinates increase
Northwest: x-coordinate decreases, y-coordinate increases
Southeast: x-coordinate increases, y-coordinate decreases
Southwest: both x and y coordinates decrease

Now let's say we place z at the origin (0, 0).

Since y is southeast of z, y would be at position (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

Since x is north of y, x would be at position (a, -b+c) where c > 0 and c > b (for x to be strictly to the north of y, we need x's y-coordinate to be greater than y's y-coordinate, which means -b+c > -b, or c > 0).

So x is at (a, -b+c) and z is at (0, 0).

To determine the relation between x and z, I compare their coordinates:
- x's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate by a units (a > 0)
- x's y-coordinate is (-b+c) compared to z's y-coordinate. If -b+c > 0, then x is north of z. If -b+c < 0, then x is south of z. If -b+c = 0, then x is at the same latitude as z.

So the relation between x and z depends on the values of b and c:
1. If c > b, then -b+c > 0, and x is northeast of z.
2. If c < b, then -b+c < 0, and x is southeast of z.
3. If c = b, then -b+c = 0, and x is directly east of z.

But I think I still need to be more careful about the exact definitions of cardinal directions.

Let's say that:
- "North of" means having a higher y-coordinate and the same x-coordinate
- "South of" means having a lower y-coordinate and the same x-coordinate
- "East of" means having a higher x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate
- "West of" means having a lower x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate
- "Northeast of" means having both higher x and y coordinates
- "Northwest of" means having a higher y-coordinate and a lower x-coordinate
- "Southeast of" means having a higher x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate
- "Southwest of" means having both lower x and y coordinates

Let's place z at the origin (0, 0).

Since y is southeast of z, y would be at position (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

Now, x is north of y. With our strict definition, this would mean x is at position (a, -b+c) where c > 0.

So x is at (a, -b+c) and z is at (0, 0).

To determine the strict cardinal relation between x and z, I need to compare their coordinates:
- x's x-coordinate is greater than z's x-coordinate by a units (a > 0)
- x's y-coordinate is (-b+c) compared to z's y-coordinate. 
  - If -b+c > 0, then x is above z on the grid.
  - If -b+c < 0, then x is below z on the grid.
  - If -b+c = 0, then x is at the same "latitude" as z.

So the relation between x and z depends on the values of b and c:
1. If c > b, then -b+c > 0, and x is to the northeast of z (both higher x and y coordinates).
2. If c < b, then -b+c < 0, and x is to the southeast of z (higher x-coordinate, lower y-coordinate).
3. If c = b, then -b+c = 0, and x is directly to the east of z (higher x-coordinate, same y-coordinate).

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

OK but these definitions of cardinal directions seem a bit too strict, because often "North of" is used to mean "somewhere in the northern direction", which includes "Northeast" and "Northwest". Let me reconsider again.

I think a more appropriate definition would be:
- "North of" means having a higher y-coordinate (regardless of x-coordinate)
- "South of" means having a lower y-coordinate (regardless of x-coordinate)
- "East of" means having a higher x-coordinate (regardless of y-coordinate)
- "West of" means having a lower x-coordinate (regardless of y-coordinate)
- "Northeast of" means having both higher x and y coordinates
- "Northwest of" means having a higher y-coordinate and a lower x-coordinate
- "Southeast of" means having a higher x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate
- "Southwest of" means having both lower x and y coordinates

But this doesn't make sense either, because then we could say that a point is both "North of" and "South of" another point, which doesn't align with how these terms are used.

OK wait I think my original definitions were correct. Let's just be very explicit. The eight basic cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) are like the eight sectors of a circle centered at a reference point.

Now let's start again with a clearer understanding.

We're told that:
- Region x is North of region y. This means x is somewhere in the "North" sector relative to y.
- Region y is Southeast of region z. This means y is somewhere in the "Southeast" sector relative to z.

Now, to figure out the possible relation between x and z, I need to consider where x could be located relative to z, given the constraints.

Let's think of it this way: starting from z, I go to y, and then from y, I go to x. I need to determine where x could end up relative to z.

Starting from z, if I go southeast to reach y, then from y, if I go north to reach x, x could be:
- Northeast of z
- North of z
- East of z

Let me confirm this with a few examples using coordinates.

Let's say z is at the origin (0, 0).

Example 1: y is at (1, -1) (southeast of z), and x is at (1, 0) (north of y). 
From z's perspective, x is to the east.

Example 2: y is at (1, -1) (southeast of z), and x is at (1, 1) (north of y). 
From z's perspective, x is to the northeast.

Example 3: y is at (2, -1) (southeast of z), and x is at (2, 1) (north of y). 
From z's perspective, x is to the northeast.

Example 4: y is at (1, -2) (southeast of z), and x is at (1, -1) (north of y). 
From z's perspective, x is to the southeast.

Example 5: y is at (1, -2) (southeast of z), and x is at (1, 0) (north of y). 
From z's perspective, x is to the east.

So based on these examples, x could be:
- Northeast of z
- East of z
- Southeast of z

Let me double-check this result. The problem is asking for the possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southeast of z

x being North of y means that x has the same x-coordinate as y and a larger y-coordinate.
y being Southeast of z means that y has a larger x-coordinate than z and a smaller y-coordinate.

So, if z is at (0, 0), then y would be at (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0, and x would be at (a, -b+c) where c > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I compare their coordinates:
- x's x-coordinate is a, which is greater than z's x-coordinate of 0. So x is to the "east" of z.
- x's y-coordinate is -b+c, which could be positive, negative, or zero depending on the values of b and c.
  - If c > b, then -b+c > 0, and x is to the "north" of z.
  - If c < b, then -b+c < 0, and x is to the "south" of z.
  - If c = b, then -b+c = 0, and x is at the same "latitude" as z.

Combining these, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast (if c > b)
- East (if c = b)
- Southeast (if c < b)

Hmmm... I still don't feel fully confident in my answer because the definitions of cardinal directions can be ambiguous.

I think I'm overthinking this. In standard cardinal directions:
- "North of" means having a higher y-coordinate and the same x-coordinate.
- "Southeast of" means having a higher x-coordinate and a lower y-coordinate.

Given these definitions, if z is at (0, 0), then y would be at (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0, and x would be at (a, -b) where c > 0.

Let me re-interpret the problem again. I think I made an error in how I was visualizing "North of". Let's try again.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southeast of z

"North of" means having a higher latitude (or y-coordinate in our grid system) and the same longitude (or x-coordinate). 
"Southeast of" means having a lower latitude (or y-coordinate) and a higher longitude (or x-coordinate).

Placing z at the origin (0, 0):
- y is Southeast of z, so y would be at position (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0.
- x is North of y, so x would be at position (a, -b+c) where c > 0.

So, x is at (a, -b+c) and z is at (0, 0).

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to compare their coordinates:
- x's x-coordinate is a, which is greater than z's x-coordinate of 0. So, x is to the "east" of z.
- x's y-coordinate is -b+c, which could be positive, negative, or zero:
  - If c > b, then -b+c > 0, and x is to the "north" of z.
  - If c < b, then -b+c < 0, and x is to the "south" of z.
  - If c = b, then -b+c = 0, and x is at the same "latitude" as z.

Combining these:
- If c > b: x is Northeast of z.
- If c = b: x is East of z.
- If c < b: x is Southeast of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actaully, on second thought, I may have been overthinking, but I'm still not 100% sure about the definitions. I think I need to be more precise about what "North of" and "Southeast of" mean.

Let's consider a standard compass with 8 cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW. 
- "North of" means being in the North direction, which is a region or wedge radiating outwards from the reference point. It's not just a point that's directly north.
- Similarly, "Southeast of" means being in the Southeast direction, which is a region or wedge.

Under this interpretation, when we say "x is North of y", we're saying that x lies somewhere in the North region relative to y. Similarly, when we say "y is Southeast of z", we're saying that y lies somewhere in the Southeast region relative to z.

Now, let's think about where x could be relative to z.

We know that:
- y is Southeast of z.
- x is North of y.

Imagine standing at z and looking southeast. You'd see y somewhere in the Southeast region. From y, if you look North, you'd see x somewhere in the North region relative to y.

So, starting from z, you'd go southeast to y, and then north from y to x.

Using a compass, if you start facing Southeast, which is between East and South, and then turn to face North, you could end up facing Northeast, North, or Northwest. But since you started from a position southeast of your original starting point, you might not necessarily return to the exact same area. You could end up northeast, north, east, southeast, or just very close to where you started.

But I think I'm overcomplicating again. Let's go back to our coordinate system and try a more analytical approach.

If z is at the origin (0, 0), and y is southeast of z, then y could be at any point with coordinates (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

If x is north of y, then x would be at (a, -b+c) where c > 0. (Note that "north of" doesn't mean directly north, but rather in the north region.)

So, x is at (a, -b+c) and z is at (0, 0).

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider where x is located relative to z:
- x's x-coordinate is a, which is greater than z's x-coordinate of 0. So, x is to the "east" of z.
- x's y-coordinate is -b+c, which could be positive, negative, or zero:
  - If c > b, then -b+c > 0, and x is to the "north" of z.
  - If c < b, then -b+c < 0, and x is to the "south" of z.
  - If c = b, then -b+c = 0, and x is at the same "latitude" as z.

Combining these:
- If c > b: x is Northeast of z.
- If c = b: x is East of z.
- If c < b: x is Southeast of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

OK I'm going to reframe the problem one more time, with one more interpretation of "North of".

If we say "x is North of y", I think we can have two interpretations:
1. Strict interpretation: x is directly North of y (both have the same longitude or x-coordinate).
2. Loose interpretation: x is somewhere in the Northern hemisphere relative to y (which includes Northeast and Northwest).

Similarly, if we say "y is Southeast of z", we can have:
1. Strict interpretation: y is directly Southeast of z (at a 135-degree angle).
2. Loose interpretation: y is somewhere in the Southeastern quadrant relative to z.

Let's go with the strict interpretation first.

If z is at the origin (0, 0):
- y is directly Southeast of z, so y would be at (a, -a) for some a > 0.
- x is directly North of y, so x would be at (a, -a+b) for some b > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider where x is located relative to z:
- x's x-coordinate is a, which is greater than z's x-coordinate of 0. So, x is to the "east" of z.
- x's y-coordinate is -a+b, which could be positive, negative, or zero:
  - If b > a, then -a+b > 0, and x is to the "north" of z.
  - If b < a, then -a+b < 0, and x is to the "south" of z.
  - If b = a, then -a+b = 0, and x is at the same "latitude" as z.

Combining these:
- If b > a: x is Northeast of z.
- If b = a: x is East of z.
- If b < a: x is Southeast of z.

But I think the strict interpretation is too restrictive for the problem. Let's go with the loose interpretation, which seems more in line with how cardinal directions are typically used.

So, "x is North of y" means x is somewhere in the Northern region relative to y. This includes North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Similarly, "y is Southeast of z" means y is somewhere in the Southeastern quadrant relative to z.

OK wait let me go back to the original definition of cardinal directions and work through this one more time.

There are 8 traditional cardinal directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

- "North of" means being located in the direction where the angle from East is 90 degrees (so straight up on a map).
- "Northeast of" means being located in the direction where the angle from East is 45 degrees.
- "East of" means being located in the direction where the angle from East is 0 degrees (so straight to the right on a map).
- "Southeast of" means being located in the direction where the angle from East is -45 degrees.
- "South of" means being located in the direction where the angle from East is -90 degrees (so straight down on a map).
- "Southwest of" means being located in the direction where the angle from East is -135 degrees.
- "West of" means being located in the direction where the angle from East is 180 degrees (so straight to the left on a map).
- "Northwest of" means being located in the direction where the angle from East is 135 degrees.

When we say "x is North of y", we mean that x is located in the North direction from y. Similarly, when we say "y is Southeast of z", we mean that y is located in the Southeast direction from z.

Now, let's place z at the origin (0, 0) and work our way from there.

If y is Southeast of z, then y is in the direction where the angle from East is -45 degrees. So, y could be at any point (a, -a) where a > 0.

If x is North of y, then x is in the direction where the angle from East is 90 degrees, but this angle is measured from y. So, from y's perspective, x would be at (a, -a+b) where b > 0 (since we're moving North from y).

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider where x is located relative to z:
- x's x-coordinate is a, which is greater than z's x-coordinate of 0. So, x is to the "east" of z.
- x's y-coordinate is -a+b, which could be positive, negative, or zero:
  - If b > a, then -a+b > 0, and x is to the "north" of z.
  - If b < a, then -a+b < 0, and x is to the "south" of z.
  - If b = a, then -a+b = 0, and x is at the same "latitude" as z.

Combining these:
- If b > a: x is Northeast of z.
- If b = a: x is East of z.
- If b < a: x is Southeast of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

But this still assumes that "North of" and "Southeast of" are strict directions. In reality, when we say "x is North of y", we might mean that x is somewhere in the northern hemisphere relative to y. Similarly, "y is Southeast of z" might mean that y is somewhere in the southeastern quadrant relative to z.

Actually, I'm starting to think that there might not be a universally agreed-upon definition for these terms, and the interpretation might vary based on context. Let me see if there's a standard definition I can use.

Actually, for the problem, let's assume that the cardinal directions are strict (not regions or wedges), which is the interpretation I used just now.

Given:
- x is North of y: x is at the same longitude as y but at a higher latitude.
- y is Southeast of z: y is at a higher longitude than z and at a lower latitude.

Using a coordinate system, if z is at (0, 0), then y would be at (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0 (Southeast of z). 

If x is North of y, then x would be at (a, -b+c) where c > 0 (North of y).

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I compare their coordinates:
- x's x-coordinate is a, which is greater than z's x-coordinate of 0. So, x is to the "east" of z.
- x's y-coordinate is -b+c, which could be positive, negative, or zero:
  - If c > b, then -b+c > 0, and x is to the "north" of z.
  - If c < b, then -b+c < 0, and x is to the "south" of z.
  - If c = b, then -b+c = 0, and x is at the same "latitude" as z.

Combining these:
- If c > b: x is Northeast of z.
- If c = b: x is East of z.
- If c < b: x is Southeast of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

OK actually, on further reflection, I think I was overly complicating the problem and have been correct in my analysis.

"North of" means that the relation North holds. Since we're talking about direction in the plane, a direction can be represented as a vector or angle. North is a specific direction, which is at a 90-degree angle from East. When we say "x is North of y", we mean that x is located in the North direction from y.

Similarly, "Southeast of" means that the relation Southeast holds. It's a specific direction, at a -45-degree angle from East.

When combining these relations, we need to consider all possible relative positions. Since I've worked out my reasoning above and have determined that the possible relations between x and z are Northeast, East, or Southeast, I'll stick with that answer. 

Actually, let me just double check once more, with a slightly different framing. 

Alright, let's represent the problem in a way that's hopefully clearer.

We're given:
- x is North of y
- y is Southeast of z

We want to find out the possible relation between x and z.

Visually, let's represent z as our reference point at the origin (0, 0).

```
        N
        |
    NW  |  NE
        |
W ------|------ E
        |
    SW  |  SE
        |
        S
```

Since y is Southeast of z, y is somewhere in the SE direction from z. Let's place y at (1, -1) for simplicity.

```
        N
        |
    NW  |  NE
        |
W ------|------ E
        |
    SW  |  SE
        |  y(1,-1)
        S
```

Now, x is North of y. So x is in the N direction from y. This means x is at (1, c) where c > -1 (because we're moving North from y, which is at (1, -1)).

```
        N
        |
    NW  |  NE
        |  x(1,c) where c>-1
W ------|------ E
        |
    SW  |  SE
        |  y(1,-1)
        S
```

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to consider where x is located relative to z.

If c > 0, then x is in the NE direction from z.
If c = 0, then x is in the E direction from z.
If -1 < c < 0, then x is in the SE direction from z.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast (if c > 0)
- East (if c = 0)
- Southeast (if -1 < c < 0)

Great, so the same set of possible relations as I had before: Northeast, East, and Southeast.

Let me confirm with one more visual illustration:

```
            N
            |
        NW  |  NE
            |  x (if c > 0)
W ----------|---------- E
            |  x (if c = 0)
        SW  |  SE
            |  x (if -1 < c < 0)
            |  y(1,-1)
            S
```

From this, it's clear that the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast (if c > 0)
- East (if c = 0)
- Southeast (if -1 < c < 0)

So the possible relations between x and z are: Northeast, East, Southeast.

Actually, let's be precise here. In the problem statement, it says "possible relations". So we need to find all possible relations between x and z, not just a specific relation.

Since x is North of y and y is Southeast of z, the possible relations between x and z, based on our analysis, are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northeast, East, Southeast.

Actually, I've been thinking about this "North of" and "Southeast of" as exact cardinal directions. But it's possible that these terms are meant to be interpreted as qualitative spatial relationships, where "North of" means "somewhere in the northern direction" and "Southeast of" means "somewhere in the southeastern direction".

Let me explore the problem once more with this interpretation:

If "x is North of y" means that x is somewhere in the northern direction from y, then x could be North, Northeast, or Northwest of y.

Similarly, if "y is Southeast of z" means that y is somewhere in the southeastern direction from z, then y could be Southeast of z.

Let's work through this spatially. If z is at the origin (0, 0), and y is Southeast of z, then y could be at (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

For each of the possible interpretations of "x is North of y":
- If x is directly North of y, then x would be at (a, -b+c) where c > 0.
- If x is Northeast of y, then x would be at (a+d, -b+c) where c > 0 and d > 0.
- If x is Northwest of y, then x would be at (a-d, -b+c) where c > 0 and d > 0 (but d < a, since x still needs to be to the right of the y-axis to be East of z).

For the case where x is directly North of y:
- If c > b, then x is Northeast of z.
- If c = b, then x is East of z.
- If c < b, then x is Southeast of z.

For the case where x is Northeast of y:
- x would be at (a+d, -b+c), which is to the East of z.
- If c > b, then x is Northeast of z.
- If c = b, then x is East of z.
- If c < b, then x is Southeast of z.

For the case where x is Northwest of y:
- x would be at (a-d, -b+c), which could be East, West, or directly North of z, depending on the values of a and d.
- If a-d > 0 and c > b, then x is Northeast of z.
- If a-d > 0 and c = b, then x is East of z.
- If a-d > 0 and c < b, then x is Southeast of z.
- If a-d = 0 and c > b, then x is directly North of z.
- If a-d < 0 and c > b, then x is Northwest of z.
- If a-d < 0 and c = b, then x is West of z.
- If a-d < 0 and c < b, then x is Southwest of z.

So, considering all these cases, the possible relations between x and z are:
- North
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
- Northwest
- West
- Southwest

Actually, let me clarify the prompt once more. The prompt has "cardinal direction relations", which suggests that the directions are not regions or wedges, but rather specific relations.

Given the precise nature of the prompt, let's go with the strict interpretation: "North of" means exactly North, and "Southeast of" means exactly Southeast.

So, if z is at the origin (0, 0), then y would be at (a, -a) for some a > 0 (exactly Southeast of z). And if x is exactly North of y, then x would be at (a, -a+b) for some b > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider where x is located relative to z:
- x's x-coordinate is a, which is greater than z's x-coordinate of 0. So, x is to the "east" of z.
- x's y-coordinate is -a+b, which could be positive, negative, or zero:
  - If b > a, then -a+b > 0, and x is to the "north" of z.
  - If b < a, then -a+b < 0, and x is to the "south" of z.
  - If b = a, then -a+b = 0, and x is at the same "latitude" as z.

Combining these:
- If b > a: x is Northeast of z.
- If b = a: x is East of z.
- If b < a: x is Southeast of z.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's use a straightforward interpretation for clarity.

"North of" means exactly North. "Southeast of" means exactly Southeast. That is, going from one to other means going in the exact direction of the cardinal direction.

But let me more precise about "exactly". I think "exactly" Southeast means the spatial relation where one entity is exactly to the Southeast of another. That is, if we were to draw a line from the second entity to the first, the line would point in the exact direction of Southeast. Similarly for "exactly" North.

So to say "y is Southeast of z" is to say "y is exactly to the Southeast of z".

So with this, if z is at the origin (0, 0), then y would be at (a, -a) for some a > 0 (exactly Southeast of z). And if x is exactly North of y, then x would be at (a, -a+b) for some b > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider where x is located relative to z:
- x's x-coordinate is a, which is greater than z's x-coordinate of 0. So, x is to the "east" of z.
- x's y-coordinate is -a+b, which could be positive, negative, or zero:
  - If b > a, then -a+b > 0, and x is to the "north" of z.
  - If b < a, then -a+b < 0, and x is to the "south" of z.
  - If b = a, then -a+b = 0, and x is at the same "latitude" as z.

Wait, I see the problem. When I say "exactly" North, I think I mean "exactly 90 degrees from the East axis". Using the definition of "North of" as "has the same longitude but a higher latitude", I'm redefining:

- "North of" means exactly North. Using a coordinate system, if we say "a is North of b", it means a has the same x-coordinate as b, but a higher y-coordinate.
- "Southeast of" means exactly Southeast. Using a coordinate system, if we say "c is Southeast of d", it means c has a higher x-coordinate than d and a lower y-coordinate. In particular, the displacement in the x and y directions are equal in magnitude. In other words, you go "one east, one south".

So with this definition, if z is at the origin (0, 0), then y would be at (a, -a) for some a > 0 (exactly Southeast of z). And if x is exactly North of y, then x would be at (a, -a+b) for some b > 0.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider where x is located relative to z:
- x's x-coordinate is a, which is greater than z's x-coordinate of 0. So, x is to the "east" of z.
- x's y-coordinate is -a+b, which could be positive, negative, or zero:
  - If b > a, then -a+b > 0, and x is to the "north" of z.
  - If b < a, then -a+b < 0, and x is to the "south" of z.
  - If b = a, then -a+b = 0, and x is at the same "latitude" as z.

But now I'm not sure if x is exactly East, Northeast, or Southeast of z. To be exactly East, the displacement from z to x should be entirely in the x-direction. But x is at (a, -a+b), which has a non-zero y-component unless b = a. Similarly, to be exactly Northeast, the displacement from z to x should be equal in the x and y directions. And to be exactly Southeast, the displacement from z to x should be equal in the x direction and negative y direction.

Actually, I'm being pedantic. The problem isn't asking for "exact" relations. It's just asking for the "possible" relations. And the possible relations are determined by the constraints of the problem, which are:
- x is North of y
- y is Southeast of z

Given these constraints, we've already established that the relation between x and z depends on the values of a and b.

If we define the cardinal directions as the 8 standard compass directions, and not as "exact" directions, then the relation between x and z would be:
- If b > a, then x is in the Northeast quadrant relative to z. The exact direction may not be precisely Northeast, but it's in that general direction.
- If b = a, then x is exactly East of z.
- If b < a, then x is in the Southeast quadrant relative to z. The exact direction may not be precisely Southeast, but it's in that general direction.

It's worth noting that the problem is asking for "which could the possible relations between region x and region z be". So it's asking for all possible relations, not just one.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

Actually, I think I still am overthinking this. In general terms:
- "North of" means having a higher latitude (y-coordinate).
- "Southeast of" means having a higher longitude (x-coordinate) and a lower latitude (y-coordinate).

Given the constraints:
- x is North of y: x has the same x-coordinate as y and a higher y-coordinate.
- y is Southeast of z: y has a higher x-coordinate than z and a lower y-coordinate.

Using coordinates, if z is at the origin (0, 0), then y would be at (a, -b) where a > 0 and b > 0. And if x is North of y, then x would be at (a, -b+c) where c > 0.

Now, the relation between x and z depends on the values of a, b, and c.

Given that x is at (a, -b+c) and z is at (0, 0):
- x is to the "east" of z (since a > 0).
- The vertical relationship between x and z depends on the values of b and c.

If -b+c > 0, then x is to the "north" of z. Combining with the fact that x is to the "east" of z, x would be in the Northeast quadrant relative to z. The exact direction may not be precisely Northeast, but it's in that general direction.

If -b+c = 0, then x is at the same latitude as z. Since x is to the "east" of z, x would be East of z.

If -b+c < 0, then x is to the "south" of z. Combining with the fact that x is to the "east" of z, x would be in the Southeast quadrant relative to z. The exact direction may not be precisely Southeast, but it's in that general direction.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast (if -b+c > 0)
- East (if -b+c = 0)
- Southeast (if -b+c < 0)

Given that c > 0 and b > 0, all of these scenarios are possible depending on the relative values of c and b.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

And to double check, let's write out the coordinates for a concrete example in each case:

Northeast: If z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, -1) (Southeast of z), and x is at (1, 1) (North of y), then x is at (1, 1) relative to z, which is Northeast of z.

East: If z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, -1) (Southeast of z), and x is at (1, 0) (North of y), then x is at (1, 0) relative to z, which is East of z.

Southeast: If z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, -2) (Southeast of z), and x is at (1, -1) (North of y), then x is at (1, -1) relative to z, which is Southeast of z.

Yes, I'm confident now. The possible relations between x and z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is Southeast of region z

To determine the possible relations between x and z, I need to analyze where x could be located relative to z.

Let me place z at the origin (0,0) for reference:
- Since y is Southeast of z, y would be at some point (a,-b) where a>0 and b>0
- Since x is North of y, x would be at (a,-b+c) where c>0

Now comparing x's position to z:
- x is always east of z (since a>0)
- x's vertical position depends on the values of b and c:
  * If c>b: x is northeast of z
  * If c=b: x is east of z
  * If c<b: x is southeast of z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- Northeast
- East
- Southeast
