PROMPT: Let North and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

THINKING:

Let's think about the spatial relationships described in the problem:
- Region x is North of region y.
- Region y is East of region z.

Now, we need to determine the possible spatial relationships between region x and region z.

To visualize this, I'll use a coordinate system where North is the positive y-direction and East is the positive x-direction.

If region y is at some position (a, b), then:
- Region x is North of y, so x is at position (a, b + c) where c > 0.
- Region z is West of y (since y is East of z), so z is at position (a - d, b) where d > 0.

So, if x is at (a, b + c) and z is at (a - d, b), then relative to z, x is at position (a - (a - d), (b + c) - b) = (d, c). This means x is d units East and c units North of z.

Since both d > 0 and c > 0, x is both North and East of z. In cardinal directions, this corresponds to the Northeast direction.

So, the relation between region x and region z is Northeast.

Actually, let me double-check my reasoning because I want to be careful about this.

We're given that region x is North of region y. This means x has a higher y-coordinate than y, but the same x-coordinate.

We're also given that region y is East of region z. This means y has a higher x-coordinate than z, but the same y-coordinate.

So if y is at position (a, b), then:
- x is at position (a, b + c) where c > 0.
- z is at position (a - d, b) where d > 0.

The relationship between x and z is the vector from z to x, which is (a, b + c) - (a - d, b) = (d, c). Since d > 0 and c > 0, this means x is Northeast of z.

So the answer remains: Northeast.

Actually, let me re-examine the problem statement to make sure I've understood it correctly.

"Let North and East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

Hmm, the question is asking for "possible relations", not just the one relation. This might mean there's more than one possible relation between x and z, depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z.

Let's consider different scenarios for the positions of the regions.

Scenario 1: The simplest case is where the regions are points. In this case, if x is directly North of y and y is directly East of z, then x is Northeast of z. This is the scenario I analyzed above.

Scenario 2: But what if the regions have a non-zero area? In that case, the relation "North of" means that every point in x is North of some point in y, and every point in y is North of some point in x. Similarly, "East of" means that every point in y is East of some point in z, and every point in z is West of some point in y.

Let me reconsider the problem with regions instead of points.

If region x is North of region y, then the y-coordinate of every point in x is greater than the y-coordinate of every point in y. We can say that the minimum y-coordinate of x, min_y(x), is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of y, max_y(y).

Similarly, if region y is East of region z, then the x-coordinate of every point in y is greater than the x-coordinate of every point in z. We can say that the minimum x-coordinate of y, min_x(y), is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, max_x(z).

Now, the spatial relationship between x and z depends on the relative x-coordinates of x and z.

There are three possibilities:
1. If the minimum x-coordinate of x, min_x(x), is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, max_x(z), then x is East of z. Combined with the fact that x is North of z, this means x is Northeast of z.
2. If the maximum x-coordinate of x, max_x(x), is less than the minimum x-coordinate of z, min_x(z), then x is West of z. Combined with the fact that x is North of z, this means x is Northwest of z.
3. If neither of the above is true, then the x-coordinates of x and z overlap. In this case, x is just North of z.

Wait, I realize that the problem statement doesn't say anything about the relative positions of x and z in the x-direction. All we know is that y is East of z. This doesn't directly constrain the relative x-coordinates of x and z.

Let's consider more carefully.

We know that:
- x is North of y, so min_y(x) > max_y(y).
- y is East of z, so min_x(y) > max_x(z).

But we don't have direct constraints on the relative x-coordinates of x and z.

In fact, x could be anywhere in the x-direction relative to z. So the possible relations between x and z are:
- Northwest (if x is West of z and North of z)
- North (if x is directly North of z)
- Northeast (if x is East of z and North of z)

So, the answer is: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Wait, I need to be more careful. 

"North of" and "East of" are binary relations that constrain the positions of regions relative to each other. Let's think more precisely about what these constraints mean.

If region x is North of region y, it means that every point in x has a higher y-coordinate than every point in y. Mathematically, for every point (x_i, y_i) in x and every point (x_j, y_j) in y, we have y_i > y_j.

Similarly, if region y is East of region z, it means that every point in y has a higher x-coordinate than every point in z. Mathematically, for every point (x_k, y_k) in y and every point (x_l, y_l) in z, we have x_k > x_l.

Now, we want to determine the possible relationships between regions x and z.

From the given constraints, we can infer that every point in x has a higher y-coordinate than every point in y, and every point in y has a higher x-coordinate than every point in z.

This constrains the position of x relative to z in the y-direction (x is always North of z), but it doesn't constrain the position of x relative to z in the x-direction.

To see this, consider a simple scenario where the regions are rectangular and axis-aligned. Let's say:
- Region z is located at (0, 0) with width 1 and height 1.
- Region y is located at (2, 0) with width 1 and height 1.
- Region x is located at (2, 2) with width 1 and height 1.

In this scenario, x is North of y, and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is Northeast.

Now, let's consider another scenario:
- Region z is located at (0, 0) with width 1 and height 1.
- Region y is located at (2, 0) with width 1 and height 1.
- Region x is located at (0, 2) with width 1 and height 1.

In this scenario, x is North of y, and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is Northwest.

And yet another scenario:
- Region z is located at (0, 0) with width 1 and height 1.
- Region y is located at (2, 0) with width 1 and height 1.
- Region x is located at (1, 2) with width 1 and height 1.

In this scenario, x is North of y, and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is North.

These examples show that the relation between x and z can be Northwest, North, or Northeast, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

Wait, I think I've been making an assumption that the cardinal direction relations are exclusive, which isn't necessarily true in spatial reasoning. Let me reconsider.

In qualitative spatial reasoning, a cardinal direction relation can be one of 9 binary relations: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, and an additional relation called "Bounding Box" or "Same" or "Equals", which is when the two regions have the same boundaries.

Given the constraints that x is North of y and y is East of z, and considering that we're talking about regions, not points, the relation between x and z could be more complex.

Actually, for regions, the definition of cardinal direction relations is typically based on the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of the regions. 

Let's use the MBR-based definition and consider the constraints again:
- Region x is North of region y, so the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y.
- Region y is East of region z, so the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z.

Given these constraints, the MBR of x can be in several positions relative to the MBR of z:
1. Entirely to the right and above, making x Northeast of z.
2. Entirely above but with overlapping x-coordinates, making x North of z.
3. Entirely to the left and above, making x Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

But actually, there might be more possible relations considering that we're dealing with regions, not points. Let me think about this more carefully.

Actually, I think my reasoning is correct. Given the constraints:
- Region x is North of region y, so the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y.
- Region y is East of region z, so the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z.

The MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z. From these, we can infer that the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of z.

However, the relative positions of x and z in the East-West direction are not fully constrained. The MBR of x could be:
1. Entirely to the right of the MBR of z, making x Northeast of z.
2. Partially overlapping with the MBR of z in the East-West direction, making x North of z.
3. Entirely to the left of the MBR of z, making x Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

Let me double-check this with a few examples to ensure my reasoning is correct.

Example 1:
- z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y: (2, 0) to (3, 1)
- x: (2, 2) to (3, 3)
Here, x is North of y and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is Northeast.

Example 2:
- z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y: (2, 0) to (3, 1)
- x: (0, 2) to (1, 3)
Here, x is North of y and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is Northwest.

Example 3:
- z: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y: (2, 0) to (3, 1)
- x: (1, 2) to (2, 3)
Here, x is North of y and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is North.

These examples confirm that the relation between x and z can be Northwest, North, or Northeast, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

So, the answer is: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Hmm actually, let me revise that. I'm not sure that "North" is a correct relation here.

Let's be more precise about the definition of cardinal direction relations. Given two regions X and Y, we say that Y is North of X if the minimum y-coordinate of Y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of X. Similarly, Y is East of X if the minimum x-coordinate of Y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of X.

Now, let's analyze the given constraints:
1. Region x is North of region y, so min_y(x) > max_y(y).
2. Region y is East of region z, so min_x(y) > max_x(z).

From these constraints, we can infer that min_y(x) > max_y(y) and min_x(y) > max_x(z).

But we can't immediately infer the relative positions of x and z in the x-direction. There are three possibilities:
1. min_x(x) > max_x(z), in which case x is Northeast of z.
2. max_x(x) < min_x(z), in which case x is Northwest of z.
3. Neither of the above, in which case the x-coordinates of x and z overlap. In this case, x is North of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

My reasoning was correct earlier. The answer is: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Hmm but let me check one more time for the "North" relation. Let's consider the MBR-based definition of cardinal direction relations:

Two regions X and Y have a cardinal direction relation based on the relative position of their MBRs. 
- Y is North of X if the MBR of Y is entirely above the MBR of X.
- Y is East of X if the MBR of Y is entirely to the right of the MBR of X.
- Y is Northeast of X if the MBR of Y is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of X.
- Y is Northwest of X if the MBR of Y is entirely above and to the left of the MBR of X.

Given the constraints:
1. Region x is North of region y, so the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y.
2. Region y is East of region z, so the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z.

From these, we can infer that the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z.

For the North relation between x and z, the MBR of x should be entirely above the MBR of z, and the x-coordinates of their MBRs should overlap. But we don't know if the x-coordinates of the MBRs of x and z overlap; it's possible, but not guaranteed.

Hmm, let me think about the transitivity of the North and East relations.

Given that x is North of y and y is North of z, we can say that x is North of z due to the transitivity of the North relation. But in our case, we have x is North of y and y is East of z.

Let's consider the semantics of these relations more carefully. The North relation implies that every point in the first region has a higher y-coordinate than every point in the second region. The East relation implies that every point in the first region has a higher x-coordinate than every point in the second region.

Given that x is North of y, every point in x has a higher y-coordinate than every point in y. And given that y is East of z, every point in y has a higher x-coordinate than every point in z.

From these, we can infer that every point in x has a higher y-coordinate than every point in y, and every point in y has a higher x-coordinate than every point in z. Transitively, every point in x has a higher y-coordinate than every point in z.

So, we can say that x is North of z. But we don't have enough information to determine the relative positions of x and z in the x-direction. Depending on the specific positions, x could be Northwest, North, or Northeast of z.

I believe the answer remains: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Actually, to further clarify, let's test for all of the possible relations. 

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is East of z

The possible relations between x and z are:
1. North: Yes, this is possible. Consider regions where z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, 0), and x is at (0.5, 1). Here, x is North of y, y is East of z, and x is North of z.
2. Northeast: Yes, this is possible. Consider regions where z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, 0), and x is at (1, 1). Here, x is North of y, y is East of z, and x is Northeast of z.
3. Northwest: Yes, this is possible. Consider regions where z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, 0), and x is at (0, 1). Here, x is North of y, y is East of z, and x is Northwest of z.
4. East: No, this isn't possible. If x is North of y, then x is also North of z (since the y-coordinates of x are all greater than the y-coordinates of z). So, x can't be directly East of z.
5. Southeast: No, this isn't possible. If x is North of y, then x is also North of z. So, x can't be Southeast of z, which would require x to be South of z.
6. South: No, this isn't possible. If x is North of y, then x is also North of z. So, x can't be South of z.
7. Southwest: No, this isn't possible. If x is North of y, then x is also North of z. So, x can't be Southwest of z, which would require x to be South of z.
8. West: No, this isn't possible. If x is North of y, then x is also North of z. So, x can't be directly West of z.
9. Bounding Box (or Equals): No, this isn't possible. If x is North of y, then x is also North of z. So, x can't be equal to z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Actually, let me go through these more carefully. I was thinking about the regions in a somewhat overly simplistic way. Let me check the more common definitions.

1. North: This relation exists when the MBR of the first region is entirely above the MBR of the second region, and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates of their MBRs.
2. Northeast: This relation exists when the MBR of the first region is entirely above and to the right of the MBR of the second region.
3. Northwest: This relation exists when the MBR of the first region is entirely above and to the left of the MBR of the second region.
4. East: This relation exists when the MBR of the first region is entirely to the right of the MBR of the second region, and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of their MBRs.
5. Southeast: This relation exists when the MBR of the first region is entirely below and to the right of the MBR of the second region.
6. South: This relation exists when the MBR of the first region is entirely below the MBR of the second region, and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates of their MBRs.
7. Southwest: This relation exists when the MBR of the first region is entirely below and to the left of the MBR of the second region.
8. West: This relation exists when the MBR of the first region is entirely to the left of the MBR of the second region, and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of their MBRs.
9. Bounding Box (or Equals): This relation exists when the MBRs of the two regions are the same.

Given the constraints:
- Region x is North of region y, so the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y.
- Region y is East of region z, so the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z.

From these, we can infer that the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y, and the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z.

Now, let's analyze the possible relations between x and z.

1. North: This requires the MBR of x to be entirely above the MBR of z, and there should be an overlap in the x-coordinates of their MBRs. The first condition is satisfied because x is above y and y is (horizontally) to the right of z, so x is above z. The second condition may or may not be satisfied, depending on the specific positions of the regions. So, North is a possible relation.

2. Northeast: This requires the MBR of x to be entirely above and to the right of the MBR of z. The first condition is satisfied as mentioned. The second condition (x being to the right of z) may or may not be satisfied, depending on the specific positions of the regions. So, Northeast is a possible relation.

3. Northwest: This requires the MBR of x to be entirely above and to the left of the MBR of z. The first condition is satisfied as mentioned. The second condition (x being to the left of z) may or may not be satisfied, depending on the specific positions of the regions. So, Northwest is a possible relation.

4. East: This requires the MBR of x to be entirely to the right of the MBR of z, and there should be an overlap in the y-coordinates of their MBRs. The first condition may or may not be satisfied, depending on the specific positions of the regions. The second condition isn't satisfied because x is above y and y is (horizontally) to the right of z, so x is above z, which means there's no overlap in the y-coordinates of x and z. So, East is not a possible relation.

5. Southeast: This requires the MBR of x to be entirely below and to the right of the MBR of z. The first condition isn't satisfied because x is above y and y is (horizontally) to the right of z, so x is above z, not below. So, Southeast is not a possible relation.

6. South: This requires the MBR of x to be entirely below the MBR of z, and there should be an overlap in the x-coordinates of their MBRs. The first condition isn't satisfied because x is above y and y is (horizontally) to the right of z, so x is above z, not below. So, South is not a possible relation.

7. Southwest: This requires the MBR of x to be entirely below and to the left of the MBR of z. The first condition isn't satisfied because x is above y and y is (horizontally) to the right of z, so x is above z, not below. So, Southwest is not a possible relation.

8. West: This requires the MBR of x to be entirely to the left of the MBR of z, and there should be an overlap in the y-coordinates of their MBRs. The first condition may or may not be satisfied, depending on the specific positions of the regions. The second condition isn't satisfied because x is above y and y is (horizontally) to the right of z, so x is above z, which means there's no overlap in the y-coordinates of x and z. So, West is not a possible relation.

9. Bounding Box (or Equals): This requires the MBRs of x and z to be the same. This isn't satisfied because x is above y and y is (horizontally) to the right of z, so x and z are at different positions. So, Bounding Box is not a possible relation.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

I apologize for the confusion; my reasoning has been inconsistent. Let me check one more time, more carefully, to ensure my reasoning is correct.

Given the constraints:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is East of region z

Using the cardinal direction relations defined by Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs), where the MBR of a region is the smallest rectangle that contains the entire region, I'd like to determine the possible relationships between x and z.

Given that x is North of y, the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y.
Given that y is East of z, the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z.

From these, we can infer that the MBR of x is above and to the right of the MBR of z. However, the exact relationship between x and z can vary. Let's consider the possible cases:

1. If the MBR of x is entirely to the right of the MBR of z, and the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of z, then x is Northeast of z.

2. If the MBR of x overlaps with the MBR of z in the x-coordinate, and the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of z, then x is North of z.

3. If the MBR of x is entirely to the left of the MBR of z, and the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of z, then x is Northwest of z.

Wait, there's a mistake in my reasoning. I was saying that "given that x is North of y and y is East of z, x is above and to the right of z". This is not necessarily true. x is above y, and y is to the right of z, but the horizontal position of x relative to z is not uniquely determined.

Let me visualize it:

z   y
    x

Here, x is North of y, y is East of z, and x is Northeast of z.

z   y
x    

Here, x is North of y, y is East of z, and x is Northwest of z.

z   y
 x   

Here, x is North of y, y is East of z, and x is North of z.

These examples show that x can be Northwest, North, or Northeast of z, given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Actually, let me just be super precise and define a few examples to make sure we check all cardinal directions and ensure a consistent analysis.

I'll use the notation (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) to define the MBR of a region.

Example 1: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (2, 3, 2, 3)
Here, x is North of y and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is Northeast.

Example 2: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (0, 1, 2, 3)
Here, x is North of y and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is North. (Actually, I'm now realizing that "North" cardinal relation doesn't necessarily require the x-coordinates to overlap. Rather, it's defined as "the MBR of the first region is entirely above the MBR of the second region, and there should be an overlap in the x-coordinates of their MBRs." In this example, the MBRs have the same x-coordinates, so there is an overlap, and x is North of z.)

Example 3: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (-1, 0, 2, 3)
Here, x is North of y and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is Northwest.

Now, let's check for the other cardinal directions:

Example 4: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (2, 3, 0, 1)
Here, x is the same as y, which contradicts the constraint that x is North of y. So, this is not a valid example.

Example 5: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (2, 3, -1, 0)
Here, x is South of y, which contradicts the constraint that x is North of y. So, this is not a valid example.

Example 6: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (0, 1, -1, 0)
Here, x is South of y, which contradicts the constraint that x is North of y. So, this is not a valid example.

Example 7: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (-1, 0, -1, 0)
Here, x is Southwest of y, which contradicts the constraint that x is North of y. So, this is not a valid example.

Example 8: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (-1, 0, 0, 1)
Here, x is West of y, which contradicts the constraint that x is North of y. So, this is not a valid example.

Example 9: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (4, 5, 0, 1)
Here, x is East of y, which contradicts the constraint that x is North of y. So, this is not a valid example.

From these examples, I can see that only Northwest, North, and Northeast relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Actually, I think I've been overly complicating this. Let's go back to the basics.

Given the constraints:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is East of region z

The possible relations between x and z can be deduced as follows:

1. The "North" constraint implies that x is above y in the 2D space.
2. The "East" constraint implies that y is to the right of z in the 2D space.

From these, we can infer that x is above y, and y is to the right of z. But the horizontal position of x relative to z is not uniquely determined. It can be to the left of z (making x Northwest of z), aligned with z (making x North of z), or to the right of z (making x Northeast of z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

I've been cycling through the reasoning, and the conclusion remains consistent. I'm confident that the answer is: Northwest, North, Northeast.

But wait, let me revisit the definition of the "North" cardinal relation. In the context of Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs), the "North" relation between two regions X and Y is defined as follows:

X is North of Y if:
1. The minimum y-coordinate of X is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of Y, and
2. There's an overlap in the x-coordinates of the MBRs of X and Y.

Similarly, the "East" relation is defined as:

X is East of Y if:
1. The minimum x-coordinate of X is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of Y, and
2. There's an overlap in the y-coordinates of the MBRs of X and Y.

Given these definitions and the constraints that x is North of y and y is East of z, we need to check if it's possible for x to be North of z. For x to be North of z, there should be an overlap in the x-coordinates of the MBRs of x and z. But we don't know if this is always the case given the constraints.

Let's reconsider our examples:

Example 1: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (2, 3, 2, 3)
Here, x is North of y and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is Northeast because there's no overlap in the x-coordinates of the MBRs of x and z.

Example 2: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (0, 1, 2, 3)
Here, x is North of y and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is North because there's an overlap in the x-coordinates of the MBRs of x and z.

Example 3: 
z: (0, 1, 0, 1)
y: (2, 3, 0, 1)
x: (-1, 0, 2, 3)
Here, x is North of y and y is East of z. The relation between x and z is Northwest because there's no overlap in the x-coordinates of the MBRs of x and z.

These examples show that given the constraints, the relation between x and z can be Northwest, North, or Northeast, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

So, to summarize:

If region x is North of region y and region y is East of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Just to make sure, let me verify that I've considered all possibilities by drawing the scenario and analyzing the possible positions.

Let's denote the MBRs of regions x, y, and z as follows:
- x: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
- y: (ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax)
- z: (zmin, zmax, wmin, wmax)

Wait, this notation is confusing. Let me use a different one:
- x: (x_min, x_max, x_y_min, x_y_max)
- y: (y_min, y_max, y_y_min, y_y_max)
- z: (z_min, z_max, z_y_min, z_y_max)

Given that x is North of y, we have x_y_min > y_y_max. This means the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y.
Given that y is East of z, we have y_min > z_max. This means the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z.

Now, to determine the relation between x and z, we need to compare their coordinates:
- If x_min > z_max, then x is entirely to the right of z in the x-direction.
- If x_max < z_min, then x is entirely to the left of z in the x-direction.
- If neither of the above is true, then there's an overlap in the x-coordinates of x and z.

From the given constraints, we know that x_y_min > y_y_max and y_min > z_max. We want to infer something about the relative positions of x and z.

First, we can deduce that x_y_min > y_y_max > z_y_max (assuming y and z are on the same level in the y-direction, which is one possible scenario). This means x is North of z in the y-direction.

Now, for the x-direction, there are three possibilities:
1. x_min > z_max, which means x is entirely to the right of z. Combined with the fact that x is North of z in the y-direction, this would make x Northeast of z.
2. x_max < z_min, which means x is entirely to the left of z. Combined with the fact that x is North of z in the y-direction, this would make x Northwest of z.
3. There's an overlap in the x-coordinates of x and z. Combined with the fact that x is North of z in the y-direction, this would make x North of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

I've been cycling through the reasoning, and the conclusion remains consistent. I'm confident that the answer is: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Actually, I've been making an assumption that y and z are on the same level in the y-direction, which isn't necessarily the case. Let me revisit the problem without this assumption.

Given that y is East of z, we have y_min > z_max (the MBR of y is entirely to the right of the MBR of z) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinates of y and z, which means y_y_min <= z_y_max and y_y_max >= z_y_min.

Given that x is North of y, we have x_y_min > y_y_max (the MBR of x is entirely above the MBR of y) and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates of x and y, which means x_min <= y_max and x_max >= y_min.

From these constraints, we can deduce that x_y_min > y_y_max. But we don't have a direct constraint on the y-coordinate relation between x and z. 

Actually, there's a mistake in my reasoning. For cardinal directions, we have a more constrained definition than what I've been using. For X to be North of Y in the cardinal direction framework, X should be above Y and there should be a vertical projection that connects X and Y. Similarly, for X to be East of Y, X should be to the right of Y and there should be a horizontal projection that connects X and Y.

Given these definitions, if x is North of y and y is East of z, then x is above y and y is to the right of z. The relation between x and z in the cardinal direction framework depends on their relative positions.

If x is to the right of z, then x is Northeast of z.
If x overlaps with z in the x-direction, then x is North of z.
If x is to the left of z, then x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

I'm redefining again just to make sure. 

In the cardinal direction framework, the relations are defined as follows:
- X is North of Y if X is above Y and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates of X and Y.
- X is Northeast of Y if X is above and to the right of Y, with no overlap in the x-coordinates.
- X is Northwest of Y if X is above and to the left of Y, with no overlap in the x-coordinates.
- (Similarly for the other directions.)

Given these definitions, if x is North of y and y is East of z, then x is above y with an overlap in the x-coordinates, and y is to the right of z with an overlap in the y-coordinates.

For the relation between x and z:
- If x is to the right of z with no overlap in the x-coordinates, then x is Northeast of z.
- If x overlaps with z in the x-coordinates, then x is North of z.
- If x is to the left of z with no overlap in the x-coordinates, then x is Northwest of z.

Based on the given constraints, all three relations are possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Alright, I've been cycling through the reasoning, and the conclusion remains consistent. The answer is: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Actually, I noticed an error in my reasoning. Let me correct it.

In the cardinal direction framework, the relations are defined as follows:
- X is North of Y if X is above Y and there's an overlap in the x-coordinates of X and Y.
- X is Northeast of Y if X is above and to the right of Y, with no overlap in the x-coordinates.
- X is Northwest of Y if X is above and to the left of Y, with no overlap in the x-coordinates.
- (Similarly for the other directions.)

Wait, I've been making assumptions about the behavior of North and East relations, which might not be accurate. Let me revisit the problem statement more carefully.

The problem states:
"Let North and East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is North of region y and region y is East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"

It's possible that the problem is using the RCC-8 relations framework, which defines cardinal directions without requiring overlaps in the projections.

Let me re-examine the constraints using the standard cardinal direction definitions:
- x is North of y: x is above y in the 2D space.
- y is East of z: y is to the right of z in the 2D space.

Given these, the relation between x and z depends on their relative positions. If x is to the right of z, then x is Northeast of z. If x overlaps with z in the x-direction, then x is North of z. If x is to the left of z, then x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

I'm getting the same answer with different approaches, which suggests it's correct.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Alright let me be super clear again. But this time let me use a different approach: let's define regions in a coordinate system.

Let's place the regions in a 2D coordinate system with North pointing to the positive y-axis and East pointing to the positive x-axis.

Given that x is North of y, the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of y. 
Given that y is East of z, the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z.

Let's consider specific coordinates for the regions:
z at (0, 0)
y at (1, 0) (East of z)

Now, where can x be?
Given that x is North of y, x is at (1, 1) or (1, 2) or (1, 3), etc. (The y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of y, while the x-coordinate remains the same.)

In this scenario, x is Northeast of z.

But this is just one possible configuration. Let's try another:
z at (0, 0)
y at (1, 0) (East of z)
x at (0, 1) (North of y, but with a different x-coordinate)

In this scenario, x is North of z.

And yet another:
z at (0, 0)
y at (1, 0) (East of z)
x at (-1, 1) (North of y, but with a different x-coordinate)

In this scenario, x is Northwest of z.

These examples demonstrate that given the constraints, the relation between x and z can be Northwest, North, or Northeast, depending on the specific positions of the regions.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Alright, I've cycled through the reasoning multiple times and the conclusion is consistent. The answer is: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Actually, I think there's been a misunderstanding. Let me check:
x is North of y if: the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of y.
y is East of z if: the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z.

Actually, these are the constraints in the problem. But the confusion I've had is over the precise definition of "North" and "East" relations for regions. Is it that all points in one region are North of all points in the other region? Or is it that there's a particular point in one region that's North of a particular point in the other region? The standard interpretation in qualitative spatial reasoning is the former. But I've been conflating different interpretations.

I'll go with the first interpretation: the "North" and "East" relations for regions mean that all points in one region are "North" or "East" of all points in the other region.

Given that all points in x are North of all points in y, and all points in y are East of all points in z, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the given constraints, we can infer that all points in x are North of all points in y, and all points in y are East of all points in z. This means that every point in x has a higher y-coordinate than every point in y, and every point in y has a higher x-coordinate than every point in z.

For the relation between x and z, we know that every point in x has a higher y-coordinate than every point in z (since x is North of y, and y has the same or higher y-coordinate than z).

But the x-coordinate relation between x and z is not fully constrained. The points in x can have higher, lower, or the same x-coordinates as the points in z.

If all points in x have higher x-coordinates than all points in z, then x is Northeast of z.
If all points in x have lower x-coordinates than all points in z, then x is Northwest of z.
If some points in x have higher x-coordinates than some points in z, and some points in x have lower x-coordinates than some points in z, then x is North of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, North, Northeast.

Ok, I think I will stop here. I keep going through the reasoning over and over again, and I've now become confident in the answer:

Northwest, North, Northeast.

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is North of region y
- Region y is East of region z

To solve this systematically, I'll consider how these constraints limit the possible positions of region x relative to region z.

From the first constraint, we know that region x is above region y.
From the second constraint, we know that region y is to the right of region z.

This means region x must be above and possibly offset horizontally from region z. The possible cardinal direction relations are:

1. North - if region x is directly above region z
2. Northeast - if region x is above and to the right of region z
3. Northwest - if region x is above and to the left of region z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: North, Northeast, and Northwest.
