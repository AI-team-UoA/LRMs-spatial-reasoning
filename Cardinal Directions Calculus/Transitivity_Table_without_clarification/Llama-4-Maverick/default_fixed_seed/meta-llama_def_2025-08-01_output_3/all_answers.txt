For r1:  East, r2:  East, answer: ## Step 1: Understand the given cardinal direction relations
The problem states that region x is East of region y and region y is East of region z. This implies a sequence where x is further East than y, and y is further East than z.

## Step 2: Analyze the given relations
Given that both relations are "East", it means x is East of y and y is East of z. So, we need to determine the relation between x and z based on these conditions.

## Step 3: Determine the relation between x and z
If x is East of y and y is East of z, then logically, x is East of z because the "East" relation is transitive. This means x is further East than z.

## Step 4: Consider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z
Since x is East of z, the possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is "East". However, we should also consider if there are other possible relations based on the given conditions and the definition of cardinal direction relations.

## Step 5: Evaluate if other relations are possible
Cardinal direction relations include North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, and Bounding Box. The "East" relation is specific and implies that x is to the East of z, not necessarily directly East in a straight line, but generally in that direction.

## Step 6: Consider the transitive property of East relation
The East relation is transitive, meaning if x is East of y and y is East of z, then x is East of z. However, the exact cardinal direction can vary (e.g., Northeast, Southeast) depending on the relative positions of x, y, and z.

## Step 7: Assess possible directions considering the transitive property and given conditions
Since both given relations are "East", it suggests that x, y, and z are aligned in such a way that x is East of z. However, the regions could be positioned such that x is Northeast or Southeast of z if they are not directly aligned East-West.

## Step 8: Determine the range of possible relations
Considering x is East of y and y is East of z, x must be East of z. The relation between x and z can be East, but it could also be Northeast or Southeast depending on their relative North-South positioning.

## Step 9: Conclude on possible cardinal direction relations between x and z
The possible relations are East, Northeast, and Southeast because x being East of y and y being East of z allows for x to be in these relative positions to z.

The final answer is: $\boxed{East}$

For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: ## Step 1: Understand the given cardinal direction relations
The problem involves understanding the cardinal direction relations between regions x, y, and z, given that x is related to y and y is related to z in specific ways.

## Step 2: Analyze the given relations
Region x is $Bounding Box$ of region y, and region y is $Bounding Box$ of region z. $Bounding Box$ implies that the relation encompasses all possible cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) because a bounding box around a region includes all directions relative to that region.

## Step 3: Interpret the $Bounding Box$ relation
The $Bounding Box$ relation between two regions implies that one region is completely contained within the other or they overlap in such a way that the bounding box of one contains the other. However, the exact interpretation of $Bounding Box$ as a cardinal direction relation is not standard. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider it as indicating that x completely contains or is related to y in a broad spatial manner, and similarly, y is related to z.

## Step 4: Consider the implications of transitivity
If x is $Bounding Box$ of y, and y is $Bounding Box$ of z, we need to understand what this means for the relation between x and z. The $Bounding Box$ relation is not a standard cardinal direction relation but implies containment or a broad spatial relationship.

## Step 5: Apply the given relations to determine the possible relation between x and z
Given that x contains or is related to y, and y contains or is related to z, it implies x contains or is related to z in a similar or broader manner.

## Step 6: Identify possible cardinal direction relations between x and z
Since both relations imply a form of containment or broad spatial relation, x could be considered as having a $Bounding Box$ relation with z, as it encompasses all directions. The exact cardinal direction (North, South, etc.) depends on the specific geometry and position of x, y, and z.

## Step 7: List possible cardinal direction relations
Considering the transitivity and the nature of $Bounding Box$, the relation between x and z could be $Bounding Box$ because x contains or encompasses z through its relation with y.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Bounding Box}$
