For r1:  West, r2: North, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are: Southwest, West, Northwest.
For r1:  West, r2:  Northeast, answer: West and Northeast. 

Region x is West of y: x is to the left of y.
Region y is Northeast of z: y is above and to the right of z.

Combining these, x is to the left of and above or level with z (since y is above z and x is to the left of y), or x is to the left and below z (if x is below y but still to the left of it, and y is above z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Northwest, West, Southwest.

The answer is Northwest, West, Southwest.

For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: ## Step 1: Understand the given cardinal direction relations
The problem involves understanding the cardinal direction relations between regions x, y, and z. We're given that region x is related to region y by a certain cardinal direction relation ( Bounding Box ) and region y is related to region z by another cardinal direction relation ( Bounding Box ).

## Step 2: Interpret the given cardinal direction relations
Since the specific cardinal direction relations ( Bounding Box ) are not defined in the problem statement, we'll have to assume a general understanding of cardinal direction relations. Typically, these relations include North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, and Bounding Box. The "Bounding Box" relation often refers to a region being completely contained within another.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible relations based on transitivity
To determine the relation between x and z, we need to analyze the transitivity of the given relations. If x is  Bounding Box of y and y is  Bounding Box of z, we need to understand what " Bounding Box " implies. Assuming " Bounding Box " means one region is contained or related in a specific cardinal direction to another, we must consider how these relations compose.

## Step 4: Consider the composition of cardinal direction relations
For cardinal direction relations, if x is North of y and y is North of z, then x is North of z. This is a simple transitive relation. However, the composition can be more complex with other relations like Northeast or Southeast. The relation " Bounding Box " suggests containment, which is transitive: if x contains y and y contains z, then x contains z.

## Step 5: Evaluate the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z
Given that both relations are " Bounding Box ", it implies x contains y and y contains z. Thus, x contains z. The relation between x and z, in terms of cardinal directions, when considering containment (or "Bounding Box"), is that x is a "Bounding Box" of z because containment is transitive.

## Step 6: Determine the answer based on the given options
The possible answers include various cardinal directions and "Bounding Box". Since x contains y and y contains z, x contains z. Thus, the relation between x and z is "Bounding Box".

The final answer is: $\boxed{Bounding Box}$
