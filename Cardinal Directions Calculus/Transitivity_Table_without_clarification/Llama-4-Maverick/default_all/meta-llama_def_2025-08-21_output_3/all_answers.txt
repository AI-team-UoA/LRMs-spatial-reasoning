For r1:  Northeast, r2:  East, answer: To solve this, let's break down the given information step by step.

1. Region x is Northeast of region y.
2. Region y is East of region z.

Let's analyze the positions relative to each other.

- Since y is East of z, z must be to the West of y. This implies that z is either directly West or possibly Southwest or Northwest of y because "East" is a cardinal direction that doesn't specify latitude.

- Given that x is Northeast of y, x must be either directly North, directly East, or at some angle Northeast of y.

To understand the relation between x and z, let's consider the possible locations of y relative to z and then x relative to y.

1. If y is directly East of z, then z is directly West of y. Since x is Northeast of y, x could be North, Northeast, or East of y, and thus could be Northwest, North, Northeast, or East of z (because Northeast of something that is East of you puts you generally North and somewhat East, but the exact relation depends on the relative latitudes and longitudes).

2. If y is Southeast of z (y is East and somewhat South of z), then x being Northeast of y doesn't directly tell us the relation without considering the geometry. However, we know x is North and somewhat East of y, and y is East and somewhat South of z. So, x could be directly North, or somewhat Northeast or Northwest of z if x is sufficiently North.

3. If y is Northeast of z (less likely since "East" is specified), the relation still holds that x is further Northeast.

Let's directly infer from the given relations:
- x is Northeast of y => x is North and East of y (to some degree).
- y is East of z => z is West of y.

So, x is Northeast of something (y) that is East of z. This implies x is generally North and East of z, but the exact cardinal direction relation depends on how much North and East x is relative to y, and how much East y is relative to z.

However, a simpler way to think about it is to consider the possible configurations and directly apply the given constraints.

The composition of "Northeast" and "East" isn't directly one of the basic cardinal directions, but we can analyze it:
- Northeast ∘ East = (North ∧ East) ∘ East = North ∘ East ∧ East ∘ East. 
Since "East ∘ East" = East, and considering the latitude, "North ∘ East" can result in North or Northeast.

Hence, the relation between x and z can be Northeast or North or East, depending on the exact geometry. 

Among the given options:
- North
- Northeast
- East

are possible. 

Thus, the possible relations are Northeast, North, and East.

For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: ## Step 1: Understand the given cardinal direction relations
The given cardinal direction relations are represented as matrices or strings that describe the directional relationship between two regions. For instance, " Bounding Box" isn't directly explained, but assuming it represents a specific cardinal direction relation (e.g., North, South, etc.), we need to infer the possible relations based on the given conditions.

## Step 2: Interpret the given condition for region x and region y
Region x is  Bounding Box of region y. Without the specific meaning of " Bounding Box", let's consider it as a placeholder for a cardinal direction relation. For example, if " Bounding Box" means "North", then x is north of y.

## Step 3: Interpret the given condition for region y and region z
Region y is  Bounding Box of region z. Similar to Step 2, this implies a certain cardinal direction relation between y and z.

## Step 4: Analyze possible cardinal direction relations
Let's directly analyze with an example: If " Bounding Box" means a specific direction like "North", then x is North of y, and y is North of z. This implies x is North of z.

## Step 5: Consider various " Bounding Box" scenarios
1. If " Bounding Box" = North, then x is North of y, and y is North of z, so x is North of z.
2. If " Bounding Box" = South, then x is South of y, and y is South of z, so x is South of z.

## Step 6: Generalize for any " Bounding Box"
For any cardinal direction relation " Bounding Box", if x is  Bounding Box of y and y is  Bounding Box of z, then the relation between x and z depends on the transitivity of " Bounding Box". For cardinal directions like North, South, East, West, and their combinations (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest), the relation between x and z can be derived by applying the relation twice.

## Step 7: Apply the relation to possible cardinal directions
- If " Bounding Box" = North, x is North of z.
- If " Bounding Box" = South, x is South of z.
- For other directions, the relation might not be as straightforward due to the nature of cardinal directions (e.g., Northeast is not transitive in the same way North is because being Northeast of something doesn't directly imply a simple cardinal direction relation to another object).

## Step 8: Consider the transitive property for cardinal directions
For simple cardinal directions (North, South, East, West), the transitive property holds. For example, if x is North of y and y is North of z, then x is North of z. However, for diagonal or composite directions, the outcome depends on the specific directions.

## Step 9: Enumerate possible outcomes for region x and region z
Given the lack of specificity about " Bounding Box", let's directly infer based on common cardinal direction relations:
1. North: x North of z.
2. South: x South of z.
3. East: x East of z.
4. West: x West of z.
For diagonal directions, the result can vary. For instance, if " Bounding Box" = Northeast, then x is Northeast of y, and y is Northeast of z, implying x is generally Northeast or North or East of z, depending on their positions.

## Step 10: Conclude based on the most likely interpretation
Without the exact meaning of " Bounding Box", one must consider various cardinal direction relations. For a relation like North or South, the result is straightforward. For others, like Northeast, the exact relation between x and z can be Northeast or potentially North or East if the regions are aligned closely.

The final answer is: $\boxed{North}$
