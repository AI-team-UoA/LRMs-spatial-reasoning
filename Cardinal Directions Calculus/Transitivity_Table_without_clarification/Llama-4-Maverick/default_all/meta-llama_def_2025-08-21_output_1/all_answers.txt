For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: To determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, let's first understand the given relations and then apply them step by step.

1. Region x is Northeast of region y.
2. Region y is Northwest of region z.

Let's analyze the given information:

- If x is Northeast of y, it means x is to the North and East of y.
- If y is Northwest of z, it means y is to the North and West of z.

To understand the relation between x and z, let's consider the positions relative to y:

1. Since x is Northeast of y, and y is Northwest of z, we need to figure out where x is relative to z.

Let's break down the directions:
- x being Northeast of y means x is generally more to the East and possibly slightly to the North or at the same latitude as y, or more to the North.
- y being Northwest of z means z is generally more to the South and East of y.

Combining these:
- x is to the East of y, and y is to the West of z, so x is to the East of z (since if x is East of y and y is West of z, then x must be East or more to the East than z).
- The North-South relation is less straightforward because x is North of y, and y is North of z, so x is North of z (since x is more to the North than y, and y is more to the North than z).

Thus, considering both the North-South and East-West relations, x is generally North and East of z. 

Therefore, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is Northeast.

The answer is Northeast.

For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: ## Step 1: Understand the given cardinal direction relations
The problem provides us with two cardinal direction relations: region x is related to region y, and region y is related to region z. We need to understand how these relations affect the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

## Step 2: Identify the cardinal direction relations
The given relations are represented as " Bounding Box" which typically denotes a specific cardinal direction or a set of directions between two regions. However, the specific cardinal direction relation is not directly stated, so we'll consider the general interpretation of cardinal directions and their compositions.

## Step 3: Analyze the composition of cardinal direction relations
To determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to consider the composition of the given relations. The composition of two cardinal direction relations is another cardinal direction relation that results from combining the two.

## Step 4: Consider possible cardinal direction relations
Let's denote the cardinal direction relation between x and y as R1, and between y and z as R2. We are looking for R1 ∘ R2, where ∘ denotes the composition of relations.

## Step 5: Evaluate the composition for the given problem
Since the specific cardinal direction relations are not given, we'll consider a general approach. If x is in a certain cardinal direction of y, and y is in a certain cardinal direction of z, then x is in a specific cardinal direction of z based on the composition of these directions.

## Step 6: Recall the concept of cardinal direction relations and their composition
Cardinal direction relations between regions can be composed. For example, if x is North of y and y is North of z, then x is North of z. The composition of cardinal directions can be complex due to the variety of possible directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest).

## Step 7: Apply the concept to the given scenario
Without specific details on the "Bounding Box" relation, we consider that it could represent any of the cardinal directions. However, "Bounding Box" typically refers to a rectangle that completely contains another shape. This interpretation doesn't directly apply to cardinal directions but suggests a containment or overlap relation.

## Step 8: Reinterpret "Bounding Box" as a containment relation
If "Bounding Box" implies that one region is contained within another or is related in a specific spatial manner, we need to understand it as a specific type of spatial relation.

## Step 9: Consider the containment or spatial relation interpretation
If x is the "Bounding Box" of y, and y is the "Bounding Box" of z, this implies x contains y, and y contains z. Thus, x contains z.

## Step 10: Determine the cardinal direction relation based on containment
If x contains z, then z is inside x. The cardinal direction relation that corresponds to being inside is not directly one of the cardinal directions (North, South, etc.) but can be related to the concept of being "Bounding Box" or contained.

## Step 11: Relate containment to cardinal directions
Being contained within another region doesn't directly translate to a cardinal direction like North or South but indicates a specific spatial relationship.

## Step 12: Conclude on the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z
Given that x contains y and y contains z, it implies x contains z. The cardinal direction relation that represents containment or being inside is not directly listed among the cardinal directions.

## Step 13: Identify the correct interpretation for "Bounding Box"
If we interpret "Bounding Box" as indicating one region is contained within another, the relation between x and z would be that x is a "Bounding Box" of z, implying containment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Bounding Box}$
