For r1: North, r2:  Northwest, answer: Let x be North of y, and y be Northwest of z.
Let's consider the positions using coordinates, with z at the origin (0,0).

Since y is Northwest of z, the longitude of y ($y_{lon}$) is negative, and the latitude of y ($y_{lat}$) is positive. $y_{lon} < 0$, $y_{lat} > 0$.

Since x is North of y, the latitude of x ($x_{lat}$) is greater than the latitude of y ($y_{lat}$), and the longitude of x ($x_{lon}$) is relatively close to the longitude of y ($y_{lon}$).
$x_{lat} > y_{lat}$. Since $y_{lat} > 0$, $x_{lat}$ must be positive. This means x is always North of z's equator.

The longitude of x is $x_{lon}$. The relation between $x_{lon}$ and $y_{lon}$ can vary depending on the specific interpretation of "North". If "North" means strictly on the North axis, then $x_{lon} = y_{lon}$. If "North" means within a Northern sector (e.g., between Northwest and Northeast relative to y), then $x_{lon}$ can be slightly less than, equal to, or slightly greater than $y_{lon}$.

Let's examine the possible values for $x_{lon}$ relative to $z_{lon}$ (which is 0):
$x_{lon} = y_{lon} + \delta_{lon}$, where $\delta_{lon}$ represents the longitudinal displacement of x from y. For "North" relation, $\delta_{lon}$ is typically small compared to the latitudinal displacement, but its sign and magnitude relative to $y_{lon}$ are crucial.

1.  If $\delta_{lon}$ is zero (x is purely North of y):
    $x_{lon} = y_{lon}$. Since $y_{lon} < 0$, $x_{lon}$ is negative.
    $x_{lat} > y_{lat} > 0$, so $x_{lat}$ is positive.
    $x_{lon} < 0$ and $x_{lat} > 0$ corresponds to the Northwest quadrant relative to z. Thus, Northwest is a possible relation.

2.  If $\delta_{lon}$ is negative (x is slightly West of North from y):
    $x_{lon} = y_{lon} + \delta_{lon}$. Since $y_{lon} < 0$ and $\delta_{lon} < 0$, $x_{lon}$ is negative.
    $x_{lat} > y_{lat} > 0$, so $x_{lat}$ is positive.
    $x_{lon} < 0$ and $x_{lat} > 0$ corresponds to the Northwest quadrant relative to z. Thus, Northwest is a possible relation.

3.  If $\delta_{lon}$ is positive (x is slightly East of North from y):
    $x_{lon} = y_{lon} + \delta_{lon}$. Since $y_{lon} < 0$ and $\delta_{lon} > 0$, $x_{lon}$ can be negative (if $|y_{lon}| > \delta_{lon}$), zero (if $|y_{lon}| = \delta_{lon}$), or positive (if $|y_{lon}| < \delta_{lon}$).
    $x_{lat} > y_{lat} > 0$, so $x_{lat}$ is positive.
    *   If $x_{lon} < 0$: Northwest is possible.
    *   If $x_{lon} = 0$: x is on the North axis of z, pointing towards North as a possible relation (depending on how the North sector is defined to include the axis).
    *   If $x_{lon} > 0$: $x_{lon} > 0$ and $x_{lat} > 0$ corresponds to the Northeast quadrant relative to z. Thus, Northeast is a possible relation.

Based on the point/sector model, the possible relations are Northwest, North, and Northeast.

If we consider Bounding Box relations between regions:
Let z be a region. y is Northwest of z implies $\max(y_{lon}) < \min(z_{lon})$ and $\min(y_{lat}) > \max(z_{lat})$.
Let x be a region. x is North of y implies $\min(x_{lat}) > \max(y_{lat})$.

Combining these:
$\min(x_{lat}) > \max(y_{lat}) > \max(z_{lat})$. The latitude range of x is entirely North of the latitude range of z. This supports North, Northwest, Northeast relations latitudinally.

$\max(y_{lon}) < \min(z_{lon})$. The longitude range of y is entirely West of the longitude range of z.
The longitude range of x relative to y can vary. If x is purely North of y (bounding box aligned vertically), $\max(x_{lon}) - \min(x_{lon}) = \max(y_{lon}) - \min(y_{lon})$. The position of x's longitude range relative to y's determines its position relative to z.
If x's longitude range is shifted relative to y's (e.g., x is East of the vertical line through y's center, but still "North" of y in terms of overall relation).

Let's use examples with bounding boxes:
z = [0,1]x[0,1]. $\min=0, \max=1$ for both lon, lat.
y is NW of z: e.g., y = [-2,-1]x[3,4]. $\max(y_{lon})=-1 < 0$, $\min(y_{lat})=3 > 1$.
x is North of y: $\min(x_{lat}) > \max(y_{lat})=4$.

Case A: x is Northwest of z. Requires $\max(x_{lon}) < \min(z_{lon})=0$.
Let x = [-3,-2.5]x[5,6]. $\min(x_{lat})=5>4$. $\max(x_{lon})=-2.5 < 0$. This satisfies NW relation for x and z.

Case B: x is North of z. Requires $\max(z_{lon}) \approx \min(x_{lon})$ and $\min(z_{lon}) \approx \max(x_{lon})$ (aligned longitude ranges).
Let x = [0.1, 0.9]x[5,6]. $\min(x_{lat})=5>4$. $\min(x_{lon})=0.1 > \min(z_{lon})=0$. $\max(x_{lon})=0.9 < \max(z_{lon})=1$. x's longitude range is within z's. This could be considered a North relation (purely North latitudinally, aligned longitudally).

Case C: x is Northeast of z. Requires $\min(x_{lon}) > \max(z_{lon})=1$.
Let x = [2,3]x[5,6]. $\min(x_{lat})=5>4$. $\min(x_{lon})=2 > 1$. This satisfies NE relation for x and z.

Case D: Bounding Box relation. This can occur when longitude ranges overlap, but neither is entirely to the East or West of the other.
Let y = [-2,-1]x[3,4].
Let x = [-0.5, 0.5]x[5,6]. $\min(x_{lat})=5>4$. $\min(x_{lon})=-0.5$, $\max(x_{lon})=0.5$.
Compare x=[-0.5, 0.5]x[5,6] to z=[0,1]x[0,1].
$\min(x_{lat}) > \max(z_{lat})$ (North latitudinally).
$\min(x_{lon}) < \max(z_{lon})$ (-0.5 < 1) and $\max(x_{lon}) > \min(z_{lon})$ (0.5 > 0). Longitude ranges overlap.
This overlap prevents it from being purely East or West or contained. This configuration is typically described as a Bounding Box relation.

Since all four relations (Northwest, North, Northeast, Bounding Box) can arise from composing North and Northwest relations depending on the specific relative positions and extents of the regions, all four are possible answers.

The final answer is $\boxed{Northwest, North, Northeast, Bounding Box}$.

For r1: North, r2:  Southwest, answer: Northeast, East, Southeast
For r1: North, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: North, Northeast, Northwest
For r1:  Northeast, r2: North, answer: The possible relations are North and Northeast.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: North, Northeast, East
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Northeast, Southeast, East
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  South, answer: Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, North, Bounding Box
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  East, answer: Let z be the origin (0,0).
Since region y is East of region z (y E z), y is located in the East sector relative to z. Using the 22.5° cone model, y is in the angular region (-22.5°, 22.5°) relative to the positive x-axis from z. Let y be at coordinates (y_x, y_y) where y_x > 0 and the angle atan2(y_y, y_x) is in (-22.5°, 22.5°).

Since region x is Northeast of region y (x NE y), x is located in the Northeast sector relative to y. Using the 22.5° cone model, x is in the angular region (22.5°, 67.5°) relative to the positive x-axis from y. Let x be at coordinates (x_x, x_y) relative to y. Then the angle atan2(x_y, x_x) is in (22.5°, 67.5°), and the distance from y to x is positive.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. This depends on the coordinates of x relative to z.
Let z be at (0,0). y is at (y_x, y_y) where y_x > 0 and -22.5° < atan2(y_y, y_x) < 22.5°.
x is at (x'_x, x'_y) relative to y, where x'_x > 0, x'_y > 0 and 22.5° < atan2(x'_y, x'_x) < 67.5°.
The coordinates of x relative to z are (y_x + x'_x, y_y + x'_y).

The x-coordinate of x relative to z is x_z = y_x + x'_x. Since y_x > 0 and x'_x > 0, x_z is always positive. This means x is always to the East of z. This rules out West, Northwest, and Southwest.

The y-coordinate of x relative to z is y_z = y_y + x'_y.
y_y can be negative, zero, or positive (within the -22.5° to 22.5° angle for y relative to z).
x'_y is always positive (since x is Northeast of y, its relative y-coordinate is positive).

Let's consider extreme cases for the angle of x relative to z:
- If y is slightly South of East from z (angle approaches -22.5°) and x is slightly North of East from y (angle approaches 22.5° relative to y), and the distance from y to x is small compared to the distance from z to y, then x will be close to y. The angle of x relative to z will be close to the angle of y relative to z, which is close to -22.5°. An angle near -22.5° corresponds to the boundary between East and Southeast. Thus, Southeast is a possible relation.
- If y is slightly North of East from z (angle approaches 22.5°) and x is slightly South of North from y (angle approaches 67.5° relative to y), and the distance from z to y is small compared to the distance from y to x, then the angle of x relative to z will be dominated by the angle of x relative to y, which is close to 67.5°. An angle near 67.5° corresponds to the boundary between Northeast and North. Thus, Northeast is a possible relation.
- If y is due East from z (angle is 0°) and x is due Northeast from y (angle is 45° relative to y), then x will be strictly in the Northeast quadrant relative to z. Thus, Northeast is a possible relation.
- If y is due East from z (angle is 0°) and x is slightly North of East from y (angle is near 22.5° relative to y), x will be slightly North of East from z. East is a possible relation.
- If y is slightly South of East from z (angle is near -22.5°) and x is slightly North of East from y (angle is near 22.5° relative to y) and distances are balanced, the angle could be near 0°, corresponding to East. East is a possible relation.

Using standard composition tables for cardinal directions (based on 22.5° cones or similar models), the composition of E (East) and NE (Northeast) results in the set of possible relations {Northeast, East, Southeast}.

Given the options provided, and the instruction "one or more of these":
Northeast is a possible relation.
East is a possible relation.
Southeast is a possible relation.

The term "Bounding Box" is sometimes used as a single descriptor when the set of possible relations resulting from a composition is a disjunction of multiple specific cardinal directions. If the intention is to select a single most appropriate term from the list when multiple specific directions are possible, "Bounding Box" could be that term. However, the instruction "one or more of these" suggests listing all applicable specific relations.

Assuming "Bounding Box" is a relation type indicating a complex or multi-directional result, and given the options, the most standard interpretation is that the set of possible relations is {Northeast, East, Southeast}. If only one option must be chosen to represent this set, "Bounding Box" is a plausible interpretation, meaning the relationship is not confined to a single cardinal direction sector. If multiple options can be chosen, then Northeast, East, and Southeast are the possible relations.

Based on common interpretations of such questions and the likely structure (either list specific relations or indicate complexity with Bounding Box), and given the explicit presence of Bounding Box as an option alongside specific directions, it suggests Bounding Box is the intended answer when the result is a combination of several specific directions.

The composition E ; NE results in a set of possible relations {Northeast, East, Southeast}. Since this set contains more than one specific cardinal direction, the relation between x and z is not limited to a single cardinal direction. Therefore, the Bounding Box relation is the most appropriate descriptor from the given options, signifying that x's position relative to z can fall into multiple cardinal sectors depending on the specific geometry.

The final answer is $\boxed{Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: North, Northwest, Northeast
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  West, answer: Based on a point-based or centroid-based interpretation of the cardinal direction relations:
Let y be at coordinates (0,0).
Region x is Northeast of region y: x is at (x_coord, y_coord) where x_coord > 0 and y_coord > 0.
Region y is West of region z: z is at (z_coord, z_y_coord) where z_coord > 0 and z_y_coord can be any real number.

The relation between region x and region z is determined by the position of x relative to z, which is given by the vector (x_coord - z_coord, y_coord - z_y_coord).

- The x-component (x_coord - z_coord): Since x_coord > 0 and z_coord > 0, this difference can be positive (e.g., x_coord=2, z_coord=1), negative (e.g., x_coord=1, z_coord=2), or zero (e.g., x_coord=1, z_coord=1).
- The y-component (y_coord - z_y_coord): Since y_coord > 0 and z_y_coord can be any real number, this difference can be positive (e.g., y_coord=1, z_y_coord=0), negative (e.g., y_coord=1, z_y_coord=2), or zero (e.g., y_coord=1, z_y_coord=1).

Since the x and y components of the relative vector from z to x can independently be positive, negative, or zero (as long as they don't both result in x coinciding with z, which is also possible if x_coord=z_coord and y_coord=z_y_coord), x can be in any of the 8 cardinal directions relative to z:

1.  (+, +) -> Northeast (e.g., x=(2,2), z=(1,1))
2.  (-, +) -> Northwest (e.g., x=(1,2), z=(2,1))
3.  (0, +) -> North (e.g., x=(1,2), z=(1,1))
4.  (+, -) -> Southeast (e.g., x=(2,1), z=(1,2))
5.  (-, -) -> Southwest (e.g., x=(1,1), z=(2,2))
6.  (0, -) -> South (e.g., x=(1,1), z=(1,2))
7.  (+, 0) -> East (e.g., x=(2,1), z=(1,1))
8.  (-, 0) -> West (e.g., x=(1,1), z=(2,1))

Thus, based on a point-based interpretation, all 8 standard cardinal directions are possible relations.

If we interpret "region" as having extent, and "Northeast of" and "West of" using a definition like strict separation of bounding boxes, overlap between x and z is also possible. If the "Bounding Box" option is intended to cover cases of overlap or complex non-separated relations, then it is also a possible outcome. Given the presence of this option alongside the 8 specific directions, it is likely intended to cover all relations not specifically listed as one of the pure 8 directions.

Therefore, considering the possibility of all 8 directional relations and the potential for other relations (like overlap) represented by "Bounding Box", all listed options are possible relations between region x and region z.

The possible relations are: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by combining the given relations:
1. x is Northeast of y
2. y is Bounding Box of z

Let's assume the standard definitions:
- "Northeast" between regions means that the centroid of x is in the northeast direction from the centroid of y. This allows for regions to overlap.
- "Bounding Box" relation between regions y and z means that the bounding box of y is identical to the bounding box of z (BB(y) = BB(z)).

From relation 2, we know that BB(y) = BB(z). Let's call this common bounding box BB. Both the centroid of y (Cy) and the centroid of z (Cz) lie within BB.

From relation 1, the centroid of x (Cx) is in the northeast direction from Cy. This means Cx is generally located above and to the right of Cy.

We want to find the possible relative positions of Cx with respect to Cz. The position of Cx relative to Cy is constrained (NE direction), but the positions of Cy and Cz within the bounding box BB are not fixed relative to each other, only that they are somewhere inside BB.

Let Cy and Cz be points within BB. Cx is NE of Cy.
Let Centroid(x) - Centroid(y) be vector (dx1, dy1) with dx1 > 0, dy1 > 0.
Let Centroid(y) - Centroid(z) be vector (dx2, dy2). dx2 and dy2 can be positive, negative, or zero, as Cy and Cz can be anywhere within BB relative to each other.
The relative position of Cx to Cz is given by (Centroid(x) - Centroid(z)) = (dx1 + dx2, dy1 + dy2).

By choosing appropriate positions for Cy and Cz within BB, and a specific relative position of Cx just NE of Cy, we can make (dx1 + dx2, dy1 + dy2) fall into any of the 8 cardinal direction quadrants or axes, or be (0,0) if Equal were an option (which it is not). For example:
- To get East (dx1+dx2 > 0, dy1+dy2 = 0): Choose Cy and Cz such that dy2 = -dy1 (possible if dy1 is within the y-range of BB) and dx2 is not too negative.
- To get Southwest (dx1+dx2 < 0, dy1+dy2 < 0): Choose Cy such that it is much further NE in BB than Cz, and Cx is only slightly NE of Cy.

It can be shown that all 8 cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) are possible relations for x relative to z based on the relative positions of their centroids.

Now, consider the "Bounding Box" relation between x and z. This relation is true if BB(x) = BB(z).
Since BB(z) = BB(y), this implies BB(x) = BB(y).
Can we have BB(x) = BB(y) and "x is Northeast of y"? Yes, if "Northeast" is defined by centroids.
Consider a common bounding box BB = [0,1]x[0,1].
Let y be a region such that BB(y) = BB and its centroid Cy is near the SW corner, e.g., (0.1, 0.1).
Let x be a region such that BB(x) = BB and its centroid Cx is near the NE corner, e.g., (0.9, 0.9).
In this case, BB(x) = BB(y), and Cx is clearly Northeast of Cy.
It is possible to construct regions x and y that fill the bounding box extent while having their centroids in specific locations within the box (e.g., by making the region the union of a point at the desired centroid location and the four corner points of the bounding box, assuming centroid is average of points).

If BB(x) = BB(y) and BB(y) = BB(z), then BB(x) = BB(z).
If we can have BB(x) = BB(y) while x is Northeast of y (centroid definition), then BB(x) = BB(z) is a possible outcome. As shown above, this is possible.

Therefore, under standard interpretations where cardinal directions relate centroids and Bounding Box relates bounding box extents, all listed relations are possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z could be any of the following: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  Southeast, r2: North, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: Northeast, Southeast, East
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Southeast, South, East, Bounding Box
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  South, answer: Let z be the origin (0,0).
Since region y is South of region z, the y-coordinate of y must be less than the y-coordinate of z. Let y be located at (y_x, y_y) where y_y < 0. The x-coordinate y_x can be any real number, depending on whether "South" allows for westward or eastward displacement.

Since region x is Southeast of region y, x must be located to the East and South of y. Let x be located at (x_x, x_y). Relative to y, x's coordinates satisfy x_x > y_x and x_y < y_y.

Now let's determine the possible location of x relative to z (at (0,0)).
The y-coordinate of x is x_y. We know x_y < y_y and y_y < 0. Therefore, x_y < 0. This means x is always located South of the horizontal line passing through z. This immediately rules out the relations North, Northeast, and Northwest.

The x-coordinate of x is x_x. We know x_x > y_x. The x-coordinate y_x can be positive, negative, or zero.
- If y is strictly South of z (y_x = 0, y_y < 0): Then x_x > 0. Combined with x_y < 0, this places x in the Southeast quadrant relative to z. Depending on the ratio of the differences (x_x - z_x) and (z_y - x_y), x can be Southeast, East, or South of z.
    - Example (South): z=(0,0), y=(0,-10), x=(1,-11). x is Southeast of y, y is South of z, x is South of z.
    - Example (East): z=(0,0), y=(0,-0.1), x=(1,-0.2). x is Southeast of y, y is South of z, x is East of z.
    - Example (Southeast): z=(0,0), y=(0,-1), x=(1,-2). x is Southeast of y, y is South of z, x is Southeast of z.

- If y is South-West of z (y_x < 0, y_y < 0): Then x_x > y_x. x_x can be positive (if y_x is negative and x_x is closer to 0 or positive) or negative (if y_x is negative and x_x is still negative but greater than y_x).
    - If x_x > 0, x is in the Southeast quadrant relative to z, leading to Southeast, East, or South as seen above.
    - If x_x < 0, x is in the Southwest quadrant relative to z (since x_y < 0). Depending on the ratio, x can be Southwest or South of z.
        - Example (Southwest): z=(0,0), y=(-10,-1), x=(-5,-2). x_x=-5 > y_x=-10, x_y=-2 < y_y=-1. x is Southeast of y. y_y=-1 < z_y=0. y is South of z. Relative to z: x_x=-5 < 0, x_y=-2 < 0. x is Southwest of z.

- If y is South-East of z (y_x > 0, y_y < 0): Then x_x > y_x > 0. Combined with x_y < 0, this places x in the Southeast quadrant relative to z, leading to Southeast, East, or South.

Combining all possibilities for y being South of z (y_y < 0), and x being Southeast of y (x_x > y_x, x_y < y_y):
The possible relations between x and z are:
- South (possible when x_x is close to z_x)
- East (possible when x_x is significantly greater than z_x and x_y is only slightly less than z_y)
- Southeast (possible when x is significantly East and South of z)
- Southwest (possible when y is South-West of z, and x is still West of z but East of y)

The relation West is not possible. For x to be West of z (x_x < 0), y must be West of z (y_x < 0). But x must be East of y (x_x > y_x), which pushes x's x-coordinate towards being less negative or positive, making it unlikely to be strictly West of z, especially considering x is also South.

The relation Bounding Box is a possible answer from the list. However, based on standard definitions of cardinal directions for points or regions, the combination of "Southeast of y" and "South of z" typically results in a relation that can be described by one or more cardinal directions. The context does not suggest a scenario where the relation would be so complex it could only be described by bounding box relations (e.g., significant overlap), especially since the premise involves specific directional separations. It is most likely that the list asks for possible cardinal relations, and Bounding Box is either a distractor or an option if none of the cardinal directions strictly apply (which doesn't seem to be the case here). Assuming the question asks for the possible cardinal direction relations from the list that *can* hold:

The possible cardinal direction relations are South, Southeast, East, and Southwest.

The final answer is $\boxed{South, Southeast, East, Southwest}$.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  East, answer: The relations are:
1. Region x is Southeast of region y.
2. Region y is East of region z.

Let's represent the regions using a coordinate system or their bounding boxes.
Let z be centered at (0,0).

Relation 2: y is East of z.
This means y is located to the east of z. In terms of coordinates, the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z. If using bounding boxes, the Western edge of y is East of the Eastern edge of z (y_W > z_E). For simplicity, let's assume y is located at (y_e, y_n) where y_e > 0.

Relation 1: x is Southeast of y.
This means x is located to the southeast of y. In terms of coordinates, the x-coordinate of x is greater than the x-coordinate of y, and the y-coordinate of x is less than the y-coordinate of y. So, x is located at (x_e, x_n) where x_e > y_e and x_n < y_n.

Now let's find the possible relations between x and z=(0,0). We look at the coordinates of x relative to z.
The x-coordinate of x is x_e. We know x_e > y_e and y_e > 0. This implies x_e > 0.
A positive x-coordinate relative to z means x is always to the East of z's North-South meridian. This rules out West, Northwest, Southwest, and also North and South (as the sole relation, since the East component is always present). The possible relations must include an Eastward component: Northeast, East, or Southeast.

The y-coordinate of x is x_n. We know x_n < y_n. The possible value of x_n relative to 0 (z's y-coordinate) depends on the value of y_n.

Let's consider the possibilities for y_n, given that y_e > 0:
- If y_n > 0 (y is Northeast or East or Southeast of z, but above z's latitude):
  Since x_n < y_n, x_n could still be positive, zero, or negative.
  - If x_n > 0 and x_e > 0, then x is Northeast of z. (Example: z=(0,0), y=(5,5), x=(6,4) -> x is NE of z)
  - If x_n = 0 and x_e > 0, then x is East of z. (Example: z=(0,0), y=(5,5), x=(6,0) -> x is E of z)
  - If x_n < 0 and x_e > 0, then x is Southeast of z. (Example: z=(0,0), y=(5,5), x=(6,-1) -> x is SE of z)

- If y_n = 0 (y is East of z, at z's latitude):
  Since x_n < y_n, x_n must be negative (x_n < 0).
  - If x_n < 0 and x_e > 0, then x is Southeast of z. (Example: z=(0,0), y=(5,0), x=(6,-1) -> x is SE of z)

- If y_n < 0 (y is Southeast or East or Northeast of z, but below z's latitude):
  Since x_n < y_n and y_n is negative, x_n must also be negative.
  - If x_n < 0 and x_e > 0, then x is Southeast of z. (Example: z=(0,0), y=(5,-5), x=(6,-6) -> x is SE of z)

In summary, depending on the specific location of y relative to z (which only needs y to be East of z), the location of x relative to z (which is Southeast of y) can result in x being Northeast, East, or Southeast of z.

All three relations (Northeast, East, Southeast) are possible depending on the specific positions of y and z, consistent with the given conditions.
The relation "Bounding Box" typically applies when regions overlap in a way that doesn't fit a simple cardinal direction. However, since x is always strictly East of z's Eastern extent (x_e > y_e > z_e for bounding boxes), horizontal overlap is impossible, reducing the likelihood that "Bounding Box" is the *only* or an *additional* necessary description unless the definition of the standard terms is highly restrictive. Based on standard interpretations, the possible specific cardinal relations are Northeast, East, and Southeast.

The possible relations between region x and region z could be Northeast, East, Southeast.

The final answer is $\boxed{Northeast, East, Southeast}$.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z can be determined by considering the relative positions implied by the given relations.

Let's represent the relations using vectors in a coordinate system.
Let V_zy be the vector from region z to region y. Since y is Northwest of z, V_zy points into the Northwest quadrant. We can represent it as V_zy = (-c, d), where c > 0 and d > 0.
Let V_yx be the vector from region y to region x. Since x is Southeast of y, V_yx points into the Southeast quadrant. We can represent it as V_yx = (a, -b), where a > 0 and b > 0.

The vector from region z to region x, V_zx, is the sum of these vectors:
V_zx = V_zy + V_yx = (-c, d) + (a, -b) = (a - c, d - b).

The possible relation between x and z depends on the signs of the components of V_zx (a - c) and (d - b). Since a, b, c, and d can be any positive values, the differences (a - c) and (d - b) can be positive, negative, or zero.

Let's analyze the possibilities for the signs of (a - c) and (d - b):
1.  a - c > 0 and d - b > 0: V_zx is in the Northeast quadrant. Relation: Northeast.
2.  a - c > 0 and d - b < 0: V_zx is in the Southeast quadrant. Relation: Southeast.
3.  a - c < 0 and d - b > 0: V_zx is in the Northwest quadrant. Relation: Northwest.
4.  a - c < 0 and d - b < 0: V_zx is in the Southwest quadrant. Relation: Southwest.
5.  a - c > 0 and d - b = 0: V_zx is along the positive x-axis. Relation: East.
6.  a - c < 0 and d - b = 0: V_zx is along the negative x-axis. Relation: West.
7.  a - c = 0 and d - b > 0: V_zx is along the positive y-axis. Relation: North.
8.  a - c = 0 and d - b < 0: V_zx is along the negative y-axis. Relation: South.
9.  a - c = 0 and d - b = 0: V_zx is the zero vector (0,0). This means x is at the same location as z.

The first 8 cases correspond to the standard cardinal directions. Since a, b, c, d can be any positive values, we can always find values such that a-c and d-b result in any of these 8 sign combinations. Thus, all 8 cardinal directions are possible relations between x and z.

The ninth case, where V_zx = (0,0), means region x is located at the same position as region z (e.g., their centroids coincide). If regions are at the same location, their bounding boxes will overlap (or be identical). The option "Bounding Box" is typically used in spatial relations to indicate that the bounding boxes of the regions overlap. Since the case where x and z are at the same location is possible (when a=c and d=b), and this implies overlapping bounding boxes, "Bounding Box" is also a possible relation.

Therefore, all listed relations are possible.

The possible relations are: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  West, answer: The given relations are:
1. Region x is Southeast of region y.
2. Region y is West of region z.

Let's represent the regions by points for simplicity in exploring the directional possibilities.
Let y be at the origin (0,0).
Since x is Southeast of y, x must have a positive x-coordinate and a negative y-coordinate relative to y. Let x = (x_u, x_v) where x_u > 0 and x_v < 0.

Since y is West of z, z must be East of y. z must have a positive x-coordinate relative to y. The y-coordinate of z can be anything. Let z = (z_u, z_v) where z_u > 0 and z_v can be any real number.

We want to find the possible relations of x relative to z. This is determined by the vector from z to x, which is (x_u - z_u, x_v - z_v). We need to analyze the possible signs of the components of this vector.

1.  **Sign of (x_u - z_u)**: Since x_u > 0 and z_u > 0, the difference (x_u - z_u) can be positive (if x_u > z_u), negative (if x_u < z_u), or zero (if x_u = z_u).

2.  **Sign of (x_v - z_v)**: We know x_v < 0. z_v can be positive, negative, or zero.
    *   If z_v > 0, then x_v - z_v is negative (negative minus positive is negative).
    *   If z_v = 0, then x_v - z_v = x_v, which is negative.
    *   If z_v < 0, then x_v - z_v can be positive (if z_v is more negative than x_v, e.g., x_v=-2, z_v=-5, diff=3), negative (if x_v is more negative than z_v, e.g., x_v=-5, z_v=-2, diff=-3), or zero (if x_v = z_v).

Combining these possibilities, the vector (x_u - z_u, x_v - z_v) can have the following sign combinations for its components (delta_x, delta_y):
*   (+, +): Possible if x_u > z_u and x_v > z_v (requires z_v < 0 and |z_v| > |x_v|). Corresponds to Northeast.
*   (+, -): Possible if x_u > z_u and x_v < z_v (covers cases where z_v >= 0, or z_v < 0 and |z_v| <= |x_v|). Corresponds to Southeast.
*   (+, 0): Possible if x_u > z_u and x_v = z_v (requires z_v < 0 and |z_v| = |x_v|). Corresponds to East.
*   (-, +): Possible if x_u < z_u and x_v > z_v (requires z_v < 0 and |z_v| > |x_v|). Corresponds to Northwest.
*   (-, -): Possible if x_u < z_u and x_v < z_v (covers cases where z_v >= 0, or z_v < 0 and |z_v| <= |x_v|). Corresponds to Southwest.
*   (-, 0): Possible if x_u < z_u and x_v = z_v (requires z_v < 0 and |z_v| = |x_v|). Corresponds to West.
*   (0, +): Possible if x_u = z_u and x_v > z_v (requires z_v < 0 and |z_v| > |x_v|). Corresponds to North.
*   (0, -): Possible if x_u = z_u and x_v < z_v (covers cases where z_v >= 0, or z_v < 0 and |z_v| <= |x_v|). Corresponds to South.

We can construct examples for each of these 8 directions by choosing specific coordinates for x and z relative to y at (0,0) such that the initial conditions (x is SE of y, y is W of z) are met.

For instance:
-   North: y=(0,0), x=(1,-1), z=(1,-2). x is SE of y (1>0, -1<0). y is W of z (0<1). Relation x to z: (1-1, -1-(-2))=(0,1) -> North.
-   Northeast: y=(0,0), x=(2,-1), z=(1,-2). x is SE of y. y is W of z. Relation x to z: (2-1, -1-(-2))=(1,1) -> Northeast.
-   Southeast: y=(0,0), x=(2,-1), z=(1,0). x is SE of y. y is W of z. Relation x to z: (2-1, -1-0)=(1,-1) -> Southeast.
-   Southwest: y=(0,0), x=(1,-1), z=(2,0). x is SE of y. y is W of z. Relation x to z: (1-2, -1-0)=(-1,-1) -> Southwest.

All 8 cardinal directions are possible relations between x and z depending on their specific locations relative to y.

The option "Bounding Box" usually indicates a spatial relationship that isn't one of the simple cardinal directions, often involving overlap or complex configurations when considering regions with extent rather than just points. Since it's possible for regions x and z to overlap while satisfying the initial conditions (e.g., y is a point at origin, x is a square [1,2]x[-2,-1], z is a square [0.5, 1.5]x[-0.5, 0.5] - here x is SE of y, y is W of z, and x overlaps z), "Bounding Box" is also a possible relation to describe the relationship between x and z in such cases.

Therefore, all the listed options are possible relations between region x and region z.

The possible relations are:
North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: Southeast, South, Southwest
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Let the cardinal direction relations (North, Northeast, etc.) and the Bounding Box relation be defined based on the Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) of the regions.

Let MBR(r) denote the minimum bounding rectangle of a region r. MBR(r) is defined by [minX(r), maxX(r)] × [minY(r), maxY(r)].

The relation "region A is Southeast of region B" (A SE B) is typically defined based on the MBRs of A and B. A common strict definition implying separation is:
minX(A) > maxX(B) AND maxY(A) < minY(B).

The relation "region y is Bounding Box of region z" (y BB z) most naturally means that y is the minimum bounding box of z. This implies:
MBR(y) = MBR(z)
So, minY(y) = minY(z), maxY(y) = maxY(z), minX(y) = minX(z), maxX(y) = maxX(z).

Given:
1) x SE y
2) y BB z

Substitute the definition of y BB z into the definition of x SE y (using the strict MBR definition for SE):
minX(x) > maxX(y) becomes minX(x) > maxX(z)
maxY(x) < minY(y) becomes maxY(x) < minY(z)

These two conditions (minX(x) > maxX(z) AND maxY(x) < minY(z)) are precisely the definition of x is Southeast of z using the strict MBR definition. Under this interpretation, the only possible relation between x and z is Southeast.

However, the question asks "which could the possible relations ... be?" and provides a list including multiple cardinal directions, suggesting there might be more than one possible answer. This implies that either the definition of the relations used is not the strict MBR definition, or the composition allows for variations depending on the specific shapes or positions of regions x and z within the constraints.

Let's consider a slightly less strict definition of "Southeast" that allows for boundary touching.
x SE y: minX(x) >= maxX(y) AND maxY(x) <= minY(y)

Given this definition for x SE y and y BB z (MBR(y)=MBR(z)):
minX(x) >= maxX(z)
maxY(x) <= minY(z)

This derived condition describes the spatial relationship between MBR(x) and MBR(z). Now let's see which relations from the possible answers are compatible with this condition. Assuming the cardinal directions in the answer list also relate MBRs:

- **Southeast (x SE z):** minX(x) > maxX(z) AND maxY(x) < minY(z). This is a subset of the derived condition (when strict inequality holds). So, Southeast is a possible relation.

- **East (x E z):** minX(x) > maxX(z) AND OverlapY(x,z). OverlapY(x,z) means maxY(x) >= minY(z) and minY(x) <= maxY(z). Our condition is maxY(x) <= minY(z). So, for East to be possible, we need minX(x) > maxX(z), maxY(x) = minY(z), and OverlapY(x,z). If maxY(x) = minY(z), OverlapY requires minY(x) <= maxY(z), which is possible. Thus, East is a possible relation if boundary touching is allowed in the derived relation.

- **South (x S z):** maxY(x) < minY(z) AND OverlapX(x,z). OverlapX(x,z) means maxX(x) >= minX(z) and minX(x) <= maxX(z). Our condition is minX(x) >= maxX(z). So, for South to be possible, we need maxY(x) < minY(z), minX(x) = maxX(z), and OverlapX(x,z). If minX(x) = maxX(z), OverlapX requires maxX(x) >= minX(z), which is possible. Thus, South is a possible relation if boundary touching is allowed in the derived relation.

- **North (x N z):** minY(x) > maxY(z). The derived condition maxY(x) <= minY(z) makes North impossible unless z is degenerate (minY(z) > maxY(z)).
- **West (x W z):** maxX(x) < minX(z). The derived condition minX(x) >= maxX(z) makes West impossible unless z is degenerate.
- **Northwest, Northeast, Southwest:** These relations combine North/South and East/West conditions in ways that contradict the derived conditions.
- **Bounding Box (x BB z):** MBR(x) = MBR(z). This implies minX(x) = minX(z) and maxX(x) = maxX(z), etc. This contradicts the derived condition minX(x) >= maxX(z) and maxY(x) <= minY(z) unless x and z are points at the exact same location, which is usually not considered a cardinal direction relation.

Based on the interpretation that the initial "Southeast" relation allows boundary touching, and the resulting cardinal relations in the list cover cases including boundary touching where applicable, the possible relations between x and z are Southeast, East, and South.

If the strict definition of Southeast was intended for the premise, only Southeast would be possible. Given the structure of the multiple choice answers, the interpretation allowing boundary touching is more likely intended to produce multiple results.

The final answer is $\boxed{Southeast, East, South}$.
For r1:  South, r2: North, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  South, r2:  Northeast, answer: Let z be at the origin (0,0).
The relation "y is Northeast of z" means that the coordinates of y, let's say (y_x, y_y), satisfy y_x > 0 and y_y > 0.

The relation "x is South of y" means that the y-coordinate of x, let's say x_y, is less than the y-coordinate of y (x_y < y_y). There is no constraint on the x-coordinate of x (x_x) relative to y_x in the simple cardinal direction model.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z=(0,0). This depends on the possible values of (x_x, x_y) relative to (0,0).

From y is Northeast of z, we know y_y > 0.
From x is South of y, we know x_y < y_y.

Let's consider the possible values for x_y:
Since x_y must be less than some positive value y_y, x_y can be:
1.  Negative (e.g., if y_y=1, x_y can be -5).
2.  Zero (e.g., if y_y=1, x_y can be 0).
3.  Positive (e.g., if y_y=10, x_y can be 5).

Now let's consider the possible values for x_x:
The relation "x is South of y" does not constrain the x-position of x relative to y. The x-position of y (y_x) must be positive (y is NE of z). Since x_x is not constrained relative to y_x, and y_x can be any positive number, x_x can be:
1.  Negative (e.g., y_x=5, x_x=-3).
2.  Zero (e.g., y_x=5, x_x=0).
3.  Positive (e.g., y_x=5, x_x=7).

Combining the possibilities for x_x and x_y relative to z=(0,0):
-   x_x > 0, x_y > 0: Possible (Northeast). Example: z(0,0), y(5,5) is NE of z. x(3,4) is South of y (4<5). x(3,4) is NE of z.
-   x_x > 0, x_y = 0: Possible (East). Example: z(0,0), y(5,5) is NE of z. x(3,0) is South of y (0<5). x(3,0) is East of z.
-   x_x > 0, x_y < 0: Possible (Southeast). Example: z(0,0), y(5,5) is NE of z. x(3,-2) is South of y (-2<5). x(3,-2) is Southeast of z.
-   x_x = 0, x_y > 0: Possible (North). Example: z(0,0), y(5,5) is NE of z. x(0,3) is South of y (3<5). x(0,3) is North of z.
-   x_x = 0, x_y < 0: Possible (South). Example: z(0,0), y(5,5) is NE of z. x(0,-2) is South of y (-2<5). x(0,-2) is South of z.
-   x_x < 0, x_y > 0: Possible (Northwest). Example: z(0,0), y(5,5) is NE of z. x(-3,4) is South of y (4<5). x(-3,4) is Northwest of z.
-   x_x < 0, x_y = 0: Possible (West). Example: z(0,0), y(5,5) is NE of z. x(-3,0) is South of y (0<5). x(-3,0) is West of z.
-   x_x < 0, x_y < 0: Possible (Southwest). Example: z(0,0), y(5,5) is NE of z. x(-3,-2) is South of y (-2<5). x(-3,-2) is Southwest of z.

In fact, for any point (x_x, x_y) in the plane, we can find a y=(y_x, y_y) such that y is NE of z and x is South of y. We just need y_x > 0 and y_y > x_y and y_y > 0. We can always find such y (e.g., pick y_x=1 and y_y = max(x_y + 1, 1)).
This means x can be located anywhere relative to z.

When the relative position of x to z can be any of the cardinal directions, the relation is unconstrained by the composition. In the context of the given options, "Bounding Box" is used to represent this unconstrained or universal relation, where the relative position is not limited to a specific directional sector or set of sectors.

The possible relations between region x and region z could be any of the 8 cardinal directions. Given the option "Bounding Box" as a potential answer in addition to listing directions, it signifies the case where the set of possible relations is the universal set (all directions are possible).

Bounding Box

The final answer is $\boxed{Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  South, r2:  Southeast, answer: South, Southeast, Southwest
For r1:  South, r2:  South, answer: Southeast, South, Southwest
For r1:  South, r2:  East, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by composing the given relations: x is South of y (x Sy) and y is East of z (y Ez).

Let's consider the Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) of the regions and the definitions of the cardinal directions based on disjointness or overlap of MBRs along the axes.

- x Sy means that the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y (x_max_y < y_min_y). There is no constraint on the horizontal relationship between x and y.
- y Ez means that the MBR of y is entirely to the east of the MBR of z (y_min_x > z_max_x). There is no constraint on the vertical relationship between y and z.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. This depends on the relative positions of their MBRs along the x and y axes.

1.  **Horizontal relationship between x and z:**
    We know y_min_x > z_max_x. The MBR of y is to the east of the MBR of z.
    The horizontal position of x relative to y is not constrained by x Sy.
    -   x can be West of y horizontally (x_max_x < y_min_x). Since y_min_x > z_max_x, it is possible for x_max_x to be less than z_min_x (which is <= z_max_x). Thus, x can be West of z.
    -   x can overlap y horizontally (x_min_x <= y_max_x AND x_max_x >= y_min_x). It is possible for x to overlap z horizontally.
    -   x can be East of y horizontally (x_min_x > y_max_x). Since y_max_x > y_min_x > z_max_x, x_min_x can be greater than z_max_x. Thus, x can be East of z.
    So, horizontally, x can be West of z, overlap z, or be East of z.

2.  **Vertical relationship between x and z:**
    We know x_max_y < y_min_y. The MBR of x is below the MBR of y.
    The vertical position of y relative to z is not constrained by y Ez.
    -   y can be South of z vertically (y_max_y < z_min_y). Since x_max_y < y_min_y and y_min_y <= y_max_y, we have x_max_y < y_min_y <= y_max_y < z_min_y. This implies x_max_y < z_min_y, so x is South of z.
    -   y can overlap z vertically (y_min_y <= z_max_y AND y_max_y >= z_min_y). Since x_max_y < y_min_y, and y_min_y <= z_max_y, it is possible that x_max_y >= z_min_y (e.g., if y_min_y is within the vertical extent of z). Thus, x can overlap z vertically.
    -   y can be North of z vertically (y_min_y > z_max_y). Since x_max_y < y_min_y, and y_min_y can be arbitrarily high, it is possible for x_min_y to be greater than z_max_y. Thus, x can be North of z.
    So, vertically, x can be South of z, overlap z, or be North of z.

Since the horizontal and vertical relations are independent in this composition, any combination of the possible horizontal and vertical relations is possible. Assuming the standard definitions of cardinal directions based on disjointness along axes where applicable, and 'Bounding Box' for cases of overlap on both axes:

-   Horizontal West + Vertical South = Southwest
-   Horizontal West + Vertical Overlap = West
-   Horizontal West + Vertical North = Northwest
-   Horizontal Overlap + Vertical South = South
-   Horizontal Overlap + Vertical Overlap = Bounding Box
-   Horizontal Overlap + Vertical North = North
-   Horizontal East + Vertical South = Southeast
-   Horizontal East + Vertical Overlap = East
-   Horizontal East + Vertical North = Northeast

All 9 combinations are possible depending on the specific sizes and placements of regions x, y, and z satisfying the initial conditions.

The possible relations are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  South, r2:  Northwest, answer: Let the relations be defined using the minimum bounding boxes of the regions.
Let R be a region. Let R.min_x, R.max_x, R.min_y, R.max_y be the coordinates of its bounding box.

The given relations are:
1. Region x is South of region y: x.max_y < y.min_y
2. Region y is Northwest of region z: y.max_x < z.min_x and y.min_y > z.max_y

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z from the given list: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

Let's analyze the constraints:
(1) x.max_y < y.min_y
(2) y.max_x < z.min_x
(3) y.min_y > z.max_y

Consider the vertical relationship between x and z (comparison of x.max_y with z.min_y, and x.min_y with z.max_y):
From (1), x.max_y < y.min_y. From (3), y.min_y > z.max_y.
This implies x.max_y < y.min_y and z.max_y < y.min_y.
Can x.max_y be less than z.min_y? (x is South of z)
We know z.min_y <= z.max_y.
From x.max_y < y.min_y and z.max_y < y.min_y, we can choose y.min_y large enough. We can also choose x.max_y and z.max_y such that x.max_y < z.min_y.
Example: Let y.min_y = 10, z.max_y = 8, z.min_y = 6. (y.min_y > z.max_y and z.min_y <= z.max_y holds).
We need x.max_y < y.min_y = 10. We can choose x.max_y = 5. Then x.max_y < z.min_y (5 < 6).
So, x South of z is possible.

Can x.min_y be greater than z.max_y? (x is North of z)
We know x.min_y <= x.max_y. We have x.max_y < y.min_y and y.min_y > z.max_y.
Example: Let y.min_y = 10, z.max_y = 8. (y.min_y > z.max_y holds).
We need x.max_y < y.min_y = 10. Let x.max_y = 9.
We need x.min_y > z.max_y = 8. We can choose x.min_y = 8.5. This is consistent with x.min_y <= x.max_y (8.5 <= 9).
So, x North of z is possible.

Can x.max_y >= z.min_y and x.min_y <= z.max_y? (Vertical overlap between x and z)
Example: Let y.min_y = 10, z.min_y = 5, z.max_y = 8. (y.min_y > z.max_y holds).
We need x.max_y < y.min_y = 10. Let x.max_y = 7. (x.max_y >= z.min_y? 7 >= 5, Yes).
We need x.min_y <= z.max_y = 8. We can choose x.min_y = 6. This is consistent with x.min_y <= x.max_y (6 <= 7).
So, vertical overlap between x and z is possible.

Consider the horizontal relationship between x and z (comparison of x.max_x with z.min_x, and x.min_x with z.max_x):
From (2), y.max_x < z.min_x.
The relation "x is South of y" puts no constraint on the horizontal relationship between x and y. x can be West, East, or overlapping y horizontally.

Can x.max_x be less than z.min_x? (x is West of z)
We know y.max_x < z.min_x. If we position x such that x.max_x is less than or equal to y.max_x, then x.max_x will be less than z.min_x.
Example: Let z.min_x = 10, y.max_x = 8. (y.max_x < z.min_x holds).
Let x.max_x = 7. Then x.max_x < z.min_x (7 < 10). This is possible.
So, x West of z is possible.

Can x.min_x be greater than z.max_x? (x is East of z)
We know y.max_x < z.min_x <= z.max_x.
We can position x such that x.min_x is greater than z.max_x.
Example: Let z.max_x = 10, y.max_x = 8. (y.max_x < z.min_x is required, let z.min_x=9).
y.max_x = 8 < z.min_x = 9. z.min_x=9 <= z.max_x=10.
We need x.min_x > z.max_x = 10. Let x.min_x = 11. This is possible.
So, x East of z is possible.

Can x.max_x >= z.min_x and x.min_x <= z.max_x? (Horizontal overlap between x and z)
Example: Let z.min_x = 5, z.max_x = 10. y.max_x < z.min_x. Let y.max_x = 4. (4 < 5 holds).
We need x.max_x >= z.min_x = 5 and x.min_x <= z.max_x = 10.
We can choose x.min_x = 6 and x.max_x = 7. This satisfies 6 <= 7, 7 >= 5, and 6 <= 10.
So, horizontal overlap between x and z is possible.

Combining the vertical and horizontal possibilities:
Since vertical relation can be North, South, or Overlap, and horizontal relation can be East, West, or Overlap, any combination of these is potentially possible unless constrained by the initial relations.
As shown by the examples, all 8 cardinal directions (which imply disjoint bounding boxes aligned in a specific way) are possible. For instance, x can be entirely to the Southwest of z if x is West of y and y is Northwest of z, and x is South of y, and y is Northwest of z. The construction examples in thought process confirm all 8 disjoint relations are possible.

When both vertical overlap and horizontal overlap occur, the relation is Bounding Box (specifically Overlap, Contains, CoveredBy, or Equal). We showed that both vertical and horizontal overlap are possible simultaneously.
Example: z = [5, 10] x [5, 10], y = [0, 4] x [11, 15], x = [8, 12] x [8, 10].
x.max_y=10 < y.min_y=11 (x S y holds).
y.max_x=4 < z.min_x=5 and y.min_y=11 > z.max_y=10 (y NW z holds).
x and z overlap: x=[8,12]x[8,10], z=[5,10]x[5,10]. Both horizontal and vertical intervals overlap.

Therefore, all the listed relations are possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z could be any of the following:
North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  South, r2:  West, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  South, r2:  Southwest, answer: Southwest
For r1:  South, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: South, Southeast, Southwest
For r1:  East, r2: North, answer: Let y be at (0,0).
Since x is East of y, x has a positive x-coordinate.
Since y is North of z, z has a negative y-coordinate.

Let's consider bounding boxes.
Let $BB(R)$ denote the bounding box of region R.
$BB(R) = [min_x(R), max_x(R)] \times [min_y(R), max_y(R)]$.

Given:
1.  x is East of y: $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$ AND the y-intervals of x and y overlap ($max_y(x) > min_y(y)$ AND $min_y(x) < max_y(y)$).
2.  y is North of z: $min_y(y) > max_y(z)$ AND the x-intervals of y and z overlap ($max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ AND $min_x(y) < max_x(z)$).

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

From (1) and (2):
$min_x(x) > max_x(y)$
$max_y(x) > min_y(y)$ (overlap condition for x E y)
$min_y(y) > max_y(z)$
$min_y(x) < max_y(y)$ (overlap condition for x E y)

Combining inequalities:
$min_x(x) > max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ (from $min_x(x)>max_x(y)$ and $max_x(y)>min_x(z)$ which is part of y_x overlaps z_x)
$max_y(x) > min_y(y) > max_y(z)$

Let's check the possible relations for x relative to z:

-   **Northeast (NE):** $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$ AND $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$.
    We know $min_y(y) > max_y(z)$. From $min_y(x) < max_y(y)$ (overlap x_y, y_y), it is possible that $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$. Example: $max_y(z)=0$, $min_y(y)=1$, $max_y(y)=2$. x overlaps y on y-axis, e.g., $min_y(x)=1.1$, $max_y(x)=1.9$. Here $min_y(x)=1.1 > max_y(z)=0$. This part is possible.
    We need $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$. We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$. We also know $max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ (from y_x overlaps z_x). It is possible that $max_x(y) < max_x(z)$. Example: z=[0,5]x[-1,0], y=[1,2]x[1,2]. $max_x(z)=5, max_x(y)=2$. y N z. x E y, e.g., x=[3,4]x[1.1,1.9]. $min_x(x)=3, max_x(z)=5$. $3 > 5$ is false.
    However, it is also possible that $max_x(y) \ge max_x(z)$. Example: z=[0,1]x[-1,0], y=[0.5,1.5]x[1,2]. y N z. $max_x(z)=1, max_x(y)=1.5$. x E y, e.g., x=[1.6,2]x[1.1,1.9]. $min_x(x)=1.6, max_x(z)=1$. $1.6 > 1$. Yes.
    So, Northeast is possible.

-   **Southeast (SE):** $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$ AND $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$.
    We know $max_y(x) > min_y(y)$ (overlap x_y, y_y) and $min_y(y) > max_y(z)$. So $max_y(x) > max_y(z)$.
    Also $max_y(z) \ge min_y(z)$. Thus $max_y(x) > min_y(z)$.
    So $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$ is impossible. Southeast is not possible.

-   **Northwest (NW):** $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$ AND $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$.
    We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$ and $max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ (from y_x overlaps z_x). So $min_x(x) > min_x(z)$.
    Since $max_x(x) \ge min_x(x)$, we have $max_x(x) > min_x(z)$.
    So $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$ is impossible. Northwest is not possible.

-   **Southwest (SW):** $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$ AND $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$.
    Both conditions are impossible as shown above. Southwest is not possible.

-   **East (E):** The y-intervals of x and z overlap ($max_y(x) > min_y(z)$ AND $min_y(x) < max_y(z)$) AND $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$.
    Overlap y-intervals: $max_y(x) > min_y(y) > max_y(z) \ge min_y(z)$. So $max_y(x) > min_y(z)$ is always true.
    Need $min_y(x) < max_y(z)$. We know $min_y(x) < max_y(y)$. This is possible if $max_y(y)$ is small enough, e.g., $max_y(y)$ is only slightly greater than $max_y(z)$, and $min_y(x)$ is close to $max_y(y)$ and less than $max_y(z)$. Example: z=[0,1]x[-1,0], y=[0,1]x[0.1,0.5]. y N z. $max_y(z)=0, min_y(y)=0.1, max_y(y)=0.5$. x E y, x_y overlaps [0.1,0.5]. Let x=[2,3]x[-0.5,0.3]. $min_y(x)=-0.5, max_y(z)=0$. $-0.5 < 0$. Yes.
    Need $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$. We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$. This is possible if $max_x(y)$ is not larger than $max_x(z)$. Example: z=[0,1]x[-1,0], y=[0,1]x[0.1,0.5]. $max_x(z)=1, max_x(y)=1$. x E y, x_min_x > 1. e.g., x=[2,3]x[-0.5,0.3]. $min_x(x)=2, max_x(z)=1$. $2 > 1$. Yes.
    So, East is possible.

-   **West (W):** The y-intervals of x and z overlap ($max_y(x) > min_y(z)$ AND $min_y(x) < max_y(z)$) AND $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$.
    Overlap y-intervals is possible as shown for East.
    Need $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$. We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$ and $max_x(x) \ge min_x(x)$, so $max_x(x) > max_x(y)$.
    We also know $max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ (from y_x overlaps z_x).
    So $max_x(x) > max_x(y) > min_x(z)$. This means $max_x(x) > min_x(z)$.
    So $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$ is impossible. West is not possible.

-   **North (N):** The x-intervals of x and z overlap ($max_x(x) > min_x(z)$ AND $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$) AND $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$.
    Need $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$. We know $min_y(y) > max_y(z)$. It is possible that $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$ as shown for Northeast.
    Need x-intervals to overlap: $max_x(x) > min_x(z)$ AND $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$.
    We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y) > min_x(z)$. So $min_x(x) > min_x(z)$ is always true. $max_x(x) > min_x(z)$ is also always true.
    We need $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$. We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$. This is possible if $max_x(y)$ is small enough compared to $max_x(z)$, e.g., $max_x(y) < max_x(z)$. Example: z=[0,5]x[-1,0], y=[1,2]x[1,2]. y N z. $max_x(z)=5, max_x(y)=2$. x E y, x_min_x > 2. e.g., x=[2.1,2.5]x[1.1,1.9]. $min_x(x)=2.1, max_x(z)=5$. $2.1 < 5$. Yes.
    So, North is possible.

-   **South (S):** The x-intervals of x and z overlap ($max_x(x) > min_x(z)$ AND $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$) AND $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$.
    Overlap x-intervals is possible as shown for North.
    Need $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$. We showed this is impossible. South is not possible.

-   **Bounding Box:** This relation applies when the bounding boxes overlap but the relation is not one of the primary 8 directions. This requires overlap on both axes ($max_x(x) > min_x(z)$, $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$, $max_y(x) > min_y(z)$, $min_y(x) < max_y(z)$) but not fitting any of the 8 directional criteria (e.g., no containment).
    We showed that overlap on both axes is possible. Example configuration: z=[0,5]x[-1,0], y=[1,4]x[0.1,0.5], x=[4.1,4.9]x[-0.5,0.2].
    Check overlap: x=[4.1,4.9], z=[0,5]. Overlap. x=[-0.5,0.2], z=[-1,0]. Overlap.
    Check direction: x is not N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW of z for this example (verified in thought block).
    So, Bounding Box is possible.

Based on the analysis using standard bounding box relations, the possible relations between region x and region z are North, Northeast, East, and Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, East, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  East, r2:  Northeast, answer: East, Northeast
For r1:  East, r2:  Southeast, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z could be East, Southeast, Northeast, or Bounding Box.

Explanation:
Let the relation "x is East of y" be denoted by E, and "y is Southeast of z" be denoted by SE. We want to find the possible relations for x E o SE z.

If we consider regions as points or use their centroids, and define cardinal directions based on angular sectors (e.g., East is angle (-22.5, 22.5) degrees, Southeast is (-67.5, -22.5) degrees), the vector from z to x is the sum of the vector from z to y and the vector from y to x.

Let v_zy be the vector from z to y, with angle θ₂ in (-67.5°, -22.5°).
Let v_yx be the vector from y to x, with angle θ₁ in (-22.5°, 22.5°).
The vector from z to x is v_zx = v_zy + v_yx.

The x-component of v_zx is |v_zy|cos(θ₂) + |v_yx|cos(θ₁). Since θ₁ and θ₂ are in ranges where cosine is positive, the x-component is always positive. This means x is always to the East of z in terms of x-coordinates. This rules out West, Northwest, Southwest, North, and South as the *sole* relation, but they might be part of a compound relation or Bounding Box. Given the options, only East, Northeast, Southeast, and Bounding Box keep x to the East of z.

The y-component of v_zx is |v_zy|sin(θ₂) + |v_yx|sin(θ₁).
sin(θ₂) is in (-sin(67.5°), -sin(22.5°)) ≈ (-0.92, -0.38).
sin(θ₁) is in (-sin(22.5°), sin(22.5°)) ≈ (-0.38, 0.38).

The y-component can be:
- Negative (e.g., if |v_yx| is small compared to |v_zy|): This contributes a Southward direction, resulting in Southeast.
- Positive (e.g., if |v_yx| is large compared to |v_zy|, and θ₁ is positive while θ₂ is negative): This contributes a Northward direction. If the positive contribution outweighs the negative one, the y-component can be positive, resulting in Northeast.
- Zero (if the positive and negative contributions cancel out): This results in a purely East direction.

Calculating the range of the angle of v_zx, atan2(y-comp, x-comp), shows it lies in (-67.5°, 22.5°).
- Angles in (-67.5°, -22.5°) correspond to Southeast.
- Angles in (-22.5°, 22.5°) correspond to East.
- Angles exactly at -22.5° or 22.5° are boundary cases.

Some spatial composition systems based on these angular definitions conclude that E o SE results in {East, Southeast}. Others, with slightly different angle boundaries or interpretations, include Northeast as a possibility.

The "Bounding Box" relation is typically used when regions overlap significantly, or when their relative position is complex and not well-described by a single cardinal direction. While the centroid analysis suggests directional separation, definitions of E and SE for regions (e.g., based on bounding boxes or topological relations) can sometimes lead to situations where region x and region z have overlapping bounding boxes, particularly in the y-dimension while maintaining separation in the x-dimension (x strictly east of z). In such cases, "Bounding Box" could be considered a possible relation by some systems.

Considering the common interpretations of spatial relation composition:
- East is a possible relation.
- Southeast is a possible relation.
- Northeast is often included as a possible relation in spatial composition tables for E o SE, even if the strict angle calculation is borderline.
- Bounding Box is possible if the definitions of E and SE for regions allow for resulting overlap or complex configuration.

Therefore, the possible relations from the given list are East, Southeast, Northeast, and Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{East, Northeast, Southeast, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  East, r2:  South, answer: Southeast
For r1:  East, r2:  East, answer: East, Northeast, Southeast
For r1:  East, r2:  Northwest, answer: North
Northeast
Southeast
South
East
Northwest
West
Southwest
Bounding Box
For r1:  East, r2:  West, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  East, r2:  Southwest, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  East, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Northeast, Southeast, East
For r1:  Northwest, r2: North, answer: Let's analyze the given relations:
1. Region x is Northwest of region y (x NW y).
2. Region y is North of region z (y N z).

We want to find the possible relation(s) between region x and region z. We can represent these relations using a coordinate system. Let z be at the origin (0,0).

Relation 2: y is North of z.
This means y is located primarily in the positive y direction from z. If we consider the standard cardinal directions as quadrants, y would be in the North quadrant relative to z. Let y be at coordinates (y_x, y_y) relative to z=(0,0).
- If "North" means strictly on the positive y-axis, then y_x = 0 and y_y > 0.
- If "North" means within the North quadrant (excluding boundaries for strict definition, including for non-strict), then y_y > 0 and |y_x| <= y_y (or y_y > |y_x| for strict). Let's use y_y > 0 and -y_y <= y_x <= y_y as a representative definition for the North quadrant including boundaries.

Relation 1: x is Northwest of y.
This means x is located in the Northwest quadrant relative to y. Let x be at coordinates (x_x, x_y) relative to z=(0,0). The position of x relative to y is (x_x - y_x, x_y - y_y).
x is Northwest of y means (x_x - y_x) < 0 and (x_y - y_y) > 0.
So, x_x < y_x and x_y > y_y.

Now let's combine the constraints on x relative to z=(0,0):
We know x_x < y_x and x_y > y_y.
We also know y_y > 0 (from y is North of z).

From x_y > y_y and y_y > 0, it follows that x_y > 0.
A point (x_x, x_y) relative to (0,0) with x_y > 0 is located in the upper half-plane. This means x is always North of the x-axis passing through z.
Therefore, the possible relations cannot be South, Southeast, or Southwest, as these require x_y < 0 or x_y = 0 (for South).

Now let's consider the x-coordinate of x relative to z (x_x).
We know x_x < y_x. The possible values for y_x depend on the definition of "North" for y relative to z. Let's use y_y > 0 and -y_y <= y_x <= y_y.

- If y_x is positive (e.g., y is in the Northeast part of the North quadrant relative to z), say y_x = 0.5 * y_y where y_y > 0.
  We have x_x < 0.5 * y_y and x_y > y_y.
  It is possible for x_x to be positive in this case. For example, let y=(5, 10) (y_y=10>0, y_x=5, -10<=5<=10). x is NW of y, so x_x < 5 and x_y > 10. If x=(3, 11), then x_x=3 > 0 and x_y=11 > 0. Relative to z=(0,0), (3, 11) is Northeast. So, Northeast is a possible relation.

- If y_x is zero (i.e., y is strictly North of z), say y_x = 0 where y_y > 0.
  We have x_x < 0 and x_y > y_y.
  In this case, x_x is always negative and x_y is always positive. Relative to z=(0,0), a point with x_x < 0 and x_y > 0 is in the Northwest quadrant. So, Northwest is a possible relation. (Example: y=(0, 10), x NW y => x_x < 0, x_y > 10. x=(-2, 11) is NW of (0,0)).

- If y_x is negative (e.g., y is in the Northwest part of the North quadrant relative to z), say y_x = -0.5 * y_y where y_y > 0.
  We have x_x < -0.5 * y_y and x_y > y_y.
  In this case, x_x must be negative and x_y is always positive. Relative to z=(0,0), a point with x_x < 0 and x_y > 0 is in the Northwest quadrant.

Can x be strictly North of z? A point strictly North of z=(0,0) has coordinates (0, x_y) with x_y > 0.
We need x_x = 0, x_y > 0.
From x_x < y_x and x_y > y_y, we need 0 < y_x and x_y > y_y.
This requires y_x to be positive, which is possible if y is in the Northeast part of the North quadrant relative to z (e.g., y_y > y_x > 0).
If y_x > 0 and y_y > y_x, then y is North of z.
If x_x = 0 and x_y > y_y, then x is NW of y (since 0 < y_x and x_y > y_y).
If these conditions are met, x is North of z (x_x=0, x_y>0).
Example: z=(0,0). y=(1, 5). y is North of z (5 > |1|). x is NW of y=(1, 5) means x_x < 1, x_y > 5. Can x=(0, 6)? Yes, 0 < 1 and 6 > 5. x=(0, 6) is North of z=(0,0). So, North is a possible relation.

So, we have found that North, Northeast, and Northwest are all possible relations between region x and region z, depending on the specific relative positions of y within the "North" relation to z and x within the "Northwest" relation to y.

The set of all possible positions for x relative to z covers the area in the upper half-plane where the x-coordinate can be positive, zero, or negative, and the y-coordinate is always positive. This region spans the North, Northeast, and Northwest directions.

The question asks for the "possible relations" from the given list. We have identified configurations where x is North of z, Northeast of z, and Northwest of z.

Bounding Box as a relation typically describes complex overlaps or when the relative positions span multiple directions such that a single cardinal direction is not sufficient. While the possible locations of x span multiple directions, North, Northeast, and Northwest are themselves specific possible relations. Given that these specific relations are listed as options, and we've shown they can occur, they should be included. Bounding Box might also be considered if the combined constraints lead to a region of possible x locations that necessitates this broader description, but based on the point-based analysis, the fundamental possible directions are N, NE, and NW.

Therefore, the possible relations are North, Northeast, and Northwest.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Northwest}$.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northeast, answer: North
Northeast
Northwest
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: The given relations are:
1. Region x is Northwest of region y.
2. Region y is Southeast of region z.

Let's represent the relative positions using a coordinate system. For simplicity, we can think of regions as points or use Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs). The standard cardinal direction relations for regions are often based on the relative positions of their MBRs.

Let (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max) represent the MBR of a region.
A is Northwest of B means A.x_max < B.x_min and A.y_min > B.y_max.
A is Southeast of B means A.x_min > B.x_max and A.y_max < B.y_min.

From the given information:
1. x is Northwest of y: x.x_max < y.x_min AND x.y_min > y.y_max.
2. y is Southeast of z: y.x_min > z.x_max AND y.y_max < z.y_min.

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z based on the relations between x and y, and y and z.

Let's analyze the possible relative positions of x and z in both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) dimensions.

Horizontal relation between x and z:
From (1): x.x_max < y.x_min
From (2): z.x_max < y.x_min (derived from y.x_min > z.x_max)

Both x and z are located to the West of the vertical line y.x_min.
However, this does not determine the relationship between x.x_max and z.x_min, or x.x_min and z.x_max.

Consider examples for the horizontal axis:
Let y.x_min = 10.
If x is far West and z is close to y.x_min: x.x_max = 0, z.x_min = 5. Both are < 10. Here z is East of x (x.x_max < z.x_min).
If z is far West and x is close to y.x_min: z.x_max = 0, x.x_min = 5. Both are < 10. Here x is East of z (z.x_max < x.x_min).
If x and z are positioned such that x.x_max < z.x_min, then x is West of z.
If z.x_max < x.x_min, then x is East of z.
If their MBRs overlap horizontally (x.x_min <= z.x_max AND z.x_min <= x.x_max), then neither strictly West nor strictly East relation holds.

Vertical relation between x and z:
From (1): x.y_min > y.y_max
From (2): z.y_min > y.y_max (derived from y.y_max < z.y_min)

Both x and z are located to the North of the horizontal line y.y_max.
However, this does not determine the relationship between x.y_min and z.y_max, or x.y_max and z.y_min.

Consider examples for the vertical axis:
Let y.y_max = 10.
If x is far North and z is close to y.y_max: x.y_min = 20, z.y_max = 15. Both are > 10. Here x is North of z (x.y_min > z.y_max).
If z is far North and x is close to y.y_max: z.y_min = 20, x.y_max = 15. Both are > 10. Here x is South of z (x.y_max < z.y_min).
If x and z are positioned such that x.y_min > z.y_max, then x is North of z.
If x.y_max < z.y_min, then x is South of z.
If their MBRs overlap vertically (x.y_min <= z.y_max AND z.y_min <= x.y_max), then neither strictly North nor strictly South relation holds.

Since the horizontal relationship between x and z can be West, East, or Overlapping, and the vertical relationship between x and z can be North, South, or Overlapping, any combination of a horizontal and a vertical relationship (as long as they are not overlapping in the dimension being described by the relation) is possible.

Possible horizontal relations between x and z (excluding overlap for strict directions): West, East, or Horizontally Aligned (vertical relation applies).
Possible vertical relations between x and z (excluding overlap for strict directions): North, South, or Vertically Aligned (horizontal relation applies).

Combining these:
- If x is West of z and North of z -> Northwest
- If x is West of z and South of z -> Southwest
- If x is West of z and vertically aligned with z -> West
- If x is East of z and North of z -> Northeast
- If x is East of z and South of z -> Southeast
- If x is East of z and vertically aligned with z -> East
- If x is horizontally aligned with z and North of z -> North
- If x is horizontally aligned with z and South of z -> South

Examples demonstrating each of the 8 directions are possible can be constructed (e.g., by placing y at the origin and picking appropriate x and z coordinates in the Northwest quadrant relative to y).

Additionally, as shown in the thought process, the MBRs of x and z can overlap. If they overlap, none of the 8 strict cardinal directions apply. In such cases, "Bounding Box" is often used as a catch-all relation indicating that the regions are spatially related but not in one of the strict directional ways.

Therefore, all 8 standard cardinal directions are possible, and the "Bounding Box" relation is also possible if the regions overlap.

The possible relations are: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  South, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  East, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by the relative positions given:
1.  x is Northwest of y
2.  y is East of z

Let's represent the regions as points (e.g., their centroids) in a coordinate system. Let z be at the origin (0,0).

"y is East of z" means the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z. The y-coordinate of y relative to z is not strictly constrained by the term "East" alone in a general sense (unless specifically defined as being on the same horizontal line).
Let y = (y_x, y_y), where y_x > 0 (relative to z=(0,0)). y_y can be any real number.

"x is Northwest of y" means the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of y.
Let x = (x_x, x_y), where x_x < y_x and x_y > y_y (relative to y=(y_x, y_y)).
So, the position of x relative to z=(0,0) is (x_x, x_y), where x_x < y_x and x_y > y_y, with y_x > 0 and y_y being any real number.

We need to determine the possible signs of x_x and x_y relative to 0 (the coordinates of z).

For x_x:
We know x_x < y_x and y_x > 0.
-   If y_x is large enough compared to the difference (y_x - x_x), x_x can be positive. E.g., y_x=5, x_x=3. (3 < 5, 5 > 0).
-   If y_x equals the difference, x_x can be zero. E.g., y_x=5, x_x=0. (0 < 5, 5 > 0).
-   If y_x is smaller than the difference, x_x can be negative. E.g., y_x=5, x_x=-1. (-1 < 5, 5 > 0).
So, x_x can be positive, zero, or negative relative to z.

For x_y:
We know x_y > y_y, and y_y can be any real number relative to z.
-   If y_y is positive (e.g., y_y=5), then x_y > 5, so x_y is positive. (e.g., x_y=6).
-   If y_y is zero (e.g., y_y=0), then x_y > 0, so x_y is positive. (e.g., x_y=1).
-   If y_y is negative (e.g., y_y=-5), then x_y > -5. x_y can be positive (e.g., x_y=1), zero (e.g., x_y=0), or negative (e.g., x_y=-1).

Combining the possibilities for x_x and x_y relative to z=(0,0):
-   If x_y > 0 (x is North of z's y-level):
    -   x_x > 0: Northeast (Possible)
    -   x_x = 0: North (Possible)
    -   x_x < 0: Northwest (Possible)
-   If x_y = 0 (x is at z's y-level):
    -   x_x > 0: East (Possible, e.g., z=(0,0), y=(2,-1), x=(1,0). x NW y (1<2, 0>-1). y E z (2>0). x E z (1>0, 0=0)).
    -   x_x < 0: West (Possible, e.g., z=(0,0), y=(1,-1), x=(-1,0). x NW y (-1<1, 0>-1). y E z (1>0). x W z (-1<0, 0=0)).
-   If x_y < 0 (x is South of z's y-level):
    -   x_x > 0: Southeast (Possible, e.g., z=(0,0), y=(1,-2), x=(0.5,-1). x NW y (0.5<1, -1>-2). y E z (1>0). x SE z (0.5>0, -1<0)).
    -   x_x = 0: South (Possible, e.g., z=(0,0), y=(1,-2), x=(0,-1). x NW y (0<1, -1>-2). y E z (1>0). x S z (0=0, -1<0)).
    -   x_x < 0: Southwest (Possible, e.g., z=(0,0), y=(1,-2), x=(-1,-1). x NW y (-1<1, -1>-2). y E z (1>0). x SW z (-1<0, -1<0)).

Thus, all 8 specific cardinal directions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest) are possible relations between region x and region z when treating them as points and using the general definition of East and Northwest.

The list of possible answers also includes "Bounding Box". When considering regions with extent, the "Bounding Box" relation typically means that the bounding boxes of the two regions overlap. Since the exact sizes and positions of the regions (beyond the directional constraints) are not fixed, it is possible to configure regions x, y, and z such that their bounding boxes overlap while satisfying the given directional constraints. For example, if region z is large and centered at the origin, a region x whose centroid is Northwest of a region y which is East of z could still have its extent overlapping with z's extent. Given "Bounding Box" is listed as a possible answer alongside cardinal directions, it is intended as a possible relation that can occur, likely referring to bounding box overlap when region extent is considered.

Therefore, all listed cardinal directions and the Bounding Box relation are possible.

Possible relations are: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: North, Northwest, West
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  West, answer: Northwest, West
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southwest, answer: Northwest, Southwest, West, Bounding Box
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Northwest, North, West
For r1:  West, r2: North, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  West, r2:  Northeast, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions.
Let the relation "A is West of B" mean that the x-coordinate range of A is entirely to the west of the x-coordinate range of B, or at least the center of A is to the west of the center of B and their y-coordinates are relatively close. Let's use the general interpretation where A's x-coordinate is less than B's x-coordinate (x_A < x_B), and no strict constraint is placed on the y-coordinates unless needed to distinguish pure directions.

Let the relation "A is Northeast of B" mean that A is to the east and north of B. This means x_A > x_B and y_A > y_B.

Given:
1. x is West of y: x_x < y_x
2. y is Northeast of z: y_x > z_x and y_y > z_y

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. This depends on the relative positions of x_x vs z_x and x_y vs z_y.

Let's analyze the x-coordinates:
From (1) x_x < y_x.
From (2) y_x > z_x.
Combining these inequalities, we can see that x_x can be less than, equal to, or greater than z_x.
- Example where x_x < z_x (x is West of z): Let y_x = 10, x_x = 5, z_x = 7. (5 < 10, 10 > 7, 5 < 7). This is possible.
- Example where x_x > z_x (x is East of z): Let y_x = 10, x_x = 7, z_x = 5. (7 < 10, 10 > 5, 7 > 5). This is possible.
- Example where x_x = z_x (x is on the same longitude as z): Let y_x = 10, x_x = 5, z_x = 5. (5 < 10, 10 > 5, 5 = 5). This is possible.

Now let's analyze the y-coordinates:
From (2) y_y > z_y.
We have no direct information about x_y relative to y_y or z_y from the given relations in their most general form. The relation "West(x,y)" primarily constrains the x-coordinates. Without additional constraints on the y-coordinates in the definition of "West", x_y can be less than, equal to, or greater than z_y.
- Example where x_y < z_y (x is South of z): Possible if the definition of West allows for a significant difference in y-coordinates.
- Example where x_y > z_y (x is North of z): Possible.
- Example where x_y = z_y (x is on the same latitude as z): Possible.

Let's demonstrate that all 8 cardinal directions are possible by choosing specific coordinates that satisfy the conditions x_x < y_x, y_x > z_x, and y_y > z_y, and result in each of the 8 relations between x and z. Let z be at (0,0) for simplicity (z_x=0, z_y=0). Then y must be at (y_x, y_y) with y_x > 0 and y_y > 0. Let's pick y = (10, 10). Now x must be at (x_x, x_y) with x_x < 10.

- Northeast(x,z): x_x > 0, x_y > 0. Pick x = (5, 5). (5 < 10, 10 > 0, 10 > 0, 5 > 0, 5 > 0). Possible.
- East(x,z): x_x > 0, x_y ≈ 0. Pick x = (5, 0). (5 < 10, 10 > 0, 10 > 0, 5 > 0, 0 = 0). Possible.
- Southeast(x,z): x_x > 0, x_y < 0. Pick x = (5, -5). (5 < 10, 10 > 0, 10 > 0, 5 > 0, -5 < 0). Possible.
- South(x,z): x_x ≈ 0, x_y < 0. Pick x = (0, -5). (0 < 10, 10 > 0, 10 > 0, 0 = 0, -5 < 0). Possible.
- Southwest(x,z): x_x < 0, x_y < 0. Pick x = (-5, -5). (-5 < 10, 10 > 0, 10 > 0, -5 < 0, -5 < 0). Possible.
- West(x,z): x_x < 0, x_y ≈ 0. Pick x = (-5, 0). (-5 < 10, 10 > 0, 10 > 0, -5 < 0, 0 = 0). Possible.
- Northwest(x,z): x_x < 0, x_y > 0. Pick x = (-5, 5). (-5 < 10, 10 > 0, 10 > 0, -5 < 0, 5 > 0). Possible.
- North(x,z): x_x ≈ 0, x_y > 0. Pick x = (0, 5). (0 < 10, 10 > 0, 10 > 0, 0 = 0, 5 > 0). Possible.

Thus, all 8 cardinal directions are possible relations between x and z.

Now let's consider the "Bounding Box" relation, which typically implies that the bounding boxes of the two regions overlap.
Let z = [0,1]x[0,1].
y is Northeast of z. Let y = [10,11]x[10,11]. (y_min_x=10 > z_max_x=1, y_min_y=10 > z_max_y=1). y is Northeast of z and does not overlap z.
x is West of y. This means x_max_x < y_min_x. In our example, x_max_x < 10.
Can x overlap z? Overlap occurs if [x_min_x, x_max_x] overlaps with [0,1] AND [x_min_y, x_max_y] overlaps with [0,1].
Let x = [0.5, 0.8]x[0.5, 0.8].
- Does x overlap z? Yes, [0.5, 0.8] overlaps [0,1] in both x and y.
- Is x West of y=[10,11]x[10,11]? x_max_x = 0.8, y_min_x = 10. 0.8 < 10. Yes.
- Is y=[10,11]x[10,11] Northeast of z=[0,1]x[0,1]? Yes.
Since we found a configuration where x and z overlap, "Bounding Box" is a possible relation.

Therefore, all 8 cardinal directions and the Bounding Box relation are possible between region x and region z.

The possible relations are North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  West, r2:  Southeast, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  West, r2:  South, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in a 2D space.
Let the relations "West" and "South" refer to the relative positions of these regions.

We are given:
1. Region x is West of region y.
2. Region y is South of region z.

Let's consider the implications for the coordinates of these regions. Assuming a standard coordinate system where North is +y and East is +x.

"x is West of y" implies that the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y. For regions, this typically means the eastern boundary of x is west of the western boundary of y. Let's use bounding box notation: `x.east < y.west`.

"y is South of z" implies that the y-coordinate of y is less than the y-coordinate of z. For regions, this typically means the northern boundary of y is south of the southern boundary of z. `y.north < z.south`.

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z from the given list: {North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}.

Let's analyze the possible relative positions of x and z by constructing examples.

**Case 1: Strict Cardinal Directions (x and z are disjoint)**
For x to be in a strict cardinal relation to z (like Northwest), their bounding boxes must be disjoint.

*   **Northwest:** Requires x to be West of z horizontally (`x.east < z.west`) and North of z vertically (`x.south > z.north`).
    -   We have `x.east < y.west` and `y.north < z.south`.
    -   Can we have `x.east < z.west`? Yes, if `y.west` is west of or aligned with `z.west` (e.g., `y.west <= z.west`). Example: x=(0,1,10,11), y=(2,3,0,1), z=(3,4,5,6). `x.east < y.west` (1<2), `y.north < z.south` (1<5). `x.east < z.west` (1<3), `x.south > z.north` (10 > 6). **Northwest** is possible.
*   **West:** Requires x to be West of z horizontally (`x.east < z.west`) and vertically overlapping or aligned. Example: x=(0,1,5,6), y=(2,3,0,1), z=(3,4,2,7). `x.east < y.west` (1<2), `y.north < z.south` (1<2). `x.east < z.west` (1<3), `x.south < z.north` (5<7) and `x.north > z.south` (6>2) -> Vertical overlap. **West** is possible (if definition allows vertical overlap). If West requires vertical alignment, this is also possible with specific coordinates.
*   **Southwest:** Requires x to be West of z horizontally (`x.east < z.west`) and South of z vertically (`x.north < z.south`). Example: x=(0,1,0,1), y=(2,3,0,1), z=(3,4,5,6). `x.east < y.west` (1<2), `y.north < z.south` (1<5). `x.east < z.west` (1<3), `x.north < z.south` (1<5). **Southwest** is possible.
*   **North:** Requires x to be vertically aligned with z horizontally and North of z vertically (`x.south > z.north`). Example: x=(5,6,10,11), y=(0,1,0,1), z=(5,6,5,6). `x.east < y.west` (6<0) False. Example: x=(5,6,10,11), y=(10,11,0,1), z=(5,6,5,6). `x.east < y.west` (6<10). `y.north < z.south` (1<5). `x.west > z.east` (5 > 6) False. How about horizontal overlap? x=(4,7,10,11), y=(10,11,0,1), z=(5,6,5,6). `x.east < y.west` (7<10). `y.north < z.south` (1<5). x=(4,7,10,11), z=(5,6,5,6). Horiz overlap (4<6 and 7>5), `x.south > z.north` (10>6). This fits a "North Overlap(H)" relation, which likely falls under **North** or **Bounding Box**. Let's find a pure North example: x=(5,6,10,11), y=(7,8,0,1), z=(5,6,5,6). `x.east < y.west` (6<7), `y.north < z.south` (1<5). `x.west=z.west` (5=5), `x.east=z.east` (6=6) -> Horizontally aligned. `x.south > z.north` (10>6). **North** is possible.
*   **South:** Requires x to be vertically aligned with z horizontally and South of z vertically (`x.north < z.south`). Example: x=(5,6,0,1), y=(7,8,-5,-4), z=(5,6,2,3). `x.east < y.west` (6<7), `y.north < z.south` (-4<2). `x.west=z.west` (5=5), `x.east=z.east` (6=6) -> Horizontally aligned. `x.north < z.south` (1<2). **South** is possible.
*   **Northeast:** Requires x to be East of z horizontally (`x.west > z.east`) and North of z vertically (`x.south > z.north`). Example: x=(10,11,10,11), y=(15,16,0,1), z=(5,6,5,6). `x.east < y.west` (11<15), `y.north < z.south` (1<5). `x.west > z.east` (10>6), `x.south > z.north` (10>6). **Northeast** is possible.
*   **East:** Requires x to be East of z horizontally (`x.west > z.east`) and vertically overlapping or aligned. Example: x=(10,11,5,6), y=(15,16,0,1), z=(5,6,2,7). `x.east < y.west` (11<15), `y.north < z.south` (1<2). `x.west > z.east` (10>6), vertical overlap (5<7 and 6>2). **East** is possible.
*   **Southeast:** Requires x to be East of z horizontally (`x.west > z.east`) and South of z vertically (`x.north < z.south`). Example: x=(10,11,0,1), y=(15,16,0,1), z=(5,6,5,6). `x.east < y.west` (11<15), `y.north < z.south` (1<5). `x.west > z.east` (10>6), `x.north < z.south` (1<5). **Southeast** is possible.

So, all 8 cardinal directions are possible when x and z are disjoint.

**Case 2: Non-Disjoint (Bounding Box overlaps or touches)**
*   **Bounding Box:** This relation covers cases where the bounding boxes of x and z intersect. This includes overlap and touching.
    -   Can x and z overlap? Requires `x.west < z.east`, `x.east > z.west`, `x.south < z.north`, `x.north > z.south`.
        -   We need `x.east > z.west`. We have `x.east < y.west`. Possible if `y.west > x.east > z.west`. Example: `z.west=5, x.east=10, y.west=15`. (5 < 10 < 15).
        -   We need `x.north > z.south`. We have `y.north < z.south`. Possible if `x.north > z.south > y.north`. Example: `y.north=0, z.south=5, x.north=10`. (0 < 5 < 10).
        -   Example Construction: x=(8,10,6,10), y=(15,20,-5,0), z=(5,12,5,8).
            x is West of y (10 < 15).
            y is South of z (0 < 5).
            x=(8,10,6,10), z=(5,12,5,8).
            Horizontal: `x.west < z.east` (8<12), `x.east > z.west` (10>5). Overlap in x.
            Vertical: `x.south < z.north` (6<8), `x.north > z.south` (10>5). Overlap in y.
            Since there is overlap in both dimensions, the **Bounding Box** relation is possible.

All 8 cardinal directions and Bounding Box are possible relations between region x and region z.

The possible relations between region x and region z could be: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  West, r2:  East, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  West, r2:  Northwest, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.
For r1:  West, r2:  West, answer: West, Northwest, Southwest
For r1:  West, r2:  Southwest, answer: Northwest, West, Southwest
For r1:  West, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: West
For r1:  Southwest, r2: North, answer: Let's denote the position of region A relative to region B using coordinates. Assume the relations refer to the relative positions of the regions' centroids or bounding boxes. We use a standard Cartesian coordinate system where positive y is North and positive x is East.

1.  **x is Southwest of y (x SW y)**: This means the center of x is to the west (smaller x-coordinate) and south (smaller y-coordinate) of the center of y.
    $x_x < y_x$
    $x_y < y_y$

2.  **y is North of z (y N z)**: This means the center of y is to the north (larger y-coordinate) and horizontally aligned (same x-coordinate) with the center of z. (A general "North of" allows for some horizontal offset, but the strict cardinal relation implies alignment). Let's use strict alignment for the core case, and consider horizontal offset for possibility.
    $y_x = z_x$
    $y_y > z_y$

Now we want to find the possible relations between x and z. We need to compare $x_x$ to $z_x$ and $x_y$ to $z_y$.

From $x_x < y_x$ and $y_x = z_x$, we get $x_x < z_x$. This implies that x is always West of z (or strictly to the left of z's center line).

From $x_y < y_y$ and $y_y > z_y$, we know $z_y < y_y$ and $x_y < y_y$. The position of $x_y$ relative to $z_y$ is not fixed.
*   It is possible that $x_y > z_y$ (e.g., $z_y < x_y < y_y$).
*   It is possible that $x_y = z_y$ (e.g., $z_y = x_y < y_y$).
*   It is possible that $x_y < z_y$ (e.g., $x_y < z_y < y_y$).

Combining the horizontal relation ($x_x < z_x$) with the possible vertical relations ($x_y$ vs $z_y$):

1.  If $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y > z_y$: x is West and North of z. The relation is **Northwest**.
2.  If $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y = z_y$: x is West of z (on the same horizontal level). The relation is **West**.
3.  If $x_x < z_x$ and $x_y < z_y$: x is West and South of z. The relation is **Southwest**.

These three cases cover all possibilities based on the strict point-based interpretation. Considering regions and their bounding boxes, the same relations hold when using definitions based on relative positions of bounding box edges or centers, assuming standard cardinal relations imply separation preventing overlap leading to an "overlaps" or "bounding box" relation.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

The final answer is $\boxed{Northwest, West, Southwest}$.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Northeast, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: Southwest, South, Southeast
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  South, answer: Let Z be the origin (0,0).
Region y is South of region z. In the bounding box model, this means the maximum y-coordinate of y's bounding box (Yy_max) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z's bounding box (Zy_min), and y's bounding box overlaps z's bounding box horizontally.
So, Yy_max < Zy_min (y is strictly below z).
And max(Yx_min, Zx_min) < min(Yx_max, Zx_max) (y overlaps z horizontally).

Region x is Southwest of region y. In the bounding box model, this means the maximum x-coordinate of x's bounding box (Xx_max) is less than the minimum x-coordinate of y's bounding box (Yx_min), and the maximum y-coordinate of x's bounding box (Xy_max) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of y's bounding box (Yy_min).
So, Xx_max < Yx_min (x is strictly to the west of y).
And Xy_max < Yy_min (x is strictly below y).

Now let's find the possible relations between region x and region z. We compare their bounding boxes [Xx_min, Xx_max] x [Xy_min, Xy_max] and [Zx_min, Zx_max] x [Zy_min, Zy_max].

First, consider the vertical relation between x and z.
We have Xy_max < Yy_min (x is below y) and Yy_max < Zy_min (y is below z).
Since Yy_min <= Yy_max (assuming regions have positive height, or at least Yy_min is not greater than Yy_max), we have Xy_max < Yy_min <= Yy_max < Zy_min.
This implies Xy_max < Zy_min.
So, x is strictly below z in the y-dimension. This means the possible relations between x and z are South, Southwest, or Southeast.

Second, consider the horizontal relation between x and z.
We have Xx_max < Yx_min (x is west of y).
We also know that y overlaps z horizontally, which implies Yx_min < Zx_max and Zx_min < Yx_max.

From Xx_max < Yx_min and Yx_min < Zx_max, we can deduce Xx_max < Zx_max.
This means that the right edge of x's bounding box is to the left of the right edge of z's bounding box. This rules out x being entirely East of z (Xx_min > Zx_max, which would imply Xx_max > Zx_max). So Southeast is not possible under this definition of South.

Now let's check if x can be West of z or overlap z horizontally.

Case 1: x is West of z. This requires Xx_max < Zx_min.
We know Xx_max < Yx_min. If we can choose Yx_min such that Yx_min <= Zx_min, then Xx_max will be less than Zx_min.
From the condition that y overlaps z horizontally, we need Yx_min < Zx_max and Zx_min < Yx_max.
Can Yx_min be less than or equal to Zx_min while also satisfying Yx_min < Zx_max and Zx_min < Yx_max?
Yes. For example, if Zx = [0, 10] and Yx = [0, 10]. Yx overlaps Zx (max(0,0)=0 < min(10,10)=10). Yx_min = 0, Zx_min = 0. Yx_min = Zx_min.
We need Xx_max < Yx_min = 0. Let Xx = [-5, -1]. Xx_max = -1.
Then Xx_max = -1 is less than Zx_min = 0.
So Xx_max < Zx_min is possible.
Since x is below z and x is West of z, the relation is Southwest. Southwest is a possible relation.

Case 2: x overlaps z horizontally. This requires max(Xx_min, Zx_min) < min(Xx_max, Zx_max).
This requires Xx_max > Zx_min and Xx_min < Zx_max.
We know Xx_max < Yx_min. If we can choose Yx_min such that Yx_min > Zx_min, and choose Xx_max such that Zx_min < Xx_max < Yx_min, this is possible.
Example: Zx = [0, 10]. Yx overlaps Zx. Let Yx = [5, 12]. Yx_min = 5.
We need Xx_max < Yx_min = 5. Let Xx_max = 3.
We need Xx_max > Zx_min = 0. Yes, 3 > 0.
Let Xx = [1, 3]. Xx_min = 1, Xx_max = 3.
Check overlap: max(1, 0) = 1, min(3, 10) = 3. 1 < 3. X overlaps Z horizontally.
Since x is below z and x overlaps z horizontally, the relation is South. South is a possible relation.

The only possible horizontal relations between x and z, given the constraints derived from the input relations (specifically Xx_max < Zx_max, ruling out X being East of Z), are X being West of Z or X overlapping Z horizontally.

Combining the vertical relation (x is below z) with the possible horizontal relations:
- X is below Z + X is West of Z = Southwest
- X is below Z + X overlaps Z horizontally = South

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest and South. The "Bounding Box" option typically represents non-cardinal relations like overlap or containment, but our analysis based on standard MBR definitions for cardinal directions leads to specific cardinal directions (Southwest and South), implying "Bounding Box" is not the resulting relation here.

The final answer is $\boxed{Southwest, South}$.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  East, answer: Let R(A, B) denote the cardinal direction relation between region A and region B.
We are given:
1. R(x, y) = Southwest (x SW y)
2. R(y, z) = East (y E z)

We want to find the possible relations R(x, z).

Let's represent the regions by points in a 2D coordinate system for simplicity. Let z be at the origin (0,0).
Since y is East of z, y must have a positive x-coordinate. Let y = (Y_x, Y_y), where Y_x > 0. The y-coordinate Y_y can be positive, zero, or negative, allowing for cases where y is Northeast, directly East, or Southeast of z.

Since x is Southwest of y, x must be located in the region below and to the left of y, relative to y's position. Let x = (X_x, X_y). The vector from y to x, (X_x - Y_x, X_y - Y_y), must point into the Southwest quadrant. This means:
X_x - Y_x < 0  =>  X_x < Y_x
X_y - Y_y < 0  =>  X_y < Y_y

We need to determine the possible location of x relative to z (the origin (0,0)). The relation R(x, z) is determined by the signs of X_x and X_y.

We know Y_x > 0 and X_x < Y_x.
- Can X_x be positive? Yes, if Y_x is large enough. For example, if Y_x = 5, X_x could be 4.
- Can X_x be zero? Yes, if Y_x > 0. For example, if Y_x = 5, X_x could be 0.
- Can X_x be negative? Yes, if Y_x is small. For example, if Y_x = 1, X_x could be -1.
So, X_x can be positive, zero, or negative. This means x could be East, on the North/South axis, or West of z in terms of x-coordinates.

We know X_y < Y_y. Y_y can be positive, zero, or negative.
- If Y_y is positive (e.g., y is Northeast of z): X_y < Y_y. X_y can be positive (e.g., Y_y=5, X_y=4), zero (e.g., Y_y=5, X_y=0), or negative (e.g., Y_y=5, X_y=-1).
- If Y_y is zero (e.g., y is directly East of z): X_y < 0. X_y must be negative.
- If Y_y is negative (e.g., y is Southeast of z): X_y < Y_y. Since Y_y is negative and X_y is even less, X_y must be negative.

So, Y_y can influence the sign of X_y. However, since x is *Southwest* of y, X_y is likely significantly less than Y_y. The vector (X_x - Y_x, X_y - Y_y) must be in the SW quadrant.

Let's test whether all 8 cardinal directions are possible for R(x, z) by finding example points (X_x, X_y) for x and (Y_x, Y_y) for y relative to z=(0,0), such that Y_x > 0, X_x < Y_x, and X_y < Y_y.

1.  **Northeast (NE):** X_x > 0, X_y > 0.
    Let z=(0,0). Choose y=(10, 10). y E z (10>0).
    Choose x=(5, 5). x SW y (5<10, 5<10, vector (5-10, 5-10)=(-5,-5) is SW).
    x NE z (5>0, 5>0). Possible.

2.  **East (E):** X_x > 0, X_y = 0.
    Let z=(0,0). Choose y=(10, 10). y E z (10>0).
    Choose x=(5, 0). x SW y (5<10, 0<10, vector (5-10, 0-10)=(-5,-10) is SW).
    x E z (5>0, 0=0). Possible.

3.  **Southeast (SE):** X_x > 0, X_y < 0.
    Let z=(0,0). Choose y=(10, 10). y E z (10>0).
    Choose x=(5, -5). x SW y (5<10, -5<10, vector (5-10, -5-10)=(-5,-15) is SW).
    x SE z (5>0, -5<0). Possible.

4.  **North (N):** X_x = 0, X_y > 0.
    Let z=(0,0). Choose y=(10, 10). y E z (10>0).
    Choose x=(0, 5). x SW y (0<10, 5<10, vector (0-10, 5-10)=(-10,-5) is SW).
    x N z (0=0, 5>0). Possible.

5.  **South (S):** X_x = 0, X_y < 0.
    Let z=(0,0). Choose y=(10, 10). y E z (10>0).
    Choose x=(0, -5). x SW y (0<10, -5<10, vector (0-10, -5-10)=(-10,-15) is SW).
    x S z (0=0, -5<0). Possible.

6.  **Northwest (NW):** X_x < 0, X_y > 0.
    Let z=(0,0). Choose y=(10, 10). y E z (10>0).
    Choose x=(-5, 5). x SW y (-5<10, 5<10, vector (-5-10, 5-10)=(-15,-5) is SW).
    x NW z (-5<0, 5>0). Possible.

7.  **West (W):** X_x < 0, X_y = 0.
    Let z=(0,0). Choose y=(10, 10). y E z (10>0).
    Choose x=(-5, 0). x SW y (-5<10, 0<10, vector (-5-10, 0-10)=(-15,-10) is SW).
    x W z (-5<0, 0=0). Possible.

8.  **Southwest (SW):** X_x < 0, X_y < 0.
    Let z=(0,0). Choose y=(10, 10). y E z (10>0).
    Choose x=(-5, -5). x SW y (-5<10, -5<10, vector (-5-10, -5-10)=(-15,-15) is SW).
    x SW z (-5<0, -5<0). Possible.

All 8 cardinal directions are possible relations between x and z.

9.  **Bounding Box:** This relation can occur when regions overlap or one contains the other, which typically isn't described by a simple cardinal direction. If x and z are the same region, the relation is Bounding Box (identity). Can x be the same as z?
    If x = z, then the relations are z SW y and y E z.
    Can we find a y such that z SW y and y E z?
    Let z=(0,0). z SW y means (0,0) is SW of (Y_x, Y_y). This requires 0 < Y_x and 0 < Y_y. So y must be in the NE quadrant relative to z.
    y E z means (Y_x, Y_y) is East of (0,0). This requires Y_x > 0. Y_y can be anything.
    If we choose y=(5,5), then Y_x=5>0 and Y_y=5>0. z SW y holds. Also y E z holds (5>0).
    So, it is possible to have z SW y and y E z. If x=z, then x SW y and y E z holds, and the relation R(x, z) is Bounding Box. Possible.

Since the question asks for *which could the possible relations be*, and we have shown that all listed options (the 8 cardinal directions and Bounding Box) are possible, the answer is the set of all of them.

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:
1.  Region x is Southwest of region y.
2.  Region y is Northwest of region z.

Let's analyze the possible relative positions using coordinates. Assume z is at the origin (0,0).
Since y is Northwest of z, y is in the upper-left quadrant relative to z. This means y has a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate. Let y = (y_x, y_y) where y_x < 0 and y_y > 0.

Since x is Southwest of y, x is in the lower-left quadrant relative to y. This means x's x-coordinate is less than y's x-coordinate, and x's y-coordinate is less than y's y-coordinate. Let x = (x_x, x_y) where x_x < y_x and x_y < y_y.

Now let's determine the position of x relative to z (which is at the origin). The coordinates of x relative to z are (x_x, x_y).

From x_x < y_x and y_x < 0, it follows that x_x < 0. This means x is always to the West of z.

From x_y < y_y and y_y > 0, the y-coordinate of x can be positive, zero, or negative.
-   If x_y > 0: x is above z (North component). Since x_x < 0, this places x in the Northwest quadrant relative to z.
-   If x_y = 0: x is at the same vertical level as z (East-West line). Since x_x < 0, this places x exactly West of z.
-   If x_y < 0: x is below z (South component). Since x_x < 0, this places x in the Southwest quadrant relative to z.

Examples:
-   z = (0,0). y = (-5, 5) (NW of z). x is SW of y. Let x = (-5-1, 5-1) = (-6, 4). x is at (-6, 4) which is Northwest of z.
-   z = (0,0). y = (-5, 5) (NW of z). x is SW of y. Let x = (-5-5, 5-5) = (-10, 0). x is at (-10, 0) which is West of z.
-   z = (0,0). y = (-5, 5) (NW of z). x is SW of y. Let x = (-5-1, 5-6) = (-6, -1). x is at (-6, -1) which is Southwest of z.

The relative position of x to z can be Northwest, West, or Southwest, depending on the specific positions of y and x within their allowed regions relative to z and y.

The term "Bounding Box" is listed as a possible answer. In this context, the standard 8 cardinal directions (including intercardinal) describe the possible relative positions of disjoint regions or the centers of their bounding boxes. Our analysis shows the possible relations fall into the Northwest, West, or Southwest categories. "Bounding Box" is typically used in spatial relation theory to denote relations like overlap, containment, or adjacency between bounding boxes. Since x is always strictly West of z (max_x(x) < min_x(z) if using MBBs), there is no overlap or containment possible. Even allowing for touching boundaries still results in West, Northwest, or Southwest relations.

Given the options, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Northwest, West, Southwest.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  West, answer: Northwest, West, Southwest
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Southwest, answer: Southwest
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Southwest
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2: North, answer: Let's analyze the given relations:
1.  Region x is the Bounding Box of region y. This means that x is the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that completely encloses y. The extent of x is determined by the minimum and maximum coordinates of points within y.
2.  Region y is North of region z. This implies that region y is located generally above region z. Under a strict definition (e.g., using minimum and maximum y-coordinates), this means that the lowest point in y is higher than the highest point in z. Under a less strict definition (e.g., using centroids), it means the centroid of y is north of the centroid of z.

Let's consider a strict definition where y is North of z means the minimum y-coordinate of any point in y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of any point in z (min_y_y > max_y_z).
Since x is the bounding box of y, the minimum y-coordinate of x is the same as the minimum y-coordinate of y (min_y_x = min_y_y).
So, min_y_x > max_y_z.
This means the lowest point of x is strictly higher than the highest point of z. This implies that the entire region x is located strictly North of region z.

Under this strict interpretation, the only possible relation is North.

However, spatial relations often allow for overlap or adjacency, or consider the general position rather than strict separation of all points. Let's consider a more general interpretation where "North of" means y is predominantly above z, potentially with some horizontal offset.

If y is located directly North of z, its bounding box x will also be located directly North of z.
If y is located North-East of z, its bounding box x will likely also be located North-East of z (while still being generally above z due to the "North of z" condition).
If y is located North-West of z, its bounding box x will likely also be located North-West of z (while still being generally above z).

Given that x contains y, and y is North of z, x cannot be located predominantly to the South, East, or West of z. The condition "y is North of z" fundamentally places y, and thus its surrounding box x, in the upper half relative to z.

Therefore, the possible relations are restricted to the northerly directions. North, Northeast, and Northwest are possible depending on the horizontal positioning and extent of y relative to z.

For example:
- If y is centered directly above z, x is North of z.
- If y is centered above and to the east of z, x is Northeast of z.
- If y is centered above and to the west of z, x is Northwest of z.

The other directions (South, Southeast, Southwest, East, West) are not possible because y being North of z implies x (which contains y) cannot be located primarily in those directions relative to z.

The possible relations are North, Northeast, Northwest.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Northwest}$.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Northeast, answer: North
Northeast
East
Bounding Box
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Southeast, answer: Southeast, East, South
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  South, answer: The final answer is $\boxed{South, Southeast, Southwest, East, West, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  East, answer: Northeast, Southeast, East
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Northwest, answer: North, Northwest, West
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  West, answer: Northwest, West, Southwest
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Southwest, answer: Let's analyze the given information and determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

We are given two conditions:
1. Region x is Bounding Box of region y.
2. Region y is Southwest of region z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are given as: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

Let's interpret the relations using Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs), as this is common in spatial analysis and aligns with the term "Bounding Box".

Interpretation of Relation 2: Region y is Southwest of region z.
Using MBRs, this means that the MBR of y is entirely to the southwest of the MBR of z.
Let MBR(y) = [min_x(y), max_x(y)] x [min_y(y), max_y(y)]
Let MBR(z) = [min_x(z), max_x(z)] x [min_y(z), max_y(z)]
The condition "y is Southwest of z" means:
max_x(y) < min_x(z)  (y is to the west of z)
AND
max_y(y) < min_y(z)  (y is to the south of z)

Interpretation of Relation 1: Region x is Bounding Box of region y.
The phrase "A is Bounding Box of B" can have a few meanings. Given the list of possible relations for (x, z), one of which is "Bounding Box", it suggests that "Bounding Box" is a type of spatial relation itself.
A standard interpretation of "A is the Bounding Box of B" is that A is the minimum bounding rectangle of B (A = MBR(B)). However, if we use this for the first relation, we find it leads to only one possibility for (x, z) (Southwest), which contradicts the likely intent of the question (asking for "possible relations", plural, from a list of many).

A more plausible interpretation, given the expected outcome, is that "region x is Bounding Box of region y" means that x is a rectangle aligned with the axes (a bounding box shape) that contains region y.
This means MBR(x) contains MBR(y):
min_x(x) <= min_x(y)
max_x(x) >= max_x(y)
min_y(x) <= min_y(y)
max_y(x) >= max_y(y)
And x itself is a rectangle: [min_x(x), max_x(x)] x [min_y(x), max_y(x)].

Now let's determine the possible relations between x and z based on these conditions, using MBR definitions for the relations from the list. The list contains 8 standard cardinal directions and "Bounding Box". Let's assume the 8 directions refer to disjoint MBR relations, and "Bounding Box" refers to MBR overlap.

Relations between x and z using MBRs:
(A is R of B implies relation between MBR(A) and MBR(B))
- Southwest: max_x(x) < min_x(z) AND max_y(x) < min_y(z).
  From max_x(x) >= max_x(y) and max_x(y) < min_x(z), it's possible that max_x(x) < min_x(z).
  From max_y(x) >= max_y(y) and max_y(y) < min_y(z), it's possible that max_y(x) < min_y(z).
  Example: y=[-3,-2]x[-3,-2], z=[0,1]x[0,1]. x=[-3,-2]x[-3,-2]. x contains y. y is SW of z. max_x(x)=-2<0, max_y(x)=-2<0. x is SW of z. Southwest is possible.

- West: max_x(x) < min_x(z) AND (MBRs don't overlap in y, and are not North/South of each other).
  max_x(x) < min_x(z) is possible (e.g. x extends vertically but not far right).
  max_y(x) vs min_y(z): max_y(x) >= max_y(y) and max_y(y) < min_y(z). max_y(x) can be >= min_y(z).
  min_y(x) vs max_y(z): min_y(x) <= min_y(y). min_y(y) relative to max_y(z) is not constrained.
  Example: y=[-3,-2]x[-3,-2], z=[0,1]x[0,1]. x=[-4,-1]x[-10,10]. x contains y. max_x(x)=-1 < min_x(z)=0. max_y(x)=10, min_y(z)=0 (overlap in y). x-intervals [-4,-1] and [0,1] don't overlap. MBR(x) doesn't overlap MBR(z). x is West of z. West is possible.

- South: max_y(x) < min_y(z) AND (MBRs don't overlap in x, and are not East/West of each other).
  max_y(x) < min_y(z) is possible (e.g. x extends horizontally but not far up).
  max_x(x) vs min_x(z): max_x(x) >= max_x(y) and max_x(y) < min_x(z). max_x(x) can be >= min_x(z).
  min_x(x) vs max_x(z): min_x(x) <= min_x(y). min_x(y) relative to max_x(z) is not constrained.
  Example: y=[-3,-2]x[-3,-2], z=[0,1]x[0,1]. x=[-10,10]x[-4,-1]. x contains y. max_y(x)=-1 < min_y(z)=0. max_x(x)=10, min_x(z)=0 (overlap in x). y-intervals [-4,-1] and [0,1] don't overlap. MBR(x) doesn't overlap MBR(z). x is South of z. South is possible.

- Northwest: max_x(x) < min_x(z) AND min_y(x) > max_y(z).
  max_x(x) < min_x(z) is possible.
  min_y(x) > max_y(z)? We know min_y(x) <= min_y(y). Also max_y(y) < min_y(z) <= max_y(z).
  So min_y(x) <= min_y(y) <= max_y(y) < min_y(z) <= max_y(z). This implies min_y(x) < max_y(z).
  So min_y(x) > max_y(z) is impossible. Northwest is not possible.

- North: min_y(x) > max_y(z). Impossible, as min_y(x) < max_y(z) (shown above). North is not possible.

- Northeast: min_x(x) > max_x(z) AND min_y(x) > max_y(z).
  min_y(x) > max_y(z) is impossible. Northeast is not possible.

- East: min_x(x) > max_x(z).
  min_x(x) <= min_x(y). max_x(y) < min_x(z). min_x(z) <= max_x(z).
  min_x(x) vs max_x(z) is not directly constrained to be >.
  Example: y=[0,1]x[0,1], z=[5,6]x[5,6]. y is SW of z.
  x=[0,1]x[0,1] (x=y). min_x(x)=0 < max_x(z)=6. Not East.
  x=[-10,10]x[-10,10]. x contains y. min_x(x)=-10 < max_x(z)=6. Not East.
  min_x(x) > max_x(z) is impossible if min_x(x) <= min_x(y) and max_x(y) < min_x(z). If min_x(y) >= max_x(z), then max_x(y) >= max_x(z) is inconsistent with max_x(y) < min_x(z) if min_x(z) <= max_x(z).
  Let's formalize: min_x(x) > max_x(z). We know min_x(x) <= min_x(y). So we need min_x(y) > max_x(z).
  We also know max_x(y) < min_x(z).
  Can min_x(y) > max_x(z) AND max_x(y) < min_x(z)? Yes. Example: y=[5,6]x[...], z=[0,1]x[...]. y is East of z in x. But y must be Southwest of z. This means max_x(y) < min_x(z). Contradiction.
  So East is not possible.

- Southeast: min_x(x) > max_x(z) AND max_y(x) < min_y(z).
  min_x(x) > max_x(z) is impossible (shown above). Southeast is not possible.

- Bounding Box (MBR Overlap): [min_x(x), max_x(x)] intersects [min_x(z), max_x(z)] AND [min_y(x), max_y(x)] intersects [min_y(z), max_y(z)].
  Overlap in x: min_x(x) <= max_x(z) AND max_x(x) >= min_x(z).
  Overlap in y: min_y(x) <= max_y(z) AND max_y(x) >= min_y(z).
  Example: y=[-3,-2]x[-3,-2], z=[0,1]x[0,1]. x=[-10,10]x[-10,10]. x contains y.
  MBR(x) = [-10,10]x[-10,10]. MBR(z) = [0,1]x[0,1].
  x-intervals: [-10,10] intersects [0,1]. Yes.
  y-intervals: [-10,10] intersects [0,1]. Yes.
  MBR(x) overlaps MBR(z). Bounding Box (MBR Overlap) is possible.

Based on this interpretation, the possible relations between region x and region z are Southwest, West, South, and Bounding Box (interpreted as MBR Overlap).

The final answer is $\boxed{Southwest, West, South, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Bounding Box, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Bounding Box
