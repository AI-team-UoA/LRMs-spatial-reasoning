PROMPT: Let  South and  East be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  South of region y and region y is  East of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by composing the given relations: x is South of y (x Sy) and y is East of z (y Ez).

Let's consider the Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) of the regions and the definitions of the cardinal directions based on disjointness or overlap of MBRs along the axes.

- x Sy means that the MBR of x is entirely below the MBR of y (x_max_y < y_min_y). There is no constraint on the horizontal relationship between x and y.
- y Ez means that the MBR of y is entirely to the east of the MBR of z (y_min_x > z_max_x). There is no constraint on the vertical relationship between y and z.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. This depends on the relative positions of their MBRs along the x and y axes.

1.  **Horizontal relationship between x and z:**
    We know y_min_x > z_max_x. The MBR of y is to the east of the MBR of z.
    The horizontal position of x relative to y is not constrained by x Sy.
    -   x can be West of y horizontally (x_max_x < y_min_x). Since y_min_x > z_max_x, it is possible for x_max_x to be less than z_min_x (which is <= z_max_x). Thus, x can be West of z.
    -   x can overlap y horizontally (x_min_x <= y_max_x AND x_max_x >= y_min_x). It is possible for x to overlap z horizontally.
    -   x can be East of y horizontally (x_min_x > y_max_x). Since y_max_x > y_min_x > z_max_x, x_min_x can be greater than z_max_x. Thus, x can be East of z.
    So, horizontally, x can be West of z, overlap z, or be East of z.

2.  **Vertical relationship between x and z:**
    We know x_max_y < y_min_y. The MBR of x is below the MBR of y.
    The vertical position of y relative to z is not constrained by y Ez.
    -   y can be South of z vertically (y_max_y < z_min_y). Since x_max_y < y_min_y and y_min_y <= y_max_y, we have x_max_y < y_min_y <= y_max_y < z_min_y. This implies x_max_y < z_min_y, so x is South of z.
    -   y can overlap z vertically (y_min_y <= z_max_y AND y_max_y >= z_min_y). Since x_max_y < y_min_y, and y_min_y <= z_max_y, it is possible that x_max_y >= z_min_y (e.g., if y_min_y is within the vertical extent of z). Thus, x can overlap z vertically.
    -   y can be North of z vertically (y_min_y > z_max_y). Since x_max_y < y_min_y, and y_min_y can be arbitrarily high, it is possible for x_min_y to be greater than z_max_y. Thus, x can be North of z.
    So, vertically, x can be South of z, overlap z, or be North of z.

Since the horizontal and vertical relations are independent in this composition, any combination of the possible horizontal and vertical relations is possible. Assuming the standard definitions of cardinal directions based on disjointness along axes where applicable, and 'Bounding Box' for cases of overlap on both axes:

-   Horizontal West + Vertical South = Southwest
-   Horizontal West + Vertical Overlap = West
-   Horizontal West + Vertical North = Northwest
-   Horizontal Overlap + Vertical South = South
-   Horizontal Overlap + Vertical Overlap = Bounding Box
-   Horizontal Overlap + Vertical North = North
-   Horizontal East + Vertical South = Southeast
-   Horizontal East + Vertical Overlap = East
-   Horizontal East + Vertical North = Northeast

All 9 combinations are possible depending on the specific sizes and placements of regions x, y, and z satisfying the initial conditions.

The possible relations are: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
