PROMPT: Let  East and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Let y be at (0,0).
Since x is East of y, x has a positive x-coordinate.
Since y is North of z, z has a negative y-coordinate.

Let's consider bounding boxes.
Let $BB(R)$ denote the bounding box of region R.
$BB(R) = [min_x(R), max_x(R)] \times [min_y(R), max_y(R)]$.

Given:
1.  x is East of y: $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$ AND the y-intervals of x and y overlap ($max_y(x) > min_y(y)$ AND $min_y(x) < max_y(y)$).
2.  y is North of z: $min_y(y) > max_y(z)$ AND the x-intervals of y and z overlap ($max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ AND $min_x(y) < max_x(z)$).

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

From (1) and (2):
$min_x(x) > max_x(y)$
$max_y(x) > min_y(y)$ (overlap condition for x E y)
$min_y(y) > max_y(z)$
$min_y(x) < max_y(y)$ (overlap condition for x E y)

Combining inequalities:
$min_x(x) > max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ (from $min_x(x)>max_x(y)$ and $max_x(y)>min_x(z)$ which is part of y_x overlaps z_x)
$max_y(x) > min_y(y) > max_y(z)$

Let's check the possible relations for x relative to z:

-   **Northeast (NE):** $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$ AND $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$.
    We know $min_y(y) > max_y(z)$. From $min_y(x) < max_y(y)$ (overlap x_y, y_y), it is possible that $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$. Example: $max_y(z)=0$, $min_y(y)=1$, $max_y(y)=2$. x overlaps y on y-axis, e.g., $min_y(x)=1.1$, $max_y(x)=1.9$. Here $min_y(x)=1.1 > max_y(z)=0$. This part is possible.
    We need $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$. We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$. We also know $max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ (from y_x overlaps z_x). It is possible that $max_x(y) < max_x(z)$. Example: z=[0,5]x[-1,0], y=[1,2]x[1,2]. $max_x(z)=5, max_x(y)=2$. y N z. x E y, e.g., x=[3,4]x[1.1,1.9]. $min_x(x)=3, max_x(z)=5$. $3 > 5$ is false.
    However, it is also possible that $max_x(y) \ge max_x(z)$. Example: z=[0,1]x[-1,0], y=[0.5,1.5]x[1,2]. y N z. $max_x(z)=1, max_x(y)=1.5$. x E y, e.g., x=[1.6,2]x[1.1,1.9]. $min_x(x)=1.6, max_x(z)=1$. $1.6 > 1$. Yes.
    So, Northeast is possible.

-   **Southeast (SE):** $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$ AND $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$.
    We know $max_y(x) > min_y(y)$ (overlap x_y, y_y) and $min_y(y) > max_y(z)$. So $max_y(x) > max_y(z)$.
    Also $max_y(z) \ge min_y(z)$. Thus $max_y(x) > min_y(z)$.
    So $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$ is impossible. Southeast is not possible.

-   **Northwest (NW):** $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$ AND $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$.
    We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$ and $max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ (from y_x overlaps z_x). So $min_x(x) > min_x(z)$.
    Since $max_x(x) \ge min_x(x)$, we have $max_x(x) > min_x(z)$.
    So $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$ is impossible. Northwest is not possible.

-   **Southwest (SW):** $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$ AND $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$.
    Both conditions are impossible as shown above. Southwest is not possible.

-   **East (E):** The y-intervals of x and z overlap ($max_y(x) > min_y(z)$ AND $min_y(x) < max_y(z)$) AND $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$.
    Overlap y-intervals: $max_y(x) > min_y(y) > max_y(z) \ge min_y(z)$. So $max_y(x) > min_y(z)$ is always true.
    Need $min_y(x) < max_y(z)$. We know $min_y(x) < max_y(y)$. This is possible if $max_y(y)$ is small enough, e.g., $max_y(y)$ is only slightly greater than $max_y(z)$, and $min_y(x)$ is close to $max_y(y)$ and less than $max_y(z)$. Example: z=[0,1]x[-1,0], y=[0,1]x[0.1,0.5]. y N z. $max_y(z)=0, min_y(y)=0.1, max_y(y)=0.5$. x E y, x_y overlaps [0.1,0.5]. Let x=[2,3]x[-0.5,0.3]. $min_y(x)=-0.5, max_y(z)=0$. $-0.5 < 0$. Yes.
    Need $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$. We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$. This is possible if $max_x(y)$ is not larger than $max_x(z)$. Example: z=[0,1]x[-1,0], y=[0,1]x[0.1,0.5]. $max_x(z)=1, max_x(y)=1$. x E y, x_min_x > 1. e.g., x=[2,3]x[-0.5,0.3]. $min_x(x)=2, max_x(z)=1$. $2 > 1$. Yes.
    So, East is possible.

-   **West (W):** The y-intervals of x and z overlap ($max_y(x) > min_y(z)$ AND $min_y(x) < max_y(z)$) AND $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$.
    Overlap y-intervals is possible as shown for East.
    Need $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$. We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$ and $max_x(x) \ge min_x(x)$, so $max_x(x) > max_x(y)$.
    We also know $max_x(y) > min_x(z)$ (from y_x overlaps z_x).
    So $max_x(x) > max_x(y) > min_x(z)$. This means $max_x(x) > min_x(z)$.
    So $max_x(x) < min_x(z)$ is impossible. West is not possible.

-   **North (N):** The x-intervals of x and z overlap ($max_x(x) > min_x(z)$ AND $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$) AND $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$.
    Need $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$. We know $min_y(y) > max_y(z)$. It is possible that $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$ as shown for Northeast.
    Need x-intervals to overlap: $max_x(x) > min_x(z)$ AND $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$.
    We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y) > min_x(z)$. So $min_x(x) > min_x(z)$ is always true. $max_x(x) > min_x(z)$ is also always true.
    We need $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$. We know $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$. This is possible if $max_x(y)$ is small enough compared to $max_x(z)$, e.g., $max_x(y) < max_x(z)$. Example: z=[0,5]x[-1,0], y=[1,2]x[1,2]. y N z. $max_x(z)=5, max_x(y)=2$. x E y, x_min_x > 2. e.g., x=[2.1,2.5]x[1.1,1.9]. $min_x(x)=2.1, max_x(z)=5$. $2.1 < 5$. Yes.
    So, North is possible.

-   **South (S):** The x-intervals of x and z overlap ($max_x(x) > min_x(z)$ AND $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$) AND $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$.
    Overlap x-intervals is possible as shown for North.
    Need $max_y(x) < min_y(z)$. We showed this is impossible. South is not possible.

-   **Bounding Box:** This relation applies when the bounding boxes overlap but the relation is not one of the primary 8 directions. This requires overlap on both axes ($max_x(x) > min_x(z)$, $min_x(x) < max_x(z)$, $max_y(x) > min_y(z)$, $min_y(x) < max_y(z)$) but not fitting any of the 8 directional criteria (e.g., no containment).
    We showed that overlap on both axes is possible. Example configuration: z=[0,5]x[-1,0], y=[1,4]x[0.1,0.5], x=[4.1,4.9]x[-0.5,0.2].
    Check overlap: x=[4.1,4.9], z=[0,5]. Overlap. x=[-0.5,0.2], z=[-1,0]. Overlap.
    Check direction: x is not N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW of z for this example (verified in thought block).
    So, Bounding Box is possible.

Based on the analysis using standard bounding box relations, the possible relations between region x and region z are North, Northeast, East, and Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, East, Bounding Box}$.
