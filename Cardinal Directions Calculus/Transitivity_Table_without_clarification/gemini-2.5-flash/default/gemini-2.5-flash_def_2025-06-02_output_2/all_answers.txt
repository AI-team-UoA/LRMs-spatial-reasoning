For r1: North, r2: North, answer: North, Northeast, Northwest
For r1: North, r2:  Northeast, answer: Based on the given information:
1.  Region x is North of region y.
2.  Region y is Northeast of region z.

Let's represent the regions' positions using coordinates, assuming a standard coordinate system where North is the positive y-axis and East is the positive x-axis. We can use the centroid or a representative point for each region.

If region x is North of region y, this implies that the x-coordinate is the same or aligned, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of y. Let's use the point interpretation for simplicity and clarity, which is standard for pure cardinal relations.
Let (x_cx, x_cy), (y_cx, y_cy), and (z_cx, z_cy) be the coordinates of regions x, y, and z, respectively.

From (1): x is North of y means x_cx = y_cx and x_cy > y_cy.
From (2): y is Northeast of z means y_cx > z_cx and y_cy > z_cy (assuming a strict quadrant definition for Northeast).

Now, let's determine the relation between region x and region z.
We compare the coordinates of x to the coordinates of z.

From the relations:
x_cx = y_cx
y_cx > z_cx
Therefore, x_cx > z_cx. This means region x is located to the East of region z.

Also, from the relations:
x_cy > y_cy
y_cy > z_cy
Therefore, x_cy > z_cy. This means region x is located to the North of region z.

Since region x is located to the East (x_cx > z_cx) and to the North (x_cy > z_cy) of region z, the directional relation between x and z is Northeast.

This conclusion holds true under the standard point or centroid interpretation of cardinal directions, where North implies same x and greater y, and Northeast implies greater x and greater y.

Could any other directional relation from the list be possible?
-   North: Requires x_cx = z_cx. But we found x_cx > z_cx. Not possible.
-   East: Requires x_cy = z_cy. But we found x_cy > z_cy. Not possible.
-   South, Southeast, West, Northwest, Southwest all imply conditions on coordinates (like x_cy < z_cy or x_cx < z_cx) that contradict our findings (x_cy > z_cy and x_cx > z_cx).

So, based on the directional logic, only Northeast is a possible relation between x and z.

What about "Bounding Box"? The Bounding Box relation typically means the Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) of the two regions overlap. While the centroid of x is Northeast of the centroid of z, this does not preclude their MBRs from overlapping if the regions are sufficiently large. For example, if z is a very large region centered at the origin, and x is a smaller region whose centroid is slightly to the northeast of the origin, their MBRs could overlap. Thus, Bounding Box is a possible relation depending on the specific shapes and sizes of the regions, even though it's not a directional relation.

Therefore, the possible relations from the given list are Northeast and Bounding Box.

Northeast, Bounding Box
For r1: North, r2:  Southeast, answer: Northeast, Southeast, East
For r1: North, r2:  South, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1: North, r2:  East, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box

For r1: North, r2:  West, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1: North, r2:  Southwest, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1: North, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: North, Northeast, Northwest
For r1:  Northeast, r2: North, answer: North, Northeast, Northwest
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: The composition of the cardinal direction relation Northeast with itself yields the relation Northeast.

Let region y be Northeast of region z. This implies that region y is generally located in the positive x and positive y direction relative to region z.
Let region x be Northeast of region y. This implies that region x is generally located in the positive x and positive y direction relative to region y.

If we consider the relative position vector from z to y, it has positive x and y components.
If we consider the relative position vector from y to x, it also has positive x and y components.

The relative position vector from z to x is the sum of the vector from z to y and the vector from y to x.
Summing two vectors with positive x and y components results in a vector with positive x and y components.

Therefore, region x is located in the positive x and positive y direction relative to region z, which corresponds to the Northeast direction.

Under standard definitions of cardinal direction composition, the composition of Northeast and Northeast is Northeast.

The possible relation between region x and region z is Northeast.

Northeast
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Northeast
Southeast
East
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  South, answer: Northeast, Southeast, East
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  East, answer: Let z be at the origin (0,0).
The relation "y is East of z" implies that y is located generally to the right of z. In a common projection-based model for cardinal relations between regions, this means the x-projection of y is East of the x-projection of z, and the y-projection of y overlaps the y-projection of z.
Let $I_R^x = [min_x(R), max_x(R)]$ and $I_R^y = [min_y(R), max_y(R)]$ denote the x and y projections of region R.
$I_y^x$ is East of $I_z^x \implies min_x(y) > max_x(z)$.
$I_y^y$ overlaps $I_z^y \implies min_y(y) < max_y(z)$ AND $max_y(y) > min_y(z)$.

The relation "x is Northeast of y" implies that x is located generally to the upper-right of y. In the same projection-based model, this means the x-projection of x is East of the x-projection of y, and the y-projection of x is North of the y-projection of y.
$I_x^x$ is East of $I_y^x \implies min_x(x) > max_x(y)$.
$I_x^y$ is North of $I_y^y \implies min_y(x) > max_y(y)$.

Now we determine the possible relation between x and z by examining their projections.
For the x-axis:
We have $min_x(x) > max_x(y)$ and $min_x(y) > max_x(z)$.
Since $max_x(y) \ge min_x(y)$, it follows that $min_x(x) > min_x(y)$.
Combining $min_x(x) > min_x(y)$ and $min_x(y) > max_x(z)$, we get $min_x(x) > max_x(z)$.
This means the x-projection of x is always East of the x-projection of z.

For the y-axis:
We have $min_y(x) > max_y(y)$.
We also have $max_y(y) > min_y(z)$ (from y overlaps z on y-axis).
Combining these, we get $min_y(x) > max_y(y) > min_y(z)$, which implies $min_y(x) > min_y(z)$.

Now we consider the possible relationships between $I_x^y = [min_y(x), max_y(x)]$ and $I_z^y = [min_y(z), max_y(z)]$ given $min_y(x) > max_y(y)$ and $min_y(y) < max_y(z)$ and $max_y(y) > min_y(z)$.

Possible y-axis relations for $I_x^y$ relative to $I_z^y$:
1.  $I_x^y$ is North of $I_z^y$: This occurs if $min_y(x) > max_y(z)$.
    We know $min_y(x) > max_y(y)$. Can $min_y(x)$ also be greater than $max_y(z)$? Yes.
    Example: Let $I_z^y = [0, 1]$. Let $I_y^y = [0.2, 0.8]$ (overlaps $I_z^y$). $max_y(y)=0.8$.
    $min_y(x) > 0.8$. If we choose $min_y(x)=1.5$, then $min_y(x) > max_y(z)=1$.
    So $I_x^y$ can be North of $I_z^y$.

2.  $I_x^y$ Overlaps $I_z^y$: This occurs if $min_y(x) < max_y(z)$ and $max_y(x) > min_y(z)$.
    We know $min_y(x) > max_y(y)$. Can $min_y(x)$ be less than $max_y(z)$? Yes.
    Example: Let $I_z^y = [0, 1]$. Let $I_y^y = [-0.5, 0.1]$ (overlaps $I_z^y$). $max_y(y)=0.1$.
    $min_y(x) > 0.1$. If we choose $min_y(x)=0.2$, then $min_y(x) < max_y(z)=1$.
    We also need $max_y(x) > min_y(z)=0$. We can choose $max_y(x)=0.3$.
    $I_x^y=[0.2, 0.3]$. $min_y(x)=0.2>max_y(y)=0.1$. $I_y^y=[-0.5,0.1]$ overlaps $I_z^y=[0,1]$. $I_x^y=[0.2,0.3]$ overlaps $I_z^y=[0,1]$.
    So $I_x^y$ can overlap $I_z^y$.

3.  Other y-axis relations (South, Meets, Before, Contains, etc.): These can be ruled out as shown in the thought process, primarily because $min_y(x) > min_y(z)$.

Mapping projected relations to cardinal directions:
-   If $I_x^x$ is East of $I_z^x$ and $I_x^y$ is North of $I_z^y$, the relation is Northeast. This is possible.
-   If $I_x^x$ is East of $I_z^x$ and $I_x^y$ overlaps $I_z^y$, the relation is East. This is possible.

Therefore, based on the standard projection model for cardinal relations, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northeast and East.

The final answer is $\boxed{Northeast, East}$.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: North, Northeast, Northwest
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  West, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: Let the relation "Northeast of" mean that the region x is located in the quadrant where x-coordinates are greater and y-coordinates are greater, relative to region y. Similarly, "Southwest of" means x-coordinates are less and y-coordinates are less relative to the reference region. We will use a point or centroid model for simplicity, where each region is represented by a point (x_c, y_c).

Given:
1. Region x is Northeast of region y: x_c > y_c and x_y > y_y
2. Region y is Southwest of region z: y_c < z_c and y_y < z_y

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z, which depend on the signs of (x_c - z_c) and (x_y - z_y).

Let's analyze the differences:
x_c - z_c = (x_c - y_c) + (y_c - z_c)
From (1), (x_c - y_c) > 0. Let this difference be 'a' (a > 0).
From (2), (y_c - z_c) < 0. Let this difference be 'b' (b < 0).
So, x_c - z_c = a + b. Since 'a' is positive and 'b' is negative, (a + b) can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the magnitudes of 'a' and 'b'.

x_y - z_y = (x_y - y_y) + (y_y - z_y)
From (1), (x_y - y_y) > 0. Let this difference be 'c' (c > 0).
From (2), (y_y - z_y) < 0. Let this difference be 'd' (d < 0).
So, x_y - z_y = c + d. Since 'c' is positive and 'd' is negative, (c + d) can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the magnitudes of 'c' and 'd'.

Let's examine the possible combinations for the signs of (x_c - z_c, x_y - z_y):

1.  (+, +): x_c > z_c and x_y > z_y. This means x is East and North of z. Relation: Northeast.
    (Possible if a > |b| and c > |d|)
2.  (+, -): x_c > z_c and x_y < z_y. This means x is East and South of z. Relation: Southeast.
    (Possible if a > |b| and c < |d|)
3.  (-, +): x_c < z_c and x_y > z_y. This means x is West and North of z. Relation: Northwest.
    (Possible if a < |b| and c > |d|)
4.  (-, -): x_c < z_c and x_y < z_y. This means x is West and South of z. Relation: Southwest.
    (Possible if a < |b| and c < |d|)
5.  (0, +): x_c = z_c and x_y > z_y. This means x is North of z. Relation: North.
    (Possible if a = |b| and c > |d|)
6.  (0, -): x_c = z_c and x_y < z_y. This means x is South of z. Relation: South.
    (Possible if a = |b| and c < |d|)
7.  (+, 0): x_c > z_c and x_y = z_y. This means x is East of z. Relation: East.
    (Possible if a > |b| and c = |d|)
8.  (-, 0): x_c < z_c and x_y = z_y. This means x is West of z. Relation: West.
    (Possible if a < |b| and c = |d|)
9.  (0, 0): x_c = z_c and x_y = z_y. This means x and z are at the same location (x=z). This relation is not covered by the 8 cardinal directions. Based on the provided options, "Bounding Box" is likely intended to cover cases not described by the 8 directional relations, such as equality or overlap (if regions were considered instead of points).
    (Possible if a = |b| and c = |d|)

Since all 8 cardinal directions and the case where x=z (possibly mapping to Bounding Box) are possible depending on the specific positions of x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions, the possible relations between region x and region z could be any of the listed options.

The possible relations are: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Northeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Let the relation "x is Northeast of y" imply that the minimal bounding box of x (BB(x)) is positioned in the Northeast direction relative to the minimal bounding box of y (BB(y)). This typically means that the minimum x-coordinate of BB(x) is greater than or equal to the maximum x-coordinate of BB(y), and the minimum y-coordinate of BB(x) is greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of BB(y), with at least one of these inequalities being strict for a non-touching relation, or allowing equality for adjacency.

The relation "y is Bounding Box of z" means that the region y is the minimal bounding box of region z. This implies that BB(y) is identical to BB(z), and region z is entirely contained within region y.

Given:
1. x is Northeast of y (x NE y)
2. y is Bounding Box of z (y BB z)

From (2), BB(y) = BB(z).
Substitute this into (1): x is Northeast of BB(z).

This means that BB(x) is positioned in the Northeast direction relative to BB(z). Let's consider the possible relative positions of BB(x) and BB(z) that are consistent with "BB(x) is Northeast of BB(z)" under a common MBR-based spatial relation model that includes boundary touching:

- **Strict Northeast:** BB(x) is entirely to the East and entirely to the North of BB(z). This implies `min_x(x) > max_x(z)` and `min_y(x) > max_y(z)`. If BB(x) is strictly Northeast of BB(z), and z is contained within BB(z), then x is strictly Northeast of z. Thus, **Northeast** is a possible relation.

- **North-Adjacency on the East side:** BB(x) is North of BB(z) and touches its East boundary. This implies `min_x(x) = max_x(z)` and `min_y(x) > max_y(z)`. While strictly North, some models consider this within the broader scope of "Northeast" if it includes adjacency on the North or East boundaries. If BB(x) is North of BB(z), then x is North of z (since z is entirely within BB(z), the maximum y of z is less than or equal to the maximum y of BB(z), which is less than the minimum y of x). Thus, **North** is a possible relation.

- **East-Adjacency on the North side:** BB(x) is East of BB(z) and touches its North boundary. This implies `min_x(x) > max_x(z)` and `min_y(x) = max_y(z)`. Similar to the above, some models include this in "Northeast". If BB(x) is East of BB(z), then x is East of z (since z is entirely within BB(z), the maximum x of z is less than or equal to the maximum x of BB(z), which is less than the minimum x of x). Thus, **East** is a possible relation.

- **Northeast-Adjacency (corner touch):** BB(x) touches the Northeast corner of BB(z). This implies `min_x(x) = max_x(z)` and `min_y(x) = max_y(z)`. This is a boundary case of the Northeast relation. If BB(x) is NE-adjacent to BB(z), then x is NE-adjacent to z (as x and z are contained within their respective BBs and cannot extend beyond the touching point in the direction of the other region). This falls under the **Northeast** relation.

In all these cases where BB(x) is disjoint or touches BB(z) on the North or East boundaries, x is disjoint from z because z is contained within BB(z).

Could any other relations be possible?
If BB(x) is in a Northeast position relative to BB(z), it means BB(x) is generally located "above and to the right" of BB(z). This spatial arrangement rules out BB(x) being primarily located to the South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Southeast of BB(z). Therefore, x cannot be South, Southwest, West, Northwest, or Southeast of z.

The "Bounding Box" relation describes y in terms of z; it cannot be a relation between x and z in this context.

Some definitions of cardinal directions between regions allow for overlap. However, given that Overlap is not listed as a possible answer, we assume the intended interpretation of the possible relations is based on disjoint or touching regions, corresponding to the standard 8 directional relations. If overlap were possible, the set of answers would likely include "Overlap".

Based on the analysis of the relative positions of the bounding boxes consistent with "Northeast" and the provided list of possible answers, the possible relations between region x and region z are North, East, and Northeast.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, East}$.
For r1:  Southeast, r2: North, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are all the options provided.

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northeast, answer: Northeast, Southeast, Bounding Box
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southeast, answer: Southeast
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  South, answer: East, Southeast, Northeast
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  East, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z could be Northeast, East, or Southeast.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Northwest, answer: The given relations are:
1. Region x is Southeast of region y (x SE y).
2. Region y is Northwest of region z (y NW z).

The relation "y is Northwest of z" is equivalent to "z is Southeast of y" (z SE y).

So, we have:
1. x is Southeast of y.
2. z is Southeast of y.

This means that both region x and region z are located in the Southeast direction relative to region y.
If we consider y as the origin point (0,0), then region x must be predominantly in the (+x, -y) quadrant, and region z must also be predominantly in the (+x, -y) quadrant.

Let's consider the possible relative positions of x and z when both are constrained to be in the Southeast quadrant relative to y. Since both regions can occupy any part of the Southeast quadrant (they could be close to y or far from y), their relative positions are not strictly determined.

We can show that any of the provided relations is possible by constructing examples:

Let y be a point at (0,0). The Southeast quadrant relative to y is the region where x-coordinates are positive and y-coordinates are negative (x > 0, y < 0).

1.  **Northeast**: Let x = (3, -1) and z = (1, -3).
    -   x is SE of y (3 > 0, -1 < 0).
    -   z is SE of y (1 > 0, -3 < 0).
    -   Comparing x and z: (3, -1) relative to (1, -3). 3 > 1 (East), -1 > -3 (North). So, x is Northeast of z.

2.  **Southeast**: Let x = (3, -3) and z = (1, -1).
    -   x is SE of y (3 > 0, -3 < 0).
    -   z is SE of y (1 > 0, -1 < 0).
    -   Comparing x and z: (3, -3) relative to (1, -1). 3 > 1 (East), -3 < -1 (South). So, x is Southeast of z.

3.  **Northwest**: Let x = (1, -1) and z = (3, -3).
    -   x is SE of y (1 > 0, -1 < 0).
    -   z is SE of y (3 > 0, -3 < 0).
    -   Comparing x and z: (1, -1) relative to (3, -3). 1 < 3 (West), -1 > -3 (North). So, x is Northwest of z.

4.  **Southwest**: Let x = (1, -3) and z = (3, -1).
    -   x is SE of y (1 > 0, -3 < 0).
    -   z is SE of y (3 > 0, -1 < 0).
    -   Comparing x and z: (1, -3) relative to (3, -1). 1 < 3 (West), -3 < -1 (South). So, x is Southwest of z.

5.  **East**: Let x = (3, -2) and z = (1, -2).
    -   x is SE of y (3 > 0, -2 < 0).
    -   z is SE of y (1 > 0, -2 < 0).
    -   Comparing x and z: (3, -2) relative to (1, -2). 3 > 1 (East), -2 = -2 (same vertical level). So, x is East of z.

6.  **West**: Let x = (1, -2) and z = (3, -2).
    -   x is SE of y (1 > 0, -2 < 0).
    -   z is SE of y (3 > 0, -2 < 0).
    -   Comparing x and z: (1, -2) relative to (3, -2). 1 < 3 (West), -2 = -2 (same vertical level). So, x is West of z.

7.  **North**: Let x = (2, -1) and z = (2, -3).
    -   x is SE of y (2 > 0, -1 < 0).
    -   z is SE of y (2 > 0, -3 < 0).
    -   Comparing x and z: (2, -1) relative to (2, -3). 2 = 2 (same horizontal level), -1 > -3 (North). So, x is North of z.

8.  **South**: Let x = (2, -3) and z = (2, -1).
    -   x is SE of y (2 > 0, -3 < 0).
    -   z is SE of y (2 > 0, -1 < 0).
    -   Comparing x and z: (2, -3) relative to (2, -1). 2 = 2 (same horizontal level), -3 < -1 (South). So, x is South of z.

9.  **Bounding Box**: Let regions be defined by their bounding boxes.
    Let y be a point at (0,0).
    Let x have bounding box [1, 3] x [-3, -1]. This box is in the SE quadrant of y.
    Let z have bounding box [2, 4] x [-4, -2]. This box is in the SE quadrant of y.
    -   Comparing x and z bounding boxes:
        -   x-intervals: [1, 3] and [2, 4]. They overlap ([2, 3]).
        -   y-intervals: [-3, -1] and [-4, -2]. They overlap ([-3, -2]).
    Since both x and y intervals overlap, the bounding boxes of x and z overlap. In this case, none of the pure cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) or diagonal directions apply strictly based on bounding box disjointness. Thus, the relation is Bounding Box.

Since we have found examples where each of the listed relations holds, all of them are possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z are North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  West, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z could be: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Southwest, answer: Southeast, South, Southwest
For r1:  Southeast, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: Southeast, South, East
For r1:  South, r2: North, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  South, r2:  Northeast, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z could be Northeast, East, Southeast, or Bounding Box.

Here's why:
Let's represent the regions conceptually on a 2D plane. Assume region z is at the origin (0,0).

1.  **y is Northeast of z**: This means region y is located generally in the upper-right direction from region z. If we consider bounding boxes, the minimum x-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z, and the minimum y-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum y-coordinate of z (for a strict definition). If we consider centroids, the centroid of y is in the Northeast quadrant relative to the centroid of z. If we consider areas, the majority of y's area is in the Northeast direction from z. Let's assume y is in the region x > 0 and y > 0 relative to z.

2.  **x is South of y**: This means region x is located generally in the downward direction from region y. If we consider bounding boxes, the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of y (for a strict definition). If we consider centroids, the centroid of x is South of the centroid of y. If we consider areas, the majority of x's area is in the South direction from y. This implies that x's horizontal position is generally aligned with y's horizontal position, but x is lower vertically.

Combining these:
-   Since y is East of z (part of being Northeast), and x is horizontally aligned with y, x must also be generally East of z. This rules out relations like West, Northwest, and Southwest. It also rules out North and South as the primary relation, as x has a significant horizontal offset to the East relative to z.
-   Since x is South of y, and y is North of z (part of being Northeast), the vertical position of x relative to z depends on how far South x is from y compared to how far North y is from z.
    -   If x is only slightly South of a y that is very North of z, x could still be North or Northeast of z vertically. Since x is also East of z horizontally, this could result in a **Northeast** relation.
    -   If x is South of y such that x's vertical position aligns horizontally with z's vertical position (e.g., same y-range or centroid y-coordinate), and x is horizontally East of z, this could result in an **East** relation.
    -   If x is significantly South of y, potentially even below z's vertical position, and x is horizontally East of z, this could result in a **Southeast** relation.

These possibilities (Northeast, East, Southeast) hold under strict interpretations (like disjoint bounding boxes) or interpretations based on centroids or general regions.

Furthermore, spatial relations can involve overlap. If the input relations "South" and "Northeast" allow for overlapping regions (e.g., based on how the majority of the area is oriented), then it's possible that region x and region z could significantly overlap.
For example, if y overlaps z but its centroid is NE, and x overlaps y but its centroid is South, the resulting position of x relative to z could involve substantial overlap in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. When two regions significantly overlap in both dimensions without one being clearly in a specific cardinal direction from the other, the relation is often described as **Bounding Box** (or simply Overlap or Intersects, but Bounding Box is given as an option).

Therefore, considering various interpretations of spatial relations, the possible relations between region x and region z are Northeast, East, Southeast, and Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{Northeast, East, Southeast, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  South, r2:  Southeast, answer: Let z be the origin (0,0).
Since region y is Southeast of region z, y must be in the Southeast quadrant relative to z. This means the x-coordinate of y (y_x) is positive and the y-coordinate of y (y_y) is negative. So, y = (y_x, y_y) with y_x > 0 and y_y < 0.

Since region x is South of region y, x must be located below y in the y-direction. The x-coordinate of x (x_x) must be aligned with y's x-coordinate within the definition of 'South of', and the y-coordinate of x (x_y) must be less than y's y-coordinate.
So, x = (x_x, x_y) with x_y < y_y.

Since y_y < 0 and x_y < y_y, it is guaranteed that x_y is negative (x_y < 0). This means region x is always below the horizontal axis passing through z. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are restricted to South, Southeast, Southwest, and potentially West (if x_y is very close to 0, which is not the case here) or Bounding Box. Relations North, Northeast, East, and Northwest are impossible.

Now, let's consider the x-coordinate of x (x_x) relative to z's x-coordinate (0).
The relation "x is South of y" typically means that the horizontal position of x is aligned with y, possibly within a certain range. Let's consider different interpretations:

1.  Strict South: x_x = y_x.
    Since y_x > 0 (as y is SE of z), it follows that x_x > 0.
    With x_x > 0 and x_y < 0, x is in the Southeast quadrant relative to z.
    So, Southeast is a possible relation.

2.  South within a vertical cone: x_x is within a certain horizontal range around y_x, and x_y < y_y. A common model defines 'South of y' such that the angle of the vector from y to x falls within a sector (e.g., [-135, -45] degrees relative to the positive x-axis). This implies x_y - y_y < 0 and the horizontal displacement |x_x - y_x| is related to the vertical displacement |x_y - y_y|. For a 90-degree South cone (45 degrees to either side of the purely vertical South line), |x_x - y_x| <= |x_y - y_y|. Let diff_y = y_y - x_y > 0. Then |x_x - y_x| <= diff_y, which means y_x - diff_y <= x_x <= y_x + diff_y.
    Since y_x > 0, and diff_y > 0 can be large, x_x can be:
    *   Positive: If y_x is large or diff_y is small. Example: z=(0,0), y=(10, -1), x_y=-5 (diff_y=4). 10-4 <= x_x <= 10+4, so 6 <= x_x <= 14. x=(6, -5) has x_x>0, x_y<0 -> Southeast.
    *   Zero: If y_x is comparable to diff_y. Example: z=(0,0), y=(5, -5), x_y=-10 (diff_y=5). 5-5 <= x_x <= 5+5, so 0 <= x_x <= 10. x=(0, -10) has x_x=0, x_y<0 -> South.
    *   Negative: If y_x is small and diff_y is large. Example: z=(0,0), y=(1, -1), x_y=-10 (diff_y=9). 1-9 <= x_x <= 1+9, so -8 <= x_x <= 10. x=(-8, -10) has x_x<0, x_y<0 -> Southwest.

Thus, depending on the specific relative positions of x, y, and z consistent with the given relations, region x could be Southeast of z, South of z, or Southwest of z.

The possible relations between region x and region z from the provided list are Southeast, South, and Southwest. The "Bounding Box" option is usually related to spatial extent and overlap properties, but the composition of directional relations typically results in another directional relation, assuming point-like regions or consistent directional relationships between extended regions. Given the other options are specific directions, S, SE, SW are the derived possibilities.

The final answer is $\boxed{South, Southeast, Southwest}$.
For r1:  South, r2:  South, answer: South, Southeast, Southwest
For r1:  South, r2:  East, answer: Let's analyze the given information:
1. Region x is South of region y. This means that the bounding box of x is below the bounding box of y. Specifically, the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than the minimum y-coordinate of y (x_ymax < y_ymin).
2. Region y is East of region z. This means that the bounding box of y is to the east of the bounding box of z. Specifically, the minimum x-coordinate of y is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z (y_xmin > z_xmax).

We want to determine the possible relations between region x and region z from the given list: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

Let's consider the possible relative positions of the bounding boxes based on the constraints.

Imagine z is located somewhere. y must be located entirely to the East of z. x must be located entirely to the South of y.

  z [ ] ----> y [ ]
            |
            |
            v
          x [ ]

The relationship between x and z depends on the precise location and extent of the regions, within the constraints.

Let's test each possible relation by attempting to construct a scenario where it holds:

1.  **Southeast:** x is South of z AND x is East of z.
    *   Can x be South of z? (x_ymax < z_ymin) Yes, if y is South of z and x is just below y. Ex: z=[0,1]x[10,11], y=[2,3]x[5,6], x=[2,3]x[0,1].
        x_ymax=1 < z_ymin=10 (South of z).
        y_xmin=2 > z_xmax=1 (y East of z).
        x_ymax=1 < y_ymin=5 (x South of y). This is a valid configuration.
    *   Can x be East of z? (x_xmin > z_xmax) Yes, if x is vertically aligned with or East of y, and y is East of z. Ex: z=[0,1]x[0,1], y=[2,3]x[0,1], x=[2,3]x[-2,-1].
        x_xmin=2 > z_xmax=1 (East of z).
        y_xmin=2 > z_xmax=1 (y East of z).
        x_ymax=-1 < y_ymin=0 (x South of y). This is a valid configuration.
    *   If both conditions can hold simultaneously, Southeast is possible. Ex: z=[0,1]x[10,11], y=[2,3]x[5,6], x=[2,3]x[0,1]. x is South and East of z. Southeast is possible.

2.  **Southwest:** x is South of z AND x is West of z.
    *   Can x be West of z? (x_xmax < z_xmin) Yes, if x is sufficiently West of y, and y is only slightly East of z. Ex: z=[10,11]x[0,1], y=[12,13]x[0,1], x=[5,6]x[-2,-1].
        x_xmax=6 < z_xmin=10 (West of z).
        y_xmin=12 > z_xmax=11 (y East of z).
        x_ymax=-1 < y_ymin=0 (x South of y). This is a valid configuration where x is Southwest of z (x is South of z as well, x_ymax=-1 < z_ymin=0). Southwest is possible.

3.  **Northeast:** x is North of z AND x is East of z.
    *   Can x be North of z? (x_ymin > z_ymax) Yes, if y is sufficiently North of z and x is just below y. Ex: z=[0,1]x[0,1], y=[2,3]x[10,11], x=[2,3]x[5,6].
        x_ymin=5 > z_ymax=1 (North of z).
        y_xmin=2 > z_xmax=1 (y East of z).
        x_ymax=6 < y_ymin=10 (x South of y). This is a valid configuration where x is Northeast of z (x is East of z as well, x_xmin=2 > z_xmax=1). Northeast is possible.

4.  **Northwest:** x is North of z AND x is West of z.
    *   Can x be West of z? (x_xmax < z_xmin) Yes, demonstrated in Southwest case.
    *   Can x be North of z? (x_ymin > z_ymax) Yes, demonstrated in Northeast case.
    *   Can both hold? Ex: z=[10,11]x[0,1], y=[20,21]x[10,11], x=[5,6]x[5,6].
        x_xmax=6 < z_xmin=10 (West of z).
        x_ymin=5 > z_ymax=1 (North of z).
        y_xmin=20 > z_xmax=11 (y East of z).
        x_ymax=6 < y_ymin=10 (x South of y). This is a valid configuration where x is Northwest of z. Northwest is possible.

5.  **South:** x is South of z (x_ymax < z_ymin) and horizontally overlaps z (or is horizontally aligned, depending on definition). Can this happen without being Southeast or Southwest? Yes, if the x-ranges overlap: (x_xmin < z_xmax AND x_xmax > z_xmin).
    *   Ex: z=[10,20]x[20,30], y=[30,40]x[5,15], x=[10,20]x[0,3].
        x_ymax=3 < z_ymin=20 (South of z).
        x_xmin=10, x_xmax=20; z_xmin=10, z_xmax=20. Horizontal overlap.
        y_xmin=30 > z_xmax=20 (y East of z).
        x_ymax=3 < y_ymin=5 (x South of y). This is valid. If "South" includes horizontal overlap, South is possible.

6.  **North:** x is North of z (x_ymin > z_ymax) and horizontally overlaps z.
    *   Ex: z=[10,20]x[0,10], y=[30,40]x[20,30], x=[10,20]x[15,18].
        x_ymin=15 > z_ymax=10 (North of z).
        x_xmin=10, x_xmax=20; z_xmin=10, z_xmax=20. Horizontal overlap.
        y_xmin=30 > z_xmax=20 (y East of z).
        x_ymax=18 < y_ymin=20 (x South of y). This is valid. If "North" includes horizontal overlap, North is possible.

7.  **East:** x is East of z (x_xmin > z_xmax) and vertically overlaps z.
    *   Ex: z=[0,1]x[0,10], y=[2,3]x[5,15], x=[2,3]x[0,3].
        x_xmin=2 > z_xmax=1 (East of z).
        x_ymin=0, x_ymax=3; z_ymin=0, z_ymax=10. Vertical overlap.
        y_xmin=2 > z_xmax=1 (y East of z).
        x_ymax=3 < y_ymin=5 (x South of y). This is valid. If "East" includes vertical overlap, East is possible.

8.  **West:** x is West of z (x_xmax < z_xmin) and vertically overlaps z.
    *   Ex: z=[10,11]x[0,10], y=[12,13]x[5,15], x=[5,6]x[0,3].
        x_xmax=6 < z_xmin=10 (West of z).
        x_ymin=0, x_ymax=3; z_ymin=0, z_ymax=10. Vertical overlap.
        y_xmin=12 > z_xmax=11 (y East of z).
        x_ymax=3 < y_ymin=5 (x South of y). This is valid. If "West" includes vertical overlap, West is possible.

9.  **Bounding Box:** x and z overlap, but none of the 8 strict cardinal relations hold.
    *   This happens when there is both horizontal and vertical overlap, but x is not strictly North/South/East/West/NE/NW/SE/SW of z.
    *   Ex: z=[0,10]x[0,10], y=[15,25]x[5,15], x=[5,15]x[5,15]. As shown in thought process, x is South of y and y is East of z, and x and z have both horizontal and vertical overlap. None of the 8 strict relations apply. Bounding Box is possible.

Since we have demonstrated a configuration for each of the 9 relations in the list, all of them are possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  South, r2:  Northwest, answer: Based on the analysis where region y is at (0,0), region x is in the half-plane y < 0, and region z is in the quadrant x > 0 and y < 0:
- The vector from z to x is (x_x - x_z, y_x - y_z).
- x_x can be positive, negative, or zero. x_z must be positive. Thus, x_x - x_z can be positive, negative, or zero.
- y_x must be negative. y_z must be negative. Thus, y_x - y_z can be positive (if y_x > y_z), negative (if y_x < y_z), or zero (if y_x = y_z).
- Since any combination of signs (and zero) for the components of the vector from z to x is possible (excluding (0,0) as x and z are distinct), any of the 8 cardinal or intercardinal directions can be the relation between x and z.
- If regions are considered, overlap between x and z is possible. If the option "Bounding Box" represents cases of overlap or other complex spatial relations not covered by the 8 directional terms, then it is also a possible relation.

Considering all standard cardinal direction possibilities and the potential for overlap (represented by "Bounding Box"), the possible relations are all items in the provided list.

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  South, r2:  West, answer: Southwest, South, Southeast, West, East, Northwest, North, Northeast, Bounding Box
For r1:  South, r2:  Southwest, answer: Southwest, South, Southeast
For r1:  South, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: South, Southwest, Southeast
For r1:  East, r2: North, answer: Here are the possible relations between region x and region z:

North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  East, r2:  Northeast, answer: Northeast, Southeast, East
For r1:  East, r2:  Southeast, answer: Let $z$ be at the origin (0,0).
Region $y$ is Southeast of region $z$. Using a common interpretation where regions are represented by points or the relation refers to the relative position of centroids, this means the vector from $z$ to $y$ lies within the Southeast cone. Let $\theta_y$ be the angle of the vector from $z$ to $y$ relative to the positive x-axis (East). The Southeast cone typically covers angles in the range $(-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$. So, $\theta_y \in (-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$. Let $y = (r_y \cos \theta_y, r_y \sin \theta_y)$ for some $r_y > 0$. Note that $\cos \theta_y > 0$ and $\sin \theta_y < 0$ for $\theta_y$ in this range.

Region $x$ is East of region $y$. Similarly, the vector from $y$ to $x$ lies within the East cone. Let $\theta_{xy}$ be the angle of the vector from $y$ to $x$ relative to the positive x-axis. The East cone typically covers angles in the range $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$. So, $\theta_{xy} \in (-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$. Let the vector from $y$ to $x$ be $(r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy}, r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy})$ for some $r_{xy} > 0$. Note that $\cos \theta_{xy} > 0$ for $\theta_{xy}$ in this range, while $\sin \theta_{xy}$ can be positive, negative, or zero.

The coordinates of $x$ relative to $z$ are found by vector addition: $x = z + (y-z) + (x-y)$. If $z=(0,0)$, then the vector from $z$ to $x$ is simply the sum of the vector from $z$ to $y$ and the vector from $y$ to $x$.
$x = (r_y \cos \theta_y + r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy}, r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy})$.

We need to find the possible direction of $x$ relative to $z$. This is given by the angle $\theta_x = \operatorname{atan2}(r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}, r_y \cos \theta_y + r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy})$.

Let's analyze the possible range of this angle.
The x-coordinate of $x$ is $x_x = r_y \cos \theta_y + r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy}$. Since $r_y > 0, r_{xy} > 0$, $\cos \theta_y > 0$ (in $(-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$) and $\cos \theta_{xy} > 0$ (in $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$), $x_x$ is always positive. This means $x$ must lie in the right half-plane relative to $z$, ruling out West, Southwest, Northwest, and South (unless on the positive y-axis or origin, but $x_x > 0$). Possible relations are North, Northeast, East, Southeast.

The y-coordinate of $x$ is $x_y = r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}$.
$\sin \theta_y \in (\sin(-67.5^\circ), \sin(-22.5^\circ)) \approx (-0.924, -0.383)$.
$\sin \theta_{xy} \in (\sin(-22.5^\circ), \sin(22.5^\circ)) \approx (-0.383, 0.383)$.

If $r_{xy}$ is very small compared to $r_y$, $x$ is close to $y$. Since $y$ is Southeast of $z$, $x$ will also be Southeast of $z$. This shows Southeast is a possible relation.

If $r_{xy}$ is very large compared to $r_y$, the position of $x$ is dominated by the vector from $y$ to $x$. The vector from $z$ to $x$ is approximately equal to the vector from $y$ to $x$. The angle of this vector is $\theta_{xy}$, which is in $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$. This range corresponds to the East cone. This shows East is a possible relation.

Now let's check if other directions (N, NE) are possible.
The angle $\theta_x = \operatorname{atan2}(x_y, x_x)$. The range of $\operatorname{atan2}(Y, X)$ for $X>0$ is $(-90^\circ, 90^\circ)$. So N, S, W, SW, NW, Bounding Box are ruled out (S is on the boundary -90, which is approached only if $x_x \to 0$, but $x_x$ is always positive). We only need to check if angles in the N ($45^\circ, 135^\circ$) or NE ($22.5^\circ, 67.5^\circ$) cones are possible. Since $x_x > 0$, only the range $(0, 90^\circ)$ needs checking, which covers N and NE.

For the angle $\theta_x$ to be in the NE cone, we need $x_y > 0$ and $x_y/x_x > \tan(22.5^\circ) \approx 0.414$.
$x_y = r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}$. $\sin \theta_y$ is always negative. $\sin \theta_{xy}$ can be positive. $x_y$ can be positive if $r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}$ is positive and large enough to overcome $r_y |\sin \theta_y|$. This requires $\theta_{xy} > 0$ and $r_{xy}$ large relative to $r_y$.
If $r_{xy}$ is large relative to $r_y$, the angle $\theta_x \approx \theta_{xy} \in (-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$. The maximum angle here approaches $22.5^\circ$. This angle is the boundary between the East and Northeast cones. Based on the open cone definition, this boundary is not included in NE. Based on the closed cone definition, this boundary is included in E or NE depending on convention. However, the maximum angle in the open interval $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$ is less than $22.5^\circ$. So strictly NE (angle > 22.5) does not seem possible with the open cone definition.

Formal analysis of the range of $\operatorname{atan2}(r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}, r_y \cos \theta_y + r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy})$ for $\theta_y \in (-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$ and $\theta_{xy} \in (-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$ shows the resulting angle is in the range $(-67.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$.
This range covers the Southeast cone $(-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$ and the East cone $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$.
It does not overlap with the North, Northeast, South, Southwest, West, or Northwest cones.

Bounding Box relation is not possible because $x_x > 0$, meaning $x$ is always to the East of $z$ (or on the boundary if $z$ spans x=0), so their bounding boxes cannot overlap in the x-dimension if $z$ has any width or is at the origin.

The possible relations are East and Southeast.

The final answer is $\boxed{East, Southeast}$.
For r1:  East, r2:  South, answer: Let the minimum bounding box of a region $R$ be $[R_x^{min}, R_x^{max}] \times [R_y^{min}, R_y^{max}]$.
The cardinal direction relations between two regions $A$ and $B$ are typically defined based on their minimum bounding boxes. For the list of relations provided, the standard definitions are:
- $A$ is East of $B$ if $A_x^{min} > B_x^{max}$ and their y-ranges overlap ($A_y^{min} \le B_y^{max}$ and $A_y^{max} \ge B_y^{min}$).
- $A$ is South of $B$ if $A_y^{max} < B_y^{min}$ and their x-ranges overlap ($A_x^{min} \le B_x^{max}$ and $A_x^{max} \ge B_x^{min}$).
- $A$ is Southeast of $B$ if $A_x^{min} > B_x^{max}$ and $A_y^{max} < B_y^{min}$.
- North, Northeast, Northwest, West, Southwest are defined similarly by separation in one or both dimensions.
- Bounding Box relation covers cases where the minimum bounding boxes overlap but are not in one of the strictly separated cardinal positions (i.e., they overlap in both the x and y dimensions, or one is contained within the other). This occurs if $A_x^{min} \le B_x^{max}$ and $A_x^{max} \ge B_x^{min}$ AND $A_y^{min} \le B_y^{max}$ and $A_y^{max} \ge B_y^{min}$.

Given:
1) Region $x$ is East of region $y$:
   $x_x^{min} > y_x^{max}$
   $x_y^{min} \le y_y^{max}$ and $x_y^{max} \ge y_y^{min}$ (y-ranges overlap)

2) Region $y$ is South of region $z$:
   $y_y^{max} < z_y^{min}$
   $y_x^{min} \le z_x^{max}$ and $y_x^{max} \ge z_x^{min}$ (x-ranges overlap)

We want to find the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$. Let's examine the separation in x and y dimensions between $x$ and $z$.

Relation in x-dimension between $x$ and $z$:
- Is $x$ East of $z$? ($x_x^{min} > z_x^{max}$)
  We know $x_x^{min} > y_x^{max}$. From the overlap condition for $y$ and $z$ in x, we know $y_x^{max} \ge z_x^{min}$ is possible. If we choose $y$ such that $y_x^{max} > z_x^{max}$, and $x$ is just East of $y$, then $x$ will be East of $z$.
  Example: $z_x=[0,10]$, $y_x=[15,20]$ (violates y-z overlap). A valid example: $z_x=[0,10]$, $y_x=[5,15]$ (overlaps z), $x_x=[20,30]$ (East of y). Then $x_x^{min}=20 > z_x^{max}=10$. Yes, $x$ can be East of $z$.
- Is $x$ West of $z$? ($x_x^{max} < z_x^{min}$)
  We know $x_x^{max} > x_x^{min} > y_x^{max}$. From $y$ South of $z$, $y_x^{max} \ge z_x^{min}$ is possible. Thus $x_x^{min} > y_x^{max} \ge z_x^{min}$, which implies $x_x^{min} > z_x^{min}$. Since $x_x^{max} \ge x_x^{min}$, $x_x^{max} > z_x^{min}$. Thus $x$ cannot be West of $z$.
- Do $x$ and $z$ overlap in x? ($x_x^{min} \le z_x^{max}$ and $x_x^{max} \ge z_x^{min}$)
  We showed $x_x^{max} \ge z_x^{min}$ is always true. We need to check if $x_x^{min} \le z_x^{max}$ is possible. We know $x_x^{min} > y_x^{max}$. If we choose $y$ such that $y_x^{max} \le z_x^{max}$ (which is possible as y overlaps z in x), and $x_x^{min}$ is only slightly greater than $y_x^{max}$, it is possible that $x_x^{min} \le z_x^{max}$.
  Example: $z_x=[0,10]$, $y_x=[2,8]$ (overlaps z), $x_x=[9,15]$ (East of y). Then $x_x^{min}=9 \le z_x^{max}=10$. Yes, $x$ can overlap $z$ in x.

So, in the x-dimension, $x$ can be East of $z$ or overlap with $z$.

Relation in y-dimension between $x$ and $z$:
- Is $x$ South of $z$? ($x_y^{max} < z_y^{min}$)
  We know $y_y^{max} < z_y^{min}$. From the overlap condition for $x$ and $y$ in y, $x_y^{max} \ge y_y^{min}$ is possible. If we choose $y$ such that $y_y^{min}$ is close to $y_y^{max}$, and $x$ overlaps $y$ such that $x_y^{max}$ is close to $y_y^{max}$, then $x_y^{max}$ can be less than $z_y^{min}$.
  Example: $z_y=[100,110]$, $y_y=[0,10]$ (South of z), $x_y=[5,8]$ (overlaps y). Then $x_y^{max}=8 < z_y^{min}=100$. Yes, $x$ can be South of $z$.
- Is $x$ North of $z$? ($x_y^{min} > z_y^{max}$)
  We know $x_y^{min} \le y_y^{max}$ and $y_y^{max} < z_y^{min} \le z_y^{max}$. Thus $x_y^{min} < z_y^{max}$. No, $x$ cannot be North of $z$.
- Do $x$ and $z$ overlap in y? ($x_y^{min} \le z_y^{max}$ and $x_y^{max} \ge z_y^{min}$)
  We showed $x_y^{min} \le z_y^{max}$ is always true. We need to check if $x_y^{max} \ge z_y^{min}$ is possible. We know $x_y^{max} \ge y_y^{min}$ and $y_y^{max} < z_y^{min}$. If $y_y^{min}$ is not much smaller than $z_y^{min}$, and $x$ overlaps the upper part of $y$'s y-range and extends upwards, $x_y^{max}$ can be $\ge z_y^{min}$.
  Example: $z_y=[100,110]$, $y_y=[80,99]$ (South of z), $x_y=[85,120]$ (overlaps y). Then $x_y^{max}=120 \ge z_y^{min}=100$. Yes, $x$ can overlap $z$ in y.

So, in the y-dimension, $x$ can be South of $z$ or overlap with $z$.

Combining the possibilities for both dimensions:
1. $x$ is East of $z$ (in x) AND $x$ is South of $z$ (in y) => Southeast relation. Possible.
2. $x$ is East of $z$ (in x) AND $x$ overlaps $z$ (in y) => East relation (under the 8-direction-plus-overlap model). Possible.
3. $x$ overlaps $z$ (in x) AND $x$ is South of $z$ (in y) => South relation (under the 8-direction-plus-overlap model). Possible.
4. $x$ overlaps $z$ (in x) AND $x$ overlaps $z$ (in y) => Bounding Box relation. Possible.

The impossible relations (North, Northeast, Northwest, West, Southwest) require separation that is not possible given the initial conditions.

The possible relations between region x and region z from the provided list are Southeast, East, South, and Bounding Box.

Southeast, East, South, Bounding Box
For r1:  East, r2:  East, answer: East, Northeast, Southeast
For r1:  East, r2:  Northwest, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  East, r2:  West, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  East, r2:  Southwest, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  East, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: West, Northwest, Southwest
For r1:  Northwest, r2: North, answer: Let z be the origin (0,0).
Since region y is North of region z, y is located generally along the positive y-axis relative to z. Let the vector from z to y be $\vec{V}_{zy}$. The direction of $\vec{V}_{zy}$ falls within the range defined as North. Using a standard 8-point system with 45-degree sectors centered on the main directions, the North sector spans angles from 67.5 degrees to 112.5 degrees relative to the positive x-axis.

Since region x is Northwest of region y, x is located generally in the direction of the negative x and positive y axes relative to y. Let the vector from y to x be $\vec{V}_{yx}$. The direction of $\vec{V}_{yx}$ falls within the Northwest sector, which spans angles from 112.5 degrees to 157.5 degrees relative to the positive x-axis passing through y.

The position of x relative to z is given by the vector $\vec{V}_{zx} = \vec{V}_{zy} + \vec{V}_{yx}$.
Let $M_1 = |\vec{V}_{zy}|$ and $A_1$ be its angle, where $A_1 \in [67.5^\circ, 112.5^\circ]$.
Let $M_2 = |\vec{V}_{yx}|$ and $A_2$ be its angle, where $A_2 \in [112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$.

The components of $\vec{V}_{zx}$ are $(X, Y)$:
$X = M_1 \cos(A_1) + M_2 \cos(A_2)$
$Y = M_1 \sin(A_1) + M_2 \sin(A_2)$

Let's analyze the signs of the components:
For $A_1 \in [67.5^\circ, 112.5^\circ]$, $\sin(A_1) > 0$. At $A_1=90^\circ$, $\sin(A_1)=1$.
For $A_2 \in [112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$, $\sin(A_2) > 0$.
Thus, $Y = M_1 \sin(A_1) + M_2 \sin(A_2)$ is always positive (since $M_1, M_2 > 0$). This means x is always located north of z (or at the same latitude only if M1 or M2 is zero, which is not the case for directional relations).

For $A_1 \in [67.5^\circ, 112.5^\circ]$, $\cos(A_1)$ is positive for $A_1 \in [67.5^\circ, 90^\circ)$, zero for $A_1=90^\circ$, and negative for $A_1 \in (90^\circ, 112.5^\circ]$.
For $A_2 \in [112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$, $\cos(A_2)$ is always negative.

The x-component $X = M_1 \cos(A_1) + M_2 \cos(A_2)$ can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the values of $M_1, M_2, A_1, A_2$.
- If $M_1$ is large, $M_2$ is small, and $A_1$ is close to $67.5^\circ$ (where $\cos(A_1)$ is positive), $X$ can be positive.
- If $M_2$ is large, $M_1$ is small, and $A_2$ is close to $157.5^\circ$ (where $|\cos(A_2)|$ is large), $X$ can be negative.
- If $M_1 \cos(A_1)$ and $M_2 \cos(A_2)$ balance out, $X$ can be close to zero.

Since $Y$ is always positive, the resulting vector $\vec{V}_{zx}$ points into the upper half-plane.
The possible directions are limited to North-East, North, and North-West.

Let $\theta$ be the angle of $\vec{V}_{zx}$. $\theta = \arctan2(Y, X)$.
We established $Y > 0$.

If $X > 0$ and $Y > 0$, $\theta \in (0^\circ, 90^\circ)$. This corresponds to East, Northeast, or North.
If $X = 0$ and $Y > 0$, $\theta = 90^\circ$. This corresponds to North.
If $X < 0$ and $Y > 0$, $\theta \in (90^\circ, 180^\circ)$. This corresponds to Northwest or West.

Let's consider the range of the angle $\theta = \arctan(\frac{Y}{X})$ for $X>0$.
The minimum possible angle $\theta$ occurs when the vector $\vec{V}_{zx}$ leans as much as possible towards the East. This happens when $A_1$ is close to $67.5^\circ$ and $A_2$ is close to $112.5^\circ$, and $M_1$ is significantly larger than $M_2$.
Let $A_1=67.5^\circ$ and $A_2=112.5^\circ$.
$X = M_1 \cos(67.5^\circ) + M_2 \cos(112.5^\circ) \approx M_1(0.383) + M_2(-0.383) = 0.383(M_1 - M_2)$.
$Y = M_1 \sin(67.5^\circ) + M_2 \sin(112.5^\circ) \approx M_1(0.924) + M_2(0.924) = 0.924(M_1 + M_2)$.
If $M_1 > M_2$, $X > 0$. The angle $\theta = \arctan(\frac{0.924(M_1 + M_2)}{0.383(M_1 - M_2)}) = \arctan(2.412 \frac{M_1+M_2}{M_1-M_2})$.
As $M_1$ approaches infinity relative to $M_2$ (e.g., $M_2=1$, $M_1 \to \infty$), $\frac{M_1+M_2}{M_1-M_2} \to 1$.
The angle approaches $\arctan(2.412) \approx 67.45^\circ$. This is at the boundary or just below the boundary of the North sector (depending on strict inequality in sector definition), possibly in the Northeast sector [22.5, 67.5). If the boundary 67.5 is included in North, then the minimum angle is 67.5 which is North. If the boundary 67.5 is excluded from Northeast and included in North, then angles >= 67.5 are North or above. Vector addition minimum calculation confirms angle does not go below 67.5. Thus Northeast is not possible.

Let's consider the range of the angle $\theta = \arctan(\frac{Y}{X}) + 180^\circ$ for $X<0$.
The maximum possible angle $\theta$ occurs when the vector $\vec{V}_{zx}$ leans as much as possible towards the West. This happens when $A_1$ is close to $112.5^\circ$ and $A_2$ is close to $157.5^\circ$, and $M_2$ is significantly larger than $M_1$.
Let $A_1=112.5^\circ$ and $A_2=157.5^\circ$.
$X = M_1 \cos(112.5^\circ) + M_2 \cos(157.5^\circ) \approx M_1(-0.383) + M_2(-0.924) = -0.383 M_1 - 0.924 M_2$. $X$ is always negative.
$Y = M_1 \sin(112.5^\circ) + M_2 \sin(157.5^\circ) \approx M_1(0.924) + M_2(0.383) = 0.924 M_1 + 0.383 M_2$. $Y$ is always positive.
The angle $\theta = \arctan(\frac{0.924 M_1 + 0.383 M_2}{-0.383 M_1 - 0.924 M_2}) + 180^\circ$.
As $M_2$ approaches infinity relative to $M_1$ (e.g., $M_1=1$, $M_2 \to \infty$), the ratio $\frac{0.924 M_1 + 0.383 M_2}{-0.383 M_1 - 0.924 M_2} \to \frac{0.383 M_2}{-0.924 M_2} \approx -0.414$.
The angle approaches $\arctan(-0.414) + 180^\circ \approx -22.5^\circ + 180^\circ = 157.5^\circ$. This is at the boundary of the Northwest sector [112.5, 157.5]. If 157.5 is included in Northwest, this is Northwest. If it is excluded, the angle is slightly less than 157.5, which is in Northwest.

The possible range of the resulting angle $\theta$ is approximately $[67.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$.
- Angles in $[67.5^\circ, 112.5^\circ)$ correspond to North.
- Angles in $[112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$ correspond to Northwest.

Both North and Northwest are possible relations between x and z.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northwest}$.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northeast, answer: North, Northeast, Northwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z can be determined by considering the relative positions.
Let z be at the origin (0,0).
Region y is Southeast of z, so y is located at a position (c, -d) where c > 0 and d > 0.
Region x is Northwest of y, so x is located at a position relative to y that is to the upper-left. If y is at (c, -d), then x is at (c - a, -d + b) where a > 0 and b > 0.

The position of x relative to z is (c - a, b - d).
Here, c > 0, d > 0, a > 0, b > 0.

Let's analyze the signs of the coordinates of x relative to z:
1.  The x-coordinate (c - a):
    *   Can be positive (if c > a), placing x to the East of z.
    *   Can be negative (if c < a), placing x to the West of z.
    *   Can be zero (if c = a), placing x on the North-South axis relative to z.
    Since c and a can be any positive values, all three cases are possible.

2.  The y-coordinate (b - d):
    *   Can be positive (if b > d), placing x to the North of z.
    *   Can be negative (if b < d), placing x to the South of z.
    *   Can be zero (if b = d), placing x on the East-West axis relative to z.
    Since b and d can be any positive values, all three cases are possible.

Combining these possibilities for the relative position of x to z:
*   (+, +): c > a and b > d => Northeast
*   (+, -): c > a and b < d => Southeast
*   (+, 0): c > a and b = d => East
*   (-, +): c < a and b > d => Northwest
*   (-, -): c < a and b < d => Southwest
*   (-, 0): c < a and b = d => West
*   (0, +): c = a and b > d => North
*   (0, -): c = a and b < d => South
*   (0, 0): c = a and b = d => x is at the same location as z.

If regions are treated as points, all 8 cardinal and intercardinal directions are possible depending on the specific magnitudes of a, b, c, and d. The case where x is at the same location as z (0,0) is also possible.

If regions are areas with extent, the relation "A is R of B" usually implies that the bounding box of A is R of the bounding box of B, often implying separation. However, composing these relations can lead to overlapping bounding boxes for x and z. If the bounding boxes overlap, a single cardinal direction does not describe the relation. The option "Bounding Box" likely represents this scenario of overlap or coincidence.

Considering the list of possible answers provided, which includes the 8 cardinal directions and "Bounding Box", it indicates that the result of the composition can be any of the standard cardinal directions or a configuration (like overlap or coincidence) that is represented by "Bounding Box".

The possible relations between region x and region z could be any of the 8 cardinal directions or Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  South, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  East, answer: Let R(A, B) denote the relation of region A to region B. We are given R(x, y) = Northwest and R(y, z) = East. We need to find the possible relations R(x, z) from the given list: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

Let's use a coordinate system and consider the relative positions of the regions' reference points (e.g., centroids).

1.  x is Northwest of y (x NW y): This implies the x-coordinate of x is less than the x-coordinate of y, and the y-coordinate of x is greater than the y-coordinate of y. Let x be at (y_cx - dx, y_cy + dy) relative to some origin, where y_cx is the x-coordinate of y, y_cy is the y-coordinate of y, dx > 0 and dy > 0.

2.  y is East of z (y E z): This implies the x-coordinate of y is greater than the x-coordinate of z. For a pure East relation, the y-coordinate of y is similar to the y-coordinate of z. Let y be at (z_cx + dz, z_cy + ε) relative to the same origin, where z_cx and z_cy are coordinates of z, dz > 0, and ε is small, ideally 0 for pure East.

Now let's find the position of x relative to z.
Position of x relative to origin is (y_cx - dx, y_cy + dy).
Position of y relative to origin is (z_cx + dz, z_cy + ε).

Substituting the position of y into the position of x:
x is at ((z_cx + dz) - dx, (z_cy + ε) + dy) relative to the origin.
The position of x relative to z (at (z_cx, z_cy)) is found by subtracting (z_cx, z_cy):
R(x, z) coordinates = ((z_cx + dz) - dx - z_cx, (z_cy + ε) + dy - z_cy) = (dz - dx, dy + ε).

Let Rel_x = dz - dx and Rel_y = dy + ε.
We know dy > 0. If "East" implies similar y-levels, ε ≈ 0, so Rel_y ≈ dy > 0.
If "East" allows for some vertical difference, ε could be positive or negative, but typically small compared to dz. However, some formal definitions of East only constrain the x-axis.

Case A: Assuming standard cardinal directions imply general relative position (e.g., centroid-based, where East is primarily +x, and NW is primarily -x, +y). Then Rel_y = dy + ε > 0 (since x is North of y, and y is roughly at the same y-level as z).
The relation in the y-direction is North.
The relation in the x-direction depends on dz - dx:
- If dz - dx > 0: Rel_x is positive. x is East of z in x. Combined with North in y, this is Northeast.
- If dz - dx < 0: Rel_x is negative. x is West of z in x. Combined with North in y, this is Northwest.
- If dz - dx = 0: Rel_x is zero. x is aligned with z in x. Combined with North in y, this is North.

Under this interpretation, the possible relations are North, Northeast, and Northwest.

Case B: Considering that regions have extent, and "Bounding Box" is listed as a possible relation, implying overlap is a distinct outcome. The relations might be based on the comparison of bounding boxes.
Let BB(A) = [min_x(A), max_x(A)] x [min_y(A), max_y(A)].
Approximate relations using BBs:
x NW y: max_x(x) < min_x(y) and min_y(x) > max_y(y) (strict disjoint)
y E z: min_x(y) > max_x(z) and overlap in y (e.g., min_y(y) <= max_y(z) and max_y(y) >= min_y(z)) OR strict disjoint min_x(y) > max_x(z) AND min_y(y) >= max_y(z) (y is East or Northeast of z in disjoint terms) OR min_x(y) > max_x(z) only.

If y E z implies min_x(y) > max_x(z) and min_y(y) >= max_y(z) (y is East or Northeast or aligned-East of z without being South), and x NW y implies max_x(x) < min_x(y) and min_y(x) > max_y(y), then combining these implies min_y(x) > max_y(y) >= max_y(z), so min_y(x) > max_y(z). This means x is always above z in y if disjoint.
If disjoint:
- x-relation can be West, East, or Overlap.
- y-relation must be North.
- Possible disjoint relations: Northwest, Northeast, North.

If bounding boxes overlap, the relation is "Bounding Box". We can construct scenarios where overlap occurs. For example, if regions x, y, z are large squares and their centroids are relatively close, their bounding boxes can overlap.

Example where BB overlap occurs:
z: square at [-10, 10] x [-5, 5]
y: square at [5, 25] x [-5, 5] (y is E of z)
x: square at [-5, 15] x [0, 20] (centroid (5, 10) is NW of y centroid (15, 0))
BBx: [-5, 15] x [0, 20]
BBz: [-10, 10] x [-5, 5]
BBx and BBz overlap in x ([-5, 10]) and in y ([0, 5]). Thus, "Bounding Box" is a possible relation.

Example where Northwest occurs (disjoint):
z: [-10,-8]x[-1,1]
y: [-7,-5]x[-1,1] (y is E of z)
x: [-9,-7]x[2,4] (x is NW of y)
BBx: [-9,-7]x[2,4]
BBz: [-10,-8]x[-1,1]
max_x(x)=-7 < min_x(z)=-10 is false. min_x(x)=-9 < max_x(z)=-8. Overlap in x.
max_y(z)=1 < min_y(x)=2. x is North of z in y.
This would be North (with x-overlap), not Northwest in disjoint sense.

Let's use the initial centroid interpretation for disjoint cardinal directions, and add Bounding Box for overlap.
Centroid analysis gives North, Northeast, Northwest as possible disjoint relations.
Bounding Box overlap is possible.

Can other relations (Southeast, South, East, West, Southwest) occur?
For these to occur as disjoint relations, x would need to be South of z, or at the same y-level as z. But x NW y places x's y-coordinate above y's, and y E z places y's y-coordinate around z's. Thus x's y-coordinate is expected to be above z's. This makes South, Southeast, Southwest relations unlikely in the disjoint case under standard interpretation.

If "East" merely means min_x > max_x (and no y constraint), and "Northwest" means max_x < min_x AND min_y > max_y, then Southeast and Southwest can be constructed (as shown in thought process). However, this is a less common interpretation for basic cardinal directions without further specification.

Given the options provided, the most likely intended possible relations are those from the centroid analysis plus Bounding Box for overlap.

Possible relations are North, Northeast, Northwest, and Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Northwest, Bounding Box}$.
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: Northwest
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  West, answer: Northwest
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Southwest, answer: Northwest
West
Southwest
For r1:  Northwest, r2:  Bounding Box, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z could be North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  West, r2: North, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by combining the given relations:
1.  x is West of y: This implies that the x-coordinate of x (x\_x) is less than the x-coordinate of y (y\_x), i.e., x\_x < y\_x. There is no constraint on their y-coordinates (x\_y and y\_y).
2.  y is North of z: This implies that the y-coordinate of y (y\_y) is greater than the y-coordinate of z (z\_y), i.e., y\_y > z\_y. There is no constraint on their x-coordinates (y\_x and z\_x).

We want to find the possible relations between x and z, which depend on the comparison of their coordinates (x\_x vs z\_x and x\_y vs z\_y).

From the constraints:
x\_x < y\_x
z\_y < y\_y

Consider the x-coordinates of x and z. The relation between x\_x and z\_x is not directly constrained. We know x\_x is to the left of y\_x, but z\_x can be anywhere relative to y\_x.
-   If z\_x is much larger than y\_x, then x\_x < y\_x < z\_x, so x\_x < z\_x (x is West of z's longitude).
-   If z\_x is much smaller than y\_x, and y\_x is not much larger than x\_x, it's possible that z\_x < x\_x < y\_x, so x\_x > z\_x (x is East of z's longitude).
-   It's also possible that x\_x = z\_x (x is on the same longitude as z).

Consider the y-coordinates of x and z. The relation between x\_y and z\_y is not directly constrained. We know z\_y is below y\_y, but x\_y can be anywhere relative to y\_y.
-   If x\_y is much larger than y\_y, then x\_y > y\_y > z\_y, so x\_y > z\_y (x is North of z's latitude).
-   If x\_y is much smaller than y\_y, and y\_y is not much larger than z\_y, it's possible that z\_y < x\_y < y\_y is not possible. Instead, if x\_y < z\_y < y\_y, then x\_y < z\_y (x is South of z's latitude).
-   It's also possible that x\_y = z\_y (x is on the same latitude as z).

Since the relationship between x\_x and z\_x can be <, =, or >, and independently the relationship between x\_y and z\_y can be <, =, or >, any combination of horizontal and vertical relationships is possible, except for x being identical to z (which would imply x is North of x, impossible).

The possible combinations of (horizontal relation, vertical relation) for x relative to z are:
-   West (<), North (>) => Northwest
-   West (<), South (<) => Southwest
-   West (<), Same (=) => West
-   East (>), North (>) => Northeast
-   East (>), South (<) => Southeast
-   East (>), Same (=) => East
-   Same (=), North (>) => North
-   Same (=), South (<) => South

Each of these 8 combinations corresponds to one of the standard cardinal or intercardinal directions. We can construct examples for each case by choosing appropriate coordinates for x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions (x\_x < y\_x and y\_y > z\_y). As shown in the thought process, all 8 directional relations are indeed possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z, from the provided list, are the ones we have found to be possible.

The possible relations are: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest.

The term "Bounding Box" is typically not a directional relation itself but might be used in some systems to denote the set of all possible directional relations when the composition is indeterminate, or to refer to relations involving overlapping bounding boxes. Given the instruction "one or more of these" and that all 8 directional terms represent possible outcomes, the most direct answer is to list all 8.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest}$.
For r1:  West, r2:  Northeast, answer: North, Northeast, Northwest
For r1:  West, r2:  Southeast, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z could be: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.
For r1:  West, r2:  South, answer: Southwest
For r1:  West, r2:  East, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  West, r2:  Northwest, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by composing the two given relations:
1. x is West of y (x W y)
2. y is Northwest of z (y NW z)

We want to find the possible relations for (x R z), where R is a cardinal direction relation.

Let's represent the relations using coordinates, assuming z is at the origin (0,0).
"y is Northwest of z" implies that y is in the region with coordinates (y_x, y_y) where y_x < 0 and y_y > 0.
"x is West of y" implies that x is in the region relative to y where the x-coordinate is smaller. If x is at (x_x, x_y), then x_x < y_x.

Combining these constraints:
We have x_x < y_x and y_x < 0. This implies x_x < 0.
The y-coordinate of x (x_y) relative to z (which is at y=0) is not directly constrained by these horizontal relations. The relation "West of" primarily constrains the horizontal position. Assuming "West of" only restricts the x-coordinate or describes a region to the left, the y-coordinate of x can vary.

If x_x < 0 and x_y can be any value, then the possible locations of x relative to z lie in the entire left half-plane.
The left half-plane (x < 0) covers three cardinal direction sectors relative to the origin (z):
- The Northwest sector (x < 0, y > 0)
- The West direction (x < 0, y = 0)
- The Southwest sector (x < 0, y < 0)

Therefore, region x could be Northwest of region z, West of region z, or Southwest of region z.

Let's verify with examples:
- If y is very North-like in the Northwest region (e.g., y=(-1, 10)) and x is West of y (e.g., x=(-5, 10)), then x=(-5, 10) relative to z=(0,0) is Northwest.
- If y is in the middle of the Northwest region (e.g., y=(-5, 5)) and x is West of y such that its y-coordinate aligns with z's y-coordinate (e.g., x=(-10, 0), assuming "West of" allows this vertical shift, or considering regions), then x=(-10, 0) relative to z=(0,0) is West.
- If y is very West-like in the Northwest region (e.g., y=(-10, 1)) and x is West of y (e.g., x=(-15, 1)), or West of y such that its y-coordinate is below z's y-coordinate (e.g., x=(-15, -5)), then x=(-15, -5) relative to z=(0,0) is Southwest.

The possible relations are Northwest, West, and Southwest. These are present in the list of allowed answers. The "Bounding Box" option typically applies when the resulting region is more complex or covers a wider range of possibilities, but in standard spatial reasoning composition of simple cardinal directions, the result is a specific subset of relations.

The possible relations between region x and region z could be Northwest, West, and Southwest.

Northwest, West, Southwest
For r1:  West, r2:  West, answer: West, Northwest, Southwest
For r1:  West, r2:  Southwest, answer: Let y be at the origin (0,0) in a coordinate system.
Region x is West of region y. This means region x is located in the half-plane to the west of y. A point in region x, (x_x, x_y), satisfies x_x < 0. x_y can be any real number.

Region y is Southwest of region z. This means region z is located in the Northeast quadrant relative to y. A point in region z, (z_x, z_y), satisfies z_x > 0 and z_y > 0.

So we have:
x = (x_x, x_y) where x_x < 0
y = (0, 0)
z = (z_x, z_y) where z_x > 0 and z_y > 0

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. This refers to the direction of z from x, or the direction of x from z. Let's first consider the direction of z from x.
The vector from x to z is (z_x - x_x, z_y - x_y).

Let's analyze the components of this vector:
The x-component is z_x - x_x. Since z_x > 0 and x_x < 0, z_x - x_x = (positive) - (negative) = positive + positive > 0.
The x-component is always positive. This means z is always to the East of the vertical line passing through x.

The y-component is z_y - x_y.
z_y > 0. x_y can be any real number.
- If z_y - x_y > 0 (i.e., z_y > x_y), the y-component is positive. z is North of the horizontal line passing through x.
- If z_y - x_y = 0 (i.e., z_y = x_y), the y-component is zero. z is on the horizontal line passing through x.
- If z_y - x_y < 0 (i.e., z_y < x_y), the y-component is negative. z is South of the horizontal line passing through x.

So, the vector from x to z has a positive x-component and can have a positive, zero, or negative y-component.
- Positive x, Positive y: Northeast direction.
- Positive x, Zero y: East direction.
- Positive x, Negative y: Southeast direction.

Thus, the possible relations of z from x are Northeast, East, or Southeast.

The relations between region x and region z can be the relation of z from x, or the relation of x from z (which is the opposite direction).
If z is Northeast of x, then x is Southwest of z.
If z is East of x, then x is West of z.
If z is Southeast of x, then x is Northwest of z.

So, the possible relations (either z from x or x from z) are Northeast, East, Southeast, Southwest, West, and Northwest.

We check which of these relations are present in the provided list: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box.

All the possible relations we found (Northeast, East, Southeast, Southwest, West, Northwest) are present in the list, except for North, South, and Bounding Box.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are those from the list that we have identified as possible.

The possible relations are Northeast, Southeast, East, Northwest, West, Southwest.

For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Southeast, answer: Southwest, South, Southeast
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  South, answer: Let z be at the origin (0,0).
Region y is South of region z. This means region y is located predominantly below region z. If we consider bounding boxes, the maximum y-coordinate of y (ymax_y) is less than the minimum y-coordinate of z (ymin_z). If considering centroids, the y-coordinate of y's centroid is less than that of z's centroid.

Region x is Southwest of region y. This means region x is located predominantly to the south AND west of region y. If considering bounding boxes, ymax_x < ymin_y AND xmax_x < xmin_y. If considering centroids, cx_x < cy_x AND cx_y < cy_y.

Let's use the bounding box approach, which is common for defining region-region relations.
1. y is South of z: ymax_y < ymin_z.
2. x is Southwest of y: ymax_x < ymin_y AND xmax_x < xmin_y.

From ymax_x < ymin_y and ymax_y < ymin_z, it follows that ymax_x < ymin_y < ymax_y < ymin_z.
Therefore, ymax_x < ymin_z. This implies that the bounding box of x is entirely below the bounding box of z. This means x is always South of z.

Now, let's consider the horizontal relationship between x and z based on xmax_x < xmin_y. The horizontal position of y relative to z is not fixed by the condition "y is South of z".

Let [xmin_z, xmax_z] be the x-range of z and [ymin_z, ymax_z] be the y-range of z.
Let [xmin_y, xmax_y] be the x-range of y and [ymin_y, ymax_y] be the y-range of y.
Let [xmin_x, xmax_x] be the x-range of x and [ymin_x, ymax_x] be the y-range of x.

We have ymax_x < ymin_y and ymax_y < ymin_z, so ymax_x < ymin_z.
We also have xmax_x < xmin_y.

Case 1: y is West of z in the x-direction.
This implies xmax_y < xmin_z.
Since xmax_x < xmin_y, it is possible that xmax_x < xmin_y < xmax_y < xmin_z.
This results in xmax_x < xmin_z.
If xmax_x < xmin_z, region x is entirely to the West of region z.
Since x is also always South of z (ymax_x < ymin_z), if x is West of z and South of z, the relation is Southwest. This is possible.

Case 2: y is East of z in the x-direction.
This implies xmin_y > xmax_z.
Since xmax_x < xmin_y, it is possible that xmin_x > xmax_z.
For example, let z = [0, 10]x[0, 10]. Let y = [20, 30]x[-20, -10]. y is South and East of z.
Let x = [15, 18]x[-30, -25]. xmax_x=18, xmin_y=20. xmax_x < xmin_y (18 < 20).
x is Southwest of y.
Now check x relative to z: x = [15, 18]x[-30, -25], z = [0, 10]x[0, 10].
xmin_x=15 > xmax_z=10. x is East of z.
ymax_x=-25 < ymin_z=0. x is South of z.
If x is East of z and South of z, the relation is Southeast. This is possible.

Case 3: y overlaps z horizontally, or is positioned such that x overlaps z horizontally.
We need xmin_x < xmax_z AND xmax_x > xmin_z.
We know xmax_x < xmin_y. It is possible for xmin_y to be within or overlapping the range [xmin_z, xmax_z], or even larger, while still allowing x to overlap [xmin_z, xmax_z] given that xmax_x < xmin_y.
Example: z = [0, 10]x[0, 10]. Let y = [5, 15]x[-20, -10]. y is South and overlaps z horizontally. xmin_y=5.
We need xmax_x < 5. Let x = [2, 4]x[-30, -25]. xmax_x=4, xmin_x=2. xmax_x < 5 (4 < 5).
x is Southwest of y.
Now check x relative to z: x = [2, 4]x[-30, -25], z = [0, 10]x[0, 10].
xmin_x=2, xmax_x=4. xmin_z=0, xmax_z=10.
xmin_x < xmax_z (2 < 10) AND xmax_x > xmin_z (4 > 0). x overlaps z horizontally.
ymax_x=-25 < ymin_z=0. x is South of z.
If x overlaps z horizontally and is South of z, the relation is South. This is possible.

Since x is always strictly South of z (ymax_x < ymin_z), the possible cardinal relations are restricted to those involving "South": Southwest, South, Southeast. We have demonstrated examples where each of these relations is possible.
Other cardinal directions (North, Northeast, Southeast, West, East, Northwest) are not possible as they imply a different vertical or combined vertical/horizontal relationship that contradicts x being strictly South of z.
The "Bounding Box" option is likely for cases of complex overlap or different relation definitions, but based on standard interpretation of separated cardinal relations derived from bounding boxes, one of the three South-based relations must apply.

The possible relations are Southwest, South, Southeast.

The final answer is $\boxed{Southwest, South, Southeast}$.
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  East, answer: North, Northeast, Southeast, South, East, Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  Northwest, answer: Northeast, Southeast, East, Bounding Box
For r1:  Southwest, r2:  West, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions. The relations are given as:
1. Region x is Southwest of region y (x SW y).
2. Region y is West of region z (y W z).

Let's analyze these relations using a coordinate system, placing the reference region's center or significant point at the origin.

Statement 2: y is West of z.
If z is at (0,0), region y is located generally to the left of z. In terms of coordinates, if y's position is (y_x, y_y) relative to z, this implies y_x < 0. The y-coordinate, y_y, can be positive (y is Northwest of z), zero (y is strictly West of z), or negative (y is Southwest of z), depending on the definition of "West" (e.g., a broad sector, a half-plane x < 0, or a narrow band around the negative x-axis). For this analysis, we will consider the general case where y_x < 0.

Statement 1: x is Southwest of y.
If y is at (y_x, y_y), region x is located generally to the southwest of y. If x's position is (x_x, x_y) relative to y, this implies x_x < 0 and x_y < 0.
So, the coordinates of x relative to z are the sum of the coordinates of y relative to z and the coordinates of x relative to y.
Let the position of z be (0,0).
Let the position of y relative to z be (y_x, y_y), with y_x < 0.
Let the position of x relative to y be (v_x, v_y), with v_x < 0 and v_y < 0 (representing the Southwest vector from y to x).

The position of x relative to z is (z_x, z_y) where:
z_x = y_x + v_x
z_y = y_y + v_y

Since y_x < 0 and v_x < 0, their sum z_x = y_x + v_x is always negative.
This means that region x is always located to the West of the vertical line passing through region z.
This rules out the relations East, Northeast, and Southeast between x and z. North and South are also ruled out as z_x cannot be zero.

Now let's look at the y-coordinate of x relative to z: z_y = y_y + v_y.
We know v_y < 0. The sign of z_y depends on the value of y_y.

Case 1: y is in the Northwest part of the "West of z" region.
y_x < 0 and y_y > 0.
z_x = y_x + v_x < 0.
z_y = y_y + v_y. Since y_y > 0 and v_y < 0, z_y could be positive, zero, or negative.
- If y_y > |v_y|, then z_y > 0. (z_x < 0, z_y > 0) -> x is Northwest of z.
  Example: z=(0,0), y=(-5, 3). v=(-1, -1). x = (-5-1, 3-1) = (-6, 2). (-6, 2) is Northwest of (0,0).
- If y_y = |v_y|, then z_y = 0. (z_x < 0, z_y = 0) -> x is West of z.
  Example: z=(0,0), y=(-5, 1). v=(-1, -1). x = (-5-1, 1-1) = (-6, 0). (-6, 0) is West of (0,0).
- If y_y < |v_y|, then z_y < 0. (z_x < 0, z_y < 0) -> x is Southwest of z.
  Example: z=(0,0), y=(-5, 1). v=(-1, -3). x = (-5-1, 1-3) = (-6, -2). (-6, -2) is Southwest of (0,0).
Thus, Northwest, West, and Southwest are all possible when y is in the Northwest part of the West region relative to z.

Case 2: y is strictly West of z.
y_x < 0 and y_y = 0.
z_x = y_x + v_x < 0.
z_y = y_y + v_y = 0 + v_y = v_y < 0.
(z_x < 0, z_y < 0) -> x is always Southwest of z.
Example: z=(0,0), y=(-5, 0). v=(-1, -1). x = (-5-1, 0-1) = (-6, -1). (-6, -1) is Southwest of (0,0).

Case 3: y is in the Southwest part of the "West of z" region.
y_x < 0 and y_y < 0.
z_x = y_x + v_x < 0.
z_y = y_y + v_y. Since y_y < 0 and v_y < 0, their sum z_y = y_y + v_y is always negative.
(z_x < 0, z_y < 0) -> x is always Southwest of z.
Example: z=(0,0), y=(-5, -3). v=(-1, -1). x = (-5-1, -3-1) = (-6, -4). (-6, -4) is Southwest of (0,0).

Based on point or centroid analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations are Northwest, West, and Southwest.

The option "Bounding Box" is often used to describe relations between regions when they overlap in a way that is not captured by a single cardinal direction (e.g., overlapping bounding boxes in one dimension while disjoint in another) or when the regions themselves overlap.
If the cardinal relations imply disjointness of bounding boxes (BB), then:
BB(y) is West of BB(z) => BB(y).max_x < BB(z).min_x.
BB(x) is SW of BB(y) => BB(x).max_x < BB(y).min_x AND BB(x).max_y < BB(y).min_y.
From these, BB(x).max_x < BB(y).max_x < BB(z).min_x. So BB(x) is always West of BB(z).
The y-relation between BB(x) and BB(z) depends on BB(x).max_y compared to BB(z)'s y-range [BB(z).min_y, BB(z).max_y].
BB(x).max_y < BB(y).min_y. BB(y).min_y can be anywhere relative to BB(z)'s y-range.
If BB(y).min_y is high enough (y is Northwest of z in BB sense), BB(x).max_y could be above, within, or below BB(z)'s y-range, leading to Northwest, Bounding Box (y-overlap), or Southwest relations between x and z respectively.
Example for Bounding Box:
z = [0,1]x[0,1]. BB(z).min_y=0, BB(z).max_y=1.
y = [-5,-2]x[0.5, 3]. BB(y).max_x=-2<0. BB(y).min_y=0.5. (y is West of z, y-overlaps/is North of z).
x is SW of y. BB(x).max_x < -5, BB(x).max_y < 0.5.
Let x = [-7,-6]x[0.1, 0.4]. BB(x).max_x = -6 < -5. BB(x).max_y = 0.4 < 0.5. (x is SW of y).
Compare BB(x) with BB(z): BB(x)=[-7,-6]x[0.1, 0.4], BB(z)=[0,1]x[0,1].
BB(x).max_x = -6 < BB(z).min_x=0 (West).
BB(x).min_y=0.1, BB(x).max_y=0.4. BB(z).min_y=0, BB(z).max_y=1.
BB(x).min_y > BB(z).min_y and BB(x).max_y < BB(z).max_y. BB(x) is within the y-range of BB(z).
This scenario, where x is strictly West of z but vertically overlapping, does not fit a simple cardinal direction like Northwest, West, or Southwest if these imply disjointness or specific alignment. Therefore, "Bounding Box" is a possible relation to describe this configuration.

All the relations Northwest, West, Southwest have been shown to be possible. The "Bounding Box" relation is also possible under interpretations allowing for overlap in one axis when disjoint in the other, or for general complex spatial relations not fitting a single direction.

The possible relations are Northwest, West, Southwest, and Bounding Box.

The final answer is $\boxed{Northwest, West, Southwest, Bounding Box}$.
