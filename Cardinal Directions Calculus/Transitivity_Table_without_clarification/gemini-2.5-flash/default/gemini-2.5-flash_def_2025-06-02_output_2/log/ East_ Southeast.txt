PROMPT: Let  East and  Southeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  East of region y and region y is  Southeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Let $z$ be at the origin (0,0).
Region $y$ is Southeast of region $z$. Using a common interpretation where regions are represented by points or the relation refers to the relative position of centroids, this means the vector from $z$ to $y$ lies within the Southeast cone. Let $\theta_y$ be the angle of the vector from $z$ to $y$ relative to the positive x-axis (East). The Southeast cone typically covers angles in the range $(-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$. So, $\theta_y \in (-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$. Let $y = (r_y \cos \theta_y, r_y \sin \theta_y)$ for some $r_y > 0$. Note that $\cos \theta_y > 0$ and $\sin \theta_y < 0$ for $\theta_y$ in this range.

Region $x$ is East of region $y$. Similarly, the vector from $y$ to $x$ lies within the East cone. Let $\theta_{xy}$ be the angle of the vector from $y$ to $x$ relative to the positive x-axis. The East cone typically covers angles in the range $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$. So, $\theta_{xy} \in (-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$. Let the vector from $y$ to $x$ be $(r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy}, r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy})$ for some $r_{xy} > 0$. Note that $\cos \theta_{xy} > 0$ for $\theta_{xy}$ in this range, while $\sin \theta_{xy}$ can be positive, negative, or zero.

The coordinates of $x$ relative to $z$ are found by vector addition: $x = z + (y-z) + (x-y)$. If $z=(0,0)$, then the vector from $z$ to $x$ is simply the sum of the vector from $z$ to $y$ and the vector from $y$ to $x$.
$x = (r_y \cos \theta_y + r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy}, r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy})$.

We need to find the possible direction of $x$ relative to $z$. This is given by the angle $\theta_x = \operatorname{atan2}(r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}, r_y \cos \theta_y + r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy})$.

Let's analyze the possible range of this angle.
The x-coordinate of $x$ is $x_x = r_y \cos \theta_y + r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy}$. Since $r_y > 0, r_{xy} > 0$, $\cos \theta_y > 0$ (in $(-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$) and $\cos \theta_{xy} > 0$ (in $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$), $x_x$ is always positive. This means $x$ must lie in the right half-plane relative to $z$, ruling out West, Southwest, Northwest, and South (unless on the positive y-axis or origin, but $x_x > 0$). Possible relations are North, Northeast, East, Southeast.

The y-coordinate of $x$ is $x_y = r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}$.
$\sin \theta_y \in (\sin(-67.5^\circ), \sin(-22.5^\circ)) \approx (-0.924, -0.383)$.
$\sin \theta_{xy} \in (\sin(-22.5^\circ), \sin(22.5^\circ)) \approx (-0.383, 0.383)$.

If $r_{xy}$ is very small compared to $r_y$, $x$ is close to $y$. Since $y$ is Southeast of $z$, $x$ will also be Southeast of $z$. This shows Southeast is a possible relation.

If $r_{xy}$ is very large compared to $r_y$, the position of $x$ is dominated by the vector from $y$ to $x$. The vector from $z$ to $x$ is approximately equal to the vector from $y$ to $x$. The angle of this vector is $\theta_{xy}$, which is in $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$. This range corresponds to the East cone. This shows East is a possible relation.

Now let's check if other directions (N, NE) are possible.
The angle $\theta_x = \operatorname{atan2}(x_y, x_x)$. The range of $\operatorname{atan2}(Y, X)$ for $X>0$ is $(-90^\circ, 90^\circ)$. So N, S, W, SW, NW, Bounding Box are ruled out (S is on the boundary -90, which is approached only if $x_x \to 0$, but $x_x$ is always positive). We only need to check if angles in the N ($45^\circ, 135^\circ$) or NE ($22.5^\circ, 67.5^\circ$) cones are possible. Since $x_x > 0$, only the range $(0, 90^\circ)$ needs checking, which covers N and NE.

For the angle $\theta_x$ to be in the NE cone, we need $x_y > 0$ and $x_y/x_x > \tan(22.5^\circ) \approx 0.414$.
$x_y = r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}$. $\sin \theta_y$ is always negative. $\sin \theta_{xy}$ can be positive. $x_y$ can be positive if $r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}$ is positive and large enough to overcome $r_y |\sin \theta_y|$. This requires $\theta_{xy} > 0$ and $r_{xy}$ large relative to $r_y$.
If $r_{xy}$ is large relative to $r_y$, the angle $\theta_x \approx \theta_{xy} \in (-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$. The maximum angle here approaches $22.5^\circ$. This angle is the boundary between the East and Northeast cones. Based on the open cone definition, this boundary is not included in NE. Based on the closed cone definition, this boundary is included in E or NE depending on convention. However, the maximum angle in the open interval $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$ is less than $22.5^\circ$. So strictly NE (angle > 22.5) does not seem possible with the open cone definition.

Formal analysis of the range of $\operatorname{atan2}(r_y \sin \theta_y + r_{xy} \sin \theta_{xy}, r_y \cos \theta_y + r_{xy} \cos \theta_{xy})$ for $\theta_y \in (-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$ and $\theta_{xy} \in (-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$ shows the resulting angle is in the range $(-67.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$.
This range covers the Southeast cone $(-67.5^\circ, -22.5^\circ)$ and the East cone $(-22.5^\circ, 22.5^\circ)$.
It does not overlap with the North, Northeast, South, Southwest, West, or Northwest cones.

Bounding Box relation is not possible because $x_x > 0$, meaning $x$ is always to the East of $z$ (or on the boundary if $z$ spans x=0), so their bounding boxes cannot overlap in the x-dimension if $z$ has any width or is at the origin.

The possible relations are East and Southeast.

The final answer is $\boxed{East, Southeast}$.
