PROMPT: Let  Northeast and  Northeast be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northeast of region y and region y is  Northeast of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The composition of the cardinal direction relation Northeast with itself yields the relation Northeast.

Let region y be Northeast of region z. This implies that region y is generally located in the positive x and positive y direction relative to region z.
Let region x be Northeast of region y. This implies that region x is generally located in the positive x and positive y direction relative to region y.

If we consider the relative position vector from z to y, it has positive x and y components.
If we consider the relative position vector from y to x, it also has positive x and y components.

The relative position vector from z to x is the sum of the vector from z to y and the vector from y to x.
Summing two vectors with positive x and y components results in a vector with positive x and y components.

Therefore, region x is located in the positive x and positive y direction relative to region z, which corresponds to the Northeast direction.

Under standard definitions of cardinal direction composition, the composition of Northeast and Northeast is Northeast.

The possible relation between region x and region z is Northeast.
