PROMPT: Let  Northwest and North be cardinal direction relations. If region x is  Northwest of region y and region y is North of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Let z be the origin (0,0).
Since region y is North of region z, y is located generally along the positive y-axis relative to z. Let the vector from z to y be $\vec{V}_{zy}$. The direction of $\vec{V}_{zy}$ falls within the range defined as North. Using a standard 8-point system with 45-degree sectors centered on the main directions, the North sector spans angles from 67.5 degrees to 112.5 degrees relative to the positive x-axis.

Since region x is Northwest of region y, x is located generally in the direction of the negative x and positive y axes relative to y. Let the vector from y to x be $\vec{V}_{yx}$. The direction of $\vec{V}_{yx}$ falls within the Northwest sector, which spans angles from 112.5 degrees to 157.5 degrees relative to the positive x-axis passing through y.

The position of x relative to z is given by the vector $\vec{V}_{zx} = \vec{V}_{zy} + \vec{V}_{yx}$.
Let $M_1 = |\vec{V}_{zy}|$ and $A_1$ be its angle, where $A_1 \in [67.5^\circ, 112.5^\circ]$.
Let $M_2 = |\vec{V}_{yx}|$ and $A_2$ be its angle, where $A_2 \in [112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$.

The components of $\vec{V}_{zx}$ are $(X, Y)$:
$X = M_1 \cos(A_1) + M_2 \cos(A_2)$
$Y = M_1 \sin(A_1) + M_2 \sin(A_2)$

Let's analyze the signs of the components:
For $A_1 \in [67.5^\circ, 112.5^\circ]$, $\sin(A_1) > 0$. At $A_1=90^\circ$, $\sin(A_1)=1$.
For $A_2 \in [112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$, $\sin(A_2) > 0$.
Thus, $Y = M_1 \sin(A_1) + M_2 \sin(A_2)$ is always positive (since $M_1, M_2 > 0$). This means x is always located north of z (or at the same latitude only if M1 or M2 is zero, which is not the case for directional relations).

For $A_1 \in [67.5^\circ, 112.5^\circ]$, $\cos(A_1)$ is positive for $A_1 \in [67.5^\circ, 90^\circ)$, zero for $A_1=90^\circ$, and negative for $A_1 \in (90^\circ, 112.5^\circ]$.
For $A_2 \in [112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$, $\cos(A_2)$ is always negative.

The x-component $X = M_1 \cos(A_1) + M_2 \cos(A_2)$ can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the values of $M_1, M_2, A_1, A_2$.
- If $M_1$ is large, $M_2$ is small, and $A_1$ is close to $67.5^\circ$ (where $\cos(A_1)$ is positive), $X$ can be positive.
- If $M_2$ is large, $M_1$ is small, and $A_2$ is close to $157.5^\circ$ (where $|\cos(A_2)|$ is large), $X$ can be negative.
- If $M_1 \cos(A_1)$ and $M_2 \cos(A_2)$ balance out, $X$ can be close to zero.

Since $Y$ is always positive, the resulting vector $\vec{V}_{zx}$ points into the upper half-plane.
The possible directions are limited to North-East, North, and North-West.

Let $\theta$ be the angle of $\vec{V}_{zx}$. $\theta = \arctan2(Y, X)$.
We established $Y > 0$.

If $X > 0$ and $Y > 0$, $\theta \in (0^\circ, 90^\circ)$. This corresponds to East, Northeast, or North.
If $X = 0$ and $Y > 0$, $\theta = 90^\circ$. This corresponds to North.
If $X < 0$ and $Y > 0$, $\theta \in (90^\circ, 180^\circ)$. This corresponds to Northwest or West.

Let's consider the range of the angle $\theta = \arctan(\frac{Y}{X})$ for $X>0$.
The minimum possible angle $\theta$ occurs when the vector $\vec{V}_{zx}$ leans as much as possible towards the East. This happens when $A_1$ is close to $67.5^\circ$ and $A_2$ is close to $112.5^\circ$, and $M_1$ is significantly larger than $M_2$.
Let $A_1=67.5^\circ$ and $A_2=112.5^\circ$.
$X = M_1 \cos(67.5^\circ) + M_2 \cos(112.5^\circ) \approx M_1(0.383) + M_2(-0.383) = 0.383(M_1 - M_2)$.
$Y = M_1 \sin(67.5^\circ) + M_2 \sin(112.5^\circ) \approx M_1(0.924) + M_2(0.924) = 0.924(M_1 + M_2)$.
If $M_1 > M_2$, $X > 0$. The angle $\theta = \arctan(\frac{0.924(M_1 + M_2)}{0.383(M_1 - M_2)}) = \arctan(2.412 \frac{M_1+M_2}{M_1-M_2})$.
As $M_1$ approaches infinity relative to $M_2$ (e.g., $M_2=1$, $M_1 \to \infty$), $\frac{M_1+M_2}{M_1-M_2} \to 1$.
The angle approaches $\arctan(2.412) \approx 67.45^\circ$. This is at the boundary or just below the boundary of the North sector (depending on strict inequality in sector definition), possibly in the Northeast sector [22.5, 67.5). If the boundary 67.5 is included in North, then the minimum angle is 67.5 which is North. If the boundary 67.5 is excluded from Northeast and included in North, then angles >= 67.5 are North or above. Vector addition minimum calculation confirms angle does not go below 67.5. Thus Northeast is not possible.

Let's consider the range of the angle $\theta = \arctan(\frac{Y}{X}) + 180^\circ$ for $X<0$.
The maximum possible angle $\theta$ occurs when the vector $\vec{V}_{zx}$ leans as much as possible towards the West. This happens when $A_1$ is close to $112.5^\circ$ and $A_2$ is close to $157.5^\circ$, and $M_2$ is significantly larger than $M_1$.
Let $A_1=112.5^\circ$ and $A_2=157.5^\circ$.
$X = M_1 \cos(112.5^\circ) + M_2 \cos(157.5^\circ) \approx M_1(-0.383) + M_2(-0.924) = -0.383 M_1 - 0.924 M_2$. $X$ is always negative.
$Y = M_1 \sin(112.5^\circ) + M_2 \sin(157.5^\circ) \approx M_1(0.924) + M_2(0.383) = 0.924 M_1 + 0.383 M_2$. $Y$ is always positive.
The angle $\theta = \arctan(\frac{0.924 M_1 + 0.383 M_2}{-0.383 M_1 - 0.924 M_2}) + 180^\circ$.
As $M_2$ approaches infinity relative to $M_1$ (e.g., $M_1=1$, $M_2 \to \infty$), the ratio $\frac{0.924 M_1 + 0.383 M_2}{-0.383 M_1 - 0.924 M_2} \to \frac{0.383 M_2}{-0.924 M_2} \approx -0.414$.
The angle approaches $\arctan(-0.414) + 180^\circ \approx -22.5^\circ + 180^\circ = 157.5^\circ$. This is at the boundary of the Northwest sector [112.5, 157.5]. If 157.5 is included in Northwest, this is Northwest. If it is excluded, the angle is slightly less than 157.5, which is in Northwest.

The possible range of the resulting angle $\theta$ is approximately $[67.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$.
- Angles in $[67.5^\circ, 112.5^\circ)$ correspond to North.
- Angles in $[112.5^\circ, 157.5^\circ]$ correspond to Northwest.

Both North and Northwest are possible relations between x and z.

The final answer is $\boxed{North, Northwest}$.
