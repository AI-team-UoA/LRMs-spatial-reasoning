PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Narrowing down the possibilities systematically shows that x cannot lie strictly to the west of z (W, NW, SW all fail), but all of the following can occur without contradiction:

• B  (x is “contained” in z),  
• N  (x is north of z),  
• S  (x is south of z),  
• E  (x is east of z),  
• NE (x is northeast of z),  
• SE (x is southeast of z).

Hence the possible single‐tile relations between x and z are {B, N, S, E, NE, SE}.
