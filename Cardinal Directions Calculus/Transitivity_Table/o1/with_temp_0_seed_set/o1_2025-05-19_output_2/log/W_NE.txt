PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, or NW.  

Explanation (informally):  
• From “x W y” we know x is entirely to the left of y but shares y’s vertical extent.  
• From “y NE z” we know y is up‐and‐to‐the‐right of z, so in particular y (and hence x) is above z.  
• Consequently, x lies somewhere above z but may be left, right, or horizontally contained, giving precisely the possibilities NW, N, or NE.
