PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

All nine directions remain possible. Since “x E y” and “y W z” only force y to lie (in the x-dimension) strictly to the left of both x and z, they impose no ordering between x and z themselves. Hence, x could lie anywhere relative to z (including being contained in or containing z), so any of the nine relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible.
