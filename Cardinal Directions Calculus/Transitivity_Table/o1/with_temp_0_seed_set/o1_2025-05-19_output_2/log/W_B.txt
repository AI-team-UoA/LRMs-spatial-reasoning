PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W of y means x is strictly to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) but vertically within y’s bounding box (infx(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
B of z means y is fully inside z’s bounding box (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

From these two facts, one sees that x is vertically within z’s bounding box (since x is vertically inside y, which is inside z). Horizontally, x could either lie entirely to the left of z (making x W of z) or lie entirely inside z’s bounding box (making x B of z).  

Hence, the possible relations of x to z are: W or B.
