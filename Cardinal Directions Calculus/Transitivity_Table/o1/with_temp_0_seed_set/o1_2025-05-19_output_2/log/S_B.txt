PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

S (south) and B (bounding‐box) are the only possibilities.  In outline:

• From “x is S of y” one deduces that horizontally x is within y, but vertically x lies entirely below y  
  (i.e. supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).  
• From “y is B of z” one deduces that y is horizontally and vertically contained in z.  

Putting these together forces x to lie inside z’s horizontal span (because x ⊆ y and y ⊆ z horizontally).  
Vertically, however, x may or may not lie inside z:  
– If infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x can also sit inside z’s bounding‐box (“x B z”).  
– If instead supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x lies strictly below z (“x S z”).  

No other single‐tile relation is compatible with those bounding‐box constraints.
