PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W of z

Explanation (not part of the answer):  

From x W y we know:  
• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  

From y E z we know:  
• supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z),  
• infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  

Combining the horizontal constraints yields  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)  
so that supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
meaning x is strictly to the left of z (no overlap).

Combining the vertical constraints yields  
  infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z),  
so infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Hence, by definition, x W z is satisfied and no other cardinal relation can hold.
