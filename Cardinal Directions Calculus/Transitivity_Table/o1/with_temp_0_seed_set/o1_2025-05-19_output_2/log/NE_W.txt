PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible solutions are exactly N, NE, E, W, NW, or B. In other words, x can be North, North‐East, East, West, North‐West, or “inside” (B) relative to z, but cannot be strictly South, South‐East, or South‐West of z.
