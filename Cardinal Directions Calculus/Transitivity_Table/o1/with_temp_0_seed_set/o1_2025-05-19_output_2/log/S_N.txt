PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Solely from “x is S of y” and “y is N of z,” one can deduce that, horizontally, x must lie within (or coincide with) z’s bounding box (since x is contained in y’s bounding box and y is contained in z’s).  Vertically, however, x can be entirely below z, entirely above z, or contained in z.  In terms of the single‐tile relations, these three scenarios correspond precisely to:

• x S z,  
• x N z,  
• x B z.

No other single‐tile relations are forced or ruled out solely by the given information.
