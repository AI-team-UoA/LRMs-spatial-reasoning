PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Solely from “x is E of y” one knows that x lies strictly to the right of y (i.e., supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)) and that, vertically, x’s bounding‐box is contained in y’s (in other words, infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y)).  
From “y is S of z” one knows that y lies strictly below z (supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z)) and that, horizontally, y’s bounding‐box is contained in z’s (infx(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)).  

Chain these facts together:  
• Since supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z), x also lies strictly below z in the vertical dimension.  
• Horizontally, because infₓ(x) ≥ supₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z), x may or may not lie entirely to the right of z’s bounding box. In particular, two consistent possibilities emerge:  
  – If infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) both still fall within [infx(z), supₓ(z)], then x is S of z.  
  – If instead supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x), then x is SE of z.  

No other cardinal‐direction constraints (N, NE, W, NW, etc.) can be satisfied under these conditions.  

Thus, the possible relations of x to z are:  
S or SE.
