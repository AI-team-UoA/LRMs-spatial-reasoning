PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying the two given constraints

• x SE y  ⇔  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y SW z  ⇔  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z),

one can construct examples showing that x may end up strictly south‐west, straight south, or south‐east of z (depending on how far “to the right” one places x relative to z).  In other words, the possible relations of x to z in this situation are:

SW, S, or SE.
