PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x is B of y means that x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box, i.e.  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

y is SW of z means that y’s bounding box lies strictly to the left (west) and below (south) of z’s bounding box, i.e.  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y), combining these with supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) yields  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

By definition, a SW b holds exactly when  
  supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).  

Hence x SW z is the only possibility.
