PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N and NW are both possible.  In outline:

• From x W y one knows x is strictly to the left of y, but in the vertical dimension x’s bounding box fits within y’s.  
• From y N z one knows y is strictly above z, and horizontally z’s bounding box covers y’s.  

Putting these together forces x to be above z (since x sits within y vertically and y is above z).  In the x‐direction, however, x can either lie completely within z’s left‐right span (making x N z) or lie entirely to the left of z (making x NW z).  No other single‐tile relation can hold under those constraints.
