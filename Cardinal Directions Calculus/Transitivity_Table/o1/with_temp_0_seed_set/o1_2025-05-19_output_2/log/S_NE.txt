PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E, NE, or SE.  

Explanation (informally):  
• From x S y we get that x is directly below y (in the bounding‐box sense).  
• From y NE z we get that y is strictly to the northeast of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
• Combining these, one deduces supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Hence x must lie somewhere strictly to the right of z (i.e., x could be E, NE, or SE of z), but the north–south ordering between x and z is not determined by the given information.
