PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NW of y places x strictly to the left of y and strictly above y. W of z places y strictly to the left of z but vertically within z’s bounding box. Chaining these observations together forces x to lie strictly to the left of z (as x is to the left of y and y is to the left of z) but leaves open whether x is also above z or lies within z’s vertical span. Consequently, x can only be NW or W of z.
