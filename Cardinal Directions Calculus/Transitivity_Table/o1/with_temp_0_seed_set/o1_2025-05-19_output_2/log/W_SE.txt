PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x is W of y” forces x’s bounding‐box to lie strictly to the left of y’s (and vertically within y’s), and “y is SE of z” forces y’s bounding‐box strictly to the right of z’s and below z’s.  Putting these together shows that x must lie strictly below z (since x is below y and y is below z) but leaves open whether x is to the left of z, aligned horizontally under z, or to the right of z.  Consequently, the only consistent possibilities are that x is S, SW, or SE of z.
