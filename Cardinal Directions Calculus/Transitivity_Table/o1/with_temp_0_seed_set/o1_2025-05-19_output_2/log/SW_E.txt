PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x SW y” and “y E z” places very few direct constraints on x relative to z.  A careful check of each of the nine single‐tile relations shows that the only ones that cannot occur are the three that would force x to lie strictly above z (namely N, NE, NW).  All the others (B, S, SW, W, E, SE) can be realized by suitably choosing the bounding boxes.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are:  

B, S, SW, W, E, SE.
