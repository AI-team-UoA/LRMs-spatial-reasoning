PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Narrowing down the possibilities systematically shows that x cannot end up south of z (that would contradict x being above y, which itself lies within z).  The remaining directions that do not lead to any contradiction are  
B, W, NW, N, NE, E.
