PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible relations between x and z must place x strictly to the left of z (since from x NW y and y SW z one deduces supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  In the vertical dimension, x could lie above z, below z, or overlap z.  Therefore, the only single‐tile cardinal directions that remain possible are SW, W, or NW.
