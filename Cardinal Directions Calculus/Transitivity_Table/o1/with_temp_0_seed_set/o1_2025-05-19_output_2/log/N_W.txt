PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, x N y forces x’s bounding box to lie (vertically) strictly above y and be horizontally contained in y. Also, y W z forces y’s bounding box to lie (horizontally) strictly to the left of z and be vertically contained in z. Putting these together:

• Because x is horizontally contained inside y, and y is strictly to the left of z, it follows that x is also strictly to the left of z (so supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)).  
• Vertically, x may or may not lie entirely within z’s bounding box:  
  – If infᵧ(x) ≥ infᵧ(z) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z), then x is “W” of z.  
  – If infᵧ(x) ≥ supᵧ(z), then x is “NW” of z.  

Hence, the only possible single‐tile relations between x and z under those conditions are W or NW.
