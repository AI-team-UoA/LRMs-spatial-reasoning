PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Sifting through the definitions, one finds that “x SE y” means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
so x is (horizontally) to the right of y and (vertically) below y. Likewise, “y S z” means  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   and   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
so y is directly below z but horizontally contained within z’s bounding box.

From these, one can chain the vertical constraints:

• supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  
  ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  

so x must also lie below z.  Horizontally, however, x is only known to be to the right of y; since y is within z’s horizontal span, x might still lie entirely inside z’s horizontal span (“S” case) or be to the right of it (“SE” case).  No other single‐tile relation is forced.  

Hence, the only possible relations of x to z under those conditions are:  
S or SE.
