PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W (West) or SW (South‐West).  

Explanation (informal):  
• From x SW y we know x lies strictly to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and strictly below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).  
• From y W z we know y lies strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and is vertically contained in z.  
• Putting these together forces x to be strictly to the left of z (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) but leaves open whether x is also strictly below z (making x SW of z) or instead lines up within z’s vertical extent (making x W of z).
