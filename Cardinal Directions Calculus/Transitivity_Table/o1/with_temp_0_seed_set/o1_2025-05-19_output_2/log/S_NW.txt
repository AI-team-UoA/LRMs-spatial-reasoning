PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NW, W, or SW.  

Explanation (informally):  
• From x S y, we know x is strictly below y (no vertical overlap) but horizontally “within” y.  
• From y NW z, we know y is strictly above and to the left of z (no overlap in either direction).  
• Putting these together forces x to lie entirely to the left of z (since x ⊆ horizontally in y and y is left of z), but x can be above, aligned, or below z in the vertical direction.  
• In single-tile terms, that corresponds exactly to NW, W, or SW.
