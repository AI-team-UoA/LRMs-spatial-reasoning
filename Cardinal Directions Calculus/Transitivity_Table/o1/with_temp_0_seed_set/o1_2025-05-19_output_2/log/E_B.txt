PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E and B are both possible.  

• E is possible if z (containing y) is entirely to the left of x, i.e. supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
• B is possible if x also lies within z’s bounding box, i.e. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
