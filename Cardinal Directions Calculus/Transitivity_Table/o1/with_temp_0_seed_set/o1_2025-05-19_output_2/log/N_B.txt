PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N of y means x is strictly above y, and B of z means y is contained in z’s bounding box; neither of these forces x to lie below z in the y‐direction.  Checking each of the nine relations against the bounding‐box definitions shows that x cannot be strictly below z (so S, SW, SE are impossible), but all of B, W, NW, N, NE, and E can occur (by suitably placing x horizontally and/or vertically). Thus the possible relations are:

B, W, NW, N, NE, E.
