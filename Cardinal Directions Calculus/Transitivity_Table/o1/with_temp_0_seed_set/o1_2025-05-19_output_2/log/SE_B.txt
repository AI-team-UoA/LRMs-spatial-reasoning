PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

B, S, E, and SE are all consistent with “x SE y” together with “y B z.” Intuitively:

• B can occur if x is still entirely inside z’s bounding box (with y also inside).  
• S can occur if y sits at the bottom edge of z, placing x still farther below.  
• E can occur if y sits at the right edge of z, placing x still farther to the right.  
• SE can occur if y sits at the bottom‐right corner of z, placing x still farther southeast.
