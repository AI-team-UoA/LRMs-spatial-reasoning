PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E and NE are both possible.  Concretely, since y E z forces z to lie strictly to the left of y and x N y forces x to lie strictly above y, one finds that x must lie strictly to the right of z, and either directly above z as well (NE) or else vertically “within” z’s bounds (E).
