PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E, NE, or SE.  

Explanation (not part of the final answer to be given):  
From “x SE y” one deduces x is strictly to the right and below y. From “y NE z” one deduces y is strictly to the right and above z. Combining these gives that x must lie to the right of z (so directions W, NW, SW, N, S, and B are impossible) but may be either above, below, or vertically contained with respect to z, leaving E, NE, or SE as the only possibilities.
