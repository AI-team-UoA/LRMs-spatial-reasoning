PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B are all possible. The conditions “x NE y” and “y SW z” constrain x and z only insofar as both lie northeast of y and both lie northeast of y’s bounding box, but they do not impose any direct ordering between x and z; hence every single‐tile relation between x and z can be realized.
