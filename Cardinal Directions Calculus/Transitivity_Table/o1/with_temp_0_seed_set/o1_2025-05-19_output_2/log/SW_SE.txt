PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x SW y” forces x to lie strictly below and to the left of y (in bounding‐box terms), while “y SE z” forces y to lie strictly below and to the right of z.  Chaining these gives that x must lie strictly below z (since x < y < z in the vertical direction), but in the horizontal direction x can be anywhere left of, directly underneath, or right of z (as long as x remains strictly below).  

By inspecting the definitions, the only relations that place x strictly below z (and do not require vertical overlap) are S, SW, and SE.  Thus, the possible relations between x and z in this scenario are:  

• S  
• SW  
• SE
