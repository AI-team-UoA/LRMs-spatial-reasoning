PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

S is the only possibility.  In brief, since x B y forces x’s bounding box to lie wholly within y’s bounding box (both horizontally and vertically), and y S z forces y’s bounding box to lie strictly below z’s (but be horizontally contained in z’s), it follows that x must also lie strictly below z (and still be horizontally contained in z).  That is precisely the condition for x S z.
