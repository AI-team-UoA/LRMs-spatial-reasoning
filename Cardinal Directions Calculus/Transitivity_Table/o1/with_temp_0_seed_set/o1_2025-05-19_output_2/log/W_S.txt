PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying x W y means x is strictly to the left of y (their bounding boxes do not overlap in x) yet vertically contained in y’s bounding box. Meanwhile, y S z means y is strictly below z (their bounding boxes do not overlap in y) yet horizontally contained in z’s bounding box.  

Putting these together forces x to lie below z (because x is contained in y vertically and y is below z), and x can either be horizontally contained in z (making x S z) or remain strictly to the left (making x SW z). No other configuration satisfies both x W y and y S z simultaneously.  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• S  
• SW
