{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "S (south) and B (bounding\u2010box) are the only possibilities.  In outline:\n\n\u2022 From \u201cx is S of y\u201d one deduces that horizontally x is within y, but vertically x lies entirely below y  \n  (i.e. supy(x) \u2264 infy(y)).  \n\u2022 From \u201cy is B of z\u201d one deduces that y is horizontally and vertically contained in z.  \n\nPutting these together forces x to lie inside z\u2019s horizontal span (because x \u2286 y and y \u2286 z horizontally).  \nVertically, however, x may or may not lie inside z:  \n\u2013 If infy(z) \u2264 infy(x), then x can also sit inside z\u2019s bounding\u2010box (\u201cx B z\u201d).  \n\u2013 If instead supy(x) \u2264 infy(z), then x lies strictly below z (\u201cx S z\u201d).  \n\nNo other single\u2010tile relation is compatible with those bounding\u2010box constraints.", "elapsed-time": 77.31133580207825, "reasoning-tokens": 6784, "completion-tokens": 7032}
