{"prompt": "If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "E and NE are both possible.  Concretely, since y\u202fE\u202fz forces z to lie strictly to the left of y and x\u202fN\u202fy forces x to lie strictly above y, one finds that x must lie strictly to the right of z, and either directly above z as well (NE) or else vertically \u201cwithin\u201d z\u2019s bounds (E).", "elapsed-time": 96.46002173423767, "reasoning-tokens": 6656, "completion-tokens": 6781}
