{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W of y means x is strictly to the left of y (supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)) but vertically within y\u2019s bounding box (infx(y) \u2264 infy(x) and supy(x) \u2264 supy(y)).  \nB of z means y is fully inside z\u2019s bounding box (infx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 supx(z) and infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 supy(z)).  \n\nFrom these two facts, one sees that x is vertically within z\u2019s bounding box (since x is vertically inside y, which is inside z). Horizontally, x could either lie entirely to the left of z (making x W of z) or lie entirely inside z\u2019s bounding box (making x B of z).  \n\nHence, the possible relations of x to z are: W or B.", "elapsed-time": 52.73535966873169, "reasoning-tokens": 3968, "completion-tokens": 4204}
