{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NW, W, or SW.  \n\nExplanation (informally):  \n\u2022 From x S y, we know x is strictly below y (no vertical overlap) but horizontally \u201cwithin\u201d y.  \n\u2022 From y NW z, we know y is strictly above and to the left of z (no overlap in either direction).  \n\u2022 Putting these together forces x to lie entirely to the left of z (since x \u2286 horizontally in y and y is left of z), but x can be above, aligned, or below z in the vertical direction.  \n\u2022 In single-tile terms, that corresponds exactly to NW, W, or SW.
