{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Narrowing down the possibilities systematically shows that x cannot end up south of z (that would contradict x being above y, which itself lies within z).  The remaining directions that do not lead to any contradiction are  \nB, W, NW, N, NE, E.", "elapsed-time": 83.08472657203674, "reasoning-tokens": 6208, "completion-tokens": 6317}
