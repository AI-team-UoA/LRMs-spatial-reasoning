{"prompt": "If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "x is B of y means that x\u2019s bounding box is contained in y\u2019s bounding box, i.e.  \n  infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) \u2264 supx(x) \u2264 supx(y),  \n  infy(y) \u2264 infy(x) \u2264 supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).  \n\ny is SW of z means that y\u2019s bounding box lies strictly to the left (west) and below (south) of z\u2019s bounding box, i.e.  \n  supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nSince supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) and supy(x) \u2264 supy(y), combining these with supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z) yields  \n  supx(x) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nBy definition, a SW b holds exactly when  \n  supx(a) \u2264 infx(b) and supy(a) \u2264 infy(b).  \n\nHence x SW z is the only possibility.
