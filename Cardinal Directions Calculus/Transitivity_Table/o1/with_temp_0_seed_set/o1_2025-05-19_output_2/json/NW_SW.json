{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Possible relations between x and z must place x strictly to the left of z (since from x NW y and y SW z one deduces supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)).  In the vertical dimension, x could lie above z, below z, or overlap z.  Therefore, the only single\u2010tile cardinal directions that remain possible are SW, W, or NW.", "elapsed-time": 50.91302156448364, "reasoning-tokens": 3584, "completion-tokens": 3712}
