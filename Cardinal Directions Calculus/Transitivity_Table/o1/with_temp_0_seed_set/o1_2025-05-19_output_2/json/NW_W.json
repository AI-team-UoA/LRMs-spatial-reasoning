{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NW of y places x strictly to the left of y and strictly above y. W of z places y strictly to the left of z but vertically within z\u2019s bounding box. Chaining these observations together forces x to lie strictly to the left of z (as x is to the left of y and y is to the left of z) but leaves open whether x is also above z or lies within z\u2019s vertical span. Consequently, x can only be NW or W of z.", "elapsed-time": 62.522867918014526, "reasoning-tokens": 4480, "completion-tokens": 4634}
