{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N, NE, or NW.  \n\nExplanation (informally):  \n\u2022 From \u201cx W y\u201d we know x is entirely to the left of y but shares y\u2019s vertical extent.  \n\u2022 From \u201cy NE z\u201d we know y is up\u2010and\u2010to\u2010the\u2010right of z, so in particular y (and hence x) is above z.  \n\u2022 Consequently, x lies somewhere above z but may be left, right, or horizontally contained, giving precisely the possibilities NW, N, or NE.", "elapsed-time": 69.4248275756836, "reasoning-tokens": 4800, "completion-tokens": 4957}
