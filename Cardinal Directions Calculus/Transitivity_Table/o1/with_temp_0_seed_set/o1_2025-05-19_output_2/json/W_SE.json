{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Satisfying \u201cx is W of y\u201d forces x\u2019s bounding\u2010box to lie strictly to the left of y\u2019s (and vertically within y\u2019s), and \u201cy is SE of z\u201d forces y\u2019s bounding\u2010box strictly to the right of z\u2019s and below z\u2019s.  Putting these together shows that x must lie strictly below z (since x is below y and y is below z) but leaves open whether x is to the left of z, aligned horizontally under z, or to the right of z.  Consequently, the only consistent possibilities are that x is S, SW, or SE of z.", "elapsed-time": 62.77014708518982, "reasoning-tokens": 4352, "completion-tokens": 4514}
