{"prompt": "If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "From the definitions, x\u202fN\u202fy forces x\u2019s bounding box to lie (vertically) strictly above y and be horizontally contained in y. Also, y\u202fW\u202fz forces y\u2019s bounding box to lie (horizontally) strictly to the left of z and be vertically contained in z. Putting these together:\n\n\u2022 Because x is horizontally contained inside y, and y is strictly to the left of z, it follows that x is also strictly to the left of z (so sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(z)).  \n\u2022 Vertically, x may or may not lie entirely within z\u2019s bounding box:  \n  \u2013 If inf\u1d67(x) \u2265 inf\u1d67(z) and sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z), then x is \u201cW\u201d of z.  \n  \u2013 If inf\u1d67(x) \u2265 sup\u1d67(z), then x is \u201cNW\u201d of z.  \n\nHence, the only possible single\u2010tile relations between x and z under those conditions are W or NW.", "elapsed-time": 46.48677945137024, "reasoning-tokens": 3456, "completion-tokens": 3727}
