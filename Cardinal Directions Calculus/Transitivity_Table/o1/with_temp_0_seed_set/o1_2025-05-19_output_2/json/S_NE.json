{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "E, NE, or SE.  \n\nExplanation (informally):  \n\u2022 From x S y we get that x is directly below y (in the bounding\u2010box sense).  \n\u2022 From y NE z we get that y is strictly to the northeast of z: supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(z) \u2264 infy(y).  \n\u2022 Combining these, one deduces supx(z) \u2264 infx(x). Hence x must lie somewhere strictly to the right of z (i.e., x could be E, NE, or SE of z), but the north\u2013south ordering between x and z is not determined by the given information.", "elapsed-time": 32.35750985145569, "reasoning-tokens": 2560, "completion-tokens": 2730}
