{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W (West) or SW (South\u2010West).  \n\nExplanation (informal):  \n\u2022 From x SW y we know x lies strictly to the left of y (supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)) and strictly below y (supy(x) \u2264 infy(y)).  \n\u2022 From y W z we know y lies strictly to the left of z (supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)) and is vertically contained in z.  \n\u2022 Putting these together forces x to be strictly to the left of z (since supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)) but leaves open whether x is also strictly below z (making x SW of z) or instead lines up within z\u2019s vertical extent (making x W of z).
