{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Narrowing down the possibilities systematically shows that x cannot lie strictly to the west of z (W, NW, SW all fail), but all of the following can occur without contradiction:\n\n\u2022 B  (x is \u201ccontained\u201d in z),  \n\u2022 N  (x is north of z),  \n\u2022 S  (x is south of z),  \n\u2022 E  (x is east of z),  \n\u2022 NE (x is northeast of z),  \n\u2022 SE (x is southeast of z).\n\nHence the possible single\u2010tile relations between x and z are {B, N, S, E, NE, SE}.", "elapsed-time": 84.17190337181091, "reasoning-tokens": 9280, "completion-tokens": 9474}
