{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Sifting through the definitions, one finds that \u201cx SE y\u201d means  \n   supx(y) \u2264 infx(x)   and   supy(x) \u2264 infy(y),  \nso x is (horizontally) to the right of y and (vertically) below y. Likewise, \u201cy S z\u201d means  \n   supy(y) \u2264 infy(z)   and   infx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 supx(z),  \nso y is directly below z but horizontally contained within z\u2019s bounding box.\n\nFrom these, one can chain the vertical constraints:\n\n\u2022 supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z)  \n  \u21d2 supy(x) \u2264 infy(z),  \n\nso x must also lie below z.  Horizontally, however, x is only known to be to the right of y; since y is within z\u2019s horizontal span, x might still lie entirely inside z\u2019s horizontal span (\u201cS\u201d case) or be to the right of it (\u201cSE\u201d case).  No other single\u2010tile relation is forced.  \n\nHence, the only possible relations of x to z under those conditions are:  \nS or SE.
