{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Solely from \u201cx is W of y\u201d and \u201cy is SE of z,\u201d one can deduce that x ends up lying strictly below z (because from y\u2019s being SE of z we get supy(y) \u2264 infy(z), and from x\u2019s being W of y we get supy(x) \u2264 supy(y), hence supy(x) \u2264 infy(z)).  However, horizontally, x could be to the left of z, could overlap with z, or could lie to the right of z.  \n\n\u2022 If supx(x) \u2264 infx(z), then x is also to the left of z, so x could be SW of z.  \n\u2022 If infx(z) \u2264 infx(x) and supx(x) \u2264 supx(z), then x is directly below z, so x could be S of z.  \n\u2022 If supx(z) \u2264 infx(x), then x is to the right of z, so x could be SE of z.  \n\nConsequently, the only possible relations of x to z are S, SW, or SE.", "elapsed-time": 73.82824563980103, "reasoning-tokens": 5248, "completion-tokens": 5527}
