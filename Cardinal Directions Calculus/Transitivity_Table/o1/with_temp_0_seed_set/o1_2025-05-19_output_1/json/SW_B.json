{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Basing ourselves strictly on the defining inequalities, one finds that in all consistent placements of x and y (with x SW of y) and y and z (with y B of z), the region x can only be:\n\n\u2022 inside z\u2019s bounding box (B),  \n\u2022 strictly south of z (S),  \n\u2022 strictly southwest of z (SW), or  \n\u2022 strictly west of z (W).\n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction placement of x relative to z can satisfy both x SW y and y B z simultaneously. Thus the possible relations are B, S, SW, W.", "elapsed-time": 97.99546885490417, "reasoning-tokens": 7936, "completion-tokens": 8117}
