{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "SW is \u201csouth\u2010west,\u201d meaning X\u2019s box is strictly to the left and strictly below Y\u2019s box (and similarly Y below Z).  From the inequalities\n\n\u2022 X SW Y \u21d2 sup\u2093(X) \u2264 inf\u2093(Y)  and  sup\u1d67(X) \u2264 inf\u1d67(Y),  \n\u2022 Y SW Z \u21d2 sup\u2093(Y) \u2264 inf\u2093(Z)  and  sup\u1d67(Y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(Z),\n\none can chain these to see\n\n   sup\u2093(X) \u2264 inf\u2093(Y) \u2264 sup\u2093(Y) \u2264 inf\u2093(Z),  \n   sup\u1d67(X) \u2264 inf\u1d67(Y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(Y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(Z).\n\nHence X is also \u201cto the left\u201d and \u201cbelow\u201d Z, so the standard (nondegenerate) outcome is\n\n   X SW Z.\n\nHowever, in degenerate boundary cases (where X collapses to a line or point), X can end up exactly underneath Z (making X S Z) or exactly to the left of Z (making X W Z).  Consequently, the possible single\u2010tile relations between X and Z are:\n\n   { SW, S, W }.", "elapsed-time": 123.49106860160828, "reasoning-tokens": 9472, "completion-tokens": 9788}
