{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Barring the purely \u201csouth\u201d cases, all placements of x above and/or beside z remain possible.  Concretely, from x\u202fNW\u202fy and y\u202fE\u202fz one can derive that x may be\n\n\u2022 NW of z,  \n\u2022 N of z,  \n\u2022 NE of z,  \n\u2022 W of z,  \n\u2022 E of z,  \n\u2022 or B (contained) in z,  \n\nbut not S, SW, or SE of z.", "elapsed-time": 80.99511098861694, "reasoning-tokens": 5824, "completion-tokens": 5976}
