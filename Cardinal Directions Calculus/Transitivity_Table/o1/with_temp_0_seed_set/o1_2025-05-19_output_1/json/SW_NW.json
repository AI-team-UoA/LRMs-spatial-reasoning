{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "SW of y forces x to lie strictly to the left and strictly below y (supx(x) \u2264 infx(y), supy(x) \u2264 infy(y)), while NW of z forces y to lie strictly to the left and strictly above z (supx(y) \u2264 infx(z), supy(z) \u2264 infy(y)).  Combining these only tells us that x is strictly to the left of z (supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)), but does not fix their relative vertical ordering.  Consequently, x can be directly below z (SW), entirely above z (NW), or vertically overlapping and still to the left (W).  Thus, the possible relations of x to z are SW, W, or NW.", "elapsed-time": 55.90874767303467, "reasoning-tokens": 4224, "completion-tokens": 4421}
