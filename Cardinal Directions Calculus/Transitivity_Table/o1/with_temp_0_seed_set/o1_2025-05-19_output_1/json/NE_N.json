{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N and NE are the only possibilities.  In outline:\n\n\u2022 From \u201cx is NE of y\u201d one obtains supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).  \n\u2022 From \u201cy is N of z\u201d one obtains supy(z) \u2264 infy(y).  \n\u2022 Combined, these give supy(z) \u2264 infy(x), so x\u2019s bounding box is strictly above z\u2019s.  \n\nHence x can only be \u201cN\u201d or \u201cNE\u201d of z, depending on how the x\u2010coordinates line up.
