{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W of and E of fix only the horizontal ordering with respect to y (both x and z lie strictly to the left of y) while forcing x, y, z to nest vertically (x inside y, y inside z).  In that situation, x and z can still be arranged horizontally so that\n\n\u2022 x is strictly left of z  \u21d2  x W z,  \n\u2022 z is strictly left of x  \u21d2  x E z,  \n\u2022 or z\u2019s bounding box encloses x\u2019s  \u21d2  x B z.\n\nNo other single-tile relations are consistent with x W y and y E z.", "elapsed-time": 97.79043531417847, "reasoning-tokens": 7552, "completion-tokens": 7743}
