{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Narrowing down all consistent placements shows that x can end up either above, below, to the left, or even contained in z, but never strictly to the right.  Concretely, the relations x can bear to z are exactly  \n{N, NW, W, SW, S, B}.", "elapsed-time": 129.3307387828827, "reasoning-tokens": 9728, "completion-tokens": 9853}
