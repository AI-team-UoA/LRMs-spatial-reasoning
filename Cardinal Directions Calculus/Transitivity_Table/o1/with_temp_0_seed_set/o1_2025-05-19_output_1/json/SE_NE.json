{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Evidently, from \u201cx is SE of y\u201d one obtains sup\u2093(y) \u2264 inf\u2093(x).  \nFrom \u201cy is NE of z\u201d one obtains sup\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y).  \n\nStringing these together (and using inf\u2093(y) \u2264 sup\u2093(y)), one sees  \nsup\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(x).  \n\nHence, x must lie strictly to the right of z (i.e., sup\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(x)).  Because the given information imposes no further forced ordering in the y-dimension between x and z, x can be E, NE, or SE of z.", "elapsed-time": 46.881308794021606, "reasoning-tokens": 3456, "completion-tokens": 3629}
