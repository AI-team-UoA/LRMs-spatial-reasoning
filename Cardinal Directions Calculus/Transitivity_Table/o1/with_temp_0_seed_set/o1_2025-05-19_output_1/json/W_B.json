{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W of y means that x is strictly to the left of y (i.e., sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y)) but vertically within y\u2019s bounding box (in\u0192y(y) \u2264 in\u0192y(x) and sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y)).  \n\nB of z means that y\u2019s entire bounding box is contained within z\u2019s bounding box, i.e., in\u0192\u2093(z) \u2264 in\u0192\u2093(y) \u2264 sup\u2093(y) \u2264 sup\u2093(z) and in\u0192\u1d67(z) \u2264 in\u0192\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z).\n\nPutting these together, one sees that x can either also lie entirely inside z\u2019s bounding box (making x B z) or can lie to the left of z while staying within z\u2019s vertical extent (making x W z).  All other relations are impossible under these constraints. \n\nHence the possible relations between x and z are W or B.", "elapsed-time": 94.82046723365784, "reasoning-tokens": 6656, "completion-tokens": 6911}
