{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N is forced in the vertical dimension (x lies strictly above z), while the horizontal alignment between x and z can be to the left, overlapping, or to the right.  Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are NW, N, or NE.", "elapsed-time": 42.3934268951416, "reasoning-tokens": 3008, "completion-tokens": 3107}
