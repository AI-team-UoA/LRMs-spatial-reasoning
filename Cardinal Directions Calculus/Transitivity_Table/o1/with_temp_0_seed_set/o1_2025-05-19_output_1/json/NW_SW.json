{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NW of y forces x to lie completely to the left of y and above y; SW of z forces y to lie completely to the left of z and below z.  From these it follows that x also lies completely to the left of z (so supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)), but its vertical position relative to z can be above, below, or within z\u2019s bounds.  The only single\u2010tile relations consistent with \u201ccompletely to the left\u201d are NW, W, and SW.  ", "elapsed-time": 51.19671416282654, "reasoning-tokens": 3264, "completion-tokens": 3418}
