{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Sitting \u201cbelow\u201d z is guaranteed (since x is SE of y and y is S of z, it follows that x is also below z).  Horizontally, however, x could either still lie within z\u2019s bounding box or lie entirely to the right of z\u2019s bounding box.  In the single\u2010tile relations given, those two cases correspond exactly to x being S of z (if it is horizontally contained in z) or SE of z (if it is also to the right).  \n\nHence, the only possible single\u2010tile relations of x to z are S or SE.", "elapsed-time": 85.50291585922241, "reasoning-tokens": 6336, "completion-tokens": 6507}
