{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Satisfying \u201cx SE y\u201d gives supx(y) \u2264 infx(x) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y), and \u201cy SW z\u201d gives supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  From these it follows in particular that\n\n\u2022 supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z),  \n\nso x lies entirely below z (i.e., supy(x) \u2264 infy(z)).  However, from supx(y) \u2264 infx(x) and supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) alone, one cannot fix the left\u2010right order of x and z.  Consequently, the only possible relations for x with respect to z, given that x is strictly below z, are S, SW, or SE.", "elapsed-time": 78.95144939422607, "reasoning-tokens": 4352, "completion-tokens": 4570}
