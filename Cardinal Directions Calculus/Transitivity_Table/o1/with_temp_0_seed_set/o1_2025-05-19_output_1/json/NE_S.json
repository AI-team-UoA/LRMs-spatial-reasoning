{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Possible relations are exactly those that do not force x to lie to the left of z (which is impossible, since x is already to the right of y and y is horizontally inside z).  Concretely, x can be S, N, E, NE, SE, or B of z, but cannot be W, SW, or NW.", "elapsed-time": 70.75548005104065, "reasoning-tokens": 5312, "completion-tokens": 5439}
