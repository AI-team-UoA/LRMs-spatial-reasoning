{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NE of y implies x is strictly to the right and above y, and SE of z implies y is strictly to the right and below z.  Putting these together forces x to lie strictly to the right of z but does not fix its vertical placement.  Hence x can be NE, E, or SE of z.", "elapsed-time": 37.57835006713867, "reasoning-tokens": 3136, "completion-tokens": 3248}
