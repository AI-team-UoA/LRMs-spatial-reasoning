PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x SE y” gives supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), and “y SW z” gives supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  From these it follows in particular that

• supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  

so x lies entirely below z (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  However, from supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) alone, one cannot fix the left‐right order of x and z.  Consequently, the only possible relations for x with respect to z, given that x is strictly below z, are S, SW, or SE.
