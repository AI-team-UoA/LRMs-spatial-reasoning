PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NE of y implies x is strictly to the right and above y, and SE of z implies y is strictly to the right and below z.  Putting these together forces x to lie strictly to the right of z but does not fix its vertical placement.  Hence x can be NE, E, or SE of z.
