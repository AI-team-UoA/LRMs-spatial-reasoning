PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

SW is “south‐west,” meaning X’s box is strictly to the left and strictly below Y’s box (and similarly Y below Z).  From the inequalities

• X SW Y ⇒ supₓ(X) ≤ infₓ(Y)  and  supᵧ(X) ≤ infᵧ(Y),  
• Y SW Z ⇒ supₓ(Y) ≤ infₓ(Z)  and  supᵧ(Y) ≤ infᵧ(Z),

one can chain these to see

   supₓ(X) ≤ infₓ(Y) ≤ supₓ(Y) ≤ infₓ(Z),  
   supᵧ(X) ≤ infᵧ(Y) ≤ supᵧ(Y) ≤ infᵧ(Z).

Hence X is also “to the left” and “below” Z, so the standard (nondegenerate) outcome is

   X SW Z.

However, in degenerate boundary cases (where X collapses to a line or point), X can end up exactly underneath Z (making X S Z) or exactly to the left of Z (making X W Z).  Consequently, the possible single‐tile relations between X and Z are:

   { SW, S, W }.
