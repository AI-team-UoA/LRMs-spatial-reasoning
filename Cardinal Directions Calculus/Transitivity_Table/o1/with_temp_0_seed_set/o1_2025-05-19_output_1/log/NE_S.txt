PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible relations are exactly those that do not force x to lie to the left of z (which is impossible, since x is already to the right of y and y is horizontally inside z).  Concretely, x can be S, N, E, NE, SE, or B of z, but cannot be W, SW, or NW.
