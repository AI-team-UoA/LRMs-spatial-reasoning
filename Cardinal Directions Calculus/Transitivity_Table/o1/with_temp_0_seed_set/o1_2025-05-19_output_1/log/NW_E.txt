PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Barring the purely “south” cases, all placements of x above and/or beside z remain possible.  Concretely, from x NW y and y E z one can derive that x may be

• NW of z,  
• N of z,  
• NE of z,  
• W of z,  
• E of z,  
• or B (contained) in z,  

but not S, SW, or SE of z.
