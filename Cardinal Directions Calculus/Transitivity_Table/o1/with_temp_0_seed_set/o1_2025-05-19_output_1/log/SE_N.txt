PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, or B are all possible, but not W, SW, or NW.  

Reason (sketch):  
• x SE y forces x to lie to the right and below y.  
• y N z forces y to lie above z (and horizontally “inside” z’s bounding box).  
• Because y sits inside z horizontally and x is to the right of y, x cannot end up to the left of z, ruling out W, SW, NW.  
• All other directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, or being inside/bounded B) are achievable by making z suitably large or placing x suitably above/below within z’s width.
