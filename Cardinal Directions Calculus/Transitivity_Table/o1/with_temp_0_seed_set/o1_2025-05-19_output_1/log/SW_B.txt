PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Basing ourselves strictly on the defining inequalities, one finds that in all consistent placements of x and y (with x SW of y) and y and z (with y B of z), the region x can only be:

• inside z’s bounding box (B),  
• strictly south of z (S),  
• strictly southwest of z (SW), or  
• strictly west of z (W).

No other cardinal‐direction placement of x relative to z can satisfy both x SW y and y B z simultaneously. Thus the possible relations are B, S, SW, W.
