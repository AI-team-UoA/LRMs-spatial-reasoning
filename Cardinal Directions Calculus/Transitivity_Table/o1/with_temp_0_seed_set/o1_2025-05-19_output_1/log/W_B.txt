PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W of y means that x is strictly to the left of y (i.e., supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)) but vertically within y’s bounding box (inƒy(y) ≤ inƒy(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y)).  

B of z means that y’s entire bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box, i.e., inƒₓ(z) ≤ inƒₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z) and inƒᵧ(z) ≤ inƒᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Putting these together, one sees that x can either also lie entirely inside z’s bounding box (making x B z) or can lie to the left of z while staying within z’s vertical extent (making x W z).  All other relations are impossible under these constraints. 

Hence the possible relations between x and z are W or B.
