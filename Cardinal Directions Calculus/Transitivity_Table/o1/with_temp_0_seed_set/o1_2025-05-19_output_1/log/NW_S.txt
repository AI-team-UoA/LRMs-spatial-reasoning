PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Narrowing down all consistent placements shows that x can end up either above, below, to the left, or even contained in z, but never strictly to the right.  Concretely, the relations x can bear to z are exactly  
{N, NW, W, SW, S, B}.
