PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
• “x SW y” means supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y).  
• “y SE z” means supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).  

In particular,  
• supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z) together imply x is below y and y is below z, so x is certainly below z (ruling out N, NE, NW).  
• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) only tell us that both x and z lie somewhere to the left side of y; it does not fix whether x is further left or right than z, nor whether x might sit entirely inside z’s bounding box, etc.  

Hence the only directions that x cannot have relative to z are those requiring x to lie strictly above z (namely N, NE, NW).  All of the others (B, S, SW, W, E, SE) remain possible.
