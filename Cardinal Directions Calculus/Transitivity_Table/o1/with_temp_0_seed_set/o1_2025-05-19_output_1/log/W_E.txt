PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W of and E of fix only the horizontal ordering with respect to y (both x and z lie strictly to the left of y) while forcing x, y, z to nest vertically (x inside y, y inside z).  In that situation, x and z can still be arranged horizontally so that

• x is strictly left of z  ⇒  x W z,  
• z is strictly left of x  ⇒  x E z,  
• or z’s bounding box encloses x’s  ⇒  x B z.

No other single-tile relations are consistent with x W y and y E z.
