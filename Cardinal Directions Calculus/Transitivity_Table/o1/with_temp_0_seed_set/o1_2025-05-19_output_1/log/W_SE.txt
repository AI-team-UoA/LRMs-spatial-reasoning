PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Solely from “x is W of y” and “y is SE of z,” one can deduce that x ends up lying strictly below z (because from y’s being SE of z we get supy(y) ≤ infy(z), and from x’s being W of y we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y), hence supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  However, horizontally, x could be to the left of z, could overlap with z, or could lie to the right of z.  

• If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is also to the left of z, so x could be SW of z.  
• If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is directly below z, so x could be S of z.  
• If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is to the right of z, so x could be SE of z.  

Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are S, SW, or SE.
