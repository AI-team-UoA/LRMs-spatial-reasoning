PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

S is the only possibility. Indeed, from x B y one has  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
and from y S z one has  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
Combining these yields supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which exactly matches x S z. No other single‐tile relation is compatible with these inequalities.
