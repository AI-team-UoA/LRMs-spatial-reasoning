PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Evidently, from “x is SE of y” one obtains supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x).  
From “y is NE of z” one obtains supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y).  

Stringing these together (and using infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y)), one sees  
supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x).  

Hence, x must lie strictly to the right of z (i.e., supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)).  Because the given information imposes no further forced ordering in the y-dimension between x and z, x can be E, NE, or SE of z.
