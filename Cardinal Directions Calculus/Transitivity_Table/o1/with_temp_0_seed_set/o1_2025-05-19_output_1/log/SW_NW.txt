PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

SW of y forces x to lie strictly to the left and strictly below y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y), supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), while NW of z forces y to lie strictly to the left and strictly above z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Combining these only tells us that x is strictly to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), but does not fix their relative vertical ordering.  Consequently, x can be directly below z (SW), entirely above z (NW), or vertically overlapping and still to the left (W).  Thus, the possible relations of x to z are SW, W, or NW.
