PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N and NW.

Explanation (informally):  
• From x W y we know that x is strictly to the left of y and also that x’s vertical extent is contained within y’s vertical extent. In particular,  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• From y N z we know that y is strictly above z and that y’s horizontal extent is contained within z’s horizontal extent. In particular,  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  and  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

By chaining the vertical inequalities, one sees  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
so x lies entirely above z (no vertical overlap).  Hence x can only be “north-type” (N, NW, or NE) of z.  

Checking horizontal constraints shows that x can fit either directly above z (N) or above-and-left of z (NW).  In particular, x NE z would demand z be still farther left (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), but that contradicts x W y and the fact that y ⊆ z horizontally.  Consequently, the only possible relations are N or NW.
