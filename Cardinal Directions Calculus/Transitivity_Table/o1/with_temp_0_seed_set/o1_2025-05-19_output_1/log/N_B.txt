PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N and B are both possible.  

Explanation (sketch):  
• From x N y, one knows that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
• From y B z, one has infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Combining those, one finds:  
1) It is consistent for supy(z) to lie below (or exactly at) infy(x), so x can be N of z.  
2) It is also consistent for x to fit entirely inside z’s bounding box, so x can be B of z.  

No other single-tile relations satisfy all the bounding‐box constraints.
