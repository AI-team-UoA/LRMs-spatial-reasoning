PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NE and E are the only possibilities.  In brief, from  
• x NE y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• y E z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  

one can combine supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (so x is to the right of z) without fixing whether supy(z) is above or below infy(x).  Thus x can only be NE of z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) or E of z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).
