PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W of (to the left of) y imposes supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and vertical containment infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
Similarly, y W of z imposes supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chain these inequalities:  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)  ⇒  infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

These are precisely the conditions that place x W of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  No other single‐tile relation can hold under those constraints.  

Hence, if x is W of y and y is W of z, then x can only be W of z.
