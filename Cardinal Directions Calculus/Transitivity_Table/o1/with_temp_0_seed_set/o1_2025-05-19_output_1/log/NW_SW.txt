PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NW of y forces x to lie completely to the left of y and above y; SW of z forces y to lie completely to the left of z and below z.  From these it follows that x also lies completely to the left of z (so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), but its vertical position relative to z can be above, below, or within z’s bounds.  The only single‐tile relations consistent with “completely to the left” are NW, W, and SW.
