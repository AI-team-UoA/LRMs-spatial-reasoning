PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that “x NW y” forces x to lie strictly above and to the left of y (i.e.\,supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), while “y N z” forces y to lie strictly above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Chaining these in the vertical direction shows x also lies strictly above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), but horizontally x could either remain to the left of z or be contained (horizontally) within z’s bounding box.  

• If x is also to the left of z, then supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is NW of z.  
• If instead x’s bounding box fits horizontally within z (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then x is N of z.

No other single‐tile cardinal relations are consistent with those initial constraints, so the possible relations between x and z are N or NW.
