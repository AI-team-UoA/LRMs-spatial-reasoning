PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B are all possible. In other words, knowing only that “x is NW of y” and “y is SE of z” does not rule out any of the nine single‐tile relations between x and z.
