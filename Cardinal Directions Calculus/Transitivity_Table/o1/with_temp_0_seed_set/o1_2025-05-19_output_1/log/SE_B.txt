PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x SE y” forces x to lie strictly to the right and below y, and “y B z” forces y to lie fully within z’s bounding box.  Because y itself is inside z, placing x to the right/below y can yield any of the following relative positions of x to z:

• B  (x is fully within z’s bounding box),  
• S  (x is entirely below z),  
• E  (x is entirely to the right of z),  
• SE (x is below and to the right of z).  

No other cardinal directions are consistent with those two constraints. So the possible relations of x to z are {B, S, E, SE}.
