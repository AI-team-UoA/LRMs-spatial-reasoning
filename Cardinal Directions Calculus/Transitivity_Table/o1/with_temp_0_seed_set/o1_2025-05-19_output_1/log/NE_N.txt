PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N and NE are the only possibilities.  In outline:

• From “x is NE of y” one obtains supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• From “y is N of z” one obtains supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
• Combined, these give supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x’s bounding box is strictly above z’s.  

Hence x can only be “N” or “NE” of z, depending on how the x‐coordinates line up.
