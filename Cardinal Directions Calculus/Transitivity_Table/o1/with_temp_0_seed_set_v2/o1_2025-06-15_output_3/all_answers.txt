For r1: N, r2: N, answer: From the given definitions, the only way to chain “x is N of y” and “y is N of z” so as to satisfy one of the listed relations for x and z is  
x N z.  

Here is the brief reasoning:  

• Because x is N of y, we have  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

• Because y is N of z, we have  
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
  - supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

• Combining these gives, in the y‑direction, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so z is below y, which is below x.  

• In the x‑direction, we obtain infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so x’s bounding box is contained “inside” y’s and y’s is contained inside z’s.  

• Checking all definitions shows that the only way these inequalities can be satisfied by one of the nine relations is precisely x N z.  
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: From the definitions, “x N y” implies in particular that  
• x’s bounding‐box is strictly above y’s (that is, supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), and  
• in the x‐direction, x’s bounding‐box is contained within y’s bounding‐box (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).  

Similarly, “y W z” implies that  
• y’s bounding‐box is strictly to the left of z’s (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), and  
• in the y‐direction, y’s bounding‐box is contained within z’s bounding‐box (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

Combining these:

1) Because x is horizontally contained in y (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)) and y is strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), it follows that  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
   This forces x to lie strictly to the left of z in the x‐direction.

2) Vertically, y lies within z’s bounding‐box (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)), while x is strictly above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  However, nothing in these constraints forces x to lie either within z’s vertical extent or completely above it.  Consequently, in the y‐direction, x might either  
   • fit within z’s vertical boundaries (making x “W” of z), or  
   • lie wholly above z (making x “NW” of z).  

All other relations are ruled out by the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which makes x lie strictly to the left of z and therefore cannot be “E”, “NE”, “SE”, “S”, “N”, or “B”), and by the inconsistency one gets if one tries to place x strictly below z (“SW” conflicts with x being above y, which is itself inside z).

Hence the only possible relations between x and z are W or NW.
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: From the definitions, “x N y” means

  1) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

and “y E z” means

  4) supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
  5) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
  6) supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

We want all consistent ways to relate x to z.  Checking each cardinal‐direction definition against (1)–(6) rules out everything except the following two:

• x E z:  
  – We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  – From (4) and (2) we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) holds.  
  – Because (5) says infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and (1) gives supy(y) ≤ infy(x), one can choose z large enough in the y‐direction so that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  – No contradictions arise, so x E z can occur.

• x NE z:  
  – We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
  – As above, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) follows from (4) and (2).  
  – Since (6) gives supy(y) ≤ supy(z) and (1) gives supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we can have supy(y) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x), hence supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is also possible.  
  – Thus x NE z can also occur.

All other directions lead to contradictions once one combines the requirement that x is north of y (so y is strictly below x) with the requirement that y is east of z (so z is strictly to the left of y).  Consequently, the only consistent possible relations of x to z are E or NE.
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: From the given definitions one can show that the only way x can lie relative to z (once x N y and y S z are assumed) is that x is either N, S, or B of z.  In outline:

• From x N y, one has  
  (a) supy(y) ≤ infy(x)   (y is no higher than x),  
  (b) infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)   (x’s box fits within y’s box in the x‐direction).  

• From y S z, one has  
  (c) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (y is no higher than z),  
  (d) infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)   (y’s box fits within z’s box in the x‐direction).  

Combining (b) and (d) shows that x’s bounding box is contained horizontally within z’s bounding box:

  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Hence x cannot be strictly to the East, West, NE, NW, SE, or SW of z, because all those relations require a horizontal separation.  What remains possible are:

1) x N z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)),  
2) x S z (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)),  
3) x B z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)),  

all of which are consistent with the inequalities above.  Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are N, S, or B.
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: From the definitions, “x N y” forces x’s box to lie strictly above y’s (so supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and x is horizontally within y), while “y NW z” forces y’s box to lie strictly above and to the left of z’s (so supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Putting these together implies that x also lies strictly above z (because supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).  Those are exactly the conditions for “x NW z.”  No other cardinal‐direction relation can simultaneously satisfy “x N y” and “y NW z.”  

Hence, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: From the definition of the relations, “x N y” means

• supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Hence x’s bounding box is strictly above y’s, and horizontally x is within (or equal to) y’s bounding box.

Similarly, “y SW z” means

• supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

That places y strictly to the left and below z.  

Combining these:

• Because x is horizontally within y’s bounding box and y is to the left of z, it follows supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
• Thus x must also lie strictly to the left of z (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  

Vertically, we only know x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)), but there is no direct restriction tying x’s vertical position to z’s.  Consequently, depending on whether x ends up entirely below z, entirely above z, or “vertically inside” z’s bounding box, the only consistent possibilities are:

• x SW z (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)),  
• x W z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), or  
• x NW z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

No other cardinal direction can hold under those bounding‐box constraints.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: From the defining constraints one can check that x must lie strictly to the right of z (because from y SE z we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y), and from x N y we also have infx(y) ≤ infx(x), hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  In the vertical direction, nothing forces x to be strictly above, strictly below, or exactly overlapping z, so x could be above z, aligned in y with z, or below z.  

Hence, among the nine relations, the only ones consistent with “x is N of y” and “y is SE of z” are exactly NE, E, or SE between x and z.
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: From the definitions, “x N y” imposes (i) supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is strictly below x) and (ii) infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x’s bounding box is horizontally contained within y’s).  

Meanwhile “y NE z” imposes (i) supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is strictly to the left of y) and (ii) supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is strictly below y).  

Putting these together:

• Since y is below x and z is below y, we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
  Hence supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so z lies strictly below x.  
• Since z lies to the left of y and x is horizontally inside y’s bounding box (infx(y) ≤ infx(x)), we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
  Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so z lies strictly to the left of x.  

Thus x is strictly above and to the right of z; by definition, that is precisely x NE z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: From the definitions, “x N y” means  
1) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

Meanwhile, “y B z” means  
1) infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
2) infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Combining these:

• Horizontal constraints  
  – From y B z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
  – From x N y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
  Together, these imply  
     infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
  Hence, horizontally, x’s bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box.

• Vertical constraints  
  – From y B z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
  – From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
  Thus, y lies within z vertically, and x sits strictly above y (because supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  

What remains undetermined is the relation of supy(x) to supy(z):  
• If supy(x) ≤ supy(z) as well, then x is entirely within z’s bounding box (i.e., x B z).  
• If instead supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x lies strictly north of z (i.e., x N z).  

No other cardinal‐direction definitions can be satisfied given these bounding‐box constraints.  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are only N or B.
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: From the defining inequalities one sees that  
• “x W y” forces x to lie entirely to the left of y (supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)) but with x’s vertical extent contained in y’s (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
• “y N z” forces y to lie entirely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)) but with y’s horizontal extent contained in z’s (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).  

Putting these together shows that x must lie left of y, while y itself lies above z.  A little case‐checking (or explicit examples) then shows that the only ways x can relate to z are:  

• x N z:  x is strictly above z and horizontally contained in z.  
• x NW z: x is strictly above z and also strictly to the left of z.  

No other cardinal‐direction pattern can be made consistent with both x W y and y N z.  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are N or NW.
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: If x is W of y and y is W of z, then chaining the defining inequalities shows that x must also be W of z, and no other of the listed relations can occur. Indeed, from

• x W y ⇒  
  1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
  2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y),

and

• y W z ⇒  
  1) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
  2) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
  3) supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

one obtains

• supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

These exactly satisfy the definition of x W z (left in x, “nested” in y), and they rule out all other directions. Thus the only possible relation between x and z is W.
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: From the definitions, “x W y” means

• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
• supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y),

and “y E z” means

• supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
• supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Combining these tells us two things about x and z:

1) In the y-dimension:  
   From infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) and infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z),  
   we deduce infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z).  
   So in the north–south direction, x’s bounding box is contained within (or coincides with) z’s bounding box.

2) In the x-dimension:  
   We only know supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y), but not how x and z compare directly (x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or horizontally inside z’s box).

Therefore, depending on the exact placement in the x-dimension, region x could be:  
• W of z, if supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
• E of z, if supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x),  
• B of z (i.e., “contained” in z’s bounding box), if infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z) (while also infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z), which we already have).

Hence, the possible relations between x and z under “x W y” and “y E z” are W, E, or B.
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: If x is W of y and y is S of z, then from the y‐coordinate constraints one finds  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
so the top of x is below (or at best touches) the bottom of z.  In other words, x must lie “below” z.  

Depending on how far z extends leftwards in the x‐direction, x may either (i) lie horizontally within z’s bounding box, or (ii) lie entirely to the left of it.  Precisely:

• If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is contained in z’s bounding box horizontally (hence x is S of z).  
• If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the left of z (hence x is SW of z).  

No other cardinal relations are compatible with the fact that x ends up strictly below z (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  Therefore, the only possible relations from x to z in this scenario are S or SW.
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: From the given definitions, “x W y” means:

1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

And “y NW z” means:

1) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
2) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Chain these inequalities to see how x compares with z:

• From x W y we get supx(x) ≤ infx(y).  
• From y NW z we get supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  

Putting them together yields  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
so in particular supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
Hence, horizontally, x lies strictly to the left of z.

Next, look at the vertical coordinates:

• From x W y we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• From y NW z we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Chain these to obtain  
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
Thus the top of z is at or below the bottom of x, so x lies strictly above z in the vertical direction.

Putting these two facts together—x is to the left of z and also above z—matches exactly the definition of x NW z:

x NW z  ⇔  supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

No other cardinal‐direction definition can be satisfied under these constraints, so the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: From the definitions, “x W y” forces x to lie strictly to the left of y but to fit vertically inside y’s bounding‐box.  Likewise, “y SE z” forces y to lie strictly below and to the right of z while fitting horizontally/vertically outside z in just those directions.  One can show by explicit bounding‐box examples that, under these two constraints, x must also lie strictly below z (since x’s vertical extent is contained in y’s, and y is strictly below z).  Furthermore, depending on their respective horizontal placements, x may be left of z, directly under z, or to the right of z—but always below.  Concretely:

• If x is also to the left of z, then x SW z.  
• If x is directly below z, then x S z.  
• If x is below and to the right of z, then x SE z.

All other cardinal‐direction relations fail once one enforces “x W y” and “y SE z.”  Consequently, the only possible relations between x and z are:

SW, S, or SE.
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: From the given definitions, the key facts are:

•  x W y  ⇒  
   1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)         (x is strictly to the left of y),  
   2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (x is “vertically contained” in y).  

•  y NE z ⇒  
   1) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)         (z is strictly to the left of y),  
   2) supy(z) ≤ infy(y)         (z lies strictly below y).  

Because x is vertically contained in y while z is strictly below y, one deduces

   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Hence the top of z’s bounding box lies at or below the bottom of x’s bounding box, so x must be above z (or they just touch at a common horizontal boundary).  No information, however, fixes whether x is left, right, or overlapping in x‐coordinate with z.  Consequently, x can only be one of N, NE, or NW relative to z:

•  N if they overlap horizontally (x is above z).  
•  NE if x is also (strictly) to the right of z.  
•  NW if x is also (strictly) to the left of z.  

No other of the nine cardinal relations can hold under these constraints. Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, or NW.
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: From the definitions it suffices to check, in turn, which of the nine relations could hold between x and z once we know

• x W y means  
  1) supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
  2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
  3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).

• y B z means  
  1) infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z),  
  2) infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

First observe the y‐projection:  
• From x W y we have infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  
• From y B z we have infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  
Putting these together shows  
  infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x)  and  supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Hence in the y‐direction, x’s bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box.

Next look at the x‐projection.  From x W y we know  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y).  
Meanwhile, from y B z we know  
  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y).  
Since infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y), it can happen that

• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z), in which case x is also strictly to the left of z (i.e., x W z), or  
• infₓ(z) ≤ supₓ(x) < infₓ(y), in which case x’s x‐interval may lie partly or wholly inside z’s x‐interval.  

In the second scenario, provided infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z), we get x B z because x’s bounding box in both x and y directions is contained in that of z.

All other cardinal directions fail either because they require x to lie strictly below or above z in the y‐direction (contradicted by infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z)), or require z to lie entirely to one side of x in a way inconsistent with y B z and x W y.

Consequently, the only feasible relations between x and z are  
  W  or  B.
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: From the given definitions, the conditions “x E y” and “y N z” impose the following bounding‐box constraints:

1) x E y ⇒  
   • supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y),  
   • infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (x is vertically contained in y).  

2) y N z ⇒  
   • supy(z) ≤ infy(y)   (y is above z),  
   • infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)   (y is horizontally contained in z).  

Combining these shows that x lies strictly above z (because supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and that x is to the right of y, which is itself contained (horizontally) in z.  The only ways for x to relate to z under these constraints are:

• x N z, provided supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  (x is directly above z, and fits horizontally within z.)  
• x NE z, provided supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  (x is above and to the right of z.)

No other cardinal directions can be satisfied under “x E y” and “y N z.” Thus, the possible relations of x to z are N or NE.
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: From the defining inequalities one sees that, in the vertical direction, x is “contained” in z (since x E y forces x’s y‐interval to lie inside y’s, and y W z forces y’s inside z’s, so x’s y‐interval is also inside z’s).  In the horizontal direction, however, x could still lie strictly to the left of z, strictly to the right of z, or be contained in z’s x‐interval (if z is large enough).  In terms of the given cardinal‐direction definitions, those three possibilities correspond exactly to

• x W z,  
• x E z,  
• x B z.  

No other of the nine relations can arise under the constraints x E y and y W z.
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: If x is E of y and y is E of z, then chaining the defining inequalities shows that x must also be E of z. Concretely, from  
• x E y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• y E z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
one obtains by direct combination:  
supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z),  
which is precisely the definition of x E z. No other cardinal directions satisfy all these chains simultaneously. Thus the only possible relation between x and z is E.
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: From the defining inequalities one can show that, once X is “to the east” of Y and Y is “to the south” of Z, the only ways X can relate to Z (according to the given nine possibilities) are that X is either directly south of Z or south‐east of Z.  In outline:

•  “X E Y” means  
   supx(Y) ≤ infx(X),  
   infy(Y) ≤ infy(X),  
   supy(X) ≤ supy(Y).  
  In particular, the first inequality says X is to the right of Y.

•  “Y S Z” means  
   supy(Y) ≤ infy(Z),  
   infx(Z) ≤ infx(Y),  
   supx(Y) ≤ supx(Z).  
  In particular, the first inequality says Y is below Z.

Putting these together forces X to lie (at least) below Z because  
  supy(X) ≤ supy(Y) ≤ infy(Z).  

Hence in the vertical direction, X must lie entirely beneath Z.  Horizontally, however, X could still be either contained within Z’s horizontal extent (which would make X “S” of Z) or lie all the way to the right (which would make X “SE” of Z).  No other cardinal‐direction configuration can arise from those two premises.  

Therefore, if X is E of Y and Y is S of Z, then X can only be S or SE of Z.
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: From the given definitions, one can show that if x is E of y and y is NW of z, then x must lie strictly above z (since y is above z, and x in turn is vertically “within” y).  In the language of those definitions, “strictly above” means that the top edge of z’s bounding box is no higher than the bottom edge of x’s bounding box.  

Concretely:

•  x E y ⇒  
   1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y),  
   2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (x is vertically within y).

•  y NW z ⇒  
   1) supx(y) ≤ infx(z)   (y is to the left of z),  
   2) supy(z) ≤ infy(y)   (z is below y).

From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we deduce  
supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
so z’s bounding box lies strictly below x’s bounding box in the y-direction.

That leaves only the three “north”-type directions for x relative to z, namely NW, N, or NE, depending on how x’s and z’s bounding boxes compare in the x-direction:

•  x NW z if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
•  x N  z if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
•  x NE z if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Hence the possible relations of x to z are NW, N, or NE.
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: From the given definitions, the key fact is that “x is E of y” forces x’s bounding‐box entirely to the right of y’s, and “y is SW of z” forces y’s bounding‐box entirely below and to the left of z’s.  Concretely:

• x E y means supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x), infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x), and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  
• y SW z means supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).

From supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z), it follows that  
supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
so x’s bounding‐box lies strictly below z’s bounding‐box (no vertical overlap).  Once x is strictly below z, the only remaining possibilities under the definitions are that x is:  
• directly South (S) of z (if, horizontally, x’s bounding‐box is contained in z’s),  
• South‐West (SW) of z (if x is also to the left), or  
• South‐East (SE) of z (if x is also to the right).

No other cardinal‐direction relation is consistent with “x below z” in this framework.  Consequently, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, or SE.
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: From the defining inequalities, one sees that “x E y” implies, in particular,  
1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y),  
2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (x’s bounding box is vertically contained in y’s).  

Meanwhile, “y SE z” implies  
3) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   (y is to the right of z),  
4) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (y is below z).  

Putting (1) and (3) together gives  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so supx(z) ≤ infx(x). In other words, z lies to the left of x.  

On the vertical side, from 2) and 4),  
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
so the top of x is at or below the bottom of z.  Hence x is strictly below z.  

Together, “x is to the right of z” and “x is below z” is precisely the definition of “x SE z.”  No other cardinal‐direction conditions can be satisfied under these bounding‐box constraints.  

Therefore, if x is E of y and y is SE of z, then x can only be SE of z.  
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: From the given definitions, let us collect the key inequalities imposed by  
• x E y (i.e., “x is east of y”), and  
• y NE z (i.e., “y is northeast of z”),  
then see what they force about x and z.

1)  x E y  means (by definition):  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
   Geometrically, y’s bounding box is fully to the left of x’s bounding box, and in the vertical direction, x is “contained” within y.

2)  y NE z  means (by definition):  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
   Geometrically, z’s bounding box is fully southwest of y’s bounding box: z is both to the left (in x) and below (in y) of y.

Put these into a single chain.  From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
So z is leftmost, then y, then x (no horizontal overlaps).

Next, from supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
Hence the top of z lies at or below the bottom of y, and the bottom of x lies at or above the bottom of y.  Consequently, z lies strictly below x in the vertical direction (their bounding boxes do not overlap vertically).

Checking each of the nine possible relations between x and z shows that only “x NE z” can hold.  Indeed, to have x NE z one needs  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
both of which follow from the chains above (z is to the left of x and below x).  None of the other eight relations can occur, because they all require one or more inequalities that contradict the above chains.

Answer: the only possible cardinal‐direction relation between x and z is NE.
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: From the given definitions, we know that  
• “x E y” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x) , infy(y) ≤ infy(x) , and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• “y B z” means  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) , supx(y) ≤ supx(z) , infy(z) ≤ infy(y) , and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

We want the possible relation(s) between x and z.  

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Vertical (y‑)constraints
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From x E y, we have  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

From y B z, we have  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chaining these together shows  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
Hence, in the y‑direction, the bounding box of x is contained within that of z.  

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Horizontal (x‑)constraints
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From x E y we have  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  

From y B z we have  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Notice that supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) by themselves do not force a single strict ordering between x and z along the x‑axis, because supx(z) can be either smaller than, equal to, or larger than infx(x). Consequently, there are two possible scenarios for x relative to z in the x‑direction:

(a) x is still to the right (E) of z if supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
(b) x is horizontally contained within z if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Checking which relations are possible
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Because in the y‑direction we already have infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), this rules out “x N z” or “x S z” (and likewise the diagonal variants “NE,” “SE,” “NW,” “SW”) since those would require disjoint bounding boxes in the y‑direction. In particular, none of those can hold once we know x’s bounding box is vertically contained in z’s.  

That leaves only two viable relations:

• B (“bounding box inside”): x B z holds if x’s bounding box is wholly inside z’s in both directions, i.e.  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z),  
  along with infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  This is perfectly possible.  

• E (“to the East”): x E z holds if  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
  and also infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  This can also happen if z’s bounding box does not extend as far right as x’s bounding box begins.  

Hence the only possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z, given that x E y and y B z, are  
B or E.
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: From the horizontal‐bounding constraints, chaining “x S y” and “y N z” forces  
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
Hence x’s box is horizontally contained in z’s box (no east/west separation).  

Thus, x and z can only differ by their vertical positioning.  In particular, the three ways x can relate vertically to z (while remaining horizontally inside) correspond exactly to the relations S, N, or B:

• x S z if supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• x N z if supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
• x B z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

No other cardinal direction requires mere containment in the horizontal direction, so the only possible relations are S, N, or B.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: From the definitions, the key facts are:

• “x S y” forces x to lie strictly below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and horizontally within or equal to y (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).  
• “y W z” forces y to lie strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and vertically within or equal to z (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

Combining these:

1. Since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), it follows that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Hence, x is strictly to the left of z (no horizontal overlap).

2. Vertically, x could be either entirely below z (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) or could lie partly or fully in the vertical extent of z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  

Checking against the definitions of the nine cardinal relations reveals that, when one region a is strictly to the left of another region b (i.e., supx(a) ≤ infx(b)), the only relevant relations among the nine listed are “a W b” or “a SW b”:  
• a W b ⇒ supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and vertically a lies within b’s bounding box.  
• a SW b ⇒ supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and also supy(a) ≤ infy(b).  

No other relation can hold once we know a is strictly to the left of b. Consequently, given x S y and y W z, the only possible relations between x and z are:  

W or SW.
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: From the given definitions, one can combine the bounding‐box constraints for  
• x S y  (i.e.  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ),  
• y E z  (i.e.  supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) ),  

to see what relations between x and z remain possible.  In particular, chaining the x‐coordinates gives  
 supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so z lies strictly to the left (or possibly just touches) the bounding box of x.  

Checking each potential relation of x to z in turn shows that the only consistent ones are precisely E, NE, or SE.  All other relations (S, N, W, NW, SW, B) lead to contradictions when combined with supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence, the possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z are:  
E, NE, SE.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: If x is S of y and y is S of z, then by definition:

1) From x S y, we have  
   • supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
   • infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   • supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

2) From y S z, we have  
   • supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
   • infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
   • supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Chain these together:

• supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  
  implies supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

• infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
  and  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  
  imply infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

Hence x’s bounding box is horizontally within z’s, and vertically x is still entirely below z (because supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  That is precisely the definition of x S z.  None of the other relations can hold under these conditions.  

So, the only possible cardinal‐direction relation of x to z is S.
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: From the two given constraints

1) x S y, i.e.  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  

2) y NW z, i.e.  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y),

we can combine them as follows:

• From x S y we know that x lies strictly below y (or touches from below), and horizontally x is contained within y’s bounding box.  
• From y NW z we know that y lies strictly to the left of z (or touches from the left), and z is strictly below y (or touches from below).

In particular, supx(y) ≤ infx(z) means that everything in y’s bounding box (including x, which is horizontally contained in y) is to the left of (or touches) z.  Hence:

   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).

So, horizontally, x cannot overlap with z; x is entirely to the left of z (possibly just touching).  Vertically, however, there is no direct ordering forced between x and z, because both lie “below y,” but the data do not say which one is lower or higher (or if they might fit one inside another).

Recalling the definitions of the nine cardinal‐direction relations, the only ones compatible with “x is completely to the left of z” (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) are:

• x SW z  if additionally  supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• x W z   if additionally  infy(z) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(z),  
• x NW z  if additionally  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Since our hypotheses do not fix the vertical ordering between x and z (nor rule out one wholly containing the other vertically), all three of SW, W, NW are consistent with the given setup.  

Answer: The possible cardinal‐direction relations from x to z are precisely NW, W, or SW.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions,  
•  x S y entails  
   1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
   2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

•  y SW z entails  
   1) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   2) supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Because (1) and (3) of x S y together with (1) of y SW z imply supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), it follows that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Similarly, (1) of x S y and (2) of y SW z give supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Those two inequalities,  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
are exactly the defining conditions for x SW z.  

Hence, if x is S of y and y is SW of z, then the only possible cardinal‐direction relation between x and z is SW.
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: From the definitions, “x S y” means

1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y),

while “y SE z” means

4) supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and  
5) supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Chain (1) and (5) in the y‐coordinate:

• supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  
  ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hence x is strictly below z.  
Chain (2) and (4) in the x‐coordinate:

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
  ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Hence x is strictly to the right of z.  

Putting these together shows that x is simultaneously below and to the right of z.  By the definitions of the cardinal directions, that is exactly “x SE z,” and none of the other relations can hold under these strict inequalities.  Therefore, the only possible relation is SE.
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: From the given definitions, the key constraint is that x S y implies

1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y),

while y NE z implies

4) supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and  
5) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Chaining (2) with (4) gives supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), i.e. supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means x must lie strictly to the right of z in the x-dimension.  Once supx(z) ≤ infx(x) holds, the only possible cardinal relations (from the list N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, SW, B) that place x strictly to the right of z are precisely NE, E, or SE, depending on their relative positioning in the y-dimension (above, overlapping/contained, or below, respectively).  

Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are NE, E, or SE.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: From the definitions, x S y means:  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

Thus x lies entirely below y (possibly just touching at the boundary) but is horizontally within y’s bounding box.  

Also, y B z means:  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
• supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
• supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence y’s entire bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box.  

Putting these together:

1) Horizontally, since x is within y’s bounding box and y is within z’s bounding box, it follows that x is also horizontally within z’s bounding box (so the horizontal constraints needed for either x S z or x B z can both be satisfied).

2) Vertically, because x is below y and y is contained in z, two main cases can occur with respect to z’s vertical extent:  
   • If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is also entirely below z, which makes x S z.  
   • If supy(x) > infy(z) and infy(x) ≥ infy(z) (so that x’s entire bounding box fits within z’s), then x B z.  

No other cardinal‐direction relation (e.g. W, NW, etc.) can hold because x is already horizontally “under” y (and hence under z). Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z, given x S y and y B z, are:

S or B.
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: From the defining inequalities it follows that x must lie above z (because x is above y and y is above z), so any relation requiring x to be below z (S, SE, SW) is impossible.  Beyond that, the horizontal positioning of x relative to z is not forced: since x is to the left of y and y sits “above” z, no constraint forbids x from being anywhere to the left or right of z, nor from being contained within z (if z is large enough).  

Consequently, the relations between x and z that are compatible with “x NW y” and “y N z” are precisely those that place x above z in some allowable horizontal position or contained in z’s bounding box.  Concretely, the possible relations are:

• N  (x is directly north of z),  
• NW (x is north‐west of z),  
• NE (x is north‐east of z),  
• W  (x is west of z but vertically within z’s bounding box),  
• E  (x is east of z but vertically within z’s bounding box),  
• B  (x is contained in the bounding box of z).

Hence the answer is: N, NE, E, NW, W, B.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: From the definitions, “x NW y” means  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

Likewise, “y W z” means  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

From the horizontal parts of these two relations, one obtains  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
so in particular, supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
This forces x to lie strictly to the left of z, eliminating all directions that would require any overlap or containment in the horizontal dimension.  

Next, we check the possible vertical placements of x relative to z.  For a region a to be (strictly) W, NW, or SW of b, one needs supx(a) ≤ infx(b).  We already have that condition (with a = x, b = z), so x can only be W, NW, or SW of z.  

• To be SW of z, x would also have to satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  However, y is supposed to lie inside z’s vertical extent (because y W z requires infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)), and y is also strictly below x (since supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  Placing x strictly below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) would force y (which is below x) out of z’s bounding box, contradicting y W z.  Hence x cannot be SW of z.  

• To be NW of z, one requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (already true) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  There is no contradiction in having z (and therefore y) strictly below x in the vertical dimension, so NW is possible.  

• To be W of z, one requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (already true) and that x’s vertical bounding box lie within z’s vertical bounding box, i.e. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  That too can happen if z’s bounding box is tall enough to contain x above y.  

Therefore, the only plausible outcomes are  
  x NW z  or  x W z.
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: From the two given facts

1) x NW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
2) y E z  ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

one can show that x can only be “north‑oriented” or “contained” relative to z, but not “south‑oriented.”

■ Reasoning in brief

• Because x NW y , x must lie left (west) of y and above (north of) y.  
  – “Left” comes from supx(x) ≤ infx(y).  
  – “Above” comes from supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

• Because y E z , y must lie to the right (east) of z and be vertically contained within z.  
  – “Right” comes from supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  
  – “Vertical containment” comes from infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

No direct constraints force x to be below z. In particular, any relation requiring supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (such as S, SW, or SE) is ruled out, because x must sit above y, which is itself inside z’s vertical range.

On the other hand, it is consistent for x to be anywhere “north‑oriented” of z (NW, W, N, NE, E) or even fully contained by z (the B relation), provided z is large enough to include both x and y in its bounding box.  

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• NW, • W, • N, • NE, • E, • B  

and nothing else.
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: From the two given constraints

• x NW y  ⇔  (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))  and  (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)),  
• y S z   ⇔  (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))  and  (infx(z) ≤ infx(y))  and  (supx(y) ≤ supx(z)),

one can construct examples showing that x may lie North (N), South (S), West (W), North‑West (NW), South‑West (SW), or be “contained” in the bounding box (B) of z.  In contrast, placing x to the East, North‑East, or South‑East of z is incompatible with x NW y and y S z.

Concretely, one finds that the possible relations of x to z consistent with x NW y and y S z are exactly:  
N, S, W, NW, SW, B.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: From the definitions, “x NW y” means  
(1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  (2) supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

Similarly, “y NW z” means  
(3) supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  (4) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

We want to see what follows about x and z.  

• From (1) and the fact that infx(y) ≤ supx(y), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
  Then from (3), supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
  Chaining these gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

• From (4) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x) in (2), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
  Hence supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Putting these two together,  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
is exactly the definition that x is NW of z.  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold once one checks the necessary bounding‐box constraints (in particular, one finds that x must be both left of and above z, ruling out N, W, inside (B), etc.).  

Therefore, if x is NW of y and y is NW of z, the only possible relation between x and z is again NW.
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: NW, W, or SW.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: From the definitions, “x NW y” means  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is completely to the left of y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (y is completely below x).  

Also, “y SE z” means  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  (y is completely to the left of z), and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  (y is completely below z).  

From these we can deduce:

1) Since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), chaining gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
   Thus, x is entirely to the left of z in the x-dimension.

2) In the y-dimension, we only know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but nothing tells us whether x lies above, below, or within z’s vertical span.  

Hence, in the x-direction, x must lie to the left of z.  Depending on how their y-ranges compare, x can be:  
• NW of z (if x is also above),  
• W of z (if x’s vertical bounding box is contained in z’s), or  
• SW of z (if x is also below).  

No other cardinal directions are consistent with supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are NW, W, or SW.
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: From the definitions, “x NW y” means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
and “y NE z” means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

From supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), we can chain  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
so supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
Hence, in the vertical (y)‐direction, x must lie strictly above z, ruling out all relations other than N, NW, or NE (because those are precisely the ones in which the first region is north of the second).  

• N(x, z) would also require that z’s bounding box “covers” x in the horizontal direction (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  
• NW(x, z) would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
• NE(x, z) would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Because we do not know the horizontal‐axis ordering of x and z (only that both lie to the left of y), any of these three horizontal configurations could in principle occur.  

Therefore, the only possible relations of x to z are N, NW, or NE.
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: From the two hypotheses

• x NW y, i.e.  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x),

• y B z, i.e.  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)   and   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

one can check each of the nine cardinal‐direction definitions for the pair (x,z).  A brief outline of why NW, N, W, or B are all the possibilities (and the others cannot hold) is as follows.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Checking x NW z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For x NW z we need  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

From x NW y we already know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).  If z’s bounding box extends no farther left than y’s (that is infx(z) = infx(y)), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z) can hold.  

On the y‐side, y B z implies supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  Since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) also holds (from x NW y), if z’s top matches y’s top (supy(z) = supy(y)), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is satisfied.  Hence x NW z can occur.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) Checking x N z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For x N z we need  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(x),   infx(z) ≤ infx(x),   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

We already have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (since y B z).  If supy(z) = supy(y), then indeed supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  There is no contradiction preventing infx(x) from lying within [infx(z), supx(z)] (z can be large enough to “cover” x in the x‐direction).  So x N z is possible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Checking x W z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For x W z we require  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z),   infy(z) ≤ infy(x),   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

From x NW y we get supx(x) ≤ infx(y).  If infx(z) = infx(y), that forces supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  Also y B z gives infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and does not conflict with infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  Hence infy(z) ≤ infy(x) can hold, and similarly supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can hold if z is tall enough.  So x W z is possible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) Checking x B z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For x B z we need x’s bounding box to be inside z’s, i.e.  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)  
   and  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Again, because y B z and x NW y only fix  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y),   supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),
nothing rules out the possibility that x itself also lies completely in (or on) z’s bounding box (z can be “large enough” in both directions).  So x B z is consistent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) Why the other directions fail
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A quick look at the other five relations (S, SE, E, NE, SW) shows each either forces a left‐right or lower‐upper ordering that is incompatible with x NW y and y B z.  For instance:

• x SW z would require x to be both strictly left (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and strictly below (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) of z; but from x NW y and y B z, one deduces x must lie above y, and y is inside z, which forces x to be at least partly above z’s bottom—a contradiction with supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

• x NE z, x E z, x SE z similarly force impossible “right‐boundary ≤ left‐boundary” chains when combined with supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and the fact that y ⊆ z’s bounding box, etc.

• x S z would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but again x NW y plus y B z forces x to sit strictly above y (so supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) while y is inside z, contradicting x being entirely below z’s bottom.

Putting all of these checks together, on the hypotheses x NW y and y B z, the only consistent possibilities are:  
   x NW z,   x N z,   x W z,   or   x B z.
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: All nine of the listed relations can occur.  In essence, knowing only that x is SW of y and y is N of z does not impose enough constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z to rule out any of the nine possibilities (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B).  By suitably choosing shapes and sizes for the three regions (all homeomorphic to disks), one can realize each of the nine relations between x and z.
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: From the definitions, “x SW y” means  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is left of y), and  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  (x is below y).  

Similarly, “y W z” means  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  (y is left of z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)  (y is vertically contained in z).  

Putting these together shows that x must also lie to the left of z, because  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

Hence x is somewhere strictly west of z.  The only question is whether x lies entirely below z (making x SW z) or instead fits “within” z’s vertical extent (making x W z).  

• x SW z happens if, in addition to being left of z, we also have supy(x) ≤ infy(z), i.e., x lies completely below z.  
• x W z happens if supy(x) ≤ supy(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x), so that x’s bounding box is left of but vertically within that of z.  

No other cardinal‐direction constraints can be satisfied under these assumptions (for instance, x cannot end up north of z, or bounding‐box–contained by z, etc.).  

Therefore, the only possible relations between x and z, given x SW y and y W z, are  
W or SW.  
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: From the definitions one can show that the only impossible “x ? z” relations under  
• x SW y  ⇔  supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y E z   ⇔  supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  

are exactly the ones demanding x be strictly above z (namely N, NE, NW) or else sit strictly above and to one side (SE).  All of the remaining five relations,

• x SW z ,  
• x W z  ,  
• x S z  ,  
• x B z  ,  
• x E z  ,

can be satisfied by suitably positioning the three regions.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are precisely SW, W, S, E, or B.
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Syntactically, from  
• x SW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y S z  ⇒ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  

one can chain “supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)” to see that x must lie strictly below z (so x is “south” of z in the vertical sense).  Horizontally, however, there is no forced inclusion or disjointness, because knowing supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) does not force supx(x) to be either strictly less than, equal to, or greater than infx(z).  By suitable choices of widths of y and z, x can fall entirely to the left of z (SW), directly below z (S), or to the right of z (SE).  

Hence, the possible relations of x to z are:  
S, SW, SE.
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: From the definition of the SW and NW relations, we have:

• x SW y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
• y NW z  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

From these it follows that  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
so supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

Hence x is strictly to the left (west) of z (they do not overlap in x).  Depending on how x and z line up vertically, one can realize each of the following three relations:

• x SW z  (if also supy(x) ≤ infy(z)),  
• x W z   (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)),  
• x NW z  (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

No other cardinal‐direction relations are possible once supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  Thus the possible relations between x and z are exactly SW, W, or NW.
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions, “x SW y” means  
(1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  

and “y SW z” means  
(2) supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

We want the possible relation(s) between x and z.  

Step 1: Combine the x‐coordinates.  
From (1) we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y).  
Since infx(y) ≤ supx(y) always holds for a non‐degenerate region, it follows that  
supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
Then from (2) supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so chaining these gives  
supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
which simplifies to  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

Step 2: Combine the y‐coordinates.  
From (1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y), and again infy(y) ≤ supy(y) implies  
supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
Then from (2) supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so chaining these yields  
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
hence  
supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Step 3: Identify the cardinal direction from x to z.  
By definition, “x SW z” holds exactly if  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
We have just shown both of these inequalities; therefore x SW z.  

Moreover, one checks that none of the other cardinal directions (S, W, etc.) can be forced under these assumptions, because x’s bounding box is strictly to the left and below z’s bounding box, ruling out any overlap that would be needed for S or W, etc.  

Conclusion:  
If x is SW of y and y is SW of z, then x must also be SW of z. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: From the definitions, we know that  
• x SW y means supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y).  
• y SE z means supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).  

In particular, supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z) together imply  
supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
so supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  
This means x must lie entirely below z in the vertical direction.  

Horizontally, however, we only know that both supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y); that does not tell us how x compares to z (x could be farther left, farther right, or within z’s x‐extent).  

Therefore, the only cardinal directions consistent with “x is strictly below z” (supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z)) and no further horizontal constraints are:  
• S (x below z, horizontally within z),  
• SW (x below and to the left of z),  
• SE (x below and to the right of z).  

No other direction is possible under these definitions and constraints.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: From the defining inequalities one can see that “x SW y” and “y NE z” only tell us that both x and z lie (in bounding‐box terms) southwest of y.  They impose no further direct constraint on how x and z compare to one another; for example, x could lie anywhere “around” z (including bounding or being bounded by z).  Consequently, all nine relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) remain possible between x and z.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: From the defining inequalities it follows that “x SW y” means  
  1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  
  2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
i.e. x’s bounding box lies strictly to the left of and strictly below y’s bounding box.  

Meanwhile, “y B z” means  
  1) infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   2) supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
  3) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   4) supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
so y’s bounding box is contained inside z’s bounding box.

Putting these together leaves open exactly four ways x’s bounding box can lie relative to z’s bounding box:

• x SW z, if x also lies entirely to the left and entirely below z (i.e. supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  
• x W z, if x is disjoint to the left but still within z’s vertical extent (supx(x) ≤ infx(z), yet infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  
• x S z, if x is disjoint below but within z’s horizontal extent (supy(x) ≤ infy(z), yet infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  
• x B z, if z is large enough to contain x entirely, so that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Hence, from “x SW y” and “y B z”, the possible cardinal‐direction relations of x to z are exactly  
SW, W, S, or B.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: From the bounding‐box definitions, saying “x is SE of y” and “y is N of z” gives us only that  
• x lies strictly to the right and strictly below y,  
• y lies strictly above z.  

No direct constraint is imposed on the relative positions of x and z.  In particular, one can “place” z large enough (and suitably positioned) so that any of the nine cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) between x and z is consistent with x SE y and y N z.  Consequently, all nine are possible.
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: From the given definitions one sees that  
•  x SE y means  supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)  and  supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
•  y W z  means  supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z),  infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y),  and  supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  

We then ask which relations x ? z can satisfy under these two hypotheses.  A quick way to see which directions remain possible is to note that “x SE y” forces x to lie to the right and below y, while “y W z” forces y to lie to the left and (in the vertical sense) within z.  One can check systematically (or by concrete examples) which of the nine relations x ? z can still hold.  

•  N, NE, NW lead to contradictions, because they would require x to lie above z (whereas x is below y, which in turn sits inside z vertically).  
•  All of B, S, SW, W, E, SE can be realized by suitable placements.  

Hence the possible relations between x and z are precisely  
B, S, SW, W, E, SE.  
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: From the given definitions, the key geometric facts are:

•  x SE y means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
   In words, y’s box ends (in the x‐direction) before x’s box starts, and x’s box ends (in the y‐direction) before y’s box starts.

•  y E z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   and   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   In words, z’s box ends before y’s starts (in the x‐direction), and y’s box is vertically contained in z’s box.

Chain these two:

1)  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  
   Together imply  supx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
   So in the x‐direction, z’s box is to the left of x’s box.

2)  supy(x) ≤ infy(y)   while   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   Since y is contained vertically in z, we only know x is below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), but we do not get a forced ordering between x and z in the y‐direction.  In particular, x could lie entirely below z, or else fit (vertically) inside z, depending on where x sits.

Reviewing the definitions of the nine cardinal relations shows that:

•  For x to be “to the right” of z in these relations, one needs supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
   That rules out W, NW, SW, etc.

•  Among E, NE, SE:  
   –  x NE z would require x also lie entirely above z, i.e. supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
      This contradicts y ⊂ z and x below y.  
   –  x E z requires x be horizontally to the right of z (which we have) and also be vertically contained by z, i.e.  
        infy(z) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
      That is possible if x happens to lie within z’s vertical extent.  
   –  x SE z requires x be horizontally to the right of z and also below z, i.e.  
        supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
      That is likewise possible if x happens to lie entirely below z.

Hence, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations consistent with  
“x SE y and y E z”  
are  
E and SE.
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: From the given definitions, the conditions “x SE y” and “y S z” translate into the following bounding‐box inequalities:

• x SE y means  
  (1) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)   and   (2) supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y).  

• y S z means  
  (3) supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
  (4) infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
  (5) supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).  

We wish to see what these imply about x relative to z.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Vertical (y)‐coordinate reasoning
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From (2) and (3) we have

   supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y)   and   supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).

Because infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) in any nondegenerate region y, this chain implies

   supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).

Hence in the y‐direction, x lies at or below y, which in turn lies at or below z.  
In particular, supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z), so x is vertically no higher than the bottom of z.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Horizontal (x)‐coordinate reasoning
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From (1) we have

   supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x),

so x is to the right of y.  
Meanwhile, (4) and (5) say that y is horizontally inside z’s bounding box:

   infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y)   and   supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).

However, these do not pin down where x lies relative to z in the x‐direction, because x could still lie inside or to the right of z’s x‐extent.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Possible relations of x to z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

To check each candidate relation a ? b, we apply its defining bounding‐box inequalities with a = x and b = z:

• x S z requires  
  supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z),   infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x),   supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z).  
  We already have supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z), and it is certainly possible that z’s bounding box is wide enough (because y is contained horizontally in z) to satisfy infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z).  So S is possible.

• x SE z requires  
  supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)   and   supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  
  We already know supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  It can also happen that z’s right boundary supₓ(z) is still ≤ infₓ(x) (i.e., z is not as far right as x).  Thus SE is also possible.

By contrast, attempting to place x in any other cardinal direction (N, NE, E, W, NW, SW, or B) from z contradicts at least one bounding‐box requirement once we use x’s being to the right of y and y’s being below z.  In particular, one sees that:

• x cannot be N or NE of z, since x is below z.  
• x cannot be W or NW of z, since x is to the right of y (and y is within z’s box).  
• x cannot be E of z, because that would require vertical overlap in a range where in fact x is well below z.  
• x cannot be SW of z for the same reason (it would require x to be left of z).  
• x cannot be B of z (contained by z’s bounding box), because x’s top lies at or below z’s bottom (no vertical overlap).

Hence, the only possible directions of x relative to z, given x SE y and y S z, are  
S or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: From the defining inequalities one sees that “x SE y” and “y NW z” only constrain x and z relative to y, but do not fix x and z with respect to one another.  Concretely:

•  x SE y says  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
  That pins x to the right and below of y (or just touching it).

•  y NW z says  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
  That pins z to the right and below of y (or just touching it).

Nothing above forces an ordering between x and z.  In particular, one can choose bounding boxes so that x is to the left/right of z, above/below z, or even one bounding box completely inside the other—thus any of the nine relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) can be realized between x and z. Consequently, all nine cardinal‐direction relations remain possible between x and z.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: From the defining inequalities one can see that “x SE y” forces x to lie strictly to the right and strictly below y (i.e., supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), while “y SW z” forces y to lie strictly to the left and strictly below z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).  

Putting these together shows that x is necessarily below z (since x is below y and y is below z), but in the horizontal direction x could lie to the left of z, lie to the right of z, or be horizontally contained by z.  Translating this into the given cardinal‐relation definitions:

• If x is entirely left of z, then x SW z.  
• If x is entirely right of z, then x SE z.  
• If x is horizontally contained by z, then x S z.  

No other cardinal directions are compatible with “x is strictly below z.”  Hence the possible relations between x and z are exactly  
S, SW, or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: SE is defined by the pair of inequalities  
  supx(b) ≤ infx(a)  and  supy(a) ≤ infy(b).  

Given x SE y and y SE z, we have:  
1)  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)     and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2)  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)     and   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Because supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Similarly, from supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get  
  supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

These two inequalities, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), are precisely the defining conditions for x SE z. Hence the only possible relation of x to z in this scenario is SE.
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: From the definition of “x SE y,” we have  
(1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  (2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  

From the definition of “y NE z,” we have  
(3) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  (4) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Focus first on the x‐coordinates.  From (1) and (3) and the usual fact infx(y) ≤ supx(y), one obtains  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
Hence, viewed purely in the x‐direction, z lies to the left of x (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  

Turning to the y‐coordinates, the conditions supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) do not force a strict ordering between supy(x) and supy(z).  Consequently, one cannot pin down whether x is above, below, or (vertically) “inside” z solely from (2) and (4).  

By checking each of the nine cardinal relations against the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x), the only possibilities that do not lead to contradiction are:  
• x E z, which requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and (in the y‐direction) infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z),  
• x NE z, which requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
• x SE z, which requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

All other relations require x to be at least partly to the left of z or impose y‐constraints incompatible with supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Therefore, if x is SE of y and y is NE of z, then x can only be E, NE, or SE of z.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: From the two hypotheses

1) x SE y ⇔ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2) y B z  ⇔ infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

one can show that x cannot lie strictly to the left (W, NW, SW) or strictly above (N, NE) of z, because

• x SE y forces x to be to the right of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) and below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).  
• y B z forces y’s bounding box to be contained in z’s bounding box, so in particular infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), etc.

Putting these together rules out x being left of z (which would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) or above z (which would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), because x is already “to the right of y” and “below y,” with y sitting inside z.  What remains possible is that x is entirely inside z (x B z), or else x is still to the right of (E), below (S), or below‐and‐to‐the‐right (SE) of z—provided z is sufficiently large in those directions.  

Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are precisely  
B, S, E, or SE.
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: From the definitions, x NE y means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
so x is strictly to the right and above y.  

Meanwhile, y N z means  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   and   supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
so y is strictly above z but “horizontally contained” in z.

Combining those:

• From y N z we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
• From x NE y we get supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

Chaining these shows supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so the top of z lies at or below the bottom of x.  Hence x is above z.  

The only question is how x and z may align left‐to‐right.  The condition x NE z would require  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
which is consistent (x can be both above and to the right of z if z is not too wide).  

On the other hand, x N z would require  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),   infx(z) ≤ infx(x),   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  
Since we have no contradiction preventing z’s bounding box from being wide enough to contain x horizontally, x N z is also possible.  

All other relations either force x to be below z (S, SE, SW), to its left (W, NW), or else to fit inside z’s bounding box in both directions (B)—none of which is compatible with “x above y and y above z.”  

Therefore, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations of x to z under “x NE y and y N z” are  
  N  or  NE.
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: From the definitions, “x NE y” gives  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  • supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
i.e., x is strictly to the east and north of y.  

Meanwhile, “y W z” gives  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  • infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
i.e., y is strictly to the west of z but vertically contained within z.  

To find the possible relations of x to z, one systematically checks each of the nine relations against these constraints.  One finds that the only impossible ones (because they force contradictory vertical bounds) are S, SE, and SW.  All others can be satisfied by suitable choices of bounding boxes.  

Hence, if x is NE of y and y is W of z, then x could be  
B, N, NE, E, W, or NW of z.  
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: From the definitions, “x NE y” enforces that x’s bounding box is strictly to the right and above y’s bounding box, and “y E z” enforces that y’s bounding box is strictly to the right of z’s bounding box (but vertically contained in it).  Chaining these, one obtains that x must lie to the right of z.  Because x may either remain within z’s bounding box vertically or lie completely above it, the only consistent possibilities are that x is E of z or NE of z.
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: From the definitions one can show that if x is NE of y and y is S of z, then x cannot end up strictly to the west of z (that is, it cannot be W, NW, or SW of z), but all the other directions remain possible.  Concretely:

•  x NE y implies  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   In words, y’s bounding‐box lies entirely to the left and below x’s bounding‐box.

•  y S z implies  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z),   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   and   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
   In words, y’s bounding‐box lies entirely below z’s bounding‐box (and z’s box is at least as wide as y’s).

Putting these together forces the left edge of x to be to the right of y (and hence also to the right of any z that at least covers y horizontally).  That rules out x being W, NW, or SW of z (all of which require x to lie strictly to the left of z).  However, one can place x so that it is N, S, E, NE, SE, or even B (inside) relative to z by appropriate choices of sizes and positions.  

Thus the possible relations of x to z are:  
N, NE, E, SE, S, or B.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: From the given definitions one can see that “x NE y” forces x to lie strictly above and to the right of y (because supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), and “y NW z” forces y to lie strictly above and to the left of z (since supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Chain these two vertical inequalities:

• From “x NE y,” we get supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• From “y NW z,” we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Hence supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means z is strictly below x on the y-axis.  Horizontally, however, there is no direct comparison given between x and z.

Recalling the definitions of the nine cardinal‐direction relations, the only ones that place x strictly above z (but do not force a unique left‐right ordering) are N, NW, or NE.  Indeed:

• N requires z to be entirely below x but to overlap in the x‐direction.  
• NW requires z to be entirely below x, with x further left (so that supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  
• NE requires z to be entirely below x, with x further right (so that supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  

All other relations either require x to be below (S, SW, SE), to be contained within horizontally or vertically (B), or to overlap in a way that contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are N, NW, or NE.
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions,  
•  x NE y means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), and  
•  y SW z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Notice that these constraints only compare y’s bounding box to x’s and z’s but do not fix how x and z themselves compare.  In particular, knowing that y lies southwest of both x and z tells us nothing definitive about whether x is to the north, east, inside, etc. of z.  Consequently, all nine of the listed cardinal‐direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) are possible between x and z.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: From the defining conditions one can see that “x NE y” means that x’s bounding box lies strictly to the right and above y’s bounding box:

• supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y),  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)   (x is above y).

Similarly, “y SE z” means that y’s bounding box lies strictly to the right and below z’s bounding box:

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   (y is to the right of z),  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (y is below z).

Chaining these horizontal constraints,

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),

shows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x). In other words, x must lie strictly to the right of z. Vertically, however, we only know that y is below both z and x, which does not fix the vertical ordering of x and z. Consequently, the only directional relations (among N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, SW, B) that place x strictly to the right of z, irrespective of whether x is above, below, or vertically contained by z, are:

NE, E, or SE.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: From the given definitions, “x NE y” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

Similarly, “y NE z” means  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Since for any region r, infx(r) ≤ supx(r) and infy(r) ≤ supy(r), one can chain these inequalities:

• From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
• From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Hence,  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  

which is exactly the condition “x NE z”.  In particular, none of the other direction‐relations can hold once “x NE y” and “y NE z” are both satisfied.  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z under those hypotheses is NE.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: From the defining inequalities one can check systematically that the only consistent possibilities are that x is inside the bounding box of z (x B z), or else above (x N z), northeast (x NE z), or east (x E z) of z.  In symbols, the possible relations are:

B, N, NE, or E.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: From the given definitions, “x B y” means that the bounding‐box of x is contained in that of y (both horizontally and vertically), while “y N z” means that y lies strictly above z (their bounding‐boxes do not overlap vertically), and horizontally y is contained in z.  Concretely,

• x B y ⇒ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• y N z ⇒ supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Chaining these inequalities shows that, in the horizontal direction,  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
Hence x is horizontally contained in z.  In the vertical direction we get  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x),  
so the top of z is at or below the bottom of x.  This is precisely the definition of x being N of z (i.e., x is north of z and horizontally contained in z).  

None of the other cardinal directions (E, W, S, SE, SW, NE, NW, or B) can hold under these inequalities.  Therefore, the only possible relation of x to z is N.
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: From the given definitions,  
• x B y means that y's bounding box at least encloses x's bounding box in both x and y directions, i.e.  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• y W z means that y lies strictly to the left of z (in the sense of bounding boxes) but is enclosed by z vertically, i.e.  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

We want the possible relation(s) between x and z under the assumptions x B y and y W z.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Deriving supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Since x B y implies supx(x) ≤ supx(y), and y W z implies supx(y) ≤ infx(z), chaining these gives  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
Hence horizontally, x is also to the left of z (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Deriving the vertical containment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• From x B y, we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• From y W z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chaining these in the vertical direction:  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Checking which relation x can have to z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Recalling W means:  
  x W z  ⇔  supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

All three of these hold from the above chains. Indeed, x lies entirely to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) but is enclosed vertically (in the sense that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  

No other cardinal direction relation can hold without contradicting one of the bounding‐box inequalities. In particular, x cannot be B of z (that would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which fails since we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), forcing infx(x) < infx(z) unless x were degenerate). Nor can it be S, N, etc., because the horizontal condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is precisely “x is to the left of z,” which matches W (and not the others).

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z, under x B y and y W z, is:

W.
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: From the definitions, “x B y” means that the bounding box of x is contained entirely in the bounding box of y; symbolically:

  infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  and  infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

Meanwhile, “y E z” means that y lies entirely to the east of z (no horizontal overlap) but lies vertically within z; symbolically:

  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Because x is contained in y (from x B y), it follows that

  infx(x) ≥ infx(y),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),
  infy(x) ≥ infy(y),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

And y lies to the east of z, so

  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).

Putting these together forces supx(z) ≤ infx(x), i.e., x is also entirely to the right of z.  Furthermore, from the vertical inequalities

  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

we see that x is contained within z in the vertical direction.  Hence x is “to the east” of z and vertically within z.  By the definition of E, that precisely says

  x E z.

No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold under these constraints, so the only possible relation between x and z is E.
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: From the definitions,  
• “x B y” means x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box:  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

• “y S z” means y’s bounding box lies strictly south of z’s bounding box:  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Combining these:

1) From x B y we have  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

2) From y S z we have  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Vertically, x lies within y’s bounding box, and y lies strictly below z (because supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).  Hence,  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

So the top of x’s bounding box is at or below the bottom of z’s bounding box, implying x must also lie (strictly) south of z.  

Horizontally, since x is within y’s bounding box and y is within z’s, we have  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

That is exactly the horizontal containment condition needed for “x S z”:  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  infx(z) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

No other relation can hold under these constraints.  

Therefore, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is S.
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: From the given definitions, “x B y” implies that x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box, and “y NW z” implies that y’s bounding box is strictly northwest of z’s.  Concretely:

•  x B y ⇒  
   infx(x) ≥ infx(y),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(x) ≥ infy(y),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

•  y NW z ⇒  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Because x’s bounding box lies inside y’s bounding box, we also have

   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),    and    infy(x) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(z).

Thus, viewed from x to z, x is to the left (since supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and above (since infy(x) ≥ supy(z)).  By the definition of the NW relation,

   x NW z  ⇔  supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

exactly matches these inequalities.  None of the other eight cardinal‐direction definitions can be satisfied under these constraints.  Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is

   NW.
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions, “x B y” implies that x’s bounding box is contained within y’s bounding box. Formally:

1) infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
2) supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
3) infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
4) supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Also, “y SW z” implies y is strictly to the left and below z in bounding‐box terms:

5) supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  
6) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

By combining (2) and (5), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). Similarly, from (4) and (6) we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z). Hence:

– supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  
– supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This is precisely the definition that places x southwest of z. Therefore, the only consistent relation between x and z is SW.
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: From the given definitions, the key inequalities are these:

•  x B y  means  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

•  y SE z  means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

From x B y, we know x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box.  In particular,

   infx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

From y SE z, we get

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Chain these together in the x‐direction:

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).

Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x); that is, x is to the right of z (no overlap in the x‐direction).  

Chain them in the y‐direction:

   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(z); that is, x is below z (no overlap in the y‐direction).

Those two inequalities,

   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   and
   supy(x) ≤ infy(z),

are exactly the definition of “x SE z.”  No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold here without forcing degenerate (zero‐width or zero‐height) bounding boxes.  

Therefore, the only possible relation of x to z, given x B y and y SE z, is:

SE.
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: From the definitions, we know:

1)  x B y  means  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

2)  y NE z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

We want the possible relations between x and z.

First, from y NE z we have  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Next, from x B y we have  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  infy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Chain these together:

•  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
•  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  so supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Compare with the definition of x NE z:

x NE z  ⇔  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Those two conditions are exactly what we obtained by chaining x B y and y NE z.  One checks that none of the other eight cardinal‐direction definitions (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) can be satisfied under supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  Consequently, the only possible relation is

x NE z.
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: B is transitive in the sense that if x is B of y and y is B of z, then the defining inequalities imply x is also B of z. Concretely:

• From x B y, we have:  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

• From y B z, we have:  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chaining these inequalities shows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) all hold; that is exactly x B z. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z in this situation is B.
