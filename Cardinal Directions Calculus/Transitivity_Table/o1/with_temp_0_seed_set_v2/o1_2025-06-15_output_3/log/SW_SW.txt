PROMPT: Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x SW y” means  
(1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  

and “y SW z” means  
(2) supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

We want the possible relation(s) between x and z.  

Step 1: Combine the x‐coordinates.  
From (1) we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y).  
Since infx(y) ≤ supx(y) always holds for a non‐degenerate region, it follows that  
supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
Then from (2) supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so chaining these gives  
supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
which simplifies to  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

Step 2: Combine the y‐coordinates.  
From (1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y), and again infy(y) ≤ supy(y) implies  
supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
Then from (2) supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so chaining these yields  
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
hence  
supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Step 3: Identify the cardinal direction from x to z.  
By definition, “x SW z” holds exactly if  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
We have just shown both of these inequalities; therefore x SW z.  

Moreover, one checks that none of the other cardinal directions (S, W, etc.) can be forced under these assumptions, because x’s bounding box is strictly to the left and below z’s bounding box, ruling out any overlap that would be needed for S or W, etc.  

Conclusion:  
If x is SW of y and y is SW of z, then x must also be SW of z. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
