PROMPT: Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one can see that “x SW y” and “y NE z” only tell us that both x and z lie (in bounding‐box terms) southwest of y.  They impose no further direct constraint on how x and z compare to one another; for example, x could lie anywhere “around” z (including bounding or being bounded by z).  Consequently, all nine relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) remain possible between x and z.
