PROMPT: Let B and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x B y” means that the bounding‐box of x is contained in that of y (both horizontally and vertically), while “y N z” means that y lies strictly above z (their bounding‐boxes do not overlap vertically), and horizontally y is contained in z.  Concretely,

• x B y ⇒ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• y N z ⇒ supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Chaining these inequalities shows that, in the horizontal direction,  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
Hence x is horizontally contained in z.  In the vertical direction we get  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x),  
so the top of z is at or below the bottom of x.  This is precisely the definition of x being N of z (i.e., x is north of z and horizontally contained in z).  

None of the other cardinal directions (E, W, S, SE, SW, NE, NW, or B) can hold under these inequalities.  Therefore, the only possible relation of x to z is N.
