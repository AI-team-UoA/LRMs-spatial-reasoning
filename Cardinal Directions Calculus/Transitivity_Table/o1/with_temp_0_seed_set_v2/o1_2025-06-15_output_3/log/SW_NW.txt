PROMPT: Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definition of the SW and NW relations, we have:

• x SW y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
• y NW z  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

From these it follows that  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
so supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

Hence x is strictly to the left (west) of z (they do not overlap in x).  Depending on how x and z line up vertically, one can realize each of the following three relations:

• x SW z  (if also supy(x) ≤ infy(z)),  
• x W z   (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)),  
• x NW z  (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

No other cardinal‐direction relations are possible once supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  Thus the possible relations between x and z are exactly SW, W, or NW.
