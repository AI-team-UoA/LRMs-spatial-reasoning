PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x N y” means  
1) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

Meanwhile, “y B z” means  
1) infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
2) infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Combining these:

• Horizontal constraints  
  – From y B z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
  – From x N y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
  Together, these imply  
     infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
  Hence, horizontally, x’s bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box.

• Vertical constraints  
  – From y B z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
  – From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
  Thus, y lies within z vertically, and x sits strictly above y (because supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  

What remains undetermined is the relation of supy(x) to supy(z):  
• If supy(x) ≤ supy(z) as well, then x is entirely within z’s bounding box (i.e., x B z).  
• If instead supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x lies strictly north of z (i.e., x N z).  

No other cardinal‐direction definitions can be satisfied given these bounding‐box constraints.  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are only N or B.
