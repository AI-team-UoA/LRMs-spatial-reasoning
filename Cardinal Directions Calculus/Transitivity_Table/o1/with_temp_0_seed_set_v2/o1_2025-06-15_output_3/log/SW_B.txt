PROMPT: Let SW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities it follows that “x SW y” means  
  1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  
  2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
i.e. x’s bounding box lies strictly to the left of and strictly below y’s bounding box.  

Meanwhile, “y B z” means  
  1) infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   2) supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
  3) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   4) supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
so y’s bounding box is contained inside z’s bounding box.

Putting these together leaves open exactly four ways x’s bounding box can lie relative to z’s bounding box:

• x SW z, if x also lies entirely to the left and entirely below z (i.e. supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  
• x W z, if x is disjoint to the left but still within z’s vertical extent (supx(x) ≤ infx(z), yet infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  
• x S z, if x is disjoint below but within z’s horizontal extent (supy(x) ≤ infy(z), yet infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  
• x B z, if z is large enough to contain x entirely, so that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Hence, from “x SW y” and “y B z”, the possible cardinal‐direction relations of x to z are exactly  
SW, W, S, or B.
