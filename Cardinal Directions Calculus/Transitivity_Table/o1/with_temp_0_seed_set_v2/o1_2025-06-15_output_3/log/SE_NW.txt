PROMPT: Let SE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that “x SE y” and “y NW z” only constrain x and z relative to y, but do not fix x and z with respect to one another.  Concretely:

•  x SE y says  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
  That pins x to the right and below of y (or just touching it).

•  y NW z says  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
  That pins z to the right and below of y (or just touching it).

Nothing above forces an ordering between x and z.  In particular, one can choose bounding boxes so that x is to the left/right of z, above/below z, or even one bounding box completely inside the other—thus any of the nine relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) can be realized between x and z. Consequently, all nine cardinal‐direction relations remain possible between x and z.
