PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given constraints

1) x S y, i.e.  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  

2) y NW z, i.e.  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y),

we can combine them as follows:

• From x S y we know that x lies strictly below y (or touches from below), and horizontally x is contained within y’s bounding box.  
• From y NW z we know that y lies strictly to the left of z (or touches from the left), and z is strictly below y (or touches from below).

In particular, supx(y) ≤ infx(z) means that everything in y’s bounding box (including x, which is horizontally contained in y) is to the left of (or touches) z.  Hence:

   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).

So, horizontally, x cannot overlap with z; x is entirely to the left of z (possibly just touching).  Vertically, however, there is no direct ordering forced between x and z, because both lie “below y,” but the data do not say which one is lower or higher (or if they might fit one inside another).

Recalling the definitions of the nine cardinal‐direction relations, the only ones compatible with “x is completely to the left of z” (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) are:

• x SW z  if additionally  supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• x W z   if additionally  infy(z) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(z),  
• x NW z  if additionally  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Since our hypotheses do not fix the vertical ordering between x and z (nor rule out one wholly containing the other vertically), all three of SW, W, NW are consistent with the given setup.  

Answer: The possible cardinal‐direction relations from x to z are precisely NW, W, or SW.
