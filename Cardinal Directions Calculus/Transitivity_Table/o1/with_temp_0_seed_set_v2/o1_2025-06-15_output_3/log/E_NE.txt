PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, let us collect the key inequalities imposed by  
• x E y (i.e., “x is east of y”), and  
• y NE z (i.e., “y is northeast of z”),  
then see what they force about x and z.

1)  x E y  means (by definition):  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
   Geometrically, y’s bounding box is fully to the left of x’s bounding box, and in the vertical direction, x is “contained” within y.

2)  y NE z  means (by definition):  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
   Geometrically, z’s bounding box is fully southwest of y’s bounding box: z is both to the left (in x) and below (in y) of y.

Put these into a single chain.  From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
So z is leftmost, then y, then x (no horizontal overlaps).

Next, from supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
Hence the top of z lies at or below the bottom of y, and the bottom of x lies at or above the bottom of y.  Consequently, z lies strictly below x in the vertical direction (their bounding boxes do not overlap vertically).

Checking each of the nine possible relations between x and z shows that only “x NE z” can hold.  Indeed, to have x NE z one needs  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
both of which follow from the chains above (z is to the left of x and below x).  None of the other eight relations can occur, because they all require one or more inequalities that contradict the above chains.

Answer: the only possible cardinal‐direction relation between x and z is NE.
