PROMPT: Let E and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key fact is that “x is E of y” forces x’s bounding‐box entirely to the right of y’s, and “y is SW of z” forces y’s bounding‐box entirely below and to the left of z’s.  Concretely:

• x E y means supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x), infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x), and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  
• y SW z means supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).

From supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z), it follows that  
supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
so x’s bounding‐box lies strictly below z’s bounding‐box (no vertical overlap).  Once x is strictly below z, the only remaining possibilities under the definitions are that x is:  
• directly South (S) of z (if, horizontally, x’s bounding‐box is contained in z’s),  
• South‐West (SW) of z (if x is also to the left), or  
• South‐East (SE) of z (if x is also to the right).

No other cardinal‐direction relation is consistent with “x below z” in this framework.  Consequently, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, or SE.
