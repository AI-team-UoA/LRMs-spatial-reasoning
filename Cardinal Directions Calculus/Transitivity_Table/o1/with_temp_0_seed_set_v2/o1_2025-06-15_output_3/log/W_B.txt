PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions it suffices to check, in turn, which of the nine relations could hold between x and z once we know

• x W y means  
  1) supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
  2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
  3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).

• y B z means  
  1) infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z),  
  2) infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

First observe the y‐projection:  
• From x W y we have infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  
• From y B z we have infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  
Putting these together shows  
  infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x)  and  supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Hence in the y‐direction, x’s bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box.

Next look at the x‐projection.  From x W y we know  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y).  
Meanwhile, from y B z we know  
  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y).  
Since infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y), it can happen that

• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z), in which case x is also strictly to the left of z (i.e., x W z), or  
• infₓ(z) ≤ supₓ(x) < infₓ(y), in which case x’s x‐interval may lie partly or wholly inside z’s x‐interval.  

In the second scenario, provided infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z), we get x B z because x’s bounding box in both x and y directions is contained in that of z.

All other cardinal directions fail either because they require x to lie strictly below or above z in the y‐direction (contradicted by infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z)), or require z to lie entirely to one side of x in a way inconsistent with y B z and x W y.

Consequently, the only feasible relations between x and z are  
  W  or  B.
