PROMPT: Let E and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, we know that  
• “x E y” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x) , infy(y) ≤ infy(x) , and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• “y B z” means  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) , supx(y) ≤ supx(z) , infy(z) ≤ infy(y) , and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

We want the possible relation(s) between x and z.

1. Vertical (y‑)constraints
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From x E y, we have  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

From y B z, we have  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chaining these together shows  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
Hence, in the y‑direction, the bounding box of x is contained within that of z.  

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Horizontal (x‑)constraints
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From x E y we have  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  

From y B z we have  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Notice that supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) by themselves do not force a single strict ordering between x and z along the x‑axis, because supx(z) can be either smaller than, equal to, or larger than infx(x). Consequently, there are two possible scenarios for x relative to z in the x‑direction:

(a) x is still to the right (E) of z if supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
(b) x is horizontally contained within z if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Checking which relations are possible
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Because in the y‑direction we already have infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), this rules out “x N z” or “x S z” (and likewise the diagonal variants “NE,” “SE,” “NW,” “SW”) since those would require disjoint bounding boxes in the y‑direction. In particular, none of those can hold once we know x’s bounding box is vertically contained in z’s.  

That leaves only two viable relations:

• B (“bounding box inside”): x B z holds if x’s bounding box is wholly inside z’s in both directions, i.e.  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z),  
  along with infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  This is perfectly possible.  

• E (“to the East”): x E z holds if  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
  and also infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  This can also happen if z’s bounding box does not extend as far right as x’s bounding box begins.  

Hence the only possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z, given that x E y and y B z, are  
B or E.
