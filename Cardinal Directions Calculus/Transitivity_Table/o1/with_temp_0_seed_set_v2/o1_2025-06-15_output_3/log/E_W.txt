PROMPT: Let E and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that, in the vertical direction, x is “contained” in z (since x E y forces x’s y‐interval to lie inside y’s, and y W z forces y’s inside z’s, so x’s y‐interval is also inside z’s).  In the horizontal direction, however, x could still lie strictly to the left of z, strictly to the right of z, or be contained in z’s x‐interval (if z is large enough).  In terms of the given cardinal‐direction definitions, those three possibilities correspond exactly to

• x W z,  
• x E z,  
• x B z.  

No other of the nine relations can arise under the constraints x E y and y W z.
