PROMPT: Let W and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key facts are:

•  x W y  ⇒  
   1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)         (x is strictly to the left of y),  
   2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (x is “vertically contained” in y).  

•  y NE z ⇒  
   1) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)         (z is strictly to the left of y),  
   2) supy(z) ≤ infy(y)         (z lies strictly below y).  

Because x is vertically contained in y while z is strictly below y, one deduces

   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Hence the top of z’s bounding box lies at or below the bottom of x’s bounding box, so x must be above z (or they just touch at a common horizontal boundary).  No information, however, fixes whether x is left, right, or overlapping in x‐coordinate with z.  Consequently, x can only be one of N, NE, or NW relative to z:

•  N if they overlap horizontally (x is above z).  
•  NE if x is also (strictly) to the right of z.  
•  NW if x is also (strictly) to the left of z.  

No other of the nine cardinal relations can hold under these constraints. Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, or NW.
