PROMPT: Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one sees that  
•  x SE y means  supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)  and  supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
•  y W z  means  supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z),  infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y),  and  supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  

We then ask which relations x ? z can satisfy under these two hypotheses.  A quick way to see which directions remain possible is to note that “x SE y” forces x to lie to the right and below y, while “y W z” forces y to lie to the left and (in the vertical sense) within z.  One can check systematically (or by concrete examples) which of the nine relations x ? z can still hold.  

•  N, NE, NW lead to contradictions, because they would require x to lie above z (whereas x is below y, which in turn sits inside z vertically).  
•  All of B, S, SW, W, E, SE can be realized by suitable placements.  

Hence the possible relations between x and z are precisely  
B, S, SW, W, E, SE.
