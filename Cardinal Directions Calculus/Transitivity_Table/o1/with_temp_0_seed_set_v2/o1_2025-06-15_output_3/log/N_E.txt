PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x N y” means

  1) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

and “y E z” means

  4) supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
  5) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
  6) supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

We want all consistent ways to relate x to z.  Checking each cardinal‐direction definition against (1)–(6) rules out everything except the following two:

• x E z:  
  – We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  – From (4) and (2) we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) holds.  
  – Because (5) says infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and (1) gives supy(y) ≤ infy(x), one can choose z large enough in the y‐direction so that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  – No contradictions arise, so x E z can occur.

• x NE z:  
  – We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
  – As above, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) follows from (4) and (2).  
  – Since (6) gives supy(y) ≤ supy(z) and (1) gives supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we can have supy(y) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x), hence supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is also possible.  
  – Thus x NE z can also occur.

All other directions lead to contradictions once one combines the requirement that x is north of y (so y is strictly below x) with the requirement that y is east of z (so z is strictly to the left of y).  Consequently, the only consistent possible relations of x to z are E or NE.
