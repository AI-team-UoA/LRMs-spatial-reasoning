PROMPT: Let NW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given constraints

• x NW y  ⇔  (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))  and  (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)),  
• y S z   ⇔  (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))  and  (infx(z) ≤ infx(y))  and  (supx(y) ≤ supx(z)),

one can construct examples showing that x may lie North (N), South (S), West (W), North‑West (NW), South‑West (SW), or be “contained” in the bounding box (B) of z.  In contrast, placing x to the East, North‑East, or South‑East of z is incompatible with x NW y and y S z.

Concretely, one finds that the possible relations of x to z consistent with x NW y and y S z are exactly:  
N, S, W, NW, SW, B.
