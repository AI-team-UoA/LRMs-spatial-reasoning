PROMPT: Let S and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, the key facts are:

• “x S y” forces x to lie strictly below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and horizontally within or equal to y (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).  
• “y W z” forces y to lie strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and vertically within or equal to z (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

Combining these:

1. Since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), it follows that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Hence, x is strictly to the left of z (no horizontal overlap).

2. Vertically, x could be either entirely below z (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) or could lie partly or fully in the vertical extent of z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  

Checking against the definitions of the nine cardinal relations reveals that, when one region a is strictly to the left of another region b (i.e., supx(a) ≤ infx(b)), the only relevant relations among the nine listed are “a W b” or “a SW b”:  
• a W b ⇒ supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and vertically a lies within b’s bounding box.  
• a SW b ⇒ supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and also supy(a) ≤ infy(b).  

No other relation can hold once we know a is strictly to the left of b. Consequently, given x S y and y W z, the only possible relations between x and z are:  

W or SW.
