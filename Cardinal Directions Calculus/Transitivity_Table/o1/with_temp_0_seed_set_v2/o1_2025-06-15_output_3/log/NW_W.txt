PROMPT: Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x NW y” means  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

Likewise, “y W z” means  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

From the horizontal parts of these two relations, one obtains  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
so in particular, supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
This forces x to lie strictly to the left of z, eliminating all directions that would require any overlap or containment in the horizontal dimension.  

Next, we check the possible vertical placements of x relative to z.  For a region a to be (strictly) W, NW, or SW of b, one needs supx(a) ≤ infx(b).  We already have that condition (with a = x, b = z), so x can only be W, NW, or SW of z.  

• To be SW of z, x would also have to satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  However, y is supposed to lie inside z’s vertical extent (because y W z requires infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)), and y is also strictly below x (since supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  Placing x strictly below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) would force y (which is below x) out of z’s bounding box, contradicting y W z.  Hence x cannot be SW of z.  

• To be NW of z, one requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (already true) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  There is no contradiction in having z (and therefore y) strictly below x in the vertical dimension, so NW is possible.  

• To be W of z, one requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (already true) and that x’s vertical bounding box lie within z’s vertical bounding box, i.e. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  That too can happen if z’s bounding box is tall enough to contain x above y.  

Therefore, the only plausible outcomes are  
  x NW z  or  x W z.
