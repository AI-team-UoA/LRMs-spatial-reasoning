PROMPT: Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining conditions one can see that “x NE y” means that x’s bounding box lies strictly to the right and above y’s bounding box:

• supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y),  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)   (x is above y).

Similarly, “y SE z” means that y’s bounding box lies strictly to the right and below z’s bounding box:

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   (y is to the right of z),  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (y is below z).

Chaining these horizontal constraints,

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),

shows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x). In other words, x must lie strictly to the right of z. Vertically, however, we only know that y is below both z and x, which does not fix the vertical ordering of x and z. Consequently, the only directional relations (among N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, SW, B) that place x strictly to the right of z, irrespective of whether x is above, below, or vertically contained by z, are:

NE, E, or SE.
