PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, x S y means:  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

Thus x lies entirely below y (possibly just touching at the boundary) but is horizontally within y’s bounding box.  

Also, y B z means:  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
• supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
• supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence y’s entire bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box.  

Putting these together:

1) Horizontally, since x is within y’s bounding box and y is within z’s bounding box, it follows that x is also horizontally within z’s bounding box (so the horizontal constraints needed for either x S z or x B z can both be satisfied).

2) Vertically, because x is below y and y is contained in z, two main cases can occur with respect to z’s vertical extent:  
   • If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is also entirely below z, which makes x S z.  
   • If supy(x) > infy(z) and infy(x) ≥ infy(z) (so that x’s entire bounding box fits within z’s), then x B z.  

No other cardinal‐direction relation (e.g. W, NW, etc.) can hold because x is already horizontally “under” y (and hence under z). Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z, given x S y and y B z, are:

S or B.
