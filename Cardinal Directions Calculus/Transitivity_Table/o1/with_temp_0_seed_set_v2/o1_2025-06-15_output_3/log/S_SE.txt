PROMPT: Let S and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x S y” means

1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y),

while “y SE z” means

4) supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and  
5) supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Chain (1) and (5) in the y‐coordinate:

• supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  
  ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hence x is strictly below z.  
Chain (2) and (4) in the x‐coordinate:

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
  ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Hence x is strictly to the right of z.  

Putting these together shows that x is simultaneously below and to the right of z.  By the definitions of the cardinal directions, that is exactly “x SE z,” and none of the other relations can hold under these strict inequalities.  Therefore, the only possible relation is SE.
