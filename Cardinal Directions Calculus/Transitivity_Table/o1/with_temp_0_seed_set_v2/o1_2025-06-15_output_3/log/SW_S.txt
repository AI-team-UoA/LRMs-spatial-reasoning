PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Syntactically, from  
• x SW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y S z  ⇒ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  

one can chain “supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)” to see that x must lie strictly below z (so x is “south” of z in the vertical sense).  Horizontally, however, there is no forced inclusion or disjointness, because knowing supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) does not force supx(x) to be either strictly less than, equal to, or greater than infx(z).  By suitable choices of widths of y and z, x can fall entirely to the left of z (SW), directly below z (S), or to the right of z (SE).  

Hence, the possible relations of x to z are:  
S, SW, SE.
