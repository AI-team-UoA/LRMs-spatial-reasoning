PROMPT: Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x B y” means that the bounding box of x is contained entirely in the bounding box of y; symbolically:

  infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  and  infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

Meanwhile, “y E z” means that y lies entirely to the east of z (no horizontal overlap) but lies vertically within z; symbolically:

  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Because x is contained in y (from x B y), it follows that

  infx(x) ≥ infx(y),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),
  infy(x) ≥ infy(y),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

And y lies to the east of z, so

  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).

Putting these together forces supx(z) ≤ infx(x), i.e., x is also entirely to the right of z.  Furthermore, from the vertical inequalities

  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

we see that x is contained within z in the vertical direction.  Hence x is “to the east” of z and vertically within z.  By the definition of E, that precisely says

  x E z.

No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold under these constraints, so the only possible relation between x and z is E.
