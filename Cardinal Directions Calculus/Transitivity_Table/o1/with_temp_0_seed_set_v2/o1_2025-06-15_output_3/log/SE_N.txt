PROMPT: Let SE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the bounding‐box definitions, saying “x is SE of y” and “y is N of z” gives us only that  
• x lies strictly to the right and strictly below y,  
• y lies strictly above z.  

No direct constraint is imposed on the relative positions of x and z.  In particular, one can “place” z large enough (and suitably positioned) so that any of the nine cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) between x and z is consistent with x SE y and y N z.  Consequently, all nine are possible.
