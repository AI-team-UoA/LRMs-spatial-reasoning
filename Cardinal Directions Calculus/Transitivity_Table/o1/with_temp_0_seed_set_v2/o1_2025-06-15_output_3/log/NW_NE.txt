PROMPT: Let NW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x NW y” means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
and “y NE z” means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

From supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), we can chain  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
so supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
Hence, in the vertical (y)‐direction, x must lie strictly above z, ruling out all relations other than N, NW, or NE (because those are precisely the ones in which the first region is north of the second).  

• N(x, z) would also require that z’s bounding box “covers” x in the horizontal direction (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  
• NW(x, z) would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
• NE(x, z) would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Because we do not know the horizontal‐axis ordering of x and z (only that both lie to the left of y), any of these three horizontal configurations could in principle occur.  

Therefore, the only possible relations of x to z are N, NW, or NE.
