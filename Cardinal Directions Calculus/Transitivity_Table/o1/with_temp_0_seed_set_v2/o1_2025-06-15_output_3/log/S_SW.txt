PROMPT: Let S and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
•  x S y entails  
   1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
   2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

•  y SW z entails  
   1) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   2) supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Because (1) and (3) of x S y together with (1) of y SW z imply supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), it follows that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Similarly, (1) of x S y and (2) of y SW z give supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Those two inequalities,  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
are exactly the defining conditions for x SW z.  

Hence, if x is S of y and y is SW of z, then the only possible cardinal‐direction relation between x and z is SW.
