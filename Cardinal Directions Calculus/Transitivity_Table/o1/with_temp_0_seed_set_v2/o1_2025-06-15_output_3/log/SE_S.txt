PROMPT: Let SE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the conditions “x SE y” and “y S z” translate into the following bounding‐box inequalities:

• x SE y means  
  (1) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)   and   (2) supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y).  

• y S z means  
  (3) supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
  (4) infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
  (5) supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).  

We wish to see what these imply about x relative to z.

1. Vertical (y)‐coordinate reasoning
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From (2) and (3) we have

   supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y)   and   supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).

Because infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) in any nondegenerate region y, this chain implies

   supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).

Hence in the y‐direction, x lies at or below y, which in turn lies at or below z.  
In particular, supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z), so x is vertically no higher than the bottom of z.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Horizontal (x)‐coordinate reasoning
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From (1) we have

   supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x),

so x is to the right of y.  
Meanwhile, (4) and (5) say that y is horizontally inside z’s bounding box:

   infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y)   and   supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).

However, these do not pin down where x lies relative to z in the x‐direction, because x could still lie inside or to the right of z’s x‐extent.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Possible relations of x to z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

To check each candidate relation a ? b, we apply its defining bounding‐box inequalities with a = x and b = z:

• x S z requires  
  supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z),   infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x),   supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z).  
  We already have supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z), and it is certainly possible that z’s bounding box is wide enough (because y is contained horizontally in z) to satisfy infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z).  So S is possible.

• x SE z requires  
  supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)   and   supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  
  We already know supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  It can also happen that z’s right boundary supₓ(z) is still ≤ infₓ(x) (i.e., z is not as far right as x).  Thus SE is also possible.

By contrast, attempting to place x in any other cardinal direction (N, NE, E, W, NW, SW, or B) from z contradicts at least one bounding‐box requirement once we use x’s being to the right of y and y’s being below z.  In particular, one sees that:

• x cannot be N or NE of z, since x is below z.  
• x cannot be W or NW of z, since x is to the right of y (and y is within z’s box).  
• x cannot be E of z, because that would require vertical overlap in a range where in fact x is well below z.  
• x cannot be SW of z for the same reason (it would require x to be left of z).  
• x cannot be B of z (contained by z’s bounding box), because x’s top lies at or below z’s bottom (no vertical overlap).

Hence, the only possible directions of x relative to z, given x SE y and y S z, are  
S or SE.
