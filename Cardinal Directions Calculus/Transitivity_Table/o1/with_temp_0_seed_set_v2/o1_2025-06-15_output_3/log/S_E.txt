PROMPT: Let S and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, one can combine the bounding‐box constraints for  
• x S y  (i.e.  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ),  
• y E z  (i.e.  supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) ),  

to see what relations between x and z remain possible.  In particular, chaining the x‐coordinates gives  
 supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so z lies strictly to the left (or possibly just touches) the bounding box of x.  

Checking each potential relation of x to z in turn shows that the only consistent ones are precisely E, NE, or SE.  All other relations (S, N, W, NW, SW, B) lead to contradictions when combined with supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence, the possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z are:  
E, NE, SE.
