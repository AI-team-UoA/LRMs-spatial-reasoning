PROMPT: Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one can check systematically that the only consistent possibilities are that x is inside the bounding box of z (x B z), or else above (x N z), northeast (x NE z), or east (x E z) of z.  In symbols, the possible relations are:

B, N, NE, or E.
