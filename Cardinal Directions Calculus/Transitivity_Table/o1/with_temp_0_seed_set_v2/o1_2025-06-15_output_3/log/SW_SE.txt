PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, we know that  
• x SW y means supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y).  
• y SE z means supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).  

In particular, supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z) together imply  
supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
so supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  
This means x must lie entirely below z in the vertical direction.  

Horizontally, however, we only know that both supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y); that does not tell us how x compares to z (x could be farther left, farther right, or within z’s x‐extent).  

Therefore, the only cardinal directions consistent with “x is strictly below z” (supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z)) and no further horizontal constraints are:  
• S (x below z, horizontally within z),  
• SW (x below and to the left of z),  
• SE (x below and to the right of z).  

No other direction is possible under these definitions and constraints.
