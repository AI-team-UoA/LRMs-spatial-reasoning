PROMPT: Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x W y” means

• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
• supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y),

and “y E z” means

• supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
• supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Combining these tells us two things about x and z:

1) In the y-dimension:  
   From infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) and infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z),  
   we deduce infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z).  
   So in the north–south direction, x’s bounding box is contained within (or coincides with) z’s bounding box.

2) In the x-dimension:  
   We only know supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y), but not how x and z compare directly (x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or horizontally inside z’s box).

Therefore, depending on the exact placement in the x-dimension, region x could be:  
• W of z, if supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
• E of z, if supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x),  
• B of z (i.e., “contained” in z’s bounding box), if infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z) (while also infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z), which we already have).

Hence, the possible relations between x and z under “x W y” and “y E z” are W, E, or B.
