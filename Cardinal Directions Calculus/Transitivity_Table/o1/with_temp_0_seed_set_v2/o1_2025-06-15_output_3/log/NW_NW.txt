PROMPT: Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x NW y” means  
(1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  (2) supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

Similarly, “y NW z” means  
(3) supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  (4) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

We want to see what follows about x and z.  

• From (1) and the fact that infx(y) ≤ supx(y), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
  Then from (3), supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
  Chaining these gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

• From (4) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x) in (2), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
  Hence supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Putting these two together,  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
is exactly the definition that x is NW of z.  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold once one checks the necessary bounding‐box constraints (in particular, one finds that x must be both left of and above z, ruling out N, W, inside (B), etc.).  

Therefore, if x is NW of y and y is NW of z, the only possible relation between x and z is again NW.
