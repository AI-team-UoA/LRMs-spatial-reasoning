PROMPT: Let NE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, x NE y means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
so x is strictly to the right and above y.  

Meanwhile, y N z means  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   and   supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
so y is strictly above z but “horizontally contained” in z.

Combining those:

• From y N z we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
• From x NE y we get supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

Chaining these shows supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so the top of z lies at or below the bottom of x.  Hence x is above z.  

The only question is how x and z may align left‐to‐right.  The condition x NE z would require  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
which is consistent (x can be both above and to the right of z if z is not too wide).  

On the other hand, x N z would require  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),   infx(z) ≤ infx(x),   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  
Since we have no contradiction preventing z’s bounding box from being wide enough to contain x horizontally, x N z is also possible.  

All other relations either force x to be below z (S, SE, SW), to its left (W, NW), or else to fit inside z’s bounding box in both directions (B)—none of which is compatible with “x above y and y above z.”  

Therefore, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations of x to z under “x NE y and y N z” are  
  N  or  NE.
