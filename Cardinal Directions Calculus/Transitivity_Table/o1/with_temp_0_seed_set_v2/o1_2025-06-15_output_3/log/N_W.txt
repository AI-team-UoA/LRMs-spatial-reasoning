PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x N y” implies in particular that  
• x’s bounding‐box is strictly above y’s (that is, supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), and  
• in the x‐direction, x’s bounding‐box is contained within y’s bounding‐box (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).  

Similarly, “y W z” implies that  
• y’s bounding‐box is strictly to the left of z’s (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), and  
• in the y‐direction, y’s bounding‐box is contained within z’s bounding‐box (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

Combining these:

1) Because x is horizontally contained in y (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)) and y is strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), it follows that  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
   This forces x to lie strictly to the left of z in the x‐direction.

2) Vertically, y lies within z’s bounding‐box (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)), while x is strictly above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  However, nothing in these constraints forces x to lie either within z’s vertical extent or completely above it.  Consequently, in the y‐direction, x might either  
   • fit within z’s vertical boundaries (making x “W” of z), or  
   • lie wholly above z (making x “NW” of z).  

All other relations are ruled out by the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which makes x lie strictly to the left of z and therefore cannot be “E”, “NE”, “SE”, “S”, “N”, or “B”), and by the inconsistency one gets if one tries to place x strictly below z (“SW” conflicts with x being above y, which is itself inside z).

Hence the only possible relations between x and z are W or NW.
