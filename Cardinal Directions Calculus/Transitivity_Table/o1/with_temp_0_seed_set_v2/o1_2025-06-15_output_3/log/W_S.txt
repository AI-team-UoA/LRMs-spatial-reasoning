PROMPT: Let W and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If x is W of y and y is S of z, then from the y‐coordinate constraints one finds  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
so the top of x is below (or at best touches) the bottom of z.  In other words, x must lie “below” z.  

Depending on how far z extends leftwards in the x‐direction, x may either (i) lie horizontally within z’s bounding box, or (ii) lie entirely to the left of it.  Precisely:

• If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is contained in z’s bounding box horizontally (hence x is S of z).  
• If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the left of z (hence x is SW of z).  

No other cardinal relations are compatible with the fact that x ends up strictly below z (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  Therefore, the only possible relations from x to z in this scenario are S or SW.
