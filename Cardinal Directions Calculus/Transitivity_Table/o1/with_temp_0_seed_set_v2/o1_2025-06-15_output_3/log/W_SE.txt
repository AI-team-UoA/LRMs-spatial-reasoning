PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x W y” forces x to lie strictly to the left of y but to fit vertically inside y’s bounding‐box.  Likewise, “y SE z” forces y to lie strictly below and to the right of z while fitting horizontally/vertically outside z in just those directions.  One can show by explicit bounding‐box examples that, under these two constraints, x must also lie strictly below z (since x’s vertical extent is contained in y’s, and y is strictly below z).  Furthermore, depending on their respective horizontal placements, x may be left of z, directly under z, or to the right of z—but always below.  Concretely:

• If x is also to the left of z, then x SW z.  
• If x is directly below z, then x S z.  
• If x is below and to the right of z, then x SE z.

All other cardinal‐direction relations fail once one enforces “x W y” and “y SE z.”  Consequently, the only possible relations between x and z are:

SW, S, or SE.
