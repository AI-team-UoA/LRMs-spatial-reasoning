PROMPT: Let B and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
• “x B y” means x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box:  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

• “y S z” means y’s bounding box lies strictly south of z’s bounding box:  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Combining these:

1) From x B y we have  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

2) From y S z we have  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Vertically, x lies within y’s bounding box, and y lies strictly below z (because supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).  Hence,  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

So the top of x’s bounding box is at or below the bottom of z’s bounding box, implying x must also lie (strictly) south of z.  

Horizontally, since x is within y’s bounding box and y is within z’s, we have  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

That is exactly the horizontal containment condition needed for “x S z”:  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  infx(z) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

No other relation can hold under these constraints.  

Therefore, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is S.
