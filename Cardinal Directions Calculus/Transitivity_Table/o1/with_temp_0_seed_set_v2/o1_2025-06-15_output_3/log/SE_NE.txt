PROMPT: Let SE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definition of “x SE y,” we have  
(1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  (2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  

From the definition of “y NE z,” we have  
(3) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  (4) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Focus first on the x‐coordinates.  From (1) and (3) and the usual fact infx(y) ≤ supx(y), one obtains  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
Hence, viewed purely in the x‐direction, z lies to the left of x (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  

Turning to the y‐coordinates, the conditions supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) do not force a strict ordering between supy(x) and supy(z).  Consequently, one cannot pin down whether x is above, below, or (vertically) “inside” z solely from (2) and (4).  

By checking each of the nine cardinal relations against the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x), the only possibilities that do not lead to contradiction are:  
• x E z, which requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and (in the y‐direction) infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z),  
• x NE z, which requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
• x SE z, which requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

All other relations require x to be at least partly to the left of z or impose y‐constraints incompatible with supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Therefore, if x is SE of y and y is NE of z, then x can only be E, NE, or SE of z.
