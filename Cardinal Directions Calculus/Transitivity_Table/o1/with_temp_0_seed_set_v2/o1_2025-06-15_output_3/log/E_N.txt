PROMPT: Let E and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the conditions “x E y” and “y N z” impose the following bounding‐box constraints:

1) x E y ⇒  
   • supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y),  
   • infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (x is vertically contained in y).  

2) y N z ⇒  
   • supy(z) ≤ infy(y)   (y is above z),  
   • infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)   (y is horizontally contained in z).  

Combining these shows that x lies strictly above z (because supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and that x is to the right of y, which is itself contained (horizontally) in z.  The only ways for x to relate to z under these constraints are:

• x N z, provided supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  (x is directly above z, and fits horizontally within z.)  
• x NE z, provided supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  (x is above and to the right of z.)

No other cardinal directions can be satisfied under “x E y” and “y N z.” Thus, the possible relations of x to z are N or NE.
