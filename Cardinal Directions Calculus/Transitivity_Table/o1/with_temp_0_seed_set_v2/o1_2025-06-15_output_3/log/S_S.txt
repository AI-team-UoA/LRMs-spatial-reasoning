PROMPT: Let S and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If x is S of y and y is S of z, then by definition:

1) From x S y, we have  
   • supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
   • infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   • supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

2) From y S z, we have  
   • supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
   • infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
   • supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Chain these together:

• supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  
  implies supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

• infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
  and  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  
  imply infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

Hence x’s bounding box is horizontally within z’s, and vertically x is still entirely below z (because supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  That is precisely the definition of x S z.  None of the other relations can hold under these conditions.  

So, the only possible cardinal‐direction relation of x to z is S.
