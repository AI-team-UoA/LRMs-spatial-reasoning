PROMPT: Let B and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions,  
• x B y means that y's bounding box at least encloses x's bounding box in both x and y directions, i.e.  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• y W z means that y lies strictly to the left of z (in the sense of bounding boxes) but is enclosed by z vertically, i.e.  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

We want the possible relation(s) between x and z under the assumptions x B y and y W z.

1. Deriving supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Since x B y implies supx(x) ≤ supx(y), and y W z implies supx(y) ≤ infx(z), chaining these gives  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
Hence horizontally, x is also to the left of z (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Deriving the vertical containment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• From x B y, we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• From y W z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chaining these in the vertical direction:  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Checking which relation x can have to z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Recalling W means:  
  x W z  ⇔  supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

All three of these hold from the above chains. Indeed, x lies entirely to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) but is enclosed vertically (in the sense that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  

No other cardinal direction relation can hold without contradicting one of the bounding‐box inequalities. In particular, x cannot be B of z (that would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which fails since we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), forcing infx(x) < infx(z) unless x were degenerate). Nor can it be S, N, etc., because the horizontal condition supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is precisely “x is to the left of z,” which matches W (and not the others).

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z, under x B y and y W z, is:

W.
