PROMPT: Let W and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x W y” means:

1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

And “y NW z” means:

1) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
2) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Chain these inequalities to see how x compares with z:

• From x W y we get supx(x) ≤ infx(y).  
• From y NW z we get supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  

Putting them together yields  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
so in particular supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
Hence, horizontally, x lies strictly to the left of z.

Next, look at the vertical coordinates:

• From x W y we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• From y NW z we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Chain these to obtain  
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
Thus the top of z is at or below the bottom of x, so x lies strictly above z in the vertical direction.

Putting these two facts together—x is to the left of z and also above z—matches exactly the definition of x NW z:

x NW z  ⇔  supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

No other cardinal‐direction definition can be satisfied under these constraints, so the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
