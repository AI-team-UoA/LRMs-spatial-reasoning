PROMPT: Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x NE y” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

Similarly, “y NE z” means  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Since for any region r, infx(r) ≤ supx(r) and infy(r) ≤ supy(r), one can chain these inequalities:

• From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
• From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Hence,  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  

which is exactly the condition “x NE z”.  In particular, none of the other direction‐relations can hold once “x NE y” and “y NE z” are both satisfied.  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z under those hypotheses is NE.
