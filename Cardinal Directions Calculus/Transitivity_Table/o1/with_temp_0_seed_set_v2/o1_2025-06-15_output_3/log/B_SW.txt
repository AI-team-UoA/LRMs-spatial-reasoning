PROMPT: Let B and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x B y” implies that x’s bounding box is contained within y’s bounding box. Formally:

1) infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
2) supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
3) infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
4) supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Also, “y SW z” implies y is strictly to the left and below z in bounding‐box terms:

5) supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  
6) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

By combining (2) and (5), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). Similarly, from (4) and (6) we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z). Hence:

– supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  
– supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This is precisely the definition that places x southwest of z. Therefore, the only consistent relation between x and z is SW.
