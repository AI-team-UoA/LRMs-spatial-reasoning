PROMPT: Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x N y” imposes (i) supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is strictly below x) and (ii) infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x’s bounding box is horizontally contained within y’s).  

Meanwhile “y NE z” imposes (i) supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is strictly to the left of y) and (ii) supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is strictly below y).  

Putting these together:

• Since y is below x and z is below y, we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
  Hence supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so z lies strictly below x.  
• Since z lies to the left of y and x is horizontally inside y’s bounding box (infx(y) ≤ infx(x)), we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
  Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so z lies strictly to the left of x.  

Thus x is strictly above and to the right of z; by definition, that is precisely x NE z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.
