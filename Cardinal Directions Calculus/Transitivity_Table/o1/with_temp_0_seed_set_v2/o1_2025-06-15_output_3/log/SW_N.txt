PROMPT: Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

All nine of the listed relations can occur.  In essence, knowing only that x is SW of y and y is N of z does not impose enough constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z to rule out any of the nine possibilities (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B).  By suitably choosing shapes and sizes for the three regions (all homeomorphic to disks), one can realize each of the nine relations between x and z.
