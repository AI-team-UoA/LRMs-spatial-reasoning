PROMPT: Let B and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, we know:

1)  x B y  means  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

2)  y NE z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

We want the possible relations between x and z.

First, from y NE z we have  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Next, from x B y we have  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  infy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Chain these together:

•  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
•  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  so supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Compare with the definition of x NE z:

x NE z  ⇔  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Those two conditions are exactly what we obtained by chaining x B y and y NE z.  One checks that none of the other eight cardinal‐direction definitions (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) can be satisfied under supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  Consequently, the only possible relation is

x NE z.
