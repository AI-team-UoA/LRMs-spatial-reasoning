PROMPT: Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definition of the relations, “x N y” means

• supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Hence x’s bounding box is strictly above y’s, and horizontally x is within (or equal to) y’s bounding box.

Similarly, “y SW z” means

• supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

That places y strictly to the left and below z.  

Combining these:

• Because x is horizontally within y’s bounding box and y is to the left of z, it follows supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
• Thus x must also lie strictly to the left of z (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  

Vertically, we only know x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)), but there is no direct restriction tying x’s vertical position to z’s.  Consequently, depending on whether x ends up entirely below z, entirely above z, or “vertically inside” z’s bounding box, the only consistent possibilities are:

• x SW z (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)),  
• x W z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), or  
• x NW z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

No other cardinal direction can hold under those bounding‐box constraints.
