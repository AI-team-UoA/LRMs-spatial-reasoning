PROMPT: Let SW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x SW y” means  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is left of y), and  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  (x is below y).  

Similarly, “y W z” means  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  (y is left of z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)  (y is vertically contained in z).  

Putting these together shows that x must also lie to the left of z, because  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

Hence x is somewhere strictly west of z.  The only question is whether x lies entirely below z (making x SW z) or instead fits “within” z’s vertical extent (making x W z).  

• x SW z happens if, in addition to being left of z, we also have supy(x) ≤ infy(z), i.e., x lies completely below z.  
• x W z happens if supy(x) ≤ supy(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x), so that x’s bounding box is left of but vertically within that of z.  

No other cardinal‐direction constraints can be satisfied under these assumptions (for instance, x cannot end up north of z, or bounding‐box–contained by z, etc.).  

Therefore, the only possible relations between x and z, given x SW y and y W z, are  
W or SW.
