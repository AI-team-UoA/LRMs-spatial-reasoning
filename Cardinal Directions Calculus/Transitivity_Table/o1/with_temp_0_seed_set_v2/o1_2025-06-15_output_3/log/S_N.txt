PROMPT: Let S and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the horizontal‐bounding constraints, chaining “x S y” and “y N z” forces  
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
Hence x’s box is horizontally contained in z’s box (no east/west separation).  

Thus, x and z can only differ by their vertical positioning.  In particular, the three ways x can relate vertically to z (while remaining horizontally inside) correspond exactly to the relations S, N, or B:

• x S z if supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• x N z if supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
• x B z if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

No other cardinal direction requires mere containment in the horizontal direction, so the only possible relations are S, N, or B.
