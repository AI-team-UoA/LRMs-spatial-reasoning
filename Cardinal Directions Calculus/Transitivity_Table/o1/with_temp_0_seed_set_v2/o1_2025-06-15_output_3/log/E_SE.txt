PROMPT: Let E and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities, one sees that “x E y” implies, in particular,  
1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y),  
2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (x’s bounding box is vertically contained in y’s).  

Meanwhile, “y SE z” implies  
3) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   (y is to the right of z),  
4) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (y is below z).  

Putting (1) and (3) together gives  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so supx(z) ≤ infx(x). In other words, z lies to the left of x.  

On the vertical side, from 2) and 4),  
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
so the top of x is at or below the bottom of z.  Hence x is strictly below z.  

Together, “x is to the right of z” and “x is below z” is precisely the definition of “x SE z.”  No other cardinal‐direction conditions can be satisfied under these bounding‐box constraints.  

Therefore, if x is E of y and y is SE of z, then x can only be SE of z.
