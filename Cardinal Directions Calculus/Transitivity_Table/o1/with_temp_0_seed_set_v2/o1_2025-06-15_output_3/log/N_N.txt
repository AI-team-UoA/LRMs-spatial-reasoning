PROMPT: Let N and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the only way to chain “x is N of y” and “y is N of z” so as to satisfy one of the listed relations for x and z is  
x N z.  

Here is the brief reasoning:  

• Because x is N of y, we have  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

• Because y is N of z, we have  
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
  - supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

• Combining these gives, in the y‑direction, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so z is below y, which is below x.  

• In the x‑direction, we obtain infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so x’s bounding box is contained “inside” y’s and y’s is contained inside z’s.  

• Checking all definitions shows that the only way these inequalities can be satisfied by one of the nine relations is precisely x N z.
