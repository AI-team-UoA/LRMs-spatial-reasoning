PROMPT: Let NE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
•  x NE y means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), and  
•  y SW z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Notice that these constraints only compare y’s bounding box to x’s and z’s but do not fix how x and z themselves compare.  In particular, knowing that y lies southwest of both x and z tells us nothing definitive about whether x is to the north, east, inside, etc. of z.  Consequently, all nine of the listed cardinal‐direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) are possible between x and z.
