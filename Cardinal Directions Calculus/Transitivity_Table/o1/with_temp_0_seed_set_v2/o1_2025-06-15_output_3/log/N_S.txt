PROMPT: Let N and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can show that the only way x can lie relative to z (once x N y and y S z are assumed) is that x is either N, S, or B of z.  In outline:

• From x N y, one has  
  (a) supy(y) ≤ infy(x)   (y is no higher than x),  
  (b) infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)   (x’s box fits within y’s box in the x‐direction).  

• From y S z, one has  
  (c) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (y is no higher than z),  
  (d) infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)   (y’s box fits within z’s box in the x‐direction).  

Combining (b) and (d) shows that x’s bounding box is contained horizontally within z’s bounding box:

  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Hence x cannot be strictly to the East, West, NE, NW, SE, or SW of z, because all those relations require a horizontal separation.  What remains possible are:

1) x N z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)),  
2) x S z (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)),  
3) x B z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)),  

all of which are consistent with the inequalities above.  Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are N, S, or B.
