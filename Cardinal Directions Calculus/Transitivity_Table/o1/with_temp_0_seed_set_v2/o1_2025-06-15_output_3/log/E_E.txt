PROMPT: Let E and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If x is E of y and y is E of z, then chaining the defining inequalities shows that x must also be E of z. Concretely, from  
• x E y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• y E z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
one obtains by direct combination:  
supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z),  
which is precisely the definition of x E z. No other cardinal directions satisfy all these chains simultaneously. Thus the only possible relation between x and z is E.
