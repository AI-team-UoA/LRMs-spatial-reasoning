PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one can show that the only impossible “x ? z” relations under  
• x SW y  ⇔  supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y E z   ⇔  supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  

are exactly the ones demanding x be strictly above z (namely N, NE, NW) or else sit strictly above and to one side (SE).  All of the remaining five relations,

• x SW z ,  
• x W z  ,  
• x S z  ,  
• x B z  ,  
• x E z  ,

can be satisfied by suitably positioning the three regions.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are precisely SW, W, S, E, or B.
