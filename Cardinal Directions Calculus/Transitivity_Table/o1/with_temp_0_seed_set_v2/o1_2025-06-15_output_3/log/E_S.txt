PROMPT: Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one can show that, once X is “to the east” of Y and Y is “to the south” of Z, the only ways X can relate to Z (according to the given nine possibilities) are that X is either directly south of Z or south‐east of Z.  In outline:

•  “X E Y” means  
   supx(Y) ≤ infx(X),  
   infy(Y) ≤ infy(X),  
   supy(X) ≤ supy(Y).  
  In particular, the first inequality says X is to the right of Y.

•  “Y S Z” means  
   supy(Y) ≤ infy(Z),  
   infx(Z) ≤ infx(Y),  
   supx(Y) ≤ supx(Z).  
  In particular, the first inequality says Y is below Z.

Putting these together forces X to lie (at least) below Z because  
  supy(X) ≤ supy(Y) ≤ infy(Z).  

Hence in the vertical direction, X must lie entirely beneath Z.  Horizontally, however, X could still be either contained within Z’s horizontal extent (which would make X “S” of Z) or lie all the way to the right (which would make X “SE” of Z).  No other cardinal‐direction configuration can arise from those two premises.  

Therefore, if X is E of Y and Y is S of Z, then X can only be S or SE of Z.
