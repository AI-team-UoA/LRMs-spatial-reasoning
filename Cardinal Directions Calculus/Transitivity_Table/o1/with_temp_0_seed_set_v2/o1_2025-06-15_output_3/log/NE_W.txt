PROMPT: Let NE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x NE y” gives  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  • supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
i.e., x is strictly to the east and north of y.  

Meanwhile, “y W z” gives  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  • infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
i.e., y is strictly to the west of z but vertically contained within z.  

To find the possible relations of x to z, one systematically checks each of the nine relations against these constraints.  One finds that the only impossible ones (because they force contradictory vertical bounds) are S, SE, and SW.  All others can be satisfied by suitable choices of bounding boxes.  

Hence, if x is NE of y and y is W of z, then x could be  
B, N, NE, E, W, or NW of z.
