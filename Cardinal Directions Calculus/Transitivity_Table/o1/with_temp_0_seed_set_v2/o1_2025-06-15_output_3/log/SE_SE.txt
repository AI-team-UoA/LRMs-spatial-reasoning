PROMPT: Let SE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

SE is defined by the pair of inequalities  
  supx(b) ≤ infx(a)  and  supy(a) ≤ infy(b).  

Given x SE y and y SE z, we have:  
1)  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)     and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2)  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)     and   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Because supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Similarly, from supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get  
  supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

These two inequalities, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), are precisely the defining conditions for x SE z. Hence the only possible relation of x to z in this scenario is SE.
