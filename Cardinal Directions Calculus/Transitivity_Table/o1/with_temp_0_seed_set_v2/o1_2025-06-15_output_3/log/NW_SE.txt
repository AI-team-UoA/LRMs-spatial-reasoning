PROMPT: Let NW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x NW y” means  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is completely to the left of y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (y is completely below x).  

Also, “y SE z” means  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  (y is completely to the left of z), and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  (y is completely below z).  

From these we can deduce:

1) Since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), chaining gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
   Thus, x is entirely to the left of z in the x-dimension.

2) In the y-dimension, we only know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but nothing tells us whether x lies above, below, or within z’s vertical span.  

Hence, in the x-direction, x must lie to the left of z.  Depending on how their y-ranges compare, x can be:  
• NW of z (if x is also above),  
• W of z (if x’s vertical bounding box is contained in z’s), or  
• SW of z (if x is also below).  

No other cardinal directions are consistent with supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are NW, W, or SW.
