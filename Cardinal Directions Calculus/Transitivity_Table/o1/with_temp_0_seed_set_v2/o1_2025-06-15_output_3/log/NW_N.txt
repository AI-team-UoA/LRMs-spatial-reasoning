PROMPT: Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities it follows that x must lie above z (because x is above y and y is above z), so any relation requiring x to be below z (S, SE, SW) is impossible.  Beyond that, the horizontal positioning of x relative to z is not forced: since x is to the left of y and y sits “above” z, no constraint forbids x from being anywhere to the left or right of z, nor from being contained within z (if z is large enough).  

Consequently, the relations between x and z that are compatible with “x NW y” and “y N z” are precisely those that place x above z in some allowable horizontal position or contained in z’s bounding box.  Concretely, the possible relations are:

• N  (x is directly north of z),  
• NW (x is north‐west of z),  
• NE (x is north‐east of z),  
• W  (x is west of z but vertically within z’s bounding box),  
• E  (x is east of z but vertically within z’s bounding box),  
• B  (x is contained in the bounding box of z).

Hence the answer is: N, NE, E, NW, W, B.
