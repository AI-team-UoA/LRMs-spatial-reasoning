PROMPT: Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x N y” forces x’s box to lie strictly above y’s (so supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and x is horizontally within y), while “y NW z” forces y’s box to lie strictly above and to the left of z’s (so supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Putting these together implies that x also lies strictly above z (because supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and to the left of z (because supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).  Those are exactly the conditions for “x NW z.”  No other cardinal‐direction relation can simultaneously satisfy “x N y” and “y NW z.”  

Hence, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
