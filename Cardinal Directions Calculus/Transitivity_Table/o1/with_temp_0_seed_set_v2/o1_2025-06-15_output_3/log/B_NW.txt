PROMPT: Let B and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x B y” implies that x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box, and “y NW z” implies that y’s bounding box is strictly northwest of z’s.  Concretely:

•  x B y ⇒  
   infx(x) ≥ infx(y),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(x) ≥ infy(y),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

•  y NW z ⇒  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Because x’s bounding box lies inside y’s bounding box, we also have

   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),    and    infy(x) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(z).

Thus, viewed from x to z, x is to the left (since supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and above (since infy(x) ≥ supy(z)).  By the definition of the NW relation,

   x NW z  ⇔  supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

exactly matches these inequalities.  None of the other eight cardinal‐direction definitions can be satisfied under these constraints.  Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is

   NW.
