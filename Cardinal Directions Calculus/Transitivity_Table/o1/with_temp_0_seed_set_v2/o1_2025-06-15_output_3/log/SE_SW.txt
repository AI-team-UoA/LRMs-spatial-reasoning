PROMPT: Let SE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one can see that “x SE y” forces x to lie strictly to the right and strictly below y (i.e., supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), while “y SW z” forces y to lie strictly to the left and strictly below z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).  

Putting these together shows that x is necessarily below z (since x is below y and y is below z), but in the horizontal direction x could lie to the left of z, lie to the right of z, or be horizontally contained by z.  Translating this into the given cardinal‐relation definitions:

• If x is entirely left of z, then x SW z.  
• If x is entirely right of z, then x SE z.  
• If x is horizontally contained by z, then x S z.  

No other cardinal directions are compatible with “x is strictly below z.”  Hence the possible relations between x and z are exactly  
S, SW, or SE.
