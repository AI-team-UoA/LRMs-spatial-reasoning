PROMPT: Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that  
• “x W y” forces x to lie entirely to the left of y (supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)) but with x’s vertical extent contained in y’s (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
• “y N z” forces y to lie entirely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)) but with y’s horizontal extent contained in z’s (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).  

Putting these together shows that x must lie left of y, while y itself lies above z.  A little case‐checking (or explicit examples) then shows that the only ways x can relate to z are:  

• x N z:  x is strictly above z and horizontally contained in z.  
• x NW z: x is strictly above z and also strictly to the left of z.  

No other cardinal‐direction pattern can be made consistent with both x W y and y N z.  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are N or NW.
