PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining constraints one can check that x must lie strictly to the right of z (because from y SE z we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y), and from x N y we also have infx(y) ≤ infx(x), hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  In the vertical direction, nothing forces x to be strictly above, strictly below, or exactly overlapping z, so x could be above z, aligned in y with z, or below z.  

Hence, among the nine relations, the only ones consistent with “x is N of y” and “y is SE of z” are exactly NE, E, or SE between x and z.
