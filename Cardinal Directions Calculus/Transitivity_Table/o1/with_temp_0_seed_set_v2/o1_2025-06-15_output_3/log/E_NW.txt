PROMPT: Let E and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, one can show that if x is E of y and y is NW of z, then x must lie strictly above z (since y is above z, and x in turn is vertically “within” y).  In the language of those definitions, “strictly above” means that the top edge of z’s bounding box is no higher than the bottom edge of x’s bounding box.  

Concretely:

•  x E y ⇒  
   1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y),  
   2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (x is vertically within y).

•  y NW z ⇒  
   1) supx(y) ≤ infx(z)   (y is to the left of z),  
   2) supy(z) ≤ infy(y)   (z is below y).

From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we deduce  
supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
so z’s bounding box lies strictly below x’s bounding box in the y-direction.

That leaves only the three “north”-type directions for x relative to z, namely NW, N, or NE, depending on how x’s and z’s bounding boxes compare in the x-direction:

•  x NW z if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
•  x N  z if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
•  x NE z if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Hence the possible relations of x to z are NW, N, or NE.
