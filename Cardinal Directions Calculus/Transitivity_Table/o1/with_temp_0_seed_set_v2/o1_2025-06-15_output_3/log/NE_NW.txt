PROMPT: Let NE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can see that “x NE y” forces x to lie strictly above and to the right of y (because supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), and “y NW z” forces y to lie strictly above and to the left of z (since supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Chain these two vertical inequalities:

• From “x NE y,” we get supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• From “y NW z,” we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Hence supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means z is strictly below x on the y-axis.  Horizontally, however, there is no direct comparison given between x and z.

Recalling the definitions of the nine cardinal‐direction relations, the only ones that place x strictly above z (but do not force a unique left‐right ordering) are N, NW, or NE.  Indeed:

• N requires z to be entirely below x but to overlap in the x‐direction.  
• NW requires z to be entirely below x, with x further left (so that supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  
• NE requires z to be entirely below x, with x further right (so that supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  

All other relations either require x to be below (S, SW, SE), to be contained within horizontally or vertically (B), or to overlap in a way that contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are N, NW, or NE.
