PROMPT: Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

B is transitive in the sense that if x is B of y and y is B of z, then the defining inequalities imply x is also B of z. Concretely:

• From x B y, we have:  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

• From y B z, we have:  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chaining these inequalities shows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) all hold; that is exactly x B z. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z in this situation is B.
