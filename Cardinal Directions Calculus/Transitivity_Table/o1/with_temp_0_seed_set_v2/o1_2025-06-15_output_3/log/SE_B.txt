PROMPT: Let SE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two hypotheses

1) x SE y ⇔ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2) y B z  ⇔ infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

one can show that x cannot lie strictly to the left (W, NW, SW) or strictly above (N, NE) of z, because

• x SE y forces x to be to the right of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) and below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).  
• y B z forces y’s bounding box to be contained in z’s bounding box, so in particular infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), etc.

Putting these together rules out x being left of z (which would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) or above z (which would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), because x is already “to the right of y” and “below y,” with y sitting inside z.  What remains possible is that x is entirely inside z (x B z), or else x is still to the right of (E), below (S), or below‐and‐to‐the‐right (SE) of z—provided z is sufficiently large in those directions.  

Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are precisely  
B, S, E, or SE.
