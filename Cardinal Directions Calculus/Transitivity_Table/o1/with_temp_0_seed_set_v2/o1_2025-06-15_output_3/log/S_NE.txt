PROMPT: Let S and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key constraint is that x S y implies

1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y),

while y NE z implies

4) supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and  
5) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Chaining (2) with (4) gives supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), i.e. supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means x must lie strictly to the right of z in the x-dimension.  Once supx(z) ≤ infx(x) holds, the only possible cardinal relations (from the list N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, SW, B) that place x strictly to the right of z are precisely NE, E, or SE, depending on their relative positioning in the y-dimension (above, overlapping/contained, or below, respectively).  

Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are NE, E, or SE.
