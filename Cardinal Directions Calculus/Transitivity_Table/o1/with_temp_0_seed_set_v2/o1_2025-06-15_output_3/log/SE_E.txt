PROMPT: Let SE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key geometric facts are:

•  x SE y means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
   In words, y’s box ends (in the x‐direction) before x’s box starts, and x’s box ends (in the y‐direction) before y’s box starts.

•  y E z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   and   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   In words, z’s box ends before y’s starts (in the x‐direction), and y’s box is vertically contained in z’s box.

Chain these two:

1)  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  
   Together imply  supx(z) ≤ infx(x). 
   So in the x‐direction, z’s box is to the left of x’s box.

2)  supy(x) ≤ infy(y)   while   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   Since y is contained vertically in z, we only know x is below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), but we do not get a forced ordering between x and z in the y‐direction.  In particular, x could lie entirely below z, or else fit (vertically) inside z, depending on where x sits.

Reviewing the definitions of the nine cardinal relations shows that:

•  For x to be “to the right” of z in these relations, one needs supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
   That rules out W, NW, SW, etc.

•  Among E, NE, SE:  
   –  x NE z would require x also lie entirely above z, i.e. supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
      This contradicts y ⊂ z and x below y.  
   –  x E z requires x be horizontally to the right of z (which we have) and also be vertically contained by z, i.e.  
        infy(z) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
      That is possible if x happens to lie within z’s vertical extent.  
   –  x SE z requires x be horizontally to the right of z and also below z, i.e.  
        supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
      That is likewise possible if x happens to lie entirely below z.

Hence, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations consistent with  
“x SE y and y E z”  
are  
E and SE.
