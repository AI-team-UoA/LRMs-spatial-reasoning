PROMPT: Let B and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key inequalities are these:

•  x B y  means  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

•  y SE z  means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

From x B y, we know x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box.  In particular,

   infx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

From y SE z, we get

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Chain these together in the x‐direction:

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).

Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x); that is, x is to the right of z (no overlap in the x‐direction).  

Chain them in the y‐direction:

   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(z); that is, x is below z (no overlap in the y‐direction).

Those two inequalities,

   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   and
   supy(x) ≤ infy(z),

are exactly the definition of “x SE z.”  No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold here without forcing degenerate (zero‐width or zero‐height) bounding boxes.  

Therefore, the only possible relation of x to z, given x B y and y SE z, is:

SE.
