PROMPT: Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If x is W of y and y is W of z, then chaining the defining inequalities shows that x must also be W of z, and no other of the listed relations can occur. Indeed, from

• x W y ⇒  
  1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
  2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y),

and

• y W z ⇒  
  1) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
  2) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
  3) supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

one obtains

• supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

These exactly satisfy the definition of x W z (left in x, “nested” in y), and they rule out all other directions. Thus the only possible relation between x and z is W.
