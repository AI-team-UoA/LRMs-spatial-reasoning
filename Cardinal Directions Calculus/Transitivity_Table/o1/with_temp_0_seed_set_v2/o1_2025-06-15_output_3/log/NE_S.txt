PROMPT: Let NE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one can show that if x is NE of y and y is S of z, then x cannot end up strictly to the west of z (that is, it cannot be W, NW, or SW of z), but all the other directions remain possible.  Concretely:

•  x NE y implies  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   In words, y’s bounding‐box lies entirely to the left and below x’s bounding‐box.

•  y S z implies  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z),   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   and   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
   In words, y’s bounding‐box lies entirely below z’s bounding‐box (and z’s box is at least as wide as y’s).

Putting these together forces the left edge of x to be to the right of y (and hence also to the right of any z that at least covers y horizontally).  That rules out x being W, NW, or SW of z (all of which require x to lie strictly to the left of z).  However, one can place x so that it is N, S, E, NE, SE, or even B (inside) relative to z by appropriate choices of sizes and positions.  

Thus the possible relations of x to z are:  
N, NE, E, SE, S, or B.
