PROMPT: Let NE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x NE y” enforces that x’s bounding box is strictly to the right and above y’s bounding box, and “y E z” enforces that y’s bounding box is strictly to the right of z’s bounding box (but vertically contained in it).  Chaining these, one obtains that x must lie to the right of z.  Because x may either remain within z’s bounding box vertically or lie completely above it, the only consistent possibilities are that x is E of z or NE of z.
