PROMPT: Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given facts

1) x NW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
2) y E z  ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

one can show that x can only be “north‑oriented” or “contained” relative to z, but not “south‑oriented.”

■ Reasoning in brief

• Because x NW y , x must lie left (west) of y and above (north of) y.  
  – “Left” comes from supx(x) ≤ infx(y).  
  – “Above” comes from supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

• Because y E z , y must lie to the right (east) of z and be vertically contained within z.  
  – “Right” comes from supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  
  – “Vertical containment” comes from infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

No direct constraints force x to be below z. In particular, any relation requiring supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (such as S, SW, or SE) is ruled out, because x must sit above y, which is itself inside z’s vertical range.

On the other hand, it is consistent for x to be anywhere “north‑oriented” of z (NW, W, N, NE, E) or even fully contained by z (the B relation), provided z is large enough to include both x and y in its bounding box.  

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are:  
• NW, • W, • N, • NE, • E, • B  

and nothing else.
