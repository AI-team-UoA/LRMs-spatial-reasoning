{"prompt": "Let E and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "If x is E of y and y is E of z, then chaining the defining inequalities shows that x must also be E of z. Concretely, from  \n\u2022 x E y \u21d2 supx(y) \u2264 infx(x), infy(y) \u2264 infy(x), supy(x) \u2264 supy(y),  \n\u2022 y E z \u21d2 supx(z) \u2264 infx(y), infy(z) \u2264 infy(y), supy(y) \u2264 supy(z),  \none obtains by direct combination:  \nsupx(z) \u2264 infx(x), infy(z) \u2264 infy(x), supy(x) \u2264 supy(z),  \nwhich is precisely the definition of x E z. No other cardinal directions satisfy all these chains simultaneously. Thus the only possible relation between x and z is E.", "elapsed-time": 25.090342044830322, "reasoning-tokens": 3584, "completion-tokens": 3798}
