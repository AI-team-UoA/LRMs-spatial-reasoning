{"prompt": "Let E and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the defining inequalities, one sees that \u201cx E y\u201d implies, in particular,  \n1) supx(y) \u2264 infx(x)   (x is to the right of y),  \n2) infy(y) \u2264 infy(x)   and   supy(x) \u2264 supy(y)   (x\u2019s bounding box is vertically contained in y\u2019s).  \n\nMeanwhile, \u201cy SE z\u201d implies  \n3) supx(z) \u2264 infx(y)   (y is to the right of z),  \n4) supy(y) \u2264 infy(z)   (y is below z).  \n\nPutting (1) and (3) together gives  \nsupx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(x),  \nso supx(z) \u2264 infx(x). In other words, z lies to the left of x.  \n\nOn the vertical side, from 2) and 4),  \nsupy(x) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z),  \nso the top of x is at or below the bottom of z.  Hence x is strictly below z.  \n\nTogether, \u201cx is to the right of z\u201d and \u201cx is below z\u201d is precisely the definition of \u201cx SE z.\u201d  No other cardinal\u2010direction conditions can be satisfied under these bounding\u2010box constraints.  \n\nTherefore, if x is E of y and y is SE of z, then x can only be SE of z.
