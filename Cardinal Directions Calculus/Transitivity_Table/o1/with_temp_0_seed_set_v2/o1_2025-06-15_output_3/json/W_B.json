{"prompt": "Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions it suffices to check, in turn, which of the nine relations could hold between x and z once we know\n\n\u2022 x W y means  \n  1) sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y),  \n  2) inf\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x),  \n  3) sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y).\n\n\u2022 y B z means  \n  1) inf\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) and sup\u2093(y) \u2264 sup\u2093(z),  \n  2) inf\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y) and sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z).\n\nFirst observe the y\u2010projection:  \n\u2022 From x W y we have inf\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x) and sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y).  \n\u2022 From y B z we have inf\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y) and sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z).  \nPutting these together shows  \n  inf\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x)  and  sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z).\n\nHence in the y\u2010direction, x\u2019s bounding box is contained within z\u2019s bounding box.\n\nNext look at the x\u2010projection.  From x W y we know  \n  sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y).  \nMeanwhile, from y B z we know  \n  inf\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y).  \nSince inf\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y), it can happen that\n\n\u2022 sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(z), in which case x is also strictly to the left of z (i.e., x W z), or  \n\u2022 inf\u2093(z) \u2264 sup\u2093(x) < inf\u2093(y), in which case x\u2019s x\u2010interval may lie partly or wholly inside z\u2019s x\u2010interval.  \n\nIn the second scenario, provided inf\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(x) and sup\u2093(x) \u2264 sup\u2093(z), we get x B z because x\u2019s bounding box in both x and y directions is contained in that of z.\n\nAll other cardinal directions fail either because they require x to lie strictly below or above z in the y\u2010direction (contradicted by inf\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z)), or require z to lie entirely to one side of x in a way inconsistent with y B z and x W y.\n\nConsequently, the only feasible relations between x and z are  \n  W  or  B.", "elapsed-time": 50.58473825454712, "reasoning-tokens": 7040, "completion-tokens": 7671}
