{"prompt": "Let NW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the two given constraints\n\n\u2022 x\u202fNW\u202fy  \u21d4  (supx(x) \u2264 infx(y))  and  (supy(y) \u2264 infy(x)),  \n\u2022 y\u202fS\u202fz   \u21d4  (supy(y) \u2264 infy(z))  and  (infx(z) \u2264 infx(y))  and  (supx(y) \u2264 supx(z)),\n\none can construct examples showing that x may lie North (N), South (S), West (W), North\u2011West (NW), South\u2011West (SW), or be \u201ccontained\u201d in the bounding box (B) of z.  In contrast, placing x to the East, North\u2011East, or South\u2011East of z is incompatible with x\u202fNW\u202fy and y\u202fS\u202fz.\n\nConcretely, one finds that the possible relations of x to z consistent with x\u202fNW\u202fy and y\u202fS\u202fz are exactly:  \nN,\u202fS,\u202fW,\u202fNW,\u202fSW,\u202fB.", "elapsed-time": 48.50086736679077, "reasoning-tokens": 7360, "completion-tokens": 7643}
