{"prompt": "Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, \u201cx NW y\u201d means  \n(1) supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)  and  (2) supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).  \n\nSimilarly, \u201cy NW z\u201d means  \n(3) supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)  and  (4) supy(z) \u2264 infy(y).  \n\nWe want to see what follows about x and z.  \n\n\u2022 From (1) and the fact that infx(y) \u2264 supx(y), we get supx(x) \u2264 supx(y).  \n  Then from (3), supx(y) \u2264 infx(z).  \n  Chaining these gives supx(x) \u2264 infx(z).  \n\n\u2022 From (4) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(x) in (2), we get supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).  \n  Hence supy(z) \u2264 infy(x).  \n\nPutting these two together,  \nsupx(x) \u2264 infx(z)  and  supy(z) \u2264 infy(x),  \nis exactly the definition that x is NW of z.  \n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction relation can hold once one checks the necessary bounding\u2010box constraints (in particular, one finds that x must be both left of and above z, ruling out N, W, inside (B), etc.).  \n\nTherefore, if x is NW of y and y is NW of z, the only possible relation between x and z is again NW.", "elapsed-time": 50.97179412841797, "reasoning-tokens": 7680, "completion-tokens": 8038}
