{"prompt": "Let N and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions, the only way to chain \u201cx is N of y\u201d and \u201cy is N of z\u201d so as to satisfy one of the listed relations for x and z is  \nx N z.  \n\nHere is the brief reasoning:  \n\n\u2022 Because x is N of y, we have  \n  - supy(y) \u2264 infy(x),  \n  - infx(y) \u2264 infx(x),  \n  - supx(x) \u2264 supx(y).  \n\n\u2022 Because y is N of z, we have  \n  - supy(z) \u2264 infy(y),  \n  - infx(z) \u2264 infx(y),  \n  - supx(y) \u2264 supx(z).  \n\n\u2022 Combining these gives, in the y\u2011direction, supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x), so z is below y, which is below x.  \n\n\u2022 In the x\u2011direction, we obtain infx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) \u2264 supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 supx(z), so x\u2019s bounding box is contained \u201cinside\u201d y\u2019s and y\u2019s is contained inside z\u2019s.  \n\n\u2022 Checking all definitions shows that the only way these inequalities can be satisfied by one of the nine relations is precisely x N z.
