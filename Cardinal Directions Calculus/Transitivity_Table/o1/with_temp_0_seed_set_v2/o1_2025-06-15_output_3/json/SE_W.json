{"prompt": "Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions one sees that  \n\u2022  x\u202fSE\u202fy means  sup\u2093(y)\u202f\u2264\u202finf\u2093(x)  and  sup\u1d67(x)\u202f\u2264\u202finf\u1d67(y),  \n\u2022  y\u202fW\u202fz  means  sup\u2093(y)\u202f\u2264\u202finf\u2093(z),  inf\u1d67(z)\u202f\u2264\u202finf\u1d67(y),  and  sup\u1d67(y)\u202f\u2264\u202fsup\u1d67(z).  \n\nWe then ask which relations x\u202f?\u202fz can satisfy under these two hypotheses.  A quick way to see which directions remain possible is to note that \u201cx SE y\u201d forces x to lie to the right and below y, while \u201cy W z\u201d forces y to lie to the left and (in the vertical sense) within z.  One can check systematically (or by concrete examples) which of the nine relations x\u202f?\u202fz can still hold.  \n\n\u2022  N, NE, NW lead to contradictions, because they would require x to lie above z (whereas x is below y, which in turn sits inside z vertically).  \n\u2022  All of B, S, SW, W, E, SE can be realized by suitable placements.  \n\nHence the possible relations between x and z are precisely  \nB, S, SW, W, E, SE.
