{"prompt": "Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the defining inequalities one can show that, once X is \u201cto the east\u201d of Y and Y is \u201cto the south\u201d of Z, the only ways X can relate to Z (according to the given nine possibilities) are that X is either directly south of Z or south\u2010east of Z.  In outline:\n\n\u2022  \u201cX E Y\u201d means  \n   supx(Y) \u2264 infx(X),  \n   infy(Y) \u2264 infy(X),  \n   supy(X) \u2264 supy(Y).  \n  In particular, the first inequality says X is to the right of Y.\n\n\u2022  \u201cY S Z\u201d means  \n   supy(Y) \u2264 infy(Z),  \n   infx(Z) \u2264 infx(Y),  \n   supx(Y) \u2264 supx(Z).  \n  In particular, the first inequality says Y is below Z.\n\nPutting these together forces X to lie (at least) below Z because  \n  supy(X) \u2264 supy(Y) \u2264 infy(Z).  \n\nHence in the vertical direction, X must lie entirely beneath Z.  Horizontally, however, X could still be either contained within Z\u2019s horizontal extent (which would make X \u201cS\u201d of Z) or lie all the way to the right (which would make X \u201cSE\u201d of Z).  No other cardinal\u2010direction configuration can arise from those two premises.  \n\nTherefore, if X is E of Y and Y is S of Z, then X can only be S or SE of Z.", "elapsed-time": 60.17640399932861, "reasoning-tokens": 8704, "completion-tokens": 9079}
