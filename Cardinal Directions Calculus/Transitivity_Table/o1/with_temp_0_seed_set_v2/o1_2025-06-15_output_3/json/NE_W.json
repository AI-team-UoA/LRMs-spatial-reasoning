{"prompt": "Let NE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, \u201cx NE y\u201d gives  \n\u2022 supx(y) \u2264 infx(x)  and  \u2022 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x),  \ni.e., x is strictly to the east and north of y.  \n\nMeanwhile, \u201cy W z\u201d gives  \n\u2022 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)  and  \u2022 infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 supy(z),  \ni.e., y is strictly to the west of z but vertically contained within z.  \n\nTo find the possible relations of x to z, one systematically checks each of the nine relations against these constraints.  One finds that the only impossible ones (because they force contradictory vertical bounds) are S, SE, and SW.  All others can be satisfied by suitable choices of bounding boxes.  \n\nHence, if x is NE of y and y is W of z, then x could be  \nB, N, NE, E, W, or NW of z.
