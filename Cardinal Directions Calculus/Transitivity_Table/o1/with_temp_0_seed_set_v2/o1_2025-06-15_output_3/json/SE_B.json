{"prompt": "Let SE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the two hypotheses\n\n1) x SE y \u21d4 supx(y) \u2264 infx(x) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y),  \n2) y B z  \u21d4 infx(z) \u2264 infx(y), supx(y) \u2264 supx(z), infy(z) \u2264 infy(y), supy(y) \u2264 supy(z),\n\none can show that x cannot lie strictly to the left (W, NW, SW) or strictly above (N, NE) of z, because\n\n\u2022 x SE y forces x to be to the right of y (supx(y) \u2264 infx(x)) and below y (supy(x) \u2264 infy(y)).  \n\u2022 y B z forces y\u2019s bounding box to be contained in z\u2019s bounding box, so in particular infx(z) \u2264 infx(y) and supx(y) \u2264 supx(z), etc.\n\nPutting these together rules out x being left of z (which would require supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)) or above z (which would require supy(z) \u2264 infy(x)), because x is already \u201cto the right of y\u201d and \u201cbelow y,\u201d with y sitting inside z.  What remains possible is that x is entirely inside z (x B z), or else x is still to the right of (E), below (S), or below\u2010and\u2010to\u2010the\u2010right (SE) of z\u2014provided z is sufficiently large in those directions.  \n\nConsequently, the possible relations of x to z are precisely  \nB, S, E, or SE.", "elapsed-time": 52.836055278778076, "reasoning-tokens": 6976, "completion-tokens": 7350}
