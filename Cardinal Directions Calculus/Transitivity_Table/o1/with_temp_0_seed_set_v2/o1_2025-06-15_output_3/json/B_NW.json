{"prompt": "Let B and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions, \u201cx\u202fB\u202fy\u201d implies that x\u2019s bounding box is contained in y\u2019s bounding box, and \u201cy\u202fNW\u202fz\u201d implies that y\u2019s bounding box is strictly northwest of z\u2019s.  Concretely:\n\n\u2022  x\u202fB\u202fy \u21d2  \n   infx(x) \u2265 infx(y),   supx(x) \u2264 supx(y),  \n   infy(x) \u2265 infy(y),   supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).\n\n\u2022  y\u202fNW\u202fz \u21d2  \n   supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)   and   supy(z) \u2264 infy(y).\n\nBecause x\u2019s bounding box lies inside y\u2019s bounding box, we also have\n\n   supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z),    and    infy(x) \u2265 infy(y) \u2265 supy(z).\n\nThus, viewed from x to z, x is to the left (since supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)) and above (since infy(x) \u2265 supy(z)).  By the definition of the NW relation,\n\n   x\u202fNW\u202fz  \u21d4  supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)  and  supy(z) \u2264 infy(x).\n\nexactly matches these inequalities.  None of the other eight cardinal\u2010direction definitions can be satisfied under these constraints.  Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is\n\n   NW.", "elapsed-time": 61.86137366294861, "reasoning-tokens": 8768, "completion-tokens": 9108}
