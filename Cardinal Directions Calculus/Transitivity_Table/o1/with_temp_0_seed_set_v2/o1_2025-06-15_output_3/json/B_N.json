{"prompt": "Let B and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions, \u201cx B y\u201d means that the bounding\u2010box of x is contained in that of y (both horizontally and vertically), while \u201cy N z\u201d means that y lies strictly above z (their bounding\u2010boxes do not overlap vertically), and horizontally y is contained in z.  Concretely,\n\n\u2022 x B y \u21d2 infx(y) \u2264 infx(x),  supx(x) \u2264 supx(y),  infy(y) \u2264 infy(x),  supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).  \n\u2022 y N z \u21d2 supy(z) \u2264 infy(y),  infx(z) \u2264 infx(y),  supx(y) \u2264 supx(z).\n\nChaining these inequalities shows that, in the horizontal direction,  \n  infx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 infx(x)  and  supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 supx(z).  \nHence x is horizontally contained in z.  In the vertical direction we get  \n  supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 infy(x) \u2264 supy(x),  \nso the top of z is at or below the bottom of x.  This is precisely the definition of x being N of z (i.e., x is north of z and horizontally contained in z).  \n\nNone of the other cardinal directions (E, W, S, SE, SW, NE, NW, or B) can hold under these inequalities.  Therefore, the only possible relation of x to z is N.", "elapsed-time": 32.235355377197266, "reasoning-tokens": 4288, "completion-tokens": 4656}
