{"prompt": "Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, \u201cx N y\u201d imposes (i) supy(y) \u2264 infy(x) (y is strictly below x) and (ii) infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) \u2264 supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) (x\u2019s bounding box is horizontally contained within y\u2019s).  \n\nMeanwhile \u201cy NE z\u201d imposes (i) supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) (z is strictly to the left of y) and (ii) supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) (z is strictly below y).  \n\nPutting these together:\n\n\u2022 Since y is below x and z is below y, we get supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).  \n  Hence supy(z) \u2264 infy(x), so z lies strictly below x.  \n\u2022 Since z lies to the left of y and x is horizontally inside y\u2019s bounding box (infx(y) \u2264 infx(x)), we have supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 infx(x).  \n  Hence supx(z) \u2264 infx(x), so z lies strictly to the left of x.  \n\nThus x is strictly above and to the right of z; by definition, that is precisely x NE z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.", "elapsed-time": 30.166160583496094, "reasoning-tokens": 4032, "completion-tokens": 4358}
