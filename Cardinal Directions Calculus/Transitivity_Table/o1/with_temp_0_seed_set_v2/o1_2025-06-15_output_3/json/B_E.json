{"prompt": "Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, \u201cx B y\u201d means that the bounding box of x is contained entirely in the bounding box of y; symbolically:\n\n  infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) \u2264 supx(x) \u2264 supx(y)  and  infy(y) \u2264 infy(x) \u2264 supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cy E z\u201d means that y lies entirely to the east of z (no horizontal overlap) but lies vertically within z; symbolically:\n\n  supx(z) \u2264 infx(y)  and  infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).\n\nBecause x is contained in y (from x B y), it follows that\n\n  infx(x) \u2265 infx(y),   supx(x) \u2264 supx(y),\n  infy(x) \u2265 infy(y),   supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).\n\nAnd y lies to the east of z, so\n\n  supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 infx(x).\n\nPutting these together forces supx(z) \u2264 infx(x), i.e., x is also entirely to the right of z.  Furthermore, from the vertical inequalities\n\n  infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 infy(x),   supy(x) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 supy(z),\n\nwe see that x is contained within z in the vertical direction.  Hence x is \u201cto the east\u201d of z and vertically within z.  By the definition of E, that precisely says\n\n  x E z.\n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction relation can hold under these constraints, so the only possible relation between x and z is E.", "elapsed-time": 31.32134699821472, "reasoning-tokens": 4480, "completion-tokens": 4872}
