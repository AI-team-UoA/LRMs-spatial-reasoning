{"prompt": "Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the defining inequalities one sees that  \n\u2022 \u201cx W y\u201d forces x to lie entirely to the left of y (sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y)) but with x\u2019s vertical extent contained in y\u2019s (infy(y) \u2264 infy(x) and supy(x) \u2264 supy(y)).  \n\u2022 \u201cy N z\u201d forces y to lie entirely above z (supy(z) \u2264 infy(y)) but with y\u2019s horizontal extent contained in z\u2019s (infx(z) \u2264 infx(y) and supx(y) \u2264 supx(z)).  \n\nPutting these together shows that x must lie left of y, while y itself lies above z.  A little case\u2010checking (or explicit examples) then shows that the only ways x can relate to z are:  \n\n\u2022 x N z:  x is strictly above z and horizontally contained in z.  \n\u2022 x NW z: x is strictly above z and also strictly to the left of z.  \n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction pattern can be made consistent with both x W y and y N z.  \n\nThus, the possible relations between x and z are N or NW.", "elapsed-time": 78.554279088974, "reasoning-tokens": 10880, "completion-tokens": 11155}
