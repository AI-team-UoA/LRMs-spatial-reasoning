{"prompt": "Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "If x is W of y and y is W of z, then chaining the defining inequalities shows that x must also be W of z, and no other of the listed relations can occur.
