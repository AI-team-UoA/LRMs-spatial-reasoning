{"prompt": "Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "B is transitive in the sense that if x is B of y and y is B of z, then the defining inequalities imply x is also B of z. Concretely:\n\n\u2022 From x B y, we have:  \n  infx(y) \u2264 infx(x),   supx(x) \u2264 supx(y),  \n  infy(y) \u2264 infy(x),   supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).  \n\n\u2022 From y B z, we have:  \n  infx(z) \u2264 infx(y),   supx(y) \u2264 supx(z),  \n  infy(z) \u2264 infy(y),   supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).  \n\nChaining these inequalities shows that infx(z) \u2264 infx(x), supx(x) \u2264 supx(z), infy(z) \u2264 infy(x), and supy(x) \u2264 supy(z) all hold; that is exactly x B z. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z in this situation is B.", "elapsed-time": 19.762058973312378, "reasoning-tokens": 2304, "completion-tokens": 2551}
