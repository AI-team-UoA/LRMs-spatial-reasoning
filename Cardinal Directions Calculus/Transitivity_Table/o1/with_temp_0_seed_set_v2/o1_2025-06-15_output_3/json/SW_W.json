{"prompt": "Let SW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, \u201cx SW y\u201d means  \n\u2022 supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)  (x is left of y), and  \n\u2022 supy(x) \u2264 infy(y)  (x is below y).  \n\nSimilarly, \u201cy W z\u201d means  \n\u2022 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)  (y is left of z),  \n\u2022 infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) and supy(y) \u2264 supy(z)  (y is vertically contained in z).  \n\nPutting these together shows that x must also lie to the left of z, because  \nsupx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)  \u21d2  supx(x) \u2264 infx(z).  \n\nHence x is somewhere strictly west of z.  The only question is whether x lies entirely below z (making x SW z) or instead fits \u201cwithin\u201d z\u2019s vertical extent (making x W z).  \n\n\u2022 x SW z happens if, in addition to being left of z, we also have supy(x) \u2264 infy(z), i.e., x lies completely below z.  \n\u2022 x W z happens if supy(x) \u2264 supy(z) and infy(z) \u2264 infy(x), so that x\u2019s bounding box is left of but vertically within that of z.  \n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction constraints can be satisfied under these assumptions (for instance, x cannot end up north of z, or bounding\u2010box\u2013contained by z, etc.).  \n\nTherefore, the only possible relations between x and z, given x SW y and y W z, are  \nW or SW.
