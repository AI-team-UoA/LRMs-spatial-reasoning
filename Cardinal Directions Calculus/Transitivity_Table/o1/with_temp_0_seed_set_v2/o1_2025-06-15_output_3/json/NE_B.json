{"prompt": "Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the defining inequalities one can check systematically that the only consistent possibilities are that x is inside the bounding box of z (x\u202fB\u202fz), or else above (x\u202fN\u202fz), northeast (x\u202fNE\u202fz), or east (x\u202fE\u202fz) of z.  In symbols, the possible relations are:\n\nB, N, NE, or E.", "elapsed-time": 44.748626708984375, "reasoning-tokens": 6528, "completion-tokens": 6671}
