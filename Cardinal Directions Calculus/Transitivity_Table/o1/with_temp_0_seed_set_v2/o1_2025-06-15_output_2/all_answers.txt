For r1: N, r2: N, answer: From the definition of “x N y,” we have three constraints:

1) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Similarly, “y N z” gives:

4) supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
5) infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
6) supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Combining (1) and (4) yields supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
Hence, in the y-dimension, z is at or below y, which is at or below x.

Combining (2), (3), (5), and (6) in the x-dimension gives  
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Thus, for “x ? z,” the only way to satisfy supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z below x) together with infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x fitting within z’s left and right projections) is exactly:

x N z.

All other directions (e.g., NW, NE, E, etc.) require conditions in the x-dimension that contradict the chain infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and “B” (bounding box) would require z’s top to lie above x’s top, which also contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Therefore, the only possible relation is N.
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: From the definitions, “x N y” forces x’s bounding box strictly above y’s in the vertical direction and contained (or equal) in the horizontal direction:

• supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Meanwhile, “y W z” forces y’s bounding box strictly to the left of z’s in the horizontal direction and contained (or equal) in the vertical direction:

• supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combine these to see how x can relate to z:

1) From x N y:  
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
2) From y W z:  
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  

Putting them together gives  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  

Hence x’s bounding box lies strictly to the left of z’s bounding box (so x cannot be N, NE, E, SE, or B of z), leaving only W-, NW-, or SW-type possibilities (all require “left-of” in the x-dimension).

Next, check the vertical possibilities:

• For x W z one needs:  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  These say “x is entirely within z’s vertical span but to the left.”  Since infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) is not contradictory to also having supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x W z is possible if z is tall enough.

• For x NW z one needs:  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
  These say “x is above z and to the left.”  Since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) does not rule out supy(z) being ≤ infy(x), x NW z is also possible.

• For x SW z one would need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we already have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  Hence x SW z cannot hold.

Consequently, the only possible cardinal-direction relations of x to z, given “x N y” and “y W z,” are W or NW.
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: From the given definitions, one sees that  
• x N y means  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
• y E z means  supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Putting these together:

1) From y E z, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  
2) From x N y, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so horizontally, z is strictly to the left of x (no overlap).  

3) Again from x N y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
4) From y E z, we know y’s vertical bounds lie within (or equal to) z’s: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Since supy(y) ≤ infy(x], we see y lies below x, but y itself is “vertically contained” in z.  Depending on how large z is vertically, x’s vertical box could end up either fully inside z’s vertical box or fully above it.  

Checking the definitions of E and NE relative to z:

• x E z requires  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

• x NE z requires  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  
  and  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Both are consistent with “z is to the left of x,” and then either “x is vertically within z” (the E case) or “x is entirely above z” (the NE case).  One cannot get any other cardinal relation (for instance, N would require overlapping horizontally, SE would require x below z, etc.).  

Consequently, if x is N of y and y is E of z, then x can only be E of z or NE of z.
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: From the defining inequalities, one sees that if x is N of y and y is S of z, then the x and z bounding‐box projections in the horizontal direction must satisfy

infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Hence, x cannot lie strictly east or west of z (nor NE, NW, SE, or SW), because those relations all require one bounding‐box side of x to lie strictly beyond the opposite bounding‐box side of z (which is impossible given the chain of inequalities above).

What remains is to check whether x can be N, S, or B (“bounded by”) relative to z.  By suitably choosing the vertical positions (i.e. making supy(x) either well below, well above, or within the vertical extent of z), one can construct examples where x is S of z, N of z, or B of z.  Concretely:

• B example:  Place z so that its bounding box fully contains those of both x and y.  
• S example:  Make x lie entirely (vertically) between y and z but still below z’s bounding box.  
• N example:  Put z between y and x so that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Therefore, the only possible relations of x to z under “x N y” and “y S z” are:  
N, S, or B.
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: From the given definitions, one can check the implied bounding‐box constraints and see that they force x to lie strictly to the left (west) of z and also strictly above (north of) z.  Concretely:

• “x N y” gives supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• “y NW z” gives supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Because x is north of y and y is northwest of z, chaining these inequalities forces  
1) supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
2) supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Hence x is entirely to the left of z (from 1) and entirely above z (from 2).  By the definitions, that is exactly the “NW” relation.  No other cardinal‐direction relation is compatible with both sets of inequalities.  Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: From the two given constraints

• x N y ⇒ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
• y SW z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),

one can deduce that supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  In other words, x lies strictly to the left of z in terms of bounding boxes.  Vertically, however, there is no forced ordering between x and z:  x could lie below z, above z, or overlap z’s vertical extent.  

Hence, the only directional relations that require x to be strictly left of z are W (strictly left, vertically aligned), NW (strictly left and above), and SW (strictly left and below).  Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:

W, NW, or SW.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: From the defining inequalities it follows that X must lie strictly to the right of Z, but its vertical position relative to Z can be above, below, or contained within Z’s vertical extent.  Concretely:

• “X is N of Y” implies  
  (i) supy(Y) ≤ infy(X),  
  (ii) infx(Y) ≤ infx(X),  
  (iii) supx(X) ≤ supx(Y).

• “Y is SE of Z” implies  
  (iv) supx(Z) ≤ infx(Y),  
  (v) supy(Y) ≤ infy(Z).

Combining (iv) and (ii) shows supx(Z) ≤ infx(Y) ≤ infx(X), so supx(Z) ≤ infx(X).  Thus X’s bounding box is strictly to the right of Z’s bounding box.  The only cardinal‐direction relations in which one region is strictly to the right of the other (i.e., supx(Z) ≤ infx(X)) are E, NE, or SE (depending on whether X is “level,” above, or below Z in the y‐direction).  

Hence the possible relations of X to Z are exactly E, NE, or SE.
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: From the defining inequalities, “x is N of y” means

• supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

Meanwhile, “y is NE of z” means

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Chain these:

1) Because supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
   Hence x lies strictly above z (so any relation that would require x to be below or at the same vertical level as z is impossible).

2) Because supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
   Hence x lies strictly to the right of z.

Those two facts (x above z and to the right of z) are exactly the conditions for x NE z, namely  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

All other cardinal‐direction definitions fail under these constraints. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: If x is N of y and y is B of z, then the only ways to satisfy those bounding‐box inequalities for x relative to z are that x is either also B of z or else N of z.  In more detail:

1)  From x N y, we have:  
   • supy(y) ≤ infy(x)        (y is below x),  
   • infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   • supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

2)  From y B z, we have:  
   • infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   • supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
   • infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   • supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Combining the x‐bounds shows that x is horizontally within z’s bounding box (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  Vertically, two consistent scenarios can arise:

•  x is also inside z’s bounding box (so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), giving x B z.  
•  Or else the top of z is at or below the bottom of x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), placing x strictly north of z, i.e. x N z.

No other cardinal directions satisfy all of the above inequalities; hence the possible relations of x to z are N or B.
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: From the definitions it follows that “x W y” forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (in the x‐direction) but align so that y’s vertical extent at least covers x’s (in other words, infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  Meanwhile, “y N z” forces y to lie strictly above z (in the y‐direction) but align so that z’s horizontal extent at least covers y’s (i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).  

A systematic way to see what x can be relative to z is to try to place x and z so that all constraints

1)  x W y:  
   • supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
   • infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
   • supy(x) ≤ supy(y);

2)  y N z:  
   • supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   • infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
   • supx(y) ≤ supx(z);

still hold, and then check which of the nine relations x could satisfy with z.  One finds that only two of the nine relations can consistently be realized:

• x N z  
• x NW z  

All others lead to contradictions once one enforces “x W y” and “y N z.”  Hence the only possible cardinal‐direction relations that x can bear to z, under those assumptions, are:

N or NW.
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: From the definitions one sees that “x W y” and “y W z” together imply  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so chaining gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
which in turn imply infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

Putting these together matches exactly the definition of “x W z,” namely:  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
• supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold under those same constraints (e.g., one cannot get “NW,” “SW,” “B,” etc. without contradicting the above inequalities).  

Therefore, if x is W of y and y is W of z, the only possible relation of x to z is also W.
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: From the definitions, “x W y” means

• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
• supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).

And “y E z” means

• supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
• supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Combining these in the y-dimension gives

infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z),

so in the vertical (y) direction, all of x’s bounds are “inside” y’s, which in turn are “inside” z’s.  In the x-dimension, however, we only know

supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)  and  supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),

which does not tell us whether x is to the left or right of z, nor whether one bounding box contains the other in the x-direction.  One checks each cardinal relation a–z to see which are compatible with these inequalities; one finds exactly three are possible:

• x B z  (x’s bounding box is contained in z’s),  
• x W z  (x is strictly west of z),  
• x E z  (x is strictly east of z).

No other cardinal direction conditions can simultaneously satisfy those x- and y-inequalities.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are B, W, or E.
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: From the defining inequalities one can see that “x W y” forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (i.e. supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)), and “y S z” forces y to lie strictly below z (i.e. supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z)).  Combining these facts places x “west” of y and y “south” of z, which can position x in various ways relative to z.  A direct check of all nine relations shows exactly four that can be satisfied (possibly in degenerate cases):

• S:  x can be directly south of z if it also lies horizontally within z’s bounding box.  
• SW:  x can be southwest of z if it is both left (supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)) and below (supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z)) of z.  
• W:  x can be due west of z—again in a (vertically) degenerate scenario in which x’s bounding‐box “just touches” z’s bounding box from the left.  
• B:  x can be inside z’s bounding box if, for instance, x is degenerate on the line y = infᵧ(z) and also squeezed horizontally inside [infₓ(z), supₓ(z)].  

Hence, the possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z (given x W y and y S z) are  
S, SW, W, B.
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: From the definitions, one sees that  
• “x W y” means x is strictly to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and, in the vertical dimension, the bounding box of x is contained in that of y (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
• “y NW z” means y is strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and strictly above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  

Chain these together in the x‐coordinate first:

   supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

implies

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

Hence x is strictly to the left of z.  

Next look at the y‐coordinates:  
• From x W y we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• From y NW z we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Because infy(y) ≤ infy(x), one obtains

   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),

i.e. z lies strictly below x (the top of z is at or below the bottom of x).  

Putting both coordinates together:

   – in x:  supx(x) ≤ infx(z)   (x left of z),  
   – in y:  supy(z) ≤ infy(x)   (x above z).

By definition, that is exactly “x NW z.”  No other direction relation can hold under these constraints (all others require some overlap or containment in coordinates that is contradicted by the above inequalities).  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: From the given definitions,  
• “x W y” means  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• “y SW z” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Chain these inequalities:

1) From x W y and y SW z along the x-dimension:  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
   In particular, supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

2) From x W y (vertical containment by y) and y SW z (y is strictly below z) along the y-dimension:  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
   In particular, supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hence, for x and z, we get  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
which exactly matches the definition of “x SW z.”  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold once those two strict “≤” constraints (in x and y) are satisfied. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: From the given definitions one can show that from  
• x W y ⇒ supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y), infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x), and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y),  
• y SE z ⇒ supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  

it follows that supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z). Hence the top of x is below (or at) the bottom of z, so x is somewhere strictly south of z.

Because there is no information to fix x and z relative to one another in the x‐direction (we only know both of them lie “to the west” of or “meet” infₓ(y), but not how x and z compare directly), x may lie entirely to the left of z, directly underneath z, or entirely to the right of z. Consequently, the only possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are  
• SW (if x is also to the west),  
• S (if x is directly underneath), or  
• SE (if x is also to the east).  
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: From the definitions, the key observations are that  
• x W y implies that x’s bounding box lies entirely to the left of y’s (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) but is vertically “within” y’s bounding box: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• y NE z implies y is above and to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  

Since x is vertically within y and y lies strictly above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)), chaining these gives supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Hence x and z do not vertically overlap; x is strictly north of z.  

Once x is strictly north of z, the remaining question is the horizontal positioning of x relative to z. Depending on how wide z is and where x sits (still always left of y), one finds that x can be:  
• Directly north of z (N),  
• North-west of z (NW), or  
• North-east of z (NE).  

No other relation is possible without contradicting one of the bounding-box constraints. Thus, the possible relations between x and z are N, NW, or NE.
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: From the given definitions, “x W y” means

1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y),

and “y B z” means

4) infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
5) infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From 2) and 5) it follows that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and from 3) and 5) it follows that supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  Hence, in the y-dimension, x is fully “inside” z’s bounding box.  

However, along the x-dimension we only know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y).  Whether x ends up strictly to the left of z (which would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) or entirely inside z (which would require infx(x) ≥ infx(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) cannot be pinned down from the given information alone.  

Consequently, the only two cardinal‐direction relations between x and z consistent with “x W y” and “y B z” are  
• x W z (if x’s bounding box lies strictly to the left of z’s), or  
• x B z (if x’s bounding box is contained within z’s).
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: From the definitions, “x E y” means:  
1) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)        (x is to the right of y),  
2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  

And “y N z” means:  
1) supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y)        (y is above z),  
2) infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
3) supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).  

From 1) of y N z, supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y), and from 2)–3) of x E y, x lies vertically inside y’s bounding box.  Hence in the vertical dimension, x is also strictly above z (since y is itself above z, and x cannot dip below y).  

In the horizontal dimension, y is contained within z (because infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)), but x sits to the right of y (since supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)).  Whether infₓ(x) still lies ≤ supₓ(z) or instead exceeds supₓ(z) determines whether x is horizontally contained within z or is to the right of z.  

• If infₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z), then x is “above” z but still within z horizontally.  By definition, that is x N z.  
• If infₓ(x) > supₓ(z), then x is “above” and also strictly to the right of z.  By definition, that is x NE z.  

No other cardinal‐direction placements of x relative to z can be consistent with x E y and y N z.  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are N or NE.
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: x being E of y tells us that, vertically, x’s bounding‐box is contained in y’s bounding‐box (that is, infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)), and x lies strictly to the right of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)).  
Similarly, y being W of z implies that y’s bounding‐box is contained in z’s bounding‐box vertically (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)), and y is strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).  

Putting those together, the vertical containments chain up so that x’s bounding‐box is contained within z’s bounding‐box vertically.  In particular,  
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence x and z cannot lie strictly north, south, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest of each other, because all of those relations require some vertical separation that does not exist here.  The only remaining possibilities are:

• x W z, if x also lies strictly to the left of z (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  
• x E z, if x lies strictly to the right of z (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  
• x B z, if x’s bounding‐box is completely contained by z’s bounding‐box in both x and y directions.

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W, E, or B.
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: From the definitions one can show that if x is E of y and y is E of z, then necessarily x must also be E of z (and no other of the listed relations can hold).  Here is a sketch of why:

1)  x E y says (in the x-dimension) supx(y) ≤ infx(x), and (in the y-dimension) x’s bounding‐box “fits” within y’s bounding‐box, i.e.,  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

2)  y E z likewise says (in the x-dimension) supx(z) ≤ infx(y), and (in the y-dimension) y’s bounding‐box fits within z’s bounding‐box, i.e.,  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

3)  From (2) we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  From (1) we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  Since for any region y we must have infx(y) ≤ supx(y), it follows  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),
   so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  That is exactly the x‐part of “x E z.”

4)  For the y‐part, chaining the inequalities from (1) and (2) shows that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  Hence x’s vertical bounding‐box also sits inside z’s vertical bounding‐box, matching the y‐part of “x E z.”

No other relation is compatible with these chained inequalities.  In particular, “x B z” would require supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but from y E z and x E y one deduces supx(z) ≤ supx(x), forcing equality in a way that contradicts the strict left‐to‐right placement.  Likewise, “N,” “S,” “NE,” “SE,” etc., all fail because x’s bounding‐box (vertical) ends up lying inside z’s in the y‐dimension, ruling out the pure “above” or “below” possibilities.  

Thus the only possible relation between x and z, given x E y and y E z, is x E z.
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: From the given definitions, we know the following about x and y, and y and z:

1) x E y means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x),   
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

   In particular, supx(y) ≤ infx(x) tells us that x is strictly to the right of y in the x-dimension, and the other two inequalities say that x’s bounding box in the y-dimension is contained in y’s bounding box.

2) y S z means  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and  
   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

   In particular, supy(y) ≤ infy(z) tells us that y is strictly below z in the y-dimension, and the x-range of y is contained in that of z.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Y-DIMENSION ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since y is strictly below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)) and x’s y-bounding box is contained in y’s (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)), it follows

   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Hence x is also strictly below z, so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X-DIMENSION ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We also have:

   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)    (because y’s box is contained in z’s),  
   and  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)                        (because x is to the right of y).

Thus the region x can end up in two essentially different “horizontal” positions relative to z:

• x can still lie completely within z’s x-bounding box, i.e.  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  
  In this case, together with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is S of z.

• Or x can be to the right of z in the x-dimension, i.e.  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
  Then, along with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is SE of z.

What cannot happen is that x is, for example, B of z (that would require x’s entire bounding box to lie inside z’s in both x and y, but we already have supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x’s box is entirely below z’s box in the y-dimension and thus cannot be “inside”). Nor can x be E of z, because that would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicting supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore, if x is E of y and y is S of z, then x can only be S or SE of z.
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: From the vertical‐ordering conditions alone one sees that x must lie entirely above z, since from “x E y” and “y NW z” one can deduce supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  That already rules out all relations in which x would intersect or lie below z (such as S or SE).  Horizontally, however, there are no constraints forcing x to be left, right, or “within” z.  Consequently, the only possibilities consistent with x being above z are N, NE, or NW.
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions, two key facts emerge:

1.  x E y implies  
   •  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)       (x is strictly to the right of y),  
   •  infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (vertically, x is contained in y’s bounding box).

2.  y SW z implies  
   •  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)       (y is strictly to the left of z),  
   •  supy(y) ≤ infy(z)       (y is strictly below z).

Since x’s vertical extent is contained in y’s, we have  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which shows x must lie entirely below z.  Horizontally, however, we only know that
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z),
but there is no direct comparison between infx(x) (or supx(x)) and infx(z) (or supx(z)).

Therefore, in terms of the cardinal‐direction definitions, the only certainty is that x lies below z.  Depending on the horizontal alignment, x could be:

• S of z  (if x is below z and horizontally “within” z),  
• SW of z (if x is below and to the left),  
• SE of z (if x is below and to the right).

No other relation can be guaranteed or ruled out from the given data. Thus, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, or SE.
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: From the defining inequalities, one sees that:

•  x E y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
  (x lies strictly to the east of y, and is vertically “within” y.)  

•  y SE z ⇒  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
  (y lies strictly to the southeast of z.)

Chaining these:

1)  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
   ⇒  supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
   so x is strictly to the east of z.  

2)  supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  
   ⇒  supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
   so x is strictly below z.

Hence, x ends up strictly to the southeast of z.  In other words, the only possible relation between x and z under those assumptions is  
SE.
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: From the defining inequalities, one can see that “x E y” entails  
(1) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x),  
(2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
(3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y),  

while “y NE z” entails  
(4) supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
(5) supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y).  

Chaining (4) with (1) gives supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x), so supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x).  
Chaining (5) with (2) gives supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x).  

Hence relative to z, x lies strictly to the right (supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)) and above (supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x)).  The only cardinal‐direction relation that says “to the right and above” is NE.  Therefore, the only possibility consistent with x E y and y NE z is  

NE.
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: From the definitions, the key pieces are:

•  x E y means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

•  y B z means  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
   supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chain these inequalities in both x and y directions:

1) In the x-direction:  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
   and from x E y we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   Hence,  
      infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   However, we do not know how infx(x) compares to supx(z).  It can be either infx(x) ≤ supx(z) (meaning x fits horizontally within z) or infx(x) > supx(z) (meaning x lies strictly to the right of z).

2) In the y-direction:  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   So vertically, x is contained within z’s bounding box (since infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

Because x’s vertical extent is contained within z, and because horizontally x may or may not lie entirely within z, exactly two of the cardinal‐direction definitions remain possible:

•  x B z can happen if x also lies within z horizontally, i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  
•  x E z can happen if x is strictly to the right of z, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

No other pure cardinal direction is compatible with the above chains.  Thus, the only possible relations of x to z under x E y and y B z are  
B or E.
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: From the definitions one sees that “x S y” and “y N z” together force x’s bounding‐box to lie horizontally inside z’s (because x lies inside y and y lies inside z horizontally), but place no direct vertical ordering between x and z.  In symbols:

•  x S y ⇒  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(y)   and   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

•  y N z ⇒  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y)   and   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Putting these together forces  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),

so horizontally x is “inside” z.  Vertically, however, we only know both x and z lie below y (so supy(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(y)), but not how x and z compare to each other.  One can place x either entirely below z, entirely above z, or even entirely inside z’s bounding box.  Checking each cardinal‐direction definition shows:

•  x S z (x south of z) is possible if we arrange supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
•  x N z (x north of z) is possible if we arrange supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
•  x B z (x’s box is inside z’s box) is possible if we make both x’s horizontal and vertical extents lie within those of z.

All other directions (E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) require horizontal bounds that contradict infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

Therefore, the only possible relations between x and z under “x S y” and “y N z” are  
N, S, or B.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: From the defining inequalities it follows that x must lie to the left of z (because x S y and y W z together imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  Once x is to the left of z, its vertical position relative to z can range from being wholly below z, lining up inside z’s vertical extent, or wholly above z.  In terms of the definitions:

• x W z happens if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
• x SW z happens if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
• x NW z happens if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Hence the only possible relations of x to z are W, SW, or NW.
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: From the given definitions one can show that “x is S of y” forces x to lie strictly below y (in the sense supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), and “y is E of z” forces y (and hence also x) to lie strictly to the right of z (in the sense supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)).  Once x is known to be to the right of z, the only remaining possibilities for x’s vertical position relative to z are:

• x could lie entirely below z (making x SE of z),  
• x could lie entirely above z (making x NE of z), or  
• x could be contained in z’s vertical span (making x E of z).

Hence, the possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z are E, NE, or SE.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: From the definitions, “x is S of y” precisely means:

1. supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2. infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Similarly, “y is S of z” means:

4. supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
5. infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and  
6. supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Combine (1) with (4).  Since infy(y) ≤ supy(y) always, we get:  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
Hence, supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Combine (2) with (5).  We get:  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
Hence, infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Combine (3) with (6).  We get:  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
Hence, supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

Putting these together:

• supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

But these three inequalities are exactly the definition that “x is S of z.”  No other cardinal‐direction condition can be forced from these constraints.  Therefore, if x is S of y and y is S of z, the only possible relation between x and z is again S.
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: From the given definitions one can show that x must lie strictly to the left of z (because x is horizontally within y and y is itself strictly to the left of z), but nothing forces x to be above, below, or vertically contained in z’s bounding box.  Concretely:

•  x S y implies supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
•  y NW z implies supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Putting these together gives supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is strictly to the left of z.  However, there is no constraint fixing whether x is above, below, or vertically inside z.  Checking the definitions shows that precisely the “to the left” relations (NW, W, SW) remain possible.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, or SW.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions, the key inequalities for x S y and y SW z are:

• x S y means  
  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

• y SW z means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

First, from x S y we see that x is entirely below y (its top is not above y’s bottom) and horizontally within y’s bounding box. Meanwhile, y SW z says y is entirely to the left of z (its right is not beyond z’s left) and entirely below z (its top is not above z’s bottom). Combining these:

1. Because supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
   This places x to the left of z.  

2. Because supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
   This places x below z.  

Hence x is both strictly to the left and strictly below z, which is precisely the definition of x SW z. Consequently, the only possible cardinal direction relation of x to z under these conditions is SW.
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: From the given definitions, “x S y” forces x to lie strictly below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and horizontally within y. Meanwhile, “y SE z” forces y to lie strictly southeast of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)). Combining these:

• From y SE z we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  
• From x S y we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x lies strictly to the right of z.

Similarly,

• From y SE z we get supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
• From x S y we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y).  

Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x lies strictly below z.

Putting these together—x is to the right of z and below z—matches exactly the definition of “SE.” Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: From the two given relations one can deduce that, in terms of bounding boxes, z must lie strictly to the left of x.  Indeed, from  
• x S y ⇒ supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(y) and infₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x), and  
• y NE z ⇒ supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x),  
it follows that supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x): z’s box ends (in the x‐direction) at or before x’s box begins.  

However, there is no constraint forcing x to be above or below z.  Consequently, the only cardinal‐direction possibilities (which require “x to the right of z”) are precisely E, NE, or SE.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: From the definitions, “x S y” means x is strictly below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and horizontally within y (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).  Also, “y B z” means y’s bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box (infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

Chaining these facts tells us that horizontally, x is inside z’s bounding box (because x is inside y and y is inside z).  Vertically, however, x could do either of the following with respect to z:

• Lie completely inside z’s bounding box (i.e., infy(x) ≥ infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), in which case x B z.  
• Lie entirely below z (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), in which case x S z.

No other of the nine relations can occur under these constraints.  Consequently, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z are  
S or B.
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: From the given definitions one sees first that “x is NW of y” (x NW y) implies, in particular,

  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Likewise “y is N of z” (y N z) implies

  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   and   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Chaining these in the y‐direction,

  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x),

shows that z lies strictly below x (its top is no higher than x’s bottom).  Consequently, x cannot be S, SE, SW, or W of z (all of which would require x to be level with or below z in y‐coordinates).  Nor can x “bound” z (x B z) or vice versa because that would require their bounding boxes to overlap or contain one another vertically, which is ruled out by supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Hence the only remaining “above” possibilities in the standard definitions are N, NE, and NW:

• x N z requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (already true) and that z’s bounding box in x fully covers x’s in x.  Since z can be arbitrarily wide, this can happen.

• x NE z requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning z is below and to the left, and x is above and to the right.  Nothing so far forbids z being far enough left that supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

• x NW z requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is above and to the left, z is below and to the right.  Again, not ruled out by the given constraints.

Thus, if x is NW of y and y is N of z, then x can only be N, NW, or NE of z.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: From the given definitions one can show that the only way to chain “x NW y” and “y W z” is to place x strictly to the left of z, and either above z or “vertically contained” with respect to z.  In the formal definitions:

•  x NW y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
•  y W  z  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Chaining the x NW y and y W z inequalities shows in particular  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
so x is necessarily to the left of z (since supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  

Depending on how the “tops” and “bottoms” of x and z compare (which is not fixed by the above constraints alone), x can either fit the definition of W of z or NW of z:

•  x W z  is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (already ensured) and vertically x is “contained” in z,  
•  x NW z is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (again ensured) and z lies fully below x (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  

No other cardinal‑direction definitions (N, S, E, etc.) can be satisfied once x is known to lie strictly to the left of z.  Hence the only possible relations between x and z under these hypotheses are

   NW   or   W.
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: From the given definitions, we have two pieces of information:

1) x NW y, which (by definition) means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   In words, x is strictly to the left of y in the x‑direction and strictly above y in the y‑direction (since y’s top is below x’s bottom).

2) y E z, which (by definition) means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   In words, y is strictly to the right of z in the x‑direction, and in the y‑direction y’s bounding box fits within z’s bounding box.

We want the possible relations of x to z.  One finds that demanding x be strictly south of z or southeast of z or southwest of z leads to contradictions when combined with the above two facts (because y, which is below x, is itself contained in z’s vertical extent, thereby preventing x from lying entirely below z).  However, all of the following turn out to be consistent with the two given constraints:

• N (x strictly north of z),  
• NE (x strictly north‑east of z),  
• E (x strictly east of z, vertically contained),  
• W (x strictly west of z, vertically contained),  
• NW (x strictly north‑west of z),  
• B (x’s bounding box contained in z, i.e. “x B z”).

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are precisely N, NE, E, W, NW, or B, and not S, SE, or SW.
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: From the definitions it follows that “x NW y” forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and strictly above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), while “y S z” forces y to lie strictly below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)) and horizontally within z (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).  

Because there is no direct bounding‐box constraint relating x and z (only via y), x may end up either wholly or partly inside z, or else be strictly to the left (or to the left‐and‐above/below), or possibly even entirely above or below, depending on how large z is and how x is placed relative to y.  

A straightforward check shows that the only impossible relations are those requiring z to lie strictly to the left of x (i.e., “x NE z”, “x E z”, and “x SE z”), since that would contradict x already being to the left of y (and y being contained in z).  

All other nine‐relation possibilities either are obviously consistent or can be realized by a suitable placement and sizing of the disks.  Concretely, the possible relations of x to z, given x NW y and y S z, are precisely:

• N  
• NW  
• W  
• SW  
• S  
• B  

and not NE, E, or SE.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: From the defining inequalities one sees immediately that  
• x NW y implies supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
• y NW z implies supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) and supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y).  

Chaining these together,  
supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)  ⇒  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x)  ⇒  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x).  

Hence x satisfies  
supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)  and  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
which are exactly the conditions for x NW z.  

No other relation (W, N, B, etc.) can hold, because all of them would be contradicted by the strict “left-and-above” chaining just derived. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions one sees that x NW y ⇒  
(1) supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)   and   (2) supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  

while y SW z ⇒  
(3) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)   and   (4) supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).  

From (1) and (3), we can chain  
supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z),  
so supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z).  
Hence, in the x-dimension, x lies strictly to the left (or just touches) z.

In contrast, the y-inequalities only tell us that y lies below both x and z (since supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z)), but they give no direct ordering between x and z in the vertical dimension.  Consequently, x may be above z (making x NW of z), or below z (making x SW of z), or else x may fit vertically within z’s bounding box (making x W of z).  No other relative placements are consistent with supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z).  

Therefore, the only possible cardinal-direction relations between x and z are NW, W, or SW.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: A succinct way to see that all nine relations remain possible is to note that “x NW y” forces x to lie strictly left‐and‐above y in bounding‐box terms, and “y SE z” forces y strictly right‐and‐below z.  However, those two facts only give

• x < y and z < y in the x‐dimension (that is, both x and z lie to the “left” of y),  
• x > y and z > y in the y‐dimension (both x and z lie “above” y).

Nothing in those inequalities determines whether x is left or right of z, nor whether x is above or below z; one can freely choose x’s and z’s bounding boxes so as to realize any of the nine cardinal‐direction possibilities (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) between x and z. Consequently, every one of the nine relations is consistent with “x NW y and y SE z.”
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: From the given definitions, “x NW y” means:

• supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is strictly to the left of y)  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (y is strictly below x)

and “y NE z” means:

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  (z is strictly to the left of y)  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  (z is strictly below y)

Hence y is below x, and z is below y; therefore z is below x.  In the coordinate‐direction terminology above, that forces x to be “north” of z in some sense (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  However, no constraints fix whether x is to the left, to the right, or “horizontally inside” relative to z.  

As a result, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations of x to z (given that x is above z but with indeterminate horizontal placement) are:

• x N z  
• x NE z  
• x NW z  

Thus the answer is: N, NE, NW.
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: From the definitions one can check systematically which of the nine relations  
─ N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B ─  
are still possible between x and z under the assumptions

• x NW y  (i.e. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)),  
• y B z   (i.e.  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

A brief sketch of why exactly N, W, NW, or B remain possible (and the others do not) goes as follows:

1)  x B z.  
   There is no contradiction in having z large enough to contain both y and x in its bounding box.  

2)  x NW z.  
   Since x is already “to the left of and above” y, and y is contained in z, it is perfectly possible for x also to lie strictly to the left of and above the bounding box of z (z could enclose y well to the “bottom‐right,” with x further “top‐left”).  

3)  x W z.  
   Being strictly to the left of z (no horizontal overlap) but vertically inside z’s bounding box also does not contradict x NW y and y B z: one may place x in the left‐hand portion of z’s bounding box (so it is “vertically inside” z) yet still strictly left of y.  

4)  x N z.  
   Being strictly above z (no vertical overlap) while nevertheless “horizontally inside” z’s bounding box is also compatible: x can be perched directly above z, and y can lie inside z, below x.  

Conversely, one finds that placing x strictly to the right (E, SE, NE) or strictly below (S, SE, SW) of z contradicts the geometry forced by x NW y and y B z.  

Hence the only possible relations between x and z are  
     N, W, NW, or B.
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: All nine relations remain possible. Since x’s being SW of y and y’s being N of z impose no direct inequalities relating x and z (they only constrain each to lie “south” of y in the vertical direction, without forcing an ordering between x and z themselves), x can be placed relative to z so as to satisfy any of B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, or SE.
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: From the two hypotheses

• x SW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y W z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

one deduces

1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   so x must lie wholly to the left of z,  
2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  

Meanwhile, y's box is vertically contained in z's box, i.e. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  Because x lies below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) but y is contained in z, x may still lie either below z altogether (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) or be vertically contained in z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  

Hence the only ways x can relate to z (under the given definitions) are:

• x SW z, if x is both to the left and strictly below z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)),  
• x W z, if x is to the left of z but vertically contained in z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

No other cardinal‐direction definitions can be satisfied given these conditions. Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are SW or W.
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: From the defining inequalities one sees immediately that placing x “above” z is impossible, because x is already forced below y (via x SW y) while y is contained in z vertically (via y E z).  In particular, x N z, x NE z, or x NW z would require x to lie above z in the bounding‐box sense, which cannot be made consistent with x lying below y and y lying inside z.  

On the other hand, letting x be strictly to one side or below z, or letting z’s bounding box be large enough to contain x, does not contradict any of the given conditions.  Consequently, the directions x S z, x SW z, x W z, x E z, x SE z, and x B z can all be realized by appropriate placements satisfying x SW y and y E z.  

Hence the possible relations between x and z are exactly  
B, S, SW, W, E, and SE.
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: From the definitions, “x SW y” imposes  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
so x lies strictly to the left and below y.  

Also, “y S z” imposes  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
so y lies strictly below z (but horizontally within z’s bounding box).

Chaining these together implies that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), so x also lies strictly below z.  However, whether x is left of, or horizontally within, z’s bounding box depends on how infx(x), supx(x) compare to infx(z), supx(z).  In particular:

• If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is also strictly left of z, giving x SW z.  
• If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x can lie vertically below but horizontally within z’s bounding box, giving x S z.  

No other relation can hold, because x must be below z (ruling out N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, B) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) cannot occur (which would be needed for x to be to the right of z).  

Hence the possible relations from x to z are S or SW.
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: From the definitions one can check that “x SW y” forces x to lie strictly to the left and below y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), while “y NW z” forces y to lie strictly to the left and above z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Piecing these together yields that x is strictly to the left of z (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) but imposes no definitive ordering of x and z in the vertical dimension (both lie below y, but we do not know which is higher).  Consequently, the only ways x can relate to z among the nine given relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are precisely

• x SW z,  
• x W z, or  
• x NW z.
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions,

• x SW y ⇔ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y SW z ⇔ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Chaining these inequalities gives  
1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), exactly the conditions for  
x SW z.  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can be made to hold under these constraints (for example, to have x S z one would need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is incompatible with supx(x) ≤ infx(z), etc.).  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: From the given definitions:

•  x SW y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
•  y SE z  ⇒  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Chain these inequalities vertically to compare x and z.  

1.  From x SW y we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
2.  From y SE z we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  In particular,  
supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

That tells us x must lie entirely below (or just touch) z.  Once x is known to lie below z, the only cardinal‐direction relations consistent with “x is below z” in the above definitions are S, SW, and SE (depending on whether x is horizontally within z, to its left, or to its right).  

Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are:  
S, SW, or SE.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: All nine of the listed relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) can occur.  To see why, note that  
• “x SW y” forces x to lie strictly to the left and below y,  
• “y NE z” forces z to lie strictly to the left and below y as well,  

but these two facts alone place no constraint on whether x is to the left/right/above/below/etc. of z.  By suitably positioning and sizing x and z (both still left‐below y), any of the nine cardinal relations between x and z can be realized.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: From the definitions one can check systematically which of the nine relations between x and z are consistent with

• x SW y:  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
• y B z:   infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z) and infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Because y is “inside” z (due to y B z), it is possible for x (which is left/below y) to be variously placed with respect to z, as long as supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y), supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y), and y’s bounding box is contained in z’s.  One finds that the only consistent possibilities are that x is:

• B of z (if x also fits entirely inside z),  
• S of z (if x is entirely below z but horizontally within z),  
• W of z (if x is entirely to the left of z but vertically within z),  
• SW of z (if x is below and to the left of z).

No other relation can be satisfied. Hence the possible relations between x and z are: B, S, W, or SW.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: From the definitions, the key observations are:

•  x SE y  means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
   (x is strictly to the right and strictly below y in terms of bounding boxes.)

•  y N z  means  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y),   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
   (y is strictly above z, and y’s bounding box in the x‐direction is inside that of z.)

We wish to see which relations between x and z can (or cannot) be satisfied simultaneously with these constraints.  The critical point is that  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  
force y to lie (in the x‐direction) between z and x.  It turns out that this rules out any relation of x to z that requires

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z),

because chaining the inequalities leads to a contradiction.  In particular, the relations W, NW, and SW all require

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z),

so those three cannot occur.  

On the other hand, all other cardinal‐direction relations—namely B, S, N, NE, E, and SE—do not force this contradiction and can be achieved by suitably enlarging or placing z (which, by definition of y N z, already extends at least as far in x as y does).  Concretely:

•  B (bounding) can occur by letting z be large enough in both x and y so as to contain x’s bounding box.  
•  S, N, E, and NE (and similarly SE) can be arranged by placing z appropriately above/below x or to the left/right of x (or both), as there is no forced contradiction in those cases.

Hence the possible relations of x to z are:

B, S, N, NE, E, and SE.
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: Solely from “x SE y” and “y W z,” one cannot fix a single direction for “x ? z,” but one can show that x cannot lie north of z.  In fact, all of the following can occur (no others):

• B  (x’s box is inside z’s box),  
• S  (x is entirely south of z),  
• SW (x is south-and-west of z),  
• W  (x is west of z),  
• E  (x is east of z),  
• SE (x is south-and-east of z).

Hence the possible relations are B, S, SW, W, E, and SE.
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: E, NE, or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: From the defining inequalities one sees that “x SE y” (i.e., x is southeast of y) forces x to lie strictly to the right and strictly below y’s bounding box, while “y S z” forces y to lie strictly below (but horizontally within) z’s bounding box.  Chaining these shows that x must lie strictly below z (because x is below y and y is below z), but x may either be horizontally within z or to the right of z.  Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are:

• S (south), or  
• SE (southeast).
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: All nine relations are possible.  In other words, knowing that x is SE of y and y is NW of z imposes no direct bounding‐box constraint between x and z, so x and z can satisfy any of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: From the defining inequalities one sees that x SE y implies

  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),

so x is strictly to the east and south of y (in bounding‐box terms).  
Similarly, y SW z implies

  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z),

so y is strictly to the west and south of z.

Putting these together shows that x is below z (because x is below y and y is below z), so we must have supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  However, the given information does not fix their relative positions in the x‐direction; x could be left of, right of, or horizontally within z.  Precisely those three “southerly” relations will still hold:

• x SW z if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• x S z  if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and (horizontally x lies within z’s bounding box),  
• x SE z if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hence the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: From the given definitions,  
• “x SE y” means  
  (1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (“y is left of x”),  
  (2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y)   (“x is below y”),  

• “y SE z” means  
  (3) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   (“z is left of y”),  
  (4) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (“y is below z”).  

Chaining (1) and (3) in the x‑direction gives  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so in particular supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
This says that z lies entirely to the left of x.  

Chaining (2) and (4) in the y‑direction gives  
  supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
so in particular supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
This says that x lies entirely below z.  

Hence, relative to z, region x is strictly to its right (no horizontal overlap) and strictly below (no vertical overlap).  By the definitions of the cardinal directions, the only one that requires  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
is precisely “x SE z.”  

Therefore, if x is SE of y and y is SE of z, then x must also be SE of z.  
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: From the given definitions, the key facts are:

•	x SE y means  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
  (x is strictly to the right of y and strictly below y.)

•	y NE z means  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
  (y is strictly to the right of z and strictly above z.)

From the first condition (x SE y) and the second (y NE z), one deduces that

•	xmin(x) > xmax(y) > xmax(z),  

so x is strictly to the right of z (no overlap in x).  That immediately rules out W, SW, NW, N, S, and B as possibilities for x relative to z, because those would all require x not to be strictly to the right (for instance, W or NW would require x to be to the left, and B or S require x to be horizontally contained).  

At the same time, there are no constraints that force x to sit above, below, or be contained in z’s vertical extent, since “y above z” does not pin down where x lies relative to z’s vertical range (only that x is below y).  Consequently, x can be:

•  E of z, if (among other things) infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)  
   (i.e., x sits entirely in the vertical span of z),
•  NE of z, if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)  
   (x sits above z), or  
•  SE of z, if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
   (x sits below z).

Hence the only possible cardinal‐direction relations of x to z are E, NE, or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: From the defining inequalities it follows that “x SE y” means  
(1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   (2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
so x lies strictly to the right of y’s bounding box and strictly below y’s bounding box.  

Also “y B z” means  
(3) infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   (4) supx(y) ≤ supx(z),   (5) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   (6) supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
so y’s entire bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box.

The question is then which relations “x ? z” can satisfy, subject to (1)–(6).  One finds that x can either be:  

• B of z (fully contained in z),  
• S of z (strictly below z),  
• E of z (strictly to the right of z), or  
• SE of z (strictly below and to the right of z).  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can be made consistent with (1)–(6).  Consequently, the possible relations between x and z are  
B, S, E, SE.
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: From the two given constraints

• x NE y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• y N z   ⇒  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z),

one can deduce that

1) supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
   ⇒  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

   Thus, x lies strictly above z (since the top of z, supy(z), is at or below the bottom of x, infy(x)).

2) Horizontally, however, x could (a) sit entirely to the right of z (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), or (b) be nested (at least partially) within z's horizontal extent (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) < supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  

   In the first case (a), x is northeast of z; in the second case (b), x is “north” of z in the sense of being above but horizontally contained within z.

Hence, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations of x with respect to z are  
• N (if x is directly above and horizontally contained by z), or  
• NE (if x is above and entirely to the right of z).
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: From the definitions one sees that “x NE y” forces x to lie strictly to the right and strictly above y, while “y W z” forces y to lie strictly to the left of z (in x) but be vertically contained by z (in y).  Because x is already above y, and y is contained in z’s vertical extent, it is impossible for x to lie strictly below z (that would force x still lower than y, contradicting x NE y).  Consequently, the only viable relations of x to z turn out to be

• N  (x strictly above z, horizontally contained by z),  
• NE (x strictly above and to the right of z),  
• E  (x strictly to the right of z, vertically contained by z),  
• NW (x strictly above and to the left of z),  
• W  (x strictly to the left of z, vertically contained by z),  
• B  (z’s bounding box completely contains x’s bounding box).

All “southerly” relations (S, SE, SW) are ruled out by the fact that x is above y and y is vertically contained in z. Thus, the possible relations between x and z are exactly N, NE, E, NW, W, or B.
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: From the given definitions, the key pieces are:

1) x NE y means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   (That is, y’s bounding box is entirely below and to the left of x’s bounding box.)

2) y E z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   (So z is strictly to the left of y, but vertically can contain y or align with it.)

Chain these horizontally:

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).

Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which tells us that z lies completely to the left of x.  

Since there is no enforced strict ordering in the y‐direction between x and z (we only know y is below x and is contained in or aligned with z vertically, but that does not fix x’s vertical position relative to z), the only possibilities are that x is East, North‐East, or South‐East of z.  

Thus the possible relations between x and z are: E, NE, or SE.
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: From the defining inequalities one can check systematically that, under  
  • x NE y  ⇔  supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  • y S  z  ⇔  supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
it is impossible for x to lie strictly west (W, SW, or NW) of z, but all of the other six relations (B, S, N, NE, E, SE) can arise by suitably placing the three regions.  

A concise way to see why W, SW, and NW become impossible is that y S z forces z’s bounding box to be at least as far left as y’s (infx(z) ≤ infx(y)) while x NE y forces x to be strictly to the right of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)).  Trying to make x also lie strictly to the left of z (which is what a W-, SW-, or NW-type relation with z would require) leads to contradictory inequalities for infx(z) and supx(x).  

All other relations (B, S, N, NE, E, SE) can be realized by choosing appropriate bounding boxes for x and z.  

Answer:  the possible relations of x to z are B, S, N, NE, E, or SE.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: From the defining inequalities one sees that “x NE y” implies

• supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)   (x is above y),

while “y NW z” implies

• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)   (y is to the left of z), and  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y)   (y is above z).

In particular, from supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) we conclude z is strictly below x (there is a vertical “stack” z below y below x).  Horizontally, however, no direct ordering of infx(x) and infx(z) emerges from these inequalities; x can lie to the left, to the right, or even be horizontally contained within z.  

Consequently, the only viable ways for x to relate to z (given that x is definitely above z) are:

• x N z  (above and horizontally contained),  
• x NW z (above and to the left),  
• x NE z (above and to the right).

Hence the possible relations between x and z are {N, NW, NE}.
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions, “x NE y” only tells us  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
while “y SW z” only tells us  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

None of these inequalities link x’s bounding box directly to z’s, so there is no induced constraint forcing x to lie in any particular one of the nine relations with respect to z. Hence any of the nine relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) can occur between x and z.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: From the definitions,  
• x NE y means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Combining these implies in particular that  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so region z lies strictly to the left of region x.  

However, the given constraints do not fix whether x is above, below, or vertically contained with respect to z.  Recalling the definitions of E, NE, SE (all of which require supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), one sees that all three remain possible:

• x E z requires x to be strictly to the right of z and vertically contain z’s y-extent (or be contained by it).  
• x NE z requires x to be strictly to the right of z and strictly above it.  
• x SE z requires x to be strictly to the right of z and strictly below it.  

No other cardinal directions (N, S, W, NW, SW, or B) can hold under supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence, if x is NE of y and y is SE of z, then x could be E, NE, or SE of z.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: From the definitions, “x is NE of y” and “y is NE of z” respectively mean:

1) x NE y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
2) y NE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Combine these inequalities along each axis.  
• Along x:  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  which implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
• Along y:  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  which implies supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

But “x NE z” is exactly characterized by supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Hence x must also be NE of z.  

Answer: NE.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: From the definitions one sees that  
• “x NE y” means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• “y B z” means infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Because y is inside (or bounded by) z, supx(z) ≥ supx(y) and supy(z) ≥ supy(y). Meanwhile, x being NE of y forces x to lie strictly to the right and above y’s bounding box. Putting these together, one checks systematically whether each of the nine relations can hold between x and z. One finds that x can neither lie strictly south, west, southwest, northwest, nor southeast of z (all those lead to contradictions once one imposes x NE y and y B z).  

However, four relations remain possible:

1) x B z.  
   This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
   Since z’s bounding box is at least as large as y’s, and x is (by hypothesis) “to the NE” of y, it is consistent that x might still fit entirely inside z’s bounding box (particularly if z is large).

2) x N z.  
   This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and the x‑extent of x within that of z.  
   Because y is inside z and x sits above y, it can indeed happen that z’s top is still below x’s bottom (if, for example, y’s top coincides with z’s top, and x sits just above that).

3) x NE z.  
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
   Again, since z must at least encompass y, we can still have supx(z) = supx(y) < infx(x) and supy(z) = supy(y) < infy(x), which places x entirely northeast of z.

4) x E z.  
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (so z is fully to the left of x) but with overlapping y‑extent, i.e. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
   That too can occur if, for instance, supx(z) = supx(y) < infx(x) but vertically x fits between infy(z) and supy(z).  

Hence the only possible relations are B, N, NE, or E.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: From the definitions, “x B y” (x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box) means

  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),    supx(x) ≤ supx(y),
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),    supy(x) ≤ supy(y),

while “y N z” (y is entirely north of z) means

  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),    supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

We want the possible relations between x and z under these assumptions.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Horizontal (x‐)constraints
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From “x B y” we get  
  infx(x) ≥ infx(y)    and    supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

From “y N z” we get  
  infx(y) ≥ infx(z)    and    supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Putting these together:

  infx(x) ≥ infx(y) ≥ infx(z),  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Hence, horizontally, x is “inside” (or at worst tangent within) z’s bounding box.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Vertical (y‐)constraints
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From “x B y” we also have  
  infy(x) ≥ infy(y)    and    supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

From “y N z” we have  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Chain these:

  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

In other words, the entire bounding box of x lies at or above the top of z (since supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Checking each possible relation for x and z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• N (North).  
  The definition a N b requires:  
     supy(b) ≤ infy(a),  
     infx(b) ≤ infx(a),  
     supx(a) ≤ supx(b).  
  Substituting a = x, b = z, we get

  – supy(z) ≤ infy(x)     [this holds, from supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)],  
  – infx(z) ≤ infx(x)     [true, from infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)],  
  – supx(x) ≤ supx(z)     [true, from supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)].

  All three conditions are satisfied, so x N z is possible (and in fact inevitable for a nondegenerate region in REG).

• B (Bounding‐box containment).  
  The definition a B b requires:  
     infx(b) ≤ infx(a),    supx(a) ≤ supx(b),  
     infy(b) ≤ infy(a),    supy(a) ≤ supy(b).  
  For x B z this would mean supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  But from above we have  
     supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x).  
  The only way supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can also hold is if supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x),  
  forcing x to have zero vertical extent (a “degenerate” region).  Since in REG all regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk (so they are genuinely 2D), x cannot collapse to a line or a point.  Hence in REG this scenario is ruled out, and x B z does not occur for nondegenerate regions.

• Any other cardinal direction (E, W, S, etc.)  
  These all fail either because x ends up strictly north of z (so it cannot be E, W, SE, SW, etc.) or because the bounding‐box constraints contradict horizontal separation.

Consequently, for regions in REG (all truly two‐dimensional), the only feasible relation of x to z, given x B y and y N z, is:

  x N z.
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: From the definitions,  
• x B y means x’s bounding box is contained within y’s bounding box. In symbols:  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• y W z means y lies wholly to the west of z (their bounding boxes do not overlap horizontally, but are contained vertically). In symbols:  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Given x B y and y W z, we combine these constraints. First note:  
1) x B y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
2) y W z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
   Together, these imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

For the y-coordinates,  
1) y W z ⇒ infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
2) x B y ⇒ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
   Combining gives infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

All of these together precisely match the definition of x W z (i.e., x is wholly to the west of z, with vertical containment):  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

No other direction can be satisfied without contradicting the bounding‐box containments or the strict horizontal separation. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z, given x B y and y W z, is  
   x W z.
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: From the definitions, x B y means x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box (that is, horizontally and vertically, x lies within y).  On the other hand, y E z means y lies strictly to the right (east) of z while still fitting vertically within z’s bounding box.

Concretely:

• x B y implies  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

• y E z implies  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Putting these together:

1) Horizontally:  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   Thus supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

2) Vertically:  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
   so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

These are precisely the conditions for x E z (region x lies strictly to the right of z’s bounding box, while fitting vertically within it).  No other cardinal direction relation can hold under those constraints. 

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z, given x B y and y E z, is  
x E z.
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: Given that  
1) x B y means: infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
2) y S z means: supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  and  supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

we combine these as follows:

• From x B y we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• From y S z we get supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Putting the y and z inequalities together shows  
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
which forces x to lie entirely below z in the vertical dimension.  

Next, combining infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) tells us x’s bounding box is horizontally within z’s bounding box.  

Altogether, these exactly match the definition of x S z, namely  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

No other cardinal‐direction condition can be satisfied under these constraints (for instance, x cannot be SW or SE of z because that would demand contradictory x‐coordinate inequalities, etc.).  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is:  
S.
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: From the definitions, “x B y” means x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box; in coordinates:

• infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

And “y NW z” means y is northwest of z; in coordinates:

• supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

From these two, we can chain together:

1. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x B y)  
2. supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y NW z)  

Combining 1 and 2 gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Thus, x’s entire bounding box lies to the left of (or just abutting) z.

Similarly, from y NW z we also have supy(z) ≤ infy(y). Then using infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x B y), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Hence z is entirely (or just abutting) below x.

Putting these together:  
• x is to the left of z (since supx(x) ≤ infx(z)),  
• x is above z (since supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

By the definitions of the nine cardinal direction relations, “to the left and above” matches exactly NW. None of the other relations is compatible with both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for a nondegenerate region in REG. 

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z, given x B y and y NW z, is:  
x NW z.
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: From the definitions, x B y means  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

In other words, the bounding box of x is contained in the bounding box of y.  

Also, y SW z means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

From x B y we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y). Combining these with y SW z gives:  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

These two inequalities (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) are precisely the conditions for x SW z. No other cardinal relation can hold (for instance, x cannot be “W” or “S” of z, because that would require partial overlap in one dimension rather than being strictly below and to the left).  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: From the defining inequalities it follows that x must lie strictly to the right of z (since y is to the right of z and x is contained in y’s bounding box) and strictly below z (since y is below z and x is contained in y’s bounding box).  In symbols:

•  y SE z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

•  x B y means  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)   and  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

Putting these together shows  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   and  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
which is precisely the condition that x is southeast of z.  

Hence, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: From the given definitions, we have two pieces of information:

1) x B y means:  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

   In words, the bounding box of x lies completely inside the bounding box of y.

2) y NE z means:  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

   In words, z is strictly southwest of y: its “rightmost” x is at or to the left of y’s “leftmost” x, and its “topmost” y is at or below y’s “bottommost” y.

Combine these to relate x and z. From x B y we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x). From y NE z we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y). Putting them together:

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Hence,  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

By the definitions, x NE z if and only if  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

That is exactly what we found. Checking all other relations shows that none of them can be satisfied under these inequalities. Consequently, the only possible relation here is:

x NE z.
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: If x is B of y and y is B of z, then by definition we have

• infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combining these in the x-direction gives  
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
so infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

Similarly, in the y-direction we obtain  
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence x’s bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box, which means x is B of z. No other strict cardinal‐direction relationship (like N, S, E, W, etc.) is consistent with both x being inside y’s bounding box and y being inside z’s bounding box. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z, under those assumptions, is B.
