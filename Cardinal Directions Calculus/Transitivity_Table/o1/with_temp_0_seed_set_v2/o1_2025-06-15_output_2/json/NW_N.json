{"prompt": "Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions one sees first that \u201cx is NW of y\u201d (x NW y) implies, in particular,\n\n  supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)   and   supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).\n\nLikewise \u201cy is N of z\u201d (y N z) implies\n\n  supy(z) \u2264 infy(y),   infx(z) \u2264 infx(y),   and   supx(y) \u2264 supx(z).\n\nChaining these in the y\u2010direction,\n\n  supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x),\n\nshows that z lies strictly below x (its top is no higher than x\u2019s bottom).  Consequently, x cannot be S, SE, SW, or W of z (all of which would require x to be level with or below z in y\u2010coordinates).  Nor can x \u201cbound\u201d z (x B z) or vice versa because that would require their bounding boxes to overlap or contain one another vertically, which is ruled out by supy(z) \u2264 infy(x).\n\nHence the only remaining \u201cabove\u201d possibilities in the standard definitions are N, NE, and NW:\n\n\u2022 x N z requires supy(z) \u2264 infy(x) (already true) and that z\u2019s bounding box in x fully covers x\u2019s in x.  Since z can be arbitrarily wide, this can happen.\n\n\u2022 x NE z requires supy(z) \u2264 infy(x) and supx(z) \u2264 infx(x), meaning z is below and to the left, and x is above and to the right.  Nothing so far forbids z being far enough left that supx(z) \u2264 infx(x).\n\n\u2022 x NW z requires supy(z) \u2264 infy(x) and supx(x) \u2264 infx(z), meaning x is above and to the left, z is below and to the right.  Again, not ruled out by the given constraints.\n\nThus, if x is NW of y and y is N of z, then x can only be N, NW, or NE of z.", "elapsed-time": 40.346229791641235, "reasoning-tokens": 5760, "completion-tokens": 6255}
