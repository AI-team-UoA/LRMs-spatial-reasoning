{"prompt": "Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions one can show that from  \n\u2022 x W y \u21d2 sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y), inf\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x), and sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y),  \n\u2022 y SE z \u21d2 sup\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) and sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(z),  \n\nit follows that sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(z). Hence the top of x is below (or at) the bottom of z, so x is somewhere strictly south of z.\n\nBecause there is no information to fix x and z relative to one another in the x\u2010direction (we only know both of them lie \u201cto the west\u201d of or \u201cmeet\u201d inf\u2093(y), but not how x and z compare directly), x may lie entirely to the left of z, directly underneath z, or entirely to the right of z. Consequently, the only possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are  \n\u2022 SW (if x is also to the west),  \n\u2022 S (if x is directly underneath), or  \n\u2022 SE (if x is also to the east).
