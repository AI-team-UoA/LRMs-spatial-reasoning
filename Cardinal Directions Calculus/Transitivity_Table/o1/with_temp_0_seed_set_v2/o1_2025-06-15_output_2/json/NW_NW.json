{"prompt": "Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the defining inequalities one sees immediately that  \n\u2022 x NW y implies sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) and sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x),  \n\u2022 y NW z implies sup\u2093(y) \u2264 inf\u2093(z) and sup\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y).  \n\nChaining these together,  \nsup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) \u2264 sup\u2093(y) \u2264 inf\u2093(z)  \u21d2  sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(z),  \nsup\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x)  \u21d2  sup\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x).  \n\nHence x satisfies  \nsup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(z)  and  sup\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x),  \nwhich are exactly the conditions for x NW z.  \n\nNo other relation (W, N, B, etc.) can hold, because all of them would be contradicted by the strict \u201cleft-and-above\u201d chaining just derived. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.", "elapsed-time": 44.441110372543335, "reasoning-tokens": 5888, "completion-tokens": 6182}
