{"prompt": "Let B and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions, we have two pieces of information:\n\n1) x B y means:  \n   infx(y) \u2264 infx(x),   supx(x) \u2264 supx(y),  \n   infy(y) \u2264 infy(x),   supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).  \n\n   In words, the bounding box of x lies completely inside the bounding box of y.\n\n2) y NE z means:  \n   supx(z) \u2264 infx(y),   supy(z) \u2264 infy(y).  \n\n   In words, z is strictly southwest of y: its \u201crightmost\u201d x is at or to the left of y\u2019s \u201cleftmost\u201d x, and its \u201ctopmost\u201d y is at or below y\u2019s \u201cbottommost\u201d y.\n\nCombine these to relate x and z. From x B y we have infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) and infy(y) \u2264 infy(x). From y NE z we have supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(z) \u2264 infy(y). Putting them together:\n\n\u2022 supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 infx(x)  \n\u2022 supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 infy(x)\n\nHence,  \n   supx(z) \u2264 infx(x)   and   supy(z) \u2264 infy(x).\n\nBy the definitions, x NE z if and only if  \n   supx(z) \u2264 infx(x)   and   supy(z) \u2264 infy(x).\n\nThat is exactly what we found. Checking all other relations shows that none of them can be satisfied under these inequalities. Consequently, the only possible relation here is:\n\nx NE z.", "elapsed-time": 37.719178438186646, "reasoning-tokens": 5376, "completion-tokens": 5776}
