{"prompt": "Let S and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the defining inequalities it follows that x must lie to the left of z (because x\u202fS\u202fy and y\u202fW\u202fz together imply supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)).  Once x is to the left of z, its vertical position relative to z can range from being wholly below z, lining up inside z\u2019s vertical extent, or wholly above z.  In terms of the definitions:\n\n\u2022 x\u202fW\u202fz happens if infy(z) \u2264 infy(x) and supy(x) \u2264 supy(z).  \n\u2022 x\u202fSW\u202fz happens if supy(x) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\u2022 x\u202fNW\u202fz happens if supy(z) \u2264 infy(x).\n\nHence the only possible relations of x to z are W, SW, or NW.", "elapsed-time": 40.13965106010437, "reasoning-tokens": 6016, "completion-tokens": 6231}
