{"prompt": "Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions one can show that the only way to chain \u201cx NW y\u201d and \u201cy W z\u201d is to place x strictly to the left of z, and either above z or \u201cvertically contained\u201d with respect to z.  In the formal definitions:\n\n\u2022  x NW y  \u21d2  supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)   and   supy(y) \u2264 infy(x),  \n\u2022  y W  z  \u21d2  supx(y) \u2264 infx(z),  infy(z) \u2264 infy(y),  supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).\n\nChaining the x\u202fNW\u202fy and y\u202fW\u202fz inequalities shows in particular  \nsupx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z),  \nso x is necessarily to the left of z (since supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)).  \n\nDepending on how the \u201ctops\u201d and \u201cbottoms\u201d of x and z compare (which is not fixed by the above constraints alone), x can either fit the definition of W of z or NW of z:\n\n\u2022  x W z  is possible if supx(x) \u2264 infx(z) (already ensured) and vertically x is \u201ccontained\u201d in z,  \n\u2022  x NW z is possible if supx(x) \u2264 infx(z) (again ensured) and z lies fully below x (i.e., supy(z) \u2264 infy(x)).  \n\nNo other cardinal\u2011direction definitions (N, S, E, etc.) can be satisfied once x is known to lie strictly to the left of z.  Hence the only possible relations between x and z under these hypotheses are\n\n   NW   or   W.", "elapsed-time": 49.354767084121704, "reasoning-tokens": 6976, "completion-tokens": 7375}
