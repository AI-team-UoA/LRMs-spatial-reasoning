{"prompt": "Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions,\n\n\u2022 x SW y \u21d4 supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y),  \n\u2022 y SW z \u21d4 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nChaining these inequalities gives  \n1) supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z),  \n2) supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nHence supx(x) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(z), exactly the conditions for  \nx SW z.  \n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction relation can be made to hold under these constraints (for example, to have x S z one would need infx(z) \u2264 infx(x), which is incompatible with supx(x) \u2264 infx(z), etc.).  \n\nTherefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.", "elapsed-time": 42.291096210479736, "reasoning-tokens": 6208, "completion-tokens": 6452}
