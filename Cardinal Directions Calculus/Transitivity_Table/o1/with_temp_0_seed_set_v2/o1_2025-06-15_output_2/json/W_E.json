{"prompt": "Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, \u201cx W y\u201d means\n\n\u2022 sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y),  \n\u2022 inf\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x),  \n\u2022 sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y).\n\nAnd \u201cy E z\u201d means\n\n\u2022 sup\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y),  \n\u2022 inf\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y),  \n\u2022 sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z).\n\nCombining these in the y-dimension gives\n\ninf\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z),\n\nso in the vertical (y) direction, all of x\u2019s bounds are \u201cinside\u201d y\u2019s, which in turn are \u201cinside\u201d z\u2019s.  In the x-dimension, however, we only know\n\nsup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y)  and  sup\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y),\n\nwhich does not tell us whether x is to the left or right of z, nor whether one bounding box contains the other in the x-direction.  One checks each cardinal relation a\u2013z to see which are compatible with these inequalities; one finds exactly three are possible:\n\n\u2022 x B z  (x\u2019s bounding box is contained in z\u2019s),  \n\u2022 x W z  (x is strictly west of z),  \n\u2022 x E z  (x is strictly east of z).\n\nNo other cardinal direction conditions can simultaneously satisfy those x- and y-inequalities.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are B, W, or E.", "elapsed-time": 30.511707544326782, "reasoning-tokens": 4416, "completion-tokens": 4865}
