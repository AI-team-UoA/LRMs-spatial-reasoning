{"prompt": "Let B and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, x B y means  \n  infx(y) \u2264 infx(x),  \n  supx(x) \u2264 supx(y),  \n  infy(y) \u2264 infy(x),  \n  supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).  \n\nIn other words, the bounding box of x is contained in the bounding box of y.  \n\nAlso, y SW z means  \n  supx(y) \u2264 infx(z),  \n  supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nFrom x B y we have supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) and supy(x) \u2264 supy(y). Combining these with y SW z gives:  \n  supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) \u21d2 supx(x) \u2264 infx(z),  \n  supy(x) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z) \u21d2 supy(x) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nThese two inequalities (supx(x) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(z)) are precisely the conditions for x SW z. No other cardinal relation can hold (for instance, x cannot be \u201cW\u201d or \u201cS\u201d of z, because that would require partial overlap in one dimension rather than being strictly below and to the left).  \n\nTherefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.", "elapsed-time": 20.171295166015625, "reasoning-tokens": 2752, "completion-tokens": 3075}
