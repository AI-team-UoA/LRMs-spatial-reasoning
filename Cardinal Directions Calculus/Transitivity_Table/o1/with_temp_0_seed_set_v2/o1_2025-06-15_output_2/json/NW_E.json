{"prompt": "Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions, we have two pieces of information:\n\n1) x NW y, which (by definition) means  \n   supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).  \n   In words, x is strictly to the left of y in the x\u2011direction and strictly above y in the y\u2011direction (since y\u2019s top is below x\u2019s bottom).\n\n2) y E z, which (by definition) means  \n   supx(z) \u2264 infx(y), infy(z) \u2264 infy(y), and supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).  \n   In words, y is strictly to the right of z in the x\u2011direction, and in the y\u2011direction y\u2019s bounding box fits within z\u2019s bounding box.\n\nWe want the possible relations of x to z.  One finds that demanding x be strictly south of z or southeast of z or southwest of z leads to contradictions when combined with the above two facts (because y, which is below x, is itself contained in z\u2019s vertical extent, thereby preventing x from lying entirely below z).  However, all of the following turn out to be consistent with the two given constraints:\n\n\u2022 N (x strictly north of z),  \n\u2022 NE (x strictly north\u2011east of z),  \n\u2022 E (x strictly east of z, vertically contained),  \n\u2022 W (x strictly west of z, vertically contained),  \n\u2022 NW (x strictly north\u2011west of z),  \n\u2022 B (x\u2019s bounding box contained in z, i.e. \u201cx B z\u201d).\n\nHence, the possible relations between x and z are precisely N, NE, E, W, NW, or B, and not S, SE, or SW.", "elapsed-time": 54.4749276638031, "reasoning-tokens": 7936, "completion-tokens": 8372}
