{"prompt": "Let W and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions,  \n\u2022 \u201cx W y\u201d means  \n  supx(x) \u2264 infx(y), infy(y) \u2264 infy(x), and supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).  \n\u2022 \u201cy SW z\u201d means  \n  supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nChain these inequalities:\n\n1) From x W y and y SW z along the x-dimension:  \n   supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z).  \n   In particular, supx(x) \u2264 infx(z).\n\n2) From x W y (vertical containment by y) and y SW z (y is strictly below z) along the y-dimension:  \n   supy(x) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n   In particular, supy(x) \u2264 infy(z).\n\nHence, for x and z, we get  \nsupx(x) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(z),  \nwhich exactly matches the definition of \u201cx SW z.\u201d  \n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction relation can hold once those two strict \u201c\u2264\u201d constraints (in x and y) are satisfied. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.", "elapsed-time": 24.95806336402893, "reasoning-tokens": 3200, "completion-tokens": 3516}
