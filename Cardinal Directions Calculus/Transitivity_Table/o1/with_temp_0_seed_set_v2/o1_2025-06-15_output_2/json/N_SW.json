{"prompt": "Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the two given constraints\n\n\u2022 x\u202fN\u202fy \u21d2 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x), infx(y) \u2264 infx(x), and supx(x) \u2264 supx(y),  \n\u2022 y\u202fSW\u202fz \u21d2 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z),\n\none can deduce that supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z).  In other words, x lies strictly to the left of z in terms of bounding boxes.  Vertically, however, there is no forced ordering between x and z:  x could lie below z, above z, or overlap z\u2019s vertical extent.  \n\nHence, the only directional relations that require x to be strictly left of z are W (strictly left, vertically aligned), NW (strictly left and above), and SW (strictly left and below).  Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:\n\nW, NW, or SW.", "elapsed-time": 25.805214405059814, "reasoning-tokens": 3520, "completion-tokens": 3776}
