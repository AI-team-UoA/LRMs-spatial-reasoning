{"prompt": "Let W and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, one sees that  \n\u2022 \u201cx W y\u201d means x is strictly to the left of y (supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)) and, in the vertical dimension, the bounding box of x is contained in that of y (infy(y) \u2264 infy(x) and supy(x) \u2264 supy(y)).  \n\u2022 \u201cy NW z\u201d means y is strictly to the left of z (supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)) and strictly above z (supy(z) \u2264 infy(y)).  \n\nChain these together in the x\u2010coordinate first:\n\n   supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)  and  supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)\n\nimplies\n\n   supx(x) \u2264 infx(z).\n\nHence x is strictly to the left of z.  \n\nNext look at the y\u2010coordinates:  \n\u2022 From x W y we have infy(y) \u2264 infy(x) \u2264 supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).  \n\u2022 From y NW z we have supy(z) \u2264 infy(y).  \n\nBecause infy(y) \u2264 infy(x), one obtains\n\n   supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 infy(x),\n\ni.e. z lies strictly below x (the top of z is at or below the bottom of x).  \n\nPutting both coordinates together:\n\n   \u2013 in x:  supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)   (x left of z),  \n   \u2013 in y:  supy(z) \u2264 infy(x)   (x above z).\n\nBy definition, that is exactly \u201cx NW z.\u201d  No other direction relation can hold under these constraints (all others require some overlap or containment in coordinates that is contradicted by the above inequalities).  \n\nTherefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.", "elapsed-time": 54.06549119949341, "reasoning-tokens": 7680, "completion-tokens": 8109}
