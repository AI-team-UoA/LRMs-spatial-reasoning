{"prompt": "Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "All nine of the listed relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) can occur.  To see why, note that  \n\u2022 \u201cx SW y\u201d forces x to lie strictly to the left and below y,  \n\u2022 \u201cy NE z\u201d forces z to lie strictly to the left and below y as well,  \n\nbut these two facts alone place no constraint on whether x is to the left/right/above/below/etc. of z.  By suitably positioning and sizing x and z (both still left\u2010below y), any of the nine cardinal relations between x and z can be realized.", "elapsed-time": 25.292262315750122, "reasoning-tokens": 3648, "completion-tokens": 3825}
