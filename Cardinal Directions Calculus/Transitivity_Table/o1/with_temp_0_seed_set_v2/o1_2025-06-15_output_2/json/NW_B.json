{"prompt": "Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions one can check systematically which of the nine relations  \n\u2500 N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B \u2500  \nare still possible between x and z under the assumptions\n\n\u2022 x NW y  (i.e. supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(x)),  \n\u2022 y B z   (i.e.  infx(z) \u2264 infx(y),  supx(y) \u2264 supx(z),  infy(z) \u2264 infy(y),  supy(y) \u2264 supy(z)).\n\nA brief sketch of why exactly N, W, NW, or B remain possible (and the others do not) goes as follows:\n\n1)  x B z.  \n   There is no contradiction in having z large enough to contain both y and x in its bounding box.  \n\n2)  x NW z.  \n   Since x is already \u201cto the left of and above\u201d y, and y is contained in z, it is perfectly possible for x also to lie strictly to the left of and above the bounding box of z (z could enclose y well to the \u201cbottom\u2010right,\u201d with x further \u201ctop\u2010left\u201d).  \n\n3)  x W z.  \n   Being strictly to the left of z (no horizontal overlap) but vertically inside z\u2019s bounding box also does not contradict x NW y and y B z: one may place x in the left\u2010hand portion of z\u2019s bounding box (so it is \u201cvertically inside\u201d z) yet still strictly left of y.  \n\n4)  x N z.  \n   Being strictly above z (no vertical overlap) while nevertheless \u201chorizontally inside\u201d z\u2019s bounding box is also compatible: x can be perched directly above z, and y can lie inside z, below x.  \n\nConversely, one finds that placing x strictly to the right (E, SE, NE) or strictly below (S, SE, SW) of z contradicts the geometry forced by x NW y and y B z.  \n\nHence the only possible relations between x and z are  \n     N, W, NW, or B.", "elapsed-time": 54.06647753715515, "reasoning-tokens": 7616, "completion-tokens": 8130}
