{"prompt": "Let SE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the defining inequalities it follows that \u201cx SE y\u201d means  \n(1) supx(y) \u2264 infx(x)   and   (2) supy(x) \u2264 infy(y),  \nso x lies strictly to the right of y\u2019s bounding box and strictly below y\u2019s bounding box.  \n\nAlso \u201cy B z\u201d means  \n(3) infx(z) \u2264 infx(y),   (4) supx(y) \u2264 supx(z),   (5) infy(z) \u2264 infy(y),   (6) supy(y) \u2264 supy(z),  \nso y\u2019s entire bounding box is contained in z\u2019s bounding box.\n\nThe question is then which relations \u201cx ? z\u201d can satisfy, subject to (1)\u2013(6).  One finds that x can either be:  \n\n\u2022 B of z (fully contained in z),  \n\u2022 S of z (strictly below z),  \n\u2022 E of z (strictly to the right of z), or  \n\u2022 SE of z (strictly below and to the right of z).  \n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction relation can be made consistent with (1)\u2013(6).  Consequently, the possible relations between x and z are  \nB, S, E, SE.", "elapsed-time": 48.331775188446045, "reasoning-tokens": 6912, "completion-tokens": 7231}
