{"prompt": "Let SE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "All nine relations are possible.  In other words, knowing that x is SE of y and y is NW of z imposes no direct bounding\u2010box constraint between x and z, so x and z can satisfy any of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.", "elapsed-time": 49.7664155960083, "reasoning-tokens": 7616, "completion-tokens": 7724}
