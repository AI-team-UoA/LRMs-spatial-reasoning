{"prompt": "Let SE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions,  \n\u2022 \u201cx SE y\u201d means  \n  (1) supx(y) \u2264 infx(x)   (\u201cy is left of x\u201d),  \n  (2) supy(x) \u2264 infy(y)   (\u201cx is below y\u201d),  \n\n\u2022 \u201cy SE z\u201d means  \n  (3) supx(z) \u2264 infx(y)   (\u201cz is left of y\u201d),  \n  (4) supy(y) \u2264 infy(z)   (\u201cy is below z\u201d).  \n\nChaining (1) and (3) in the x\u2011direction gives  \n  supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(x),  \nso in particular supx(z) \u2264 infx(x).  \nThis says that z lies entirely to the left of x.  \n\nChaining (2) and (4) in the y\u2011direction gives  \n  supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z),  \nso in particular supy(x) \u2264 infy(z).  \nThis says that x lies entirely below z.  \n\nHence, relative to z, region x is strictly to its right (no horizontal overlap) and strictly below (no vertical overlap).  By the definitions of the cardinal directions, the only one that requires  \n   supx(z) \u2264 infx(x)  and  supy(x) \u2264 infy(z)  \nis precisely \u201cx SE z.\u201d  \n\nTherefore, if x is SE of y and y is SE of z, then x must also be SE of z.
