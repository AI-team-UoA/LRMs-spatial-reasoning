{"prompt": "Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the given definitions, one can check the implied bounding\u2010box constraints and see that they force x to lie strictly to the left (west) of z and also strictly above (north of) z.  Concretely:\n\n\u2022 \u201cx N y\u201d gives supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).  \n\u2022 \u201cy NW z\u201d gives supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(z) \u2264 infy(y).\n\nBecause x is north of y and y is northwest of z, chaining these inequalities forces  \n1) supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z),  \n2) supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).\n\nHence x is entirely to the left of z (from 1) and entirely above z (from 2).  By the definitions, that is exactly the \u201cNW\u201d relation.  No other cardinal\u2010direction relation is compatible with both sets of inequalities.  Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.", "elapsed-time": 43.3114755153656, "reasoning-tokens": 6592, "completion-tokens": 6851}
