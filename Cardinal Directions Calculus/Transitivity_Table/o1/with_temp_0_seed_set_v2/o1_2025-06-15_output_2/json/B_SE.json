{"prompt": "Let B and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the defining inequalities it follows that x must lie strictly to the right of z (since y is to the right of z and x is contained in y\u2019s bounding box) and strictly below z (since y is below z and x is contained in y\u2019s bounding box).  In symbols:\n\n\u2022  y SE z means  \n   supx(z) \u2264 infx(y)   and   supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).\n\n\u2022  x B y means  \n   infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) \u2264 supx(x) \u2264 supx(y)   and  \n   infy(y) \u2264 infy(x) \u2264 supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).\n\nPutting these together shows  \n   supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 infx(x),  \n   and  \n   supy(x) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z),  \nwhich is precisely the condition that x is southeast of z.  \n\nHence, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.", "elapsed-time": 28.833744049072266, "reasoning-tokens": 4032, "completion-tokens": 4280}
