PROMPT: Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x W y” means

• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
• supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).

And “y E z” means

• supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
• supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Combining these in the y-dimension gives

infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z),

so in the vertical (y) direction, all of x’s bounds are “inside” y’s, which in turn are “inside” z’s.  In the x-dimension, however, we only know

supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)  and  supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),

which does not tell us whether x is to the left or right of z, nor whether one bounding box contains the other in the x-direction.  One checks each cardinal relation a–z to see which are compatible with these inequalities; one finds exactly three are possible:

• x B z  (x’s bounding box is contained in z’s),  
• x W z  (x is strictly west of z),  
• x E z  (x is strictly east of z).

No other cardinal direction conditions can simultaneously satisfy those x- and y-inequalities.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are B, W, or E.
