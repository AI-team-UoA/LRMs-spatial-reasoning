PROMPT: Let NE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one sees that “x NE y” forces x to lie strictly to the right and strictly above y, while “y W z” forces y to lie strictly to the left of z (in x) but be vertically contained by z (in y).  Because x is already above y, and y is contained in z’s vertical extent, it is impossible for x to lie strictly below z (that would force x still lower than y, contradicting x NE y).  Consequently, the only viable relations of x to z turn out to be

• N  (x strictly above z, horizontally contained by z),  
• NE (x strictly above and to the right of z),  
• E  (x strictly to the right of z, vertically contained by z),  
• NW (x strictly above and to the left of z),  
• W  (x strictly to the left of z, vertically contained by z),  
• B  (z’s bounding box completely contains x’s bounding box).

All “southerly” relations (S, SE, SW) are ruled out by the fact that x is above y and y is vertically contained in z. Thus, the possible relations between x and z are exactly N, NE, E, NW, W, or B.
