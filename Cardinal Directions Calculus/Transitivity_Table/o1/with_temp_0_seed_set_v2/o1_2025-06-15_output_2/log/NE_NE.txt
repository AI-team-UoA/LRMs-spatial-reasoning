PROMPT: Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x is NE of y” and “y is NE of z” respectively mean:

1) x NE y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
2) y NE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Combine these inequalities along each axis.  
• Along x:  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  which implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
• Along y:  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  which implies supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

But “x NE z” is exactly characterized by supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Hence x must also be NE of z.  

Answer: NE.
