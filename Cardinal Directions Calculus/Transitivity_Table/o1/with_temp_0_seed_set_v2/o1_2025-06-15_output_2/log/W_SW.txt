PROMPT: Let W and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions,  
• “x W y” means  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• “y SW z” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Chain these inequalities:

1) From x W y and y SW z along the x-dimension:  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
   In particular, supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

2) From x W y (vertical containment by y) and y SW z (y is strictly below z) along the y-dimension:  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
   In particular, supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hence, for x and z, we get  
supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
which exactly matches the definition of “x SW z.”  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold once those two strict “≤” constraints (in x and y) are satisfied. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
