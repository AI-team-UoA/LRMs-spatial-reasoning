PROMPT: Let E and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

x being E of y tells us that, vertically, x’s bounding‐box is contained in y’s bounding‐box (that is, infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)), and x lies strictly to the right of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)).  
Similarly, y being W of z implies that y’s bounding‐box is contained in z’s bounding‐box vertically (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)), and y is strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).  

Putting those together, the vertical containments chain up so that x’s bounding‐box is contained within z’s bounding‐box vertically.  In particular,  
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence x and z cannot lie strictly north, south, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest of each other, because all of those relations require some vertical separation that does not exist here.  The only remaining possibilities are:

• x W z, if x also lies strictly to the left of z (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  
• x E z, if x lies strictly to the right of z (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  
• x B z, if x’s bounding‐box is completely contained by z’s bounding‐box in both x and y directions.

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W, E, or B.
