PROMPT: Let NE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x NE y” only tells us  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
while “y SW z” only tells us  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

None of these inequalities link x’s bounding box directly to z’s, so there is no induced constraint forcing x to lie in any particular one of the nine relations with respect to z. Hence any of the nine relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) can occur between x and z.
