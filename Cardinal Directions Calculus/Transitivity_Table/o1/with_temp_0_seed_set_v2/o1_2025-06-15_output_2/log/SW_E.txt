PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees immediately that placing x “above” z is impossible, because x is already forced below y (via x SW y) while y is contained in z vertically (via y E z).  In particular, x N z, x NE z, or x NW z would require x to lie above z in the bounding‐box sense, which cannot be made consistent with x lying below y and y lying inside z.  

On the other hand, letting x be strictly to one side or below z, or letting z’s bounding box be large enough to contain x, does not contradict any of the given conditions.  Consequently, the directions x S z, x SW z, x W z, x E z, x SE z, and x B z can all be realized by appropriate placements satisfying x SW y and y E z.  

Hence the possible relations between x and z are exactly  
B, S, SW, W, E, and SE.
