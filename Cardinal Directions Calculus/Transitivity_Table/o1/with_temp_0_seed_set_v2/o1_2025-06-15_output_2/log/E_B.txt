PROMPT: Let E and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, the key pieces are:

•  x E y means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

•  y B z means  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
   supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chain these inequalities in both x and y directions:

1) In the x-direction:  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
   and from x E y we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   Hence,  
      infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   However, we do not know how infx(x) compares to supx(z).  It can be either infx(x) ≤ supx(z) (meaning x fits horizontally within z) or infx(x) > supx(z) (meaning x lies strictly to the right of z).

2) In the y-direction:  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   So vertically, x is contained within z’s bounding box (since infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

Because x’s vertical extent is contained within z, and because horizontally x may or may not lie entirely within z, exactly two of the cardinal‐direction definitions remain possible:

•  x B z can happen if x also lies within z horizontally, i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  
•  x E z can happen if x is strictly to the right of z, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

No other pure cardinal direction is compatible with the above chains.  Thus, the only possible relations of x to z under x E y and y B z are  
B or E.
