PROMPT: Let B and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
• x B y means x’s bounding box is contained within y’s bounding box. In symbols:  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• y W z means y lies wholly to the west of z (their bounding boxes do not overlap horizontally, but are contained vertically). In symbols:  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Given x B y and y W z, we combine these constraints. First note:  
1) x B y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
2) y W z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
   Together, these imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

For the y-coordinates,  
1) y W z ⇒ infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
2) x B y ⇒ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
   Combining gives infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

All of these together precisely match the definition of x W z (i.e., x is wholly to the west of z, with vertical containment):  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

No other direction can be satisfied without contradicting the bounding‐box containments or the strict horizontal separation. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z, given x B y and y W z, is  
   x W z.
