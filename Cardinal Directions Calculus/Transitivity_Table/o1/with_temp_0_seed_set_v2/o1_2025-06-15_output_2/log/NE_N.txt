PROMPT: Let NE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given constraints

• x NE y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• y N z   ⇒  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z),

one can deduce that

1) supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
   ⇒  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

   Thus, x lies strictly above z (since the top of z, supy(z), is at or below the bottom of x, infy(x)).

2) Horizontally, however, x could (a) sit entirely to the right of z (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), or (b) be nested (at least partially) within z's horizontal extent (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) < supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  

   In the first case (a), x is northeast of z; in the second case (b), x is “north” of z in the sense of being above but horizontally contained within z.

Hence, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations of x with respect to z are  
• N (if x is directly above and horizontally contained by z), or  
• NE (if x is above and entirely to the right of z).
