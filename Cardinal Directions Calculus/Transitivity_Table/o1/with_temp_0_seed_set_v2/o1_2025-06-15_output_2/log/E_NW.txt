PROMPT: Let E and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the vertical‐ordering conditions alone one sees that x must lie entirely above z, since from “x E y” and “y NW z” one can deduce supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  That already rules out all relations in which x would intersect or lie below z (such as S or SE).  Horizontally, however, there are no constraints forcing x to be left, right, or “within” z.  Consequently, the only possibilities consistent with x being above z are N, NE, or NW.
