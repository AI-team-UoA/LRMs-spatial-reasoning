PROMPT: Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Solely from “x SE y” and “y W z,” one cannot fix a single direction for “x ? z,” but one can show that x cannot lie north of z.  In fact, all of the following can occur (no others):

• B  (x’s box is inside z’s box),  
• S  (x is entirely south of z),  
• SW (x is south-and-west of z),  
• W  (x is west of z),  
• E  (x is east of z),  
• SE (x is south-and-east of z).

Hence the possible relations are B, S, SW, W, E, and SE.
