PROMPT: Let SE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities it follows that “x SE y” means  
(1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   (2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
so x lies strictly to the right of y’s bounding box and strictly below y’s bounding box.  

Also “y B z” means  
(3) infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   (4) supx(y) ≤ supx(z),   (5) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   (6) supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
so y’s entire bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box.

The question is then which relations “x ? z” can satisfy, subject to (1)–(6).  One finds that x can either be:  

• B of z (fully contained in z),  
• S of z (strictly below z),  
• E of z (strictly to the right of z), or  
• SE of z (strictly below and to the right of z).  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can be made consistent with (1)–(6).  Consequently, the possible relations between x and z are  
B, S, E, SE.
