PROMPT: Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given constraints

• x N y ⇒ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
• y SW z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),

one can deduce that supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  In other words, x lies strictly to the left of z in terms of bounding boxes.  Vertically, however, there is no forced ordering between x and z:  x could lie below z, above z, or overlap z’s vertical extent.  

Hence, the only directional relations that require x to be strictly left of z are W (strictly left, vertically aligned), NW (strictly left and above), and SW (strictly left and below).  Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:

W, NW, or SW.
