PROMPT: Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If x is B of y and y is B of z, then by definition we have

• infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combining these in the x-direction gives  
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
so infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

Similarly, in the y-direction we obtain  
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence x’s bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box, which means x is B of z. No other strict cardinal‐direction relationship (like N, S, E, W, etc.) is consistent with both x being inside y’s bounding box and y being inside z’s bounding box. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z, under those assumptions, is B.
