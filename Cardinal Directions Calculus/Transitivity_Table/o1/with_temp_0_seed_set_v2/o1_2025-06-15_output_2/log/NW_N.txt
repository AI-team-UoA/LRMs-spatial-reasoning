PROMPT: Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one sees first that “x is NW of y” (x NW y) implies, in particular,

  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Likewise “y is N of z” (y N z) implies

  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   and   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Chaining these in the y‐direction,

  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x),

shows that z lies strictly below x (its top is no higher than x’s bottom).  Consequently, x cannot be S, SE, SW, or W of z (all of which would require x to be level with or below z in y‐coordinates).  Nor can x “bound” z (x B z) or vice versa because that would require their bounding boxes to overlap or contain one another vertically, which is ruled out by supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Hence the only remaining “above” possibilities in the standard definitions are N, NE, and NW:

• x N z requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (already true) and that z’s bounding box in x fully covers x’s in x.  Since z can be arbitrarily wide, this can happen.

• x NE z requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning z is below and to the left, and x is above and to the right.  Nothing so far forbids z being far enough left that supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

• x NW z requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is above and to the left, z is below and to the right.  Again, not ruled out by the given constraints.

Thus, if x is NW of y and y is N of z, then x can only be N, NW, or NE of z.
