PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions:

•  x SW y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
•  y SE z  ⇒  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Chain these inequalities vertically to compare x and z.  

1.  From x SW y we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
2.  From y SE z we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  In particular,  
supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

That tells us x must lie entirely below (or just touch) z.  Once x is known to lie below z, the only cardinal‐direction relations consistent with “x is below z” in the above definitions are S, SW, and SE (depending on whether x is horizontally within z, to its left, or to its right).  

Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are:  
S, SW, or SE.
