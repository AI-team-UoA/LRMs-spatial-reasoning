PROMPT: Let SW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two hypotheses

• x SW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y W z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

one deduces

1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   so x must lie wholly to the left of z,  
2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  

Meanwhile, y's box is vertically contained in z's box, i.e. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  Because x lies below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) but y is contained in z, x may still lie either below z altogether (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) or be vertically contained in z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  

Hence the only ways x can relate to z (under the given definitions) are:

• x SW z, if x is both to the left and strictly below z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)),  
• x W z, if x is to the left of z but vertically contained in z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

No other cardinal‐direction definitions can be satisfied given these conditions. Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are SW or W.
