PROMPT: Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, we have two pieces of information:

1) x NW y, which (by definition) means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   In words, x is strictly to the left of y in the x‑direction and strictly above y in the y‑direction (since y’s top is below x’s bottom).

2) y E z, which (by definition) means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   In words, y is strictly to the right of z in the x‑direction, and in the y‑direction y’s bounding box fits within z’s bounding box.

We want the possible relations of x to z.  One finds that demanding x be strictly south of z or southeast of z or southwest of z leads to contradictions when combined with the above two facts (because y, which is below x, is itself contained in z’s vertical extent, thereby preventing x from lying entirely below z).  However, all of the following turn out to be consistent with the two given constraints:

• N (x strictly north of z),  
• NE (x strictly north‑east of z),  
• E (x strictly east of z, vertically contained),  
• W (x strictly west of z, vertically contained),  
• NW (x strictly north‑west of z),  
• B (x’s bounding box contained in z, i.e. “x B z”).

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are precisely N, NE, E, W, NW, or B, and not S, SE, or SW.
