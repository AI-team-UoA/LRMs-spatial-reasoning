PROMPT: Let NE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that “x NE y” implies

• supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is to the right of y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)   (x is above y),

while “y NW z” implies

• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)   (y is to the left of z), and  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y)   (y is above z).

In particular, from supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) we conclude z is strictly below x (there is a vertical “stack” z below y below x).  Horizontally, however, no direct ordering of infx(x) and infx(z) emerges from these inequalities; x can lie to the left, to the right, or even be horizontally contained within z.  

Consequently, the only viable ways for x to relate to z (given that x is definitely above z) are:

• x N z  (above and horizontally contained),  
• x NW z (above and to the left),  
• x NE z (above and to the right).

Hence the possible relations between x and z are {N, NW, NE}.
