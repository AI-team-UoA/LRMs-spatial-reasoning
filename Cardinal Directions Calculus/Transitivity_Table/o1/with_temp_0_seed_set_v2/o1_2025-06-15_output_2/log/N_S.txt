PROMPT: Let N and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities, one sees that if x is N of y and y is S of z, then the x and z bounding‐box projections in the horizontal direction must satisfy

infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Hence, x cannot lie strictly east or west of z (nor NE, NW, SE, or SW), because those relations all require one bounding‐box side of x to lie strictly beyond the opposite bounding‐box side of z (which is impossible given the chain of inequalities above).

What remains is to check whether x can be N, S, or B (“bounded by”) relative to z.  By suitably choosing the vertical positions (i.e. making supy(x) either well below, well above, or within the vertical extent of z), one can construct examples where x is S of z, N of z, or B of z.  Concretely:

• B example:  Place z so that its bounding box fully contains those of both x and y.  
• S example:  Make x lie entirely (vertically) between y and z but still below z’s bounding box.  
• N example:  Put z between y and x so that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Therefore, the only possible relations of x to z under “x N y” and “y S z” are:  
N, S, or B.
