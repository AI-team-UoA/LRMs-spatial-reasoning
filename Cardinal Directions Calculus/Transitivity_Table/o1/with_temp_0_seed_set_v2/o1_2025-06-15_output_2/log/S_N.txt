PROMPT: Let S and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one sees that “x S y” and “y N z” together force x’s bounding‐box to lie horizontally inside z’s (because x lies inside y and y lies inside z horizontally), but place no direct vertical ordering between x and z.  In symbols:

•  x S y ⇒  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(y)   and   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

•  y N z ⇒  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y)   and   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Putting these together forces  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),

so horizontally x is “inside” z.  Vertically, however, we only know both x and z lie below y (so supy(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(y)), but not how x and z compare to each other.  One can place x either entirely below z, entirely above z, or even entirely inside z’s bounding box.  Checking each cardinal‐direction definition shows:

•  x S z (x south of z) is possible if we arrange supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
•  x N z (x north of z) is possible if we arrange supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
•  x B z (x’s box is inside z’s box) is possible if we make both x’s horizontal and vertical extents lie within those of z.

All other directions (E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) require horizontal bounds that contradict infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

Therefore, the only possible relations between x and z under “x S y” and “y N z” are  
N, S, or B.
