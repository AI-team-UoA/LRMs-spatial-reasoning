PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x S y” means x is strictly below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and horizontally within y (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).  Also, “y B z” means y’s bounding box is contained within z’s bounding box (infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

Chaining these facts tells us that horizontally, x is inside z’s bounding box (because x is inside y and y is inside z).  Vertically, however, x could do either of the following with respect to z:

• Lie completely inside z’s bounding box (i.e., infy(x) ≥ infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), in which case x B z.  
• Lie entirely below z (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), in which case x S z.

No other of the nine relations can occur under these constraints.  Consequently, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z are  
S or B.
