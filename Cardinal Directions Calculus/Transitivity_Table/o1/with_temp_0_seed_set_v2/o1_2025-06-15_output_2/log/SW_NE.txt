PROMPT: Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

All nine of the listed relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) can occur.  To see why, note that  
• “x SW y” forces x to lie strictly to the left and below y,  
• “y NE z” forces z to lie strictly to the left and below y as well,  

but these two facts alone place no constraint on whether x is to the left/right/above/below/etc. of z.  By suitably positioning and sizing x and z (both still left‐below y), any of the nine cardinal relations between x and z can be realized.
