PROMPT: Let SE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key facts are:

•	x SE y means  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
  (x is strictly to the right of y and strictly below y.)

•	y NE z means  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
  (y is strictly to the right of z and strictly above z.)

From the first condition (x SE y) and the second (y NE z), one deduces that

•	xmin(x) > xmax(y) > xmax(z),  

so x is strictly to the right of z (no overlap in x).  That immediately rules out W, SW, NW, N, S, and B as possibilities for x relative to z, because those would all require x not to be strictly to the right (for instance, W or NW would require x to be to the left, and B or S require x to be horizontally contained).  

At the same time, there are no constraints that force x to sit above, below, or be contained in z’s vertical extent, since “y above z” does not pin down where x lies relative to z’s vertical range (only that x is below y).  Consequently, x can be:

•  E of z, if (among other things) infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)  
   (i.e., x sits entirely in the vertical span of z),
•  NE of z, if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)  
   (x sits above z), or  
•  SE of z, if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
   (x sits below z).

Hence the only possible cardinal‐direction relations of x to z are E, NE, or SE.
