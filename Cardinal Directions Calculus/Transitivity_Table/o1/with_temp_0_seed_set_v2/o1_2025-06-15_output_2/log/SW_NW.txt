PROMPT: Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one can check that “x SW y” forces x to lie strictly to the left and below y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), while “y NW z” forces y to lie strictly to the left and above z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Piecing these together yields that x is strictly to the left of z (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) but imposes no definitive ordering of x and z in the vertical dimension (both lie below y, but we do not know which is higher).  Consequently, the only ways x can relate to z among the nine given relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are precisely

• x SW z,  
• x W z, or  
• x NW z.
