PROMPT: Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, we know the following about x and y, and y and z:

1) x E y means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x),   
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

   In particular, supx(y) ≤ infx(x) tells us that x is strictly to the right of y in the x-dimension, and the other two inequalities say that x’s bounding box in the y-dimension is contained in y’s bounding box.

2) y S z means  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and  
   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

   In particular, supy(y) ≤ infy(z) tells us that y is strictly below z in the y-dimension, and the x-range of y is contained in that of z.

Y-DIMENSION ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since y is strictly below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)) and x’s y-bounding box is contained in y’s (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)), it follows

   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Hence x is also strictly below z, so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X-DIMENSION ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We also have:

   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)    (because y’s box is contained in z’s),  
   and  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)                        (because x is to the right of y).

Thus the region x can end up in two essentially different “horizontal” positions relative to z:

• x can still lie completely within z’s x-bounding box, i.e.  
  infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  
  In this case, together with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is S of z.

• Or x can be to the right of z in the x-dimension, i.e.  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
  Then, along with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is SE of z.

What cannot happen is that x is, for example, B of z (that would require x’s entire bounding box to lie inside z’s in both x and y, but we already have supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x’s box is entirely below z’s box in the y-dimension and thus cannot be “inside”). Nor can x be E of z, because that would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicting supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore, if x is E of y and y is S of z, then x can only be S or SE of z.
