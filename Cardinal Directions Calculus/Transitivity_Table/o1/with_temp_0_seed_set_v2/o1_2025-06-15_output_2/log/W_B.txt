PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x W y” means

1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y),

and “y B z” means

4) infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
5) infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From 2) and 5) it follows that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and from 3) and 5) it follows that supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  Hence, in the y-dimension, x is fully “inside” z’s bounding box.  

However, along the x-dimension we only know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y).  Whether x ends up strictly to the left of z (which would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) or entirely inside z (which would require infx(x) ≥ infx(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) cannot be pinned down from the given information alone.  

Consequently, the only two cardinal‐direction relations between x and z consistent with “x W y” and “y B z” are  
• x W z (if x’s bounding box lies strictly to the left of z’s), or  
• x B z (if x’s bounding box is contained within z’s).
