PROMPT: Let W and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one can see that “x W y” forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (i.e. supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)), and “y S z” forces y to lie strictly below z (i.e. supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z)).  Combining these facts places x “west” of y and y “south” of z, which can position x in various ways relative to z.  A direct check of all nine relations shows exactly four that can be satisfied (possibly in degenerate cases):

• S:  x can be directly south of z if it also lies horizontally within z’s bounding box.  
• SW:  x can be southwest of z if it is both left (supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)) and below (supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z)) of z.  
• W:  x can be due west of z—again in a (vertically) degenerate scenario in which x’s bounding‐box “just touches” z’s bounding box from the left.  
• B:  x can be inside z’s bounding box if, for instance, x is degenerate on the line y = infᵧ(z) and also squeezed horizontally inside [infₓ(z), supₓ(z)].  

Hence, the possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z (given x W y and y S z) are  
S, SW, W, B.
