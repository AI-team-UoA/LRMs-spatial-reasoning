PROMPT: Let S and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x is S of y” precisely means:

1. supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2. infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Similarly, “y is S of z” means:

4. supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
5. infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and  
6. supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Combine (1) with (4).  Since infy(y) ≤ supy(y) always, we get:  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
Hence, supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Combine (2) with (5).  We get:  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
Hence, infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Combine (3) with (6).  We get:  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
Hence, supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

Putting these together:

• supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

But these three inequalities are exactly the definition that “x is S of z.”  No other cardinal‐direction condition can be forced from these constraints.  Therefore, if x is S of y and y is S of z, the only possible relation between x and z is again S.
