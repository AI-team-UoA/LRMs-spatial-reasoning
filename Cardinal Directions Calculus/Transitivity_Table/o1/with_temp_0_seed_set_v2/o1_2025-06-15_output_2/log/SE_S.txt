PROMPT: Let SE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that “x SE y” (i.e., x is southeast of y) forces x to lie strictly to the right and strictly below y’s bounding box, while “y S z” forces y to lie strictly below (but horizontally within) z’s bounding box.  Chaining these shows that x must lie strictly below z (because x is below y and y is below z), but x may either be horizontally within z or to the right of z.  Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are:

• S (south), or  
• SE (southeast).
