PROMPT: Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one sees that “x W y” and “y W z” together imply  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so chaining gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
which in turn imply infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

Putting these together matches exactly the definition of “x W z,” namely:  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
• supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold under those same constraints (e.g., one cannot get “NW,” “SW,” “B,” etc. without contradicting the above inequalities).  

Therefore, if x is W of y and y is W of z, the only possible relation of x to z is also W.
