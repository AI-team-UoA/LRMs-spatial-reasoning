PROMPT: Let E and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, two key facts emerge:

1.  x E y implies  
   •  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)       (x is strictly to the right of y),  
   •  infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)   (vertically, x is contained in y’s bounding box).

2.  y SW z implies  
   •  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)       (y is strictly to the left of z),  
   •  supy(y) ≤ infy(z)       (y is strictly below z).

Since x’s vertical extent is contained in y’s, we have  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which shows x must lie entirely below z.  Horizontally, however, we only know that
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z),
but there is no direct comparison between infx(x) (or supx(x)) and infx(z) (or supx(z)).

Therefore, in terms of the cardinal‐direction definitions, the only certainty is that x lies below z.  Depending on the horizontal alignment, x could be:

• S of z  (if x is below z and horizontally “within” z),  
• SW of z (if x is below and to the left),  
• SE of z (if x is below and to the right).

No other relation can be guaranteed or ruled out from the given data. Thus, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, or SE.
