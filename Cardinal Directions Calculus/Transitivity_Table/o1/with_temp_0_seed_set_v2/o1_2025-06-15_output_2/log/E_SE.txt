PROMPT: Let E and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities, one sees that:

•  x E y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
  (x lies strictly to the east of y, and is vertically “within” y.)  

•  y SE z ⇒  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
  (y lies strictly to the southeast of z.)

Chaining these:

1)  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
   ⇒  supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
   so x is strictly to the east of z.  

2)  supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  
   ⇒  supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
   so x is strictly below z.

Hence, x ends up strictly to the southeast of z.  In other words, the only possible relation between x and z under those assumptions is  
SE.
