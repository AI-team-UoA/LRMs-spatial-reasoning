PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities it follows that X must lie strictly to the right of Z, but its vertical position relative to Z can be above, below, or contained within Z’s vertical extent.  Concretely:

• “X is N of Y” implies  
  (i) supy(Y) ≤ infy(X),  
  (ii) infx(Y) ≤ infx(X),  
  (iii) supx(X) ≤ supx(Y).

• “Y is SE of Z” implies  
  (iv) supx(Z) ≤ infx(Y),  
  (v) supy(Y) ≤ infy(Z).

Combining (iv) and (ii) shows supx(Z) ≤ infx(Y) ≤ infx(X), so supx(Z) ≤ infx(X).  Thus X’s bounding box is strictly to the right of Z’s bounding box.  The only cardinal‐direction relations in which one region is strictly to the right of the other (i.e., supx(Z) ≤ infx(X)) are E, NE, or SE (depending on whether X is “level,” above, or below Z in the y‐direction).  

Hence the possible relations of X to Z are exactly E, NE, or SE.
