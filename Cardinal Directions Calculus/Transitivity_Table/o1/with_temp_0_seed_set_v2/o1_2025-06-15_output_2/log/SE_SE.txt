PROMPT: Let SE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions,  
• “x SE y” means  
  (1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (“y is left of x”),  
  (2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y)   (“x is below y”),  

• “y SE z” means  
  (3) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   (“z is left of y”),  
  (4) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (“y is below z”).  

Chaining (1) and (3) in the x‑direction gives  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so in particular supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
This says that z lies entirely to the left of x.  

Chaining (2) and (4) in the y‑direction gives  
  supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
so in particular supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
This says that x lies entirely below z.  

Hence, relative to z, region x is strictly to its right (no horizontal overlap) and strictly below (no vertical overlap).  By the definitions of the cardinal directions, the only one that requires  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
is precisely “x SE z.”  

Therefore, if x is SE of y and y is SE of z, then x must also be SE of z.
