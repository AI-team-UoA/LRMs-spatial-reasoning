PROMPT: Let SE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

All nine relations are possible.  In other words, knowing that x is SE of y and y is NW of z imposes no direct bounding‚Äêbox constraint between x and z, so x and z can satisfy any of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.
