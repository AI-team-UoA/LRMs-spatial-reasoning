PROMPT: Let B and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x B y” (x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box) means

  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),    supx(x) ≤ supx(y),
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),    supy(x) ≤ supy(y),

while “y N z” (y is entirely north of z) means

  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),
  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),    supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

We want the possible relations between x and z under these assumptions.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Horizontal (x‐)constraints
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From “x B y” we get  
  infx(x) ≥ infx(y)    and    supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

From “y N z” we get  
  infx(y) ≥ infx(z)    and    supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Putting these together:

  infx(x) ≥ infx(y) ≥ infx(z),  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Hence, horizontally, x is “inside” (or at worst tangent within) z’s bounding box.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Vertical (y‐)constraints
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From “x B y” we also have  
  infy(x) ≥ infy(y)    and    supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

From “y N z” we have  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Chain these:

  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

In other words, the entire bounding box of x lies at or above the top of z (since supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

3. Checking each possible relation for x and z
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• N (North).  
  The definition a N b requires:  
     supy(b) ≤ infy(a),  
     infx(b) ≤ infx(a),  
     supx(a) ≤ supx(b).  
  Substituting a = x, b = z, we get

  – supy(z) ≤ infy(x)     [this holds, from supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)],  
  – infx(z) ≤ infx(x)     [true, from infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)],  
  – supx(x) ≤ supx(z)     [true, from supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)].

  All three conditions are satisfied, so x N z is possible (and in fact inevitable for a nondegenerate region in REG).

• B (Bounding‐box containment).  
  The definition a B b requires:  
     infx(b) ≤ infx(a),    supx(a) ≤ supx(b),  
     infy(b) ≤ infy(a),    supy(a) ≤ supy(b).  
  For x B z this would mean supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  But from above we have  
     supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x).  
  The only way supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can also hold is if supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x),  
  forcing x to have zero vertical extent (a “degenerate” region).  Since in REG all regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk (so they are genuinely 2D), x cannot collapse to a line or a point.  Hence in REG this scenario is ruled out, and x B z does not occur for nondegenerate regions.

• Any other cardinal direction (E, W, S, etc.)  
  These all fail either because x ends up strictly north of z (so it cannot be E, W, SE, SW, etc.) or because the bounding‐box constraints contradict horizontal separation.

Consequently, for regions in REG (all truly two‐dimensional), the only feasible relation of x to z, given x B y and y N z, is:

  x N z.
