PROMPT: Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
• x NE y means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Combining these implies in particular that  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so region z lies strictly to the left of region x.  

However, the given constraints do not fix whether x is above, below, or vertically contained with respect to z.  Recalling the definitions of E, NE, SE (all of which require supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), one sees that all three remain possible:

• x E z requires x to be strictly to the right of z and vertically contain z’s y-extent (or be contained by it).  
• x NE z requires x to be strictly to the right of z and strictly above it.  
• x SE z requires x to be strictly to the right of z and strictly below it.  

No other cardinal directions (N, S, W, NW, SW, or B) can hold under supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence, if x is NE of y and y is SE of z, then x could be E, NE, or SE of z.
