PROMPT: Let SE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that x SE y implies

  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),

so x is strictly to the east and south of y (in bounding‐box terms).  
Similarly, y SW z implies

  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(z),

so y is strictly to the west and south of z.

Putting these together shows that x is below z (because x is below y and y is below z), so we must have supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  However, the given information does not fix their relative positions in the x‐direction; x could be left of, right of, or horizontally within z.  Precisely those three “southerly” relations will still hold:

• x SW z if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• x S z  if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and (horizontally x lies within z’s bounding box),  
• x SE z if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hence the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, or SE.
