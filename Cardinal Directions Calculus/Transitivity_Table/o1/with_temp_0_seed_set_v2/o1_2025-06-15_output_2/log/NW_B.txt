PROMPT: Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one can check systematically which of the nine relations  
─ N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B ─  
are still possible between x and z under the assumptions

• x NW y  (i.e. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)),  
• y B z   (i.e.  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

A brief sketch of why exactly N, W, NW, or B remain possible (and the others do not) goes as follows:

1)  x B z.  
   There is no contradiction in having z large enough to contain both y and x in its bounding box.  

2)  x NW z.  
   Since x is already “to the left of and above” y, and y is contained in z, it is perfectly possible for x also to lie strictly to the left of and above the bounding box of z (z could enclose y well to the “bottom‐right,” with x further “top‐left”).  

3)  x W z.  
   Being strictly to the left of z (no horizontal overlap) but vertically inside z’s bounding box also does not contradict x NW y and y B z: one may place x in the left‐hand portion of z’s bounding box (so it is “vertically inside” z) yet still strictly left of y.  

4)  x N z.  
   Being strictly above z (no vertical overlap) while nevertheless “horizontally inside” z’s bounding box is also compatible: x can be perched directly above z, and y can lie inside z, below x.  

Conversely, one finds that placing x strictly to the right (E, SE, NE) or strictly below (S, SE, SW) of z contradicts the geometry forced by x NW y and y B z.  

Hence the only possible relations between x and z are  
     N, W, NW, or B.
