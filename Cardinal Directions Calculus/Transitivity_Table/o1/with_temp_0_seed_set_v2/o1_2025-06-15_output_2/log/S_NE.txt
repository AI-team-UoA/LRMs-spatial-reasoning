PROMPT: Let S and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given relations one can deduce that, in terms of bounding boxes, z must lie strictly to the left of x.  Indeed, from  
• x S y ⇒ supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(y) and infₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x), and  
• y NE z ⇒ supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x),  
it follows that supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x): z’s box ends (in the x‐direction) at or before x’s box begins.  

However, there is no constraint forcing x to be above or below z.  Consequently, the only cardinal‐direction possibilities (which require “x to the right of z”) are precisely E, NE, or SE.
