PROMPT: Let N and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definition of “x N y,” we have three constraints:

1) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Similarly, “y N z” gives:

4) supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
5) infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
6) supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Combining (1) and (4) yields supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
Hence, in the y-dimension, z is at or below y, which is at or below x.

Combining (2), (3), (5), and (6) in the x-dimension gives  
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Thus, for “x ? z,” the only way to satisfy supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z below x) together with infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x fitting within z’s left and right projections) is exactly:

x N z.

All other directions (e.g., NW, NE, E, etc.) require conditions in the x-dimension that contradict the chain infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and “B” (bounding box) would require z’s top to lie above x’s top, which also contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Therefore, the only possible relation is N.
