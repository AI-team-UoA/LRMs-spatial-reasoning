PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can show that from  
• x W y ⇒ supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y), infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x), and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y),  
• y SE z ⇒ supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  

it follows that supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z). Hence the top of x is below (or at) the bottom of z, so x is somewhere strictly south of z.

Because there is no information to fix x and z relative to one another in the x‐direction (we only know both of them lie “to the west” of or “meet” infₓ(y), but not how x and z compare directly), x may lie entirely to the left of z, directly underneath z, or entirely to the right of z. Consequently, the only possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are  
• SW (if x is also to the west),  
• S (if x is directly underneath), or  
• SE (if x is also to the east).
