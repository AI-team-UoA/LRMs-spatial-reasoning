PROMPT: Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees immediately that  
• x NW y implies supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
• y NW z implies supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) and supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y).  

Chaining these together,  
supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)  ⇒  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x)  ⇒  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x).  

Hence x satisfies  
supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)  and  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
which are exactly the conditions for x NW z.  

No other relation (W, N, B, etc.) can hold, because all of them would be contradicted by the strict “left-and-above” chaining just derived. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
