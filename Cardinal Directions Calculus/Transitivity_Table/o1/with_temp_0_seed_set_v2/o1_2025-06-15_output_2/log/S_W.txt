PROMPT: Let S and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities it follows that x must lie to the left of z (because x S y and y W z together imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  Once x is to the left of z, its vertical position relative to z can range from being wholly below z, lining up inside z’s vertical extent, or wholly above z.  In terms of the definitions:

• x W z happens if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
• x SW z happens if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
• x NW z happens if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Hence the only possible relations of x to z are W, SW, or NW.
