PROMPT: Let NE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key pieces are:

1) x NE y means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   (That is, y’s bounding box is entirely below and to the left of x’s bounding box.)

2) y E z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   (So z is strictly to the left of y, but vertically can contain y or align with it.)

Chain these horizontally:

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).

Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which tells us that z lies completely to the left of x.  

Since there is no enforced strict ordering in the y‐direction between x and z (we only know y is below x and is contained in or aligned with z vertically, but that does not fix x’s vertical position relative to z), the only possibilities are that x is East, North‐East, or South‐East of z.  

Thus the possible relations between x and z are: E, NE, or SE.
