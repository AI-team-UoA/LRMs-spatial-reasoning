PROMPT: Let S and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x S y” forces x to lie strictly below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and horizontally within y. Meanwhile, “y SE z” forces y to lie strictly southeast of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)). Combining these:

• From y SE z we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  
• From x S y we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x lies strictly to the right of z.

Similarly,

• From y SE z we get supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
• From x S y we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y).  

Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x lies strictly below z.

Putting these together—x is to the right of z and below z—matches exactly the definition of “SE.” Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.
