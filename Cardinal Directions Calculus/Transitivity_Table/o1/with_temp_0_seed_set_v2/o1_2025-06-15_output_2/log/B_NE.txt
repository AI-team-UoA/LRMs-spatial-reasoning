PROMPT: Let B and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, we have two pieces of information:

1) x B y means:  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

   In words, the bounding box of x lies completely inside the bounding box of y.

2) y NE z means:  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

   In words, z is strictly southwest of y: its “rightmost” x is at or to the left of y’s “leftmost” x, and its “topmost” y is at or below y’s “bottommost” y.

Combine these to relate x and z. From x B y we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x). From y NE z we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y). Putting them together:

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Hence,  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

By the definitions, x NE z if and only if  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

That is exactly what we found. Checking all other relations shows that none of them can be satisfied under these inequalities. Consequently, the only possible relation here is:

x NE z.
