PROMPT: Let NW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

A succinct way to see that all nine relations remain possible is to note that “x NW y” forces x to lie strictly left‐and‐above y in bounding‐box terms, and “y SE z” forces y strictly right‐and‐below z.  However, those two facts only give

• x < y and z < y in the x‐dimension (that is, both x and z lie to the “left” of y),  
• x > y and z > y in the y‐dimension (both x and z lie “above” y).

Nothing in those inequalities determines whether x is left or right of z, nor whether x is above or below z; one can freely choose x’s and z’s bounding boxes so as to realize any of the nine cardinal‐direction possibilities (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) between x and z. Consequently, every one of the nine relations is consistent with “x NW y and y SE z.”
