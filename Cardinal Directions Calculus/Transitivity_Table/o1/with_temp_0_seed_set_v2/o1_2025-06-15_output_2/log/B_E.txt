PROMPT: Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, x B y means x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box (that is, horizontally and vertically, x lies within y).  On the other hand, y E z means y lies strictly to the right (east) of z while still fitting vertically within z’s bounding box.

Concretely:

• x B y implies  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

• y E z implies  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Putting these together:

1) Horizontally:  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   Thus supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

2) Vertically:  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
   so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

These are precisely the conditions for x E z (region x lies strictly to the right of z’s bounding box, while fitting vertically within it).  No other cardinal direction relation can hold under those constraints. 

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z, given x B y and y E z, is  
x E z.
