PROMPT: Let NW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions it follows that “x NW y” forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and strictly above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), while “y S z” forces y to lie strictly below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)) and horizontally within z (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).  

Because there is no direct bounding‐box constraint relating x and z (only via y), x may end up either wholly or partly inside z, or else be strictly to the left (or to the left‐and‐above/below), or possibly even entirely above or below, depending on how large z is and how x is placed relative to y.  

A straightforward check shows that the only impossible relations are those requiring z to lie strictly to the left of x (i.e., “x NE z”, “x E z”, and “x SE z”), since that would contradict x already being to the left of y (and y being contained in z).  

All other nine‐relation possibilities either are obviously consistent or can be realized by a suitable placement and sizing of the disks.  Concretely, the possible relations of x to z, given x NW y and y S z, are precisely:

• N  
• NW  
• W  
• SW  
• S  
• B  

and not NE, E, or SE.
