PROMPT: Let B and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that  
1) x B y means: infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
2) y S z means: supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  and  supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

we combine these as follows:

• From x B y we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• From y S z we get supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Putting the y and z inequalities together shows  
supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
which forces x to lie entirely below z in the vertical dimension.  

Next, combining infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) tells us x’s bounding box is horizontally within z’s bounding box.  

Altogether, these exactly match the definition of x S z, namely  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

No other cardinal‐direction condition can be satisfied under these constraints (for instance, x cannot be SW or SE of z because that would demand contradictory x‐coordinate inequalities, etc.).  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is:  
S.
