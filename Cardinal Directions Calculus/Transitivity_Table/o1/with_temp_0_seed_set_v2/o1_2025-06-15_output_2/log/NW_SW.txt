PROMPT: Let NW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one sees that x NW y ⇒  
(1) supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)   and   (2) supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  

while y SW z ⇒  
(3) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)   and   (4) supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).  

From (1) and (3), we can chain  
supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z),  
so supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z).  
Hence, in the x-dimension, x lies strictly to the left (or just touches) z.

In contrast, the y-inequalities only tell us that y lies below both x and z (since supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z)), but they give no direct ordering between x and z in the vertical dimension.  Consequently, x may be above z (making x NW of z), or below z (making x SW of z), or else x may fit vertically within z’s bounding box (making x W of z).  No other relative placements are consistent with supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z).  

Therefore, the only possible cardinal-direction relations between x and z are NW, W, or SW.
