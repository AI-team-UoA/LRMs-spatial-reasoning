PROMPT: Let E and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one can show that if x is E of y and y is E of z, then necessarily x must also be E of z (and no other of the listed relations can hold).  Here is a sketch of why:

1)  x E y says (in the x-dimension) supx(y) ≤ infx(x), and (in the y-dimension) x’s bounding‐box “fits” within y’s bounding‐box, i.e.,  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

2)  y E z likewise says (in the x-dimension) supx(z) ≤ infx(y), and (in the y-dimension) y’s bounding‐box fits within z’s bounding‐box, i.e.,  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

3)  From (2) we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  From (1) we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  Since for any region y we must have infx(y) ≤ supx(y), it follows  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),
   so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  That is exactly the x‐part of “x E z.”

4)  For the y‐part, chaining the inequalities from (1) and (2) shows that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  Hence x’s vertical bounding‐box also sits inside z’s vertical bounding‐box, matching the y‐part of “x E z.”

No other relation is compatible with these chained inequalities.  In particular, “x B z” would require supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but from y E z and x E y one deduces supx(z) ≤ supx(x), forcing equality in a way that contradicts the strict left‐to‐right placement.  Likewise, “N,” “S,” “NE,” “SE,” etc., all fail because x’s bounding‐box (vertical) ends up lying inside z’s in the y‐dimension, ruling out the pure “above” or “below” possibilities.  

Thus the only possible relation between x and z, given x E y and y E z, is x E z.
