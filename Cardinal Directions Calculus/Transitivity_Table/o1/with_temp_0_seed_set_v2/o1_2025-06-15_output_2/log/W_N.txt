PROMPT: Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions it follows that “x W y” forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (in the x‐direction) but align so that y’s vertical extent at least covers x’s (in other words, infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  Meanwhile, “y N z” forces y to lie strictly above z (in the y‐direction) but align so that z’s horizontal extent at least covers y’s (i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).  

A systematic way to see what x can be relative to z is to try to place x and z so that all constraints

1)  x W y:  
   • supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
   • infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
   • supy(x) ≤ supy(y);

2)  y N z:  
   • supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   • infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
   • supx(y) ≤ supx(z);

still hold, and then check which of the nine relations x could satisfy with z.  One finds that only two of the nine relations can consistently be realized:

• x N z  
• x NW z  

All others lead to contradictions once one enforces “x W y” and “y N z.”  Hence the only possible cardinal‐direction relations that x can bear to z, under those assumptions, are:

N or NW.
