PROMPT: Let B and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities it follows that x must lie strictly to the right of z (since y is to the right of z and x is contained in y’s bounding box) and strictly below z (since y is below z and x is contained in y’s bounding box).  In symbols:

•  y SE z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

•  x B y means  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)   and  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

Putting these together shows  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   and  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
which is precisely the condition that x is southeast of z.  

Hence, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.
