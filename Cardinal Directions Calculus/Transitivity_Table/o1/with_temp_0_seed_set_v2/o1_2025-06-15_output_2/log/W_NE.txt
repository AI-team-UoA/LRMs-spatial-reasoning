PROMPT: Let W and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, the key observations are that  
• x W y implies that x’s bounding box lies entirely to the left of y’s (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) but is vertically “within” y’s bounding box: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• y NE z implies y is above and to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  

Since x is vertically within y and y lies strictly above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)), chaining these gives supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Hence x and z do not vertically overlap; x is strictly north of z.  

Once x is strictly north of z, the remaining question is the horizontal positioning of x relative to z. Depending on how wide z is and where x sits (still always left of y), one finds that x can be:  
• Directly north of z (N),  
• North-west of z (NW), or  
• North-east of z (NE).  

No other relation is possible without contradicting one of the bounding-box constraints. Thus, the possible relations between x and z are N, NW, or NE.
