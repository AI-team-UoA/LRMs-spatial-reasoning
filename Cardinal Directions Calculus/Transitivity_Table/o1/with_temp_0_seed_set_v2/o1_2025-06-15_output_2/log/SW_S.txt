PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x SW y” imposes  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
so x lies strictly to the left and below y.  

Also, “y S z” imposes  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
so y lies strictly below z (but horizontally within z’s bounding box).

Chaining these together implies that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), so x also lies strictly below z.  However, whether x is left of, or horizontally within, z’s bounding box depends on how infx(x), supx(x) compare to infx(z), supx(z).  In particular:

• If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is also strictly left of z, giving x SW z.  
• If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x can lie vertically below but horizontally within z’s bounding box, giving x S z.  

No other relation can hold, because x must be below z (ruling out N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, B) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) cannot occur (which would be needed for x to be to the right of z).  

Hence the possible relations from x to z are S or SW.
