PROMPT: Let SW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one can check systematically which of the nine relations between x and z are consistent with

• x SW y:  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
• y B z:   infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z) and infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Because y is “inside” z (due to y B z), it is possible for x (which is left/below y) to be variously placed with respect to z, as long as supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y), supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y), and y’s bounding box is contained in z’s.  One finds that the only consistent possibilities are that x is:

• B of z (if x also fits entirely inside z),  
• S of z (if x is entirely below z but horizontally within z),  
• W of z (if x is entirely to the left of z but vertically within z),  
• SW of z (if x is below and to the left of z).

No other relation can be satisfied. Hence the possible relations between x and z are: B, S, W, or SW.
