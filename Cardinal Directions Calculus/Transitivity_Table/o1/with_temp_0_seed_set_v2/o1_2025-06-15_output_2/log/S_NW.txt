PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can show that x must lie strictly to the left of z (because x is horizontally within y and y is itself strictly to the left of z), but nothing forces x to be above, below, or vertically contained in z’s bounding box.  Concretely:

•  x S y implies supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
•  y NW z implies supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Putting these together gives supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is strictly to the left of z.  However, there is no constraint fixing whether x is above, below, or vertically inside z.  Checking the definitions shows that precisely the “to the left” relations (NW, W, SW) remain possible.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, or SW.
