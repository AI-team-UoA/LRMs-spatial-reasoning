PROMPT: Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can show that the only way to chain “x NW y” and “y W z” is to place x strictly to the left of z, and either above z or “vertically contained” with respect to z.  In the formal definitions:

•  x NW y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
•  y W  z  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Chaining the x NW y and y W z inequalities shows in particular  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
so x is necessarily to the left of z (since supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).  

Depending on how the “tops” and “bottoms” of x and z compare (which is not fixed by the above constraints alone), x can either fit the definition of W of z or NW of z:

•  x W z  is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (already ensured) and vertically x is “contained” in z,  
•  x NW z is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (again ensured) and z lies fully below x (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  

No other cardinal‑direction definitions (N, S, E, etc.) can be satisfied once x is known to lie strictly to the left of z.  Hence the only possible relations between x and z under these hypotheses are

   NW   or   W.
