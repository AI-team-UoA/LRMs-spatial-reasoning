PROMPT: Let B and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, x B y means  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

In other words, the bounding box of x is contained in the bounding box of y.  

Also, y SW z means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

From x B y we have supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y). Combining these with y SW z gives:  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

These two inequalities (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) are precisely the conditions for x SW z. No other cardinal relation can hold (for instance, x cannot be “W” or “S” of z, because that would require partial overlap in one dimension rather than being strictly below and to the left).  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
