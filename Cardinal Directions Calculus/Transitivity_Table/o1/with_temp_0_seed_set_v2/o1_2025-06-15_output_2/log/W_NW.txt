PROMPT: Let W and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, one sees that  
• “x W y” means x is strictly to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and, in the vertical dimension, the bounding box of x is contained in that of y (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
• “y NW z” means y is strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and strictly above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  

Chain these together in the x‐coordinate first:

   supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

implies

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

Hence x is strictly to the left of z.  

Next look at the y‐coordinates:  
• From x W y we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
• From y NW z we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Because infy(y) ≤ infy(x), one obtains

   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),

i.e. z lies strictly below x (the top of z is at or below the bottom of x).  

Putting both coordinates together:

   – in x:  supx(x) ≤ infx(z)   (x left of z),  
   – in y:  supy(z) ≤ infy(x)   (x above z).

By definition, that is exactly “x NW z.”  No other direction relation can hold under these constraints (all others require some overlap or containment in coordinates that is contradicted by the above inequalities).  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
