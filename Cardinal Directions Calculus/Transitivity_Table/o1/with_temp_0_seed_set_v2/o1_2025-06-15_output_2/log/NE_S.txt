PROMPT: Let NE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one can check systematically that, under  
  • x NE y  ⇔  supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  • y S  z  ⇔  supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
it is impossible for x to lie strictly west (W, SW, or NW) of z, but all of the other six relations (B, S, N, NE, E, SE) can arise by suitably placing the three regions.  

A concise way to see why W, SW, and NW become impossible is that y S z forces z’s bounding box to be at least as far left as y’s (infx(z) ≤ infx(y)) while x NE y forces x to be strictly to the right of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)).  Trying to make x also lie strictly to the left of z (which is what a W-, SW-, or NW-type relation with z would require) leads to contradictory inequalities for infx(z) and supx(x).  

All other relations (B, S, N, NE, E, SE) can be realized by choosing appropriate bounding boxes for x and z.  

Answer:  the possible relations of x to z are B, S, N, NE, E, or SE.
