PROMPT: Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, one can check the implied bounding‐box constraints and see that they force x to lie strictly to the left (west) of z and also strictly above (north of) z.  Concretely:

• “x N y” gives supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• “y NW z” gives supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Because x is north of y and y is northwest of z, chaining these inequalities forces  
1) supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
2) supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Hence x is entirely to the left of z (from 1) and entirely above z (from 2).  By the definitions, that is exactly the “NW” relation.  No other cardinal‐direction relation is compatible with both sets of inequalities.  Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
