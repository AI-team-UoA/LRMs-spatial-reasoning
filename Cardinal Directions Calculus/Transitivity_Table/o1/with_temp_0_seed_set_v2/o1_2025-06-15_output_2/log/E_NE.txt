PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities, one can see that “x E y” entails  
(1) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x),  
(2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
(3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y),  

while “y NE z” entails  
(4) supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
(5) supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y).  

Chaining (4) with (1) gives supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x), so supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x).  
Chaining (5) with (2) gives supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x).  

Hence relative to z, x lies strictly to the right (supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)) and above (supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x)).  The only cardinal‐direction relation that says “to the right and above” is NE.  Therefore, the only possibility consistent with x E y and y NE z is  

NE.
