PROMPT: Let SE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, the key observations are:

•  x SE y  means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
   (x is strictly to the right and strictly below y in terms of bounding boxes.)

•  y N z  means  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y),   infx(z) ≤ infx(y),   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
   (y is strictly above z, and y’s bounding box in the x‐direction is inside that of z.)

We wish to see which relations between x and z can (or cannot) be satisfied simultaneously with these constraints.  The critical point is that  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  
force y to lie (in the x‐direction) between z and x.  It turns out that this rules out any relation of x to z that requires

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z),

because chaining the inequalities leads to a contradiction.  In particular, the relations W, NW, and SW all require

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z),

so those three cannot occur.  

On the other hand, all other cardinal‐direction relations—namely B, S, N, NE, E, and SE—do not force this contradiction and can be achieved by suitably enlarging or placing z (which, by definition of y N z, already extends at least as far in x as y does).  Concretely:

•  B (bounding) can occur by letting z be large enough in both x and y so as to contain x’s bounding box.  
•  S, N, E, and NE (and similarly SE) can be arranged by placing z appropriately above/below x or to the left/right of x (or both), as there is no forced contradiction in those cases.

Hence the possible relations of x to z are:

B, S, N, NE, E, and SE.
