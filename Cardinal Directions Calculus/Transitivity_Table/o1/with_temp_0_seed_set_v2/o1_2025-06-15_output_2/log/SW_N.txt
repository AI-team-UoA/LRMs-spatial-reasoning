PROMPT: Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

All nine relations remain possible. Since x’s being SW of y and y’s being N of z impose no direct inequalities relating x and z (they only constrain each to lie “south” of y in the vertical direction, without forcing an ordering between x and z themselves), x can be placed relative to z so as to satisfy any of B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, or SE.
