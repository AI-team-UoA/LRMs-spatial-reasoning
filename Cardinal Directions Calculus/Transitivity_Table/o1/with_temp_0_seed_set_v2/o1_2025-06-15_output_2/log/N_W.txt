PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x N y” forces x’s bounding box strictly above y’s in the vertical direction and contained (or equal) in the horizontal direction:

• supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Meanwhile, “y W z” forces y’s bounding box strictly to the left of z’s in the horizontal direction and contained (or equal) in the vertical direction:

• supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combine these to see how x can relate to z:

1) From x N y:  
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
2) From y W z:  
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  

Putting them together gives  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  

Hence x’s bounding box lies strictly to the left of z’s bounding box (so x cannot be N, NE, E, SE, or B of z), leaving only W-, NW-, or SW-type possibilities (all require “left-of” in the x-dimension).

Next, check the vertical possibilities:

• For x W z one needs:  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  These say “x is entirely within z’s vertical span but to the left.”  Since infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) is not contradictory to also having supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x W z is possible if z is tall enough.

• For x NW z one needs:  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
  These say “x is above z and to the left.”  Since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) does not rule out supy(z) being ≤ infy(x), x NW z is also possible.

• For x SW z one would need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we already have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  Hence x SW z cannot hold.

Consequently, the only possible cardinal-direction relations of x to z, given “x N y” and “y W z,” are W or NW.
