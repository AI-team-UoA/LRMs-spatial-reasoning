PROMPT: Let S and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can show that “x is S of y” forces x to lie strictly below y (in the sense supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), and “y is E of z” forces y (and hence also x) to lie strictly to the right of z (in the sense supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)).  Once x is known to be to the right of z, the only remaining possibilities for x’s vertical position relative to z are:

• x could lie entirely below z (making x SE of z),  
• x could lie entirely above z (making x NE of z), or  
• x could be contained in z’s vertical span (making x E of z).

Hence, the possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z are E, NE, or SE.
