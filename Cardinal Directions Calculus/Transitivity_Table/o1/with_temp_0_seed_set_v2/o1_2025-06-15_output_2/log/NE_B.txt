PROMPT: Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one sees that  
• “x NE y” means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• “y B z” means infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Because y is inside (or bounded by) z, supx(z) ≥ supx(y) and supy(z) ≥ supy(y). Meanwhile, x being NE of y forces x to lie strictly to the right and above y’s bounding box. Putting these together, one checks systematically whether each of the nine relations can hold between x and z. One finds that x can neither lie strictly south, west, southwest, northwest, nor southeast of z (all those lead to contradictions once one imposes x NE y and y B z).  

However, four relations remain possible:

1) x B z.  
   This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
   Since z’s bounding box is at least as large as y’s, and x is (by hypothesis) “to the NE” of y, it is consistent that x might still fit entirely inside z’s bounding box (particularly if z is large).

2) x N z.  
   This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and the x‑extent of x within that of z.  
   Because y is inside z and x sits above y, it can indeed happen that z’s top is still below x’s bottom (if, for example, y’s top coincides with z’s top, and x sits just above that).

3) x NE z.  
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
   Again, since z must at least encompass y, we can still have supx(z) = supx(y) < infx(x) and supy(z) = supy(y) < infy(x), which places x entirely northeast of z.

4) x E z.  
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (so z is fully to the left of x) but with overlapping y‑extent, i.e. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
   That too can occur if, for instance, supx(z) = supx(y) < infx(x) but vertically x fits between infy(z) and supy(z).  

Hence the only possible relations are B, N, NE, or E.
