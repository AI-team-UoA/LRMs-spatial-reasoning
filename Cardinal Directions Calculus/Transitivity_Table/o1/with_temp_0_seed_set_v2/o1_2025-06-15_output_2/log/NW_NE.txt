PROMPT: Let NW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x NW y” means:

• supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is strictly to the left of y)  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (y is strictly below x)

and “y NE z” means:

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  (z is strictly to the left of y)  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  (z is strictly below y)

Hence y is below x, and z is below y; therefore z is below x.  In the coordinate‐direction terminology above, that forces x to be “north” of z in some sense (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  However, no constraints fix whether x is to the left, to the right, or “horizontally inside” relative to z.  

As a result, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations of x to z (given that x is above z but with indeterminate horizontal placement) are:

• x N z  
• x NE z  
• x NW z  

Thus the answer is: N, NE, NW.
