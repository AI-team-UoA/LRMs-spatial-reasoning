PROMPT: Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities, “x is N of y” means

• supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

Meanwhile, “y is NE of z” means

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Chain these:

1) Because supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
   Hence x lies strictly above z (so any relation that would require x to be below or at the same vertical level as z is impossible).

2) Because supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
   Hence x lies strictly to the right of z.

Those two facts (x above z and to the right of z) are exactly the conditions for x NE z, namely  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

All other cardinal‐direction definitions fail under these constraints. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.
