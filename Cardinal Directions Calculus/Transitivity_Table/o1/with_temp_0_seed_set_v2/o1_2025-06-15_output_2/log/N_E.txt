PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, one sees that  
• x N y means  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
• y E z means  supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Putting these together:

1) From y E z, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y).  
2) From x N y, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so horizontally, z is strictly to the left of x (no overlap).  

3) Again from x N y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
4) From y E z, we know y’s vertical bounds lie within (or equal to) z’s: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Since supy(y) ≤ infy(x], we see y lies below x, but y itself is “vertically contained” in z.  Depending on how large z is vertically, x’s vertical box could end up either fully inside z’s vertical box or fully above it.  

Checking the definitions of E and NE relative to z:

• x E z requires  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

• x NE z requires  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  
  and  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Both are consistent with “z is to the left of x,” and then either “x is vertically within z” (the E case) or “x is entirely above z” (the NE case).  One cannot get any other cardinal relation (for instance, N would require overlapping horizontally, SE would require x below z, etc.).  

Consequently, if x is N of y and y is E of z, then x can only be E of z or NE of z.
