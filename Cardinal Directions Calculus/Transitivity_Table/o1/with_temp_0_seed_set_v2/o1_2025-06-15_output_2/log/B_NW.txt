PROMPT: Let B and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x B y” means x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box; in coordinates:

• infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

And “y NW z” means y is northwest of z; in coordinates:

• supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

From these two, we can chain together:

1. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x B y)  
2. supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y NW z)  

Combining 1 and 2 gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Thus, x’s entire bounding box lies to the left of (or just abutting) z.

Similarly, from y NW z we also have supy(z) ≤ infy(y). Then using infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x B y), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Hence z is entirely (or just abutting) below x.

Putting these together:  
• x is to the left of z (since supx(x) ≤ infx(z)),  
• x is above z (since supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

By the definitions of the nine cardinal direction relations, “to the left and above” matches exactly NW. None of the other relations is compatible with both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for a nondegenerate region in REG. 

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z, given x B y and y NW z, is:  
x NW z.
