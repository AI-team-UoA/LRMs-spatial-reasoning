PROMPT: Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,

• x SW y ⇔ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y SW z ⇔ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Chaining these inequalities gives  
1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), exactly the conditions for  
x SW z.  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can be made to hold under these constraints (for example, to have x S z one would need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is incompatible with supx(x) ≤ infx(z), etc.).  

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
