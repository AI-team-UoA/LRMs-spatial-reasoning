PROMPT: Let E and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x E y” means:  
1) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)        (x is to the right of y),  
2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  

And “y N z” means:  
1) supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y)        (y is above z),  
2) infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
3) supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).  

From 1) of y N z, supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y), and from 2)–3) of x E y, x lies vertically inside y’s bounding box.  Hence in the vertical dimension, x is also strictly above z (since y is itself above z, and x cannot dip below y).  

In the horizontal dimension, y is contained within z (because infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)), but x sits to the right of y (since supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)).  Whether infₓ(x) still lies ≤ supₓ(z) or instead exceeds supₓ(z) determines whether x is horizontally contained within z or is to the right of z.  

• If infₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z), then x is “above” z but still within z horizontally.  By definition, that is x N z.  
• If infₓ(x) > supₓ(z), then x is “above” and also strictly to the right of z.  By definition, that is x NE z.  

No other cardinal‐direction placements of x relative to z can be consistent with x E y and y N z.  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are N or NE.
