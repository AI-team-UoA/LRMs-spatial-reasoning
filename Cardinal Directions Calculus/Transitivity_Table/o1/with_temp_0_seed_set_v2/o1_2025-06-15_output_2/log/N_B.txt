PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If x is N of y and y is B of z, then the only ways to satisfy those bounding‐box inequalities for x relative to z are that x is either also B of z or else N of z.  In more detail:

1)  From x N y, we have:  
   • supy(y) ≤ infy(x)        (y is below x),  
   • infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   • supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

2)  From y B z, we have:  
   • infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   • supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
   • infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   • supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Combining the x‐bounds shows that x is horizontally within z’s bounding box (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  Vertically, two consistent scenarios can arise:

•  x is also inside z’s bounding box (so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), giving x B z.  
•  Or else the top of z is at or below the bottom of x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), placing x strictly north of z, i.e. x N z.

No other cardinal directions satisfy all of the above inequalities; hence the possible relations of x to z are N or B.
