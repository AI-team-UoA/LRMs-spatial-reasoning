PROMPT: Let S and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, the key inequalities for x S y and y SW z are:

• x S y means  
  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

• y SW z means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

First, from x S y we see that x is entirely below y (its top is not above y’s bottom) and horizontally within y’s bounding box. Meanwhile, y SW z says y is entirely to the left of z (its right is not beyond z’s left) and entirely below z (its top is not above z’s bottom). Combining these:

1. Because supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
   This places x to the left of z.  

2. Because supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
   This places x below z.  

Hence x is both strictly to the left and strictly below z, which is precisely the definition of x SW z. Consequently, the only possible cardinal direction relation of x to z under these conditions is SW.
