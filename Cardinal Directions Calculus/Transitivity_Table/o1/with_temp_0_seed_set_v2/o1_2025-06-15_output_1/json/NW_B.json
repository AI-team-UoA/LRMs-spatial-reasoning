{"prompt": "Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions one can show by explicit \u201cbounding\u2010box\u201d arguments (or by concrete examples) that when x is NW of y and y is B of z, then x can only be\n\n\u2022 inside z (x B z),  \n\u2022 strictly west of z (x W z),  \n\u2022 strictly northwest of z (x NW z), or  \n\u2022 strictly north of z (x N z).\n\nAll other directions (S, SE, E, NE, SW) can be ruled out by combining the two given constraints:\n\n1)  x NW y  \u21d2  supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)  and  supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).  \n   (x is left of y and above y.)\n\n2)  y B z    \u21d2  \n   infx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 supx(z),  \n   infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).  \n   (y\u2019s bounding box is contained in z\u2019s.)\n\nDepending on whether (and how) x\u2019s bounding box also fits within or around z\u2019s, one finds exactly these four possibilities for x relative to z:  B, W, NW, or N.", "elapsed-time": 56.631134033203125, "reasoning-tokens": 8192, "completion-tokens": 8508}
