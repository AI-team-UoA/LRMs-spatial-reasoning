{"prompt": "Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, \u201cx N y\u201d means horizontally x is within y\u2019s bounding box, and vertically x is completely above y.  Concretely:\n\n\u2022 x N y \u21d4 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x), infx(y) \u2264 infx(x), and supx(x) \u2264 supx(y).\n\nSimilarly, \u201cy B z\u201d means y\u2019s bounding box is contained in z\u2019s bounding box:\n\n\u2022 y B z \u21d4 infx(z) \u2264 infx(y), supx(y) \u2264 supx(z), infy(z) \u2264 infy(y), and supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).\n\nPutting these together forces x to lie horizontally inside z\u2019s bounding box (because x is horizontally inside y, and y is in turn inside z).  Vertically, x could still be \u201cinside\u201d z (if supy(x) \u2264 supy(z)) or could lie entirely above z (if supy(z) \u2264 infy(x)).  Those two scenarios correspond to x B z (the inside case) or x N z (the above case).  No other cardinal\u2010direction relation is possible given these constraints.  \n\nHence, the only possible relations between x and z are B or N.", "elapsed-time": 34.80184268951416, "reasoning-tokens": 4672, "completion-tokens": 4971}
