{"prompt": "Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the defining inequalities, one sees that  \n\u2022 x NE y means  \n  supx(y) \u2264 infx(x)  and  supy(y) \u2264 infy(x),  \n\u2022 y NE z means  \n  supx(z) \u2264 infx(y)  and  supy(z) \u2264 infy(y).  \n\nChaining these shows that  \n1) supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(x),  \n2) supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x).  \n\nHence  \n\u2013 supx(z) \u2264 infx(x), and  \n\u2013 supy(z) \u2264 infy(x),  \n\nwhich are exactly the two inequalities needed for x NE z.  \n\nAll other cardinal\u2010direction possibilities fail because either they would require x to overlap z horizontally (contradicting supx(z) \u2264 infx(x)) or to be below z (contradicting supy(z) \u2264 infy(x)).  Consequently, if x is NE of y and y is NE of z, the only consistent relation between x and z (under these definitions) is NE.", "elapsed-time": 49.3503942489624, "reasoning-tokens": 7168, "completion-tokens": 7458}
