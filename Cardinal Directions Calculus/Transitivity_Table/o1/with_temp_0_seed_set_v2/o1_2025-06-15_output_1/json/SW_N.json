{"prompt": "Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "All nine of the listed relations are consistent with \u201cx SW y\u201d and \u201cy N z.\u201d  In other words, knowing only that x is southwest of y and y is north of z does not fix how x must lie relative to z; one can arrange x and z so that any of N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B holds between them.", "elapsed-time": 29.14441990852356, "reasoning-tokens": 4096, "completion-tokens": 4223}
