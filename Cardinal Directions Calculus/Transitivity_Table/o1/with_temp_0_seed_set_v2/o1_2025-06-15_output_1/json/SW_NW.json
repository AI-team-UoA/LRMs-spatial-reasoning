{"prompt": "Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the two given relations\n\n\u2022 x SW y  \u21d2  supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)  and  supy(x) \u2264 infy(y),  \n\u2022 y NW z  \u21d2  supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)  and  supy(z) \u2264 infy(y),\n\none can chain the x-coordinates to show that supx(x) \u2264 infx(z).  Hence x must lie to the \u201cleft\u201d of z (i.e., supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)).\n\nFor the y-coordinates, we only know supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) and supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) but have no direct comparison between supy(x) and supy(z).  Consequently, x could lie below z (making x SW z), above z (x NW z), or with overlapping y-bounds but still to the left (x W z).  \n\nThus, the possible relations of x to z, under those premises, are exactly  \nW, NW, or SW.", "elapsed-time": 22.680550813674927, "reasoning-tokens": 3136, "completion-tokens": 3384}
