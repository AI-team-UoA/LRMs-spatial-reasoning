{"prompt": "Let S and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions,  \n\u2022  x S y  \u21d2  (supy(x) \u2264 infy(y))  and  (infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) \u2264 supx(x) \u2264 supx(y)),  \n\u2022  y E z  \u21d2  (supx(z) \u2264 infx(y))  and  (infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 supy(z)).  \n\nPutting these together shows, in particular, that  \n  supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 infx(x).  \n\nHence, horizontally, x lies to the right of z (since z\u2019s right\u2010most x\u2010value is no larger than x\u2019s left\u2010most x\u2010value).  Vertically, however, x may or may not lie within z\u2019s vertical extent.  \n\nChecking the definitions of the possible relations a ? b for a = x and b = z:\n\n\u2022  x E z  requires  \n   (1)  supx(z) \u2264 infx(x),  \n   (2)  infy(z) \u2264 infy(x),  \n   (3)  supy(x) \u2264 supy(z).  \n  The first is guaranteed by supx(z) \u2264 infx(x).  If x\u2019s vertical bounding box also sits inside z\u2019s (conditions (2) and (3)), then x E z can hold.\n\n\u2022  x SE z  requires  \n   (1)  supx(z) \u2264 infx(x),  \n   (2)  supy(x) \u2264 infy(z).  \n  The first again is guaranteed by supx(z) \u2264 infx(x).  If x lies entirely below z (so supy(x) \u2264 infy(z)), then x SE z can hold.\n\nAll other relations fail because either they require x to be to the left of z (contradicted by supx(z) \u2264 infx(x)) or to be above it, etc.  \n\nTherefore, the only possible cardinal\u2010direction relations between x and z are E or SE.", "elapsed-time": 38.941242694854736, "reasoning-tokens": 4672, "completion-tokens": 5147}
