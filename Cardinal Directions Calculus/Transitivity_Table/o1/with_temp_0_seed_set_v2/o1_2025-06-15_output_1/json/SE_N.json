{"prompt": "Let SE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "N, NE, E, SE, S, or B are all consistent with x being SE of y and y being N of z.  In contrast, the three \u201cwestern\u201d relations (W, NW, SW) cannot arise because x is already to the right of y (and y is horizontally contained in z), so there is no way for x to end up strictly to the left of z.", "elapsed-time": 49.5007700920105, "reasoning-tokens": 7040, "completion-tokens": 7181}
