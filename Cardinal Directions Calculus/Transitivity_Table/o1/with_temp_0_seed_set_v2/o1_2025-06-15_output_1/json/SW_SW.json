{"prompt": "Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions,\n\nx SW y means  \n   supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)  \n   supy(x) \u2264 infy(y),  \ny SW z means  \n   supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)  \n   supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nSince for each region r we have infx(r) \u2264 supx(r) and infy(r) \u2264 supy(r), chaining the above gives  \n   supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z),  \n   supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nHence we deduce supx(x) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(z).  This directly shows that x could be SW of z.  But since z can be arbitrarily large (horizontally and/or vertically), it can also encompass x in other ways:\n\n\u2022 x can be SW of z (just established),  \n\u2022 x can be S of z if z is wide enough to contain x in the horizontal dimension,  \n\u2022 x can be W of z if z is tall enough to contain x in the vertical dimension,  \n\u2022 x can be B of z if z is large enough to contain x\u2019s bounding box in both dimensions.\n\nNo other relations fit the inequalities (for example, x cannot be above z).  Therefore, the only possible relations between x and z are  \n\nS, SW, W, B.", "elapsed-time": 22.629465579986572, "reasoning-tokens": 2880, "completion-tokens": 3242}
