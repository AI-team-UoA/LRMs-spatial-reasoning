{"prompt": "Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions one can check consistency of each possible relation of x to z by combining\n\n\u2022  x NE y  \u21d2  supx(y) \u2264 infx(x)  and  supy(y) \u2264 infy(x),  \n\u2022  y B  z  \u21d2  infx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 supx(z)  and  infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).\n\nTrying each of the nine relations of x to z in turn, one finds:\n\n\u2022  S, SW, W, NW, SE all lead to contradictions once one imposes supy(y) \u2264 infy(x) (i.e., x is north of y), or supx(y) \u2264 infx(x) (x is east of y), together with y being inside the bounding box of z.  \n\u2022  B (\u201cx B z\u201d) is possible: if z is large enough, it can contain both y and x in its bounding box.  \n\u2022  N (\u201cx N z\u201d) is possible: if z (with y inside it) lies entirely below x, then supy(z) \u2264 infy(x).  \n\u2022  NE (\u201cx NE z\u201d) is possible: if z lies below and to the left, then supx(z) \u2264 infx(x) and supy(z) \u2264 infy(x).  \n\u2022  E (\u201cx E z\u201d) is possible: if x and y are within the vertical extent of z but to its right, then supx(z) \u2264 infx(x) and infy(z) \u2264 infy(x) \u2264 supy(x) \u2264 supy(z).  \n\nHence the only consistent relations of x to z, given that x is NE of y and y is B of z, are  \nB, N, NE, or E.", "elapsed-time": 32.97311329841614, "reasoning-tokens": 4736, "completion-tokens": 5177}
