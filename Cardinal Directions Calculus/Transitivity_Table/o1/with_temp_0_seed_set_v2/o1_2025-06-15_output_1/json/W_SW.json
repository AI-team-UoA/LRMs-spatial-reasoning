{"prompt": "Let W and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "From the definitions, saying  \n\u2022 x W y means  \n  1) supx(x) \u2264 infx(y),  \n  2) infy(y) \u2264 infy(x),  \n  3) supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).  \n\n\u2022 y SW z means  \n  4) supx(y) \u2264 infx(z),  \n  5) supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n\nChain these inequalities:\n\n\u2022 From (1) and (4), we get supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z).  \n  Hence supx(x) \u2264 infx(z),  \n  meaning x is strictly to the left of z.  \n\n\u2022 From (3) and (5), we get supy(x) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  \n  Hence supy(x) \u2264 infy(z),  \n  meaning x is strictly below z.  \n\nThus x is strictly left and strictly below z, which is precisely the definition of  \nx SW z.  \n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction definition can be satisfied under these constraints, so the only possible relation between x and z is SW.", "elapsed-time": 31.919269561767578, "reasoning-tokens": 4416, "completion-tokens": 4699}
