PROMPT: Let SE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
• x SE y means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y SW z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

From the y‑inequalities, we get  
  supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ … ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
so certainly supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
That forces x to lie “below” z (i.e., in the south direction relative to z).  

On the other hand, in the x‑dimension, we only know that both infx(x) and infx(z) lie to the right of (or equal to) supx(y).  However, there is nothing forcing x to be strictly left, strictly right, or horizontally “within” z, so all three possibilities remain open.  

Hence, combining “below” in the y‑direction with the unconstrained x‑direction yields exactly three possible relations of x to z:  
• S (directly south),  
• SW (southwest),  
• SE (southeast).
