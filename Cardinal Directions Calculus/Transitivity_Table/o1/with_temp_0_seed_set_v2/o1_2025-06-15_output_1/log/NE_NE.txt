PROMPT: Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities, one sees that  
• x NE y means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• y NE z means  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Chaining these shows that  
1) supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
2) supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

Hence  
– supx(z) ≤ infx(x), and  
– supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  

which are exactly the two inequalities needed for x NE z.  

All other cardinal‐direction possibilities fail because either they would require x to overlap z horizontally (contradicting supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) or to be below z (contradicting supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  Consequently, if x is NE of y and y is NE of z, the only consistent relation between x and z (under these definitions) is NE.
