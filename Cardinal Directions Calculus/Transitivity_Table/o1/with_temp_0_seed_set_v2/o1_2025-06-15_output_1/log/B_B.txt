PROMPT: Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

x B y means x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box, and y B z means y’s bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box.  From these, one can deduce that x’s bounding box is also contained in z’s bounding box.  Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z under those hypotheses is x B z.
