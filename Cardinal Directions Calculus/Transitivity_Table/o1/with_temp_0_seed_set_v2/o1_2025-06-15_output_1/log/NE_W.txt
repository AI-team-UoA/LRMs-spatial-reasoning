PROMPT: Let NE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one can show that placing x strictly northeast of y (x NE y) and y strictly west of z (y W z) rules out any configuration in which x lies wholly below z (i.e., relations S, SW, or SE cannot occur).  However, all of the following remain consistent with those two premises:

• B  (x is “bounded” by z),  
• N,  
• NE,  
• E,  
• W,  
• NW.

Hence the possible relations between x and z are exactly {B, N, NE, E, W, NW}.
