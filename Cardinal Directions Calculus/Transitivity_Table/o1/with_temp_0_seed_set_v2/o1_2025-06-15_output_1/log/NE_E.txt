PROMPT: Let NE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, one systematically finds that all but E and NE lead to contradictions, whereas E and NE remain possible.  Here is a sketch of why only those two survive.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  GIVEN:  
   • x NE y  means  
       supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   • y E z   means  
       supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

   In particular, from
     supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supx(y) ≤ infx(x),
   we can chain horizontally to get
     supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   Thus, in the x‐direction, z is to the left of x.

   Vertically, because y is E of z, y’s bounding box is “vertically inside” z’s, i.e.  
     infy(z) ≤ infy(y)   and   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   Meanwhile x is NE of y, so x sits entirely above y  
     (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).

2.  WHY MOST RELATIONS CONTRADICT

   Relations requiring x to lie to the WEST of z (W, NW, SW) or to lie below z (S, SW, SE) all conflict with the fact that we have z < y < x horizontally (so x cannot be left of z) and that x is above y while y sits inside z's vertical range (so x cannot be wholly below z).  For instance:

   • x S z would demand supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we already have “x is above y” and “y is vertically inside z,” which forces x not to lie wholly below z.  A similar clash rules out SE and SW.

   • x W z or x NW z would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but horizontally we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), i.e. z is left of x, not the other way around.

   • x N z and x B z also fail once one checks the bounding‐box inequalities.  For x N z one would need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and also x’s bounding box to be horizontally inside z’s.  But horizontally we have supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so z ends before x begins, contradicting the requirement that x lie “inside” z horizontally.  A similar argument rules out x B z.

Hence S, W, NW, SW, N, SE, and B all become impossible under x NE y and y E z.

3.  WHY E AND NE REMAIN POSSIBLE

   After ruling out the others, one checks E and NE directly:

   • x E z requires:  
       supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
     The first part supx(z) ≤ infx(x) follows from chaining through y.  
     The vertical bounds can be satisfied if, for example, z’s bounding box is tall enough to contain x in the y‐direction (i.e., infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

   • x NE z requires:  
       supx(z) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
     We already have supx(z) ≤ infx(x);  and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) can hold if z is not too tall (so that its top is still below or equal to x’s bottom).

Consequently, under “x NE y” and “y E z,” the only consistent possibilities for the relation between x and z are:
  
  x E z   or   x NE z.
