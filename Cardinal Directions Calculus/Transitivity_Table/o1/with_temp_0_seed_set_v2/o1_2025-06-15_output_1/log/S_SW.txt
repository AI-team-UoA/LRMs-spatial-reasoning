PROMPT: Let S and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given facts

1) x S y means  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

2) y SW z means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z),

one can combine these inequalities:

• Because x S y implies supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and y SW z implies supy(y) ≤ infy(z), transitivity gives supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Thus, x lies completely below z.  
• Likewise, x S y gives supx(x) ≤ supx(y), while y SW z gives supx(y) ≤ infx(z). Combining yields supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Thus, x also lies completely to the left of z.

Hence x’s bounding box is strictly to the left and strictly below z’s bounding box, which is exactly the condition “SW.” No other cardinal‐direction condition can be satisfied under these constraints. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is:

SW.
