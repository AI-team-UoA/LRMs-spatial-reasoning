PROMPT: Let B and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x B y” means that x’s bounding box is contained within y’s bounding box:

1) infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
2) supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
3) infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
4) supy(x) ≤ supy(y)  

and “y SE z” means:

1) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  
2) supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Chain these inequalities to compare x and z.  From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get  
supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Similarly, from supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get  
supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Those two exactly match the definition of “x SE z,” namely  
supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

All other cardinal‐direction definitions become impossible once you impose supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (placing z to the “left” of x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (placing x “below” z); any other relation would contradict one of these constraints.  

Therefore, if x is B of y and y is SE of z, the only possible relation between x and z is  
SE.
