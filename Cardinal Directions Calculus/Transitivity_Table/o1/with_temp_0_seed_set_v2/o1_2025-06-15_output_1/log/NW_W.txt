PROMPT: Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one sees that:

•  x NW y  ⇒  (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))  and  (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))  
   (“x is entirely to the left of y and y is entirely below x”)

•  y W  z  ⇒  (supx(y) ≤ infx(z))  and  (infy(z) ≤ infy(y))  and  (supy(y) ≤ supy(z))  
   (“y is entirely to the left of z and y’s vertical extent is contained in z’s”)

Combining the horizontal parts:

   supx(x) ≤ infx(y)   and   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

implies

   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).

Hence,

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z),

which says x is also entirely to the left of z (so x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z).

Next, the vertical constraints show that y lies below x (since supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and y is vertically contained in z (since infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  However, these do not force x to lie inside z’s vertical bounds (which would make x W z) nor do they forbid x from being completely above z (which would make x NW z).  What is ruled out is that x could lie strictly below z (SW), because that would contradict y’s being contained under x yet also contained vertically by z.

Consequently, the only feasible relations of x to z that can arise from

   x NW y  and  y W z

are

   x W z   or   x NW z.
