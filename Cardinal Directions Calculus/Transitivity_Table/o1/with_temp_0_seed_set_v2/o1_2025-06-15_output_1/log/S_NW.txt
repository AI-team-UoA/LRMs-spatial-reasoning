PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one sees that  
• x S y forces x to lie strictly below y (so supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and horizontally within y,  
• y NW z forces y to lie strictly to the left of z (so supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and strictly above z (so supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  

Since x must fit inside y’s bounding‐box horizontally (because x S y), and y in turn is strictly to the left of z (because y NW z), it follows that x is also strictly to the left of z.  Whether x ends up below, level with, or above z (in the vertical sense) can vary, so one finds exactly three consistent possibilities for x with respect to z:

• x SW z,  
• x W z,  
• x NW z.  

All other cardinal‐direction relations contradict the requirement that x be inside y (and thus also to the left of z) together with y NW z. Hence, the possible relations are precisely {SW, W, NW}.
