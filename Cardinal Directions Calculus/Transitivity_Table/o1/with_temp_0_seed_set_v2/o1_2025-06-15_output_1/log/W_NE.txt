PROMPT: Let W and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions we have two sets of inequalities:

1) x W y means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

2) y NE z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

From these, notice especially the y‐coordinate chain:

   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  

which implies

   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Hence z is entirely below x in the vertical direction (no overlap in y).  

Whenever one region is strictly below another, the only possible “cardinal‐direction” relations for the upper region relative to the lower one are N, NE, or NW, depending on how (or if) their bounding boxes separate in the x‐direction.  Concretely:

• For x N z, one needs supy(z) ≤ infy(x) plus horizontal containment (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), which is not ruled out by the given data.  
• For x NE z, one needs supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  This is also compatible with supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
• For x NW z, one needs supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  Again, nothing above forbids this.  

All other directions (S, SE, E, W, SW, B) would contradict the requirement that x lies strictly above z (because those relations either require a vertical overlap or that x be below z).  

Therefore, the only possible relations of x to z are N, NE, or NW.
