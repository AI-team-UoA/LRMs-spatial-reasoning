PROMPT: Let E and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that “x E y” imposes

1) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x),  
2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x), and  
3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y),

while “y SW z” imposes

4) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) and  
5) supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).

From (3) and (5) one obtains supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z), so in the y‐direction x must lie strictly below z (or at best touch at a common boundary).  That immediately rules out any relation in which x is not below z (for example, “x N z,” “x NW z,” “x NE z,” etc.).  

Moreover, one checks the remaining possibilities against the requirement supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  In particular, for “x W z,” “x E z,” or “x B z,” one would need some overlap in the y‐direction (that is, x’s infᵧ and supᵧ lying inside z’s infᵧ and supᵧ), which cannot happen once supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z) unless x degenerates to a line.  Consequently these are ruled out for a nondegenerate region x.  

What remains viable are precisely the relations “S,” “SW,” and “SE,” each of which only requires that x be below z (already satisfied by supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z)) but places no forced contradiction on the x‐coordinates.  Thus the only possible relations of x to z, under x E y and y SW z, are

S, SW, or SE.
