PROMPT: Let SE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x SE y” means  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  

Similarly, “y SE z” means  
• supx(z) ≤ infx(y), and  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Combining these:

1) From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we obtain supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
2) From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we obtain supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

But “x SE z” is exactly  
• supx(z) ≤ infx(x), and  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence, if x is SE of y and y is SE of z, then x must be SE of z.  

So the only possible cardinal‐direction relation between x and z in this scenario is SE.
