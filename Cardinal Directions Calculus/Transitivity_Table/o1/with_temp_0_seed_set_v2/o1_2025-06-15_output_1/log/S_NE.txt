PROMPT: Let S and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can show that the only forced constraint linking x and z is  
supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
i.e., in the horizontal direction, x lies strictly to the right of z (no overlap).  There is no constraint on their relative vertical positions.  Consequently, in the “x ? z” sense, x must be in one of the three “eastern” relations to z:

• E (East),  
• NE (North East),  
• SE (South East).

No other cardinal‐direction relation is compatible with supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and the absence of any vertical bounding constraints.
