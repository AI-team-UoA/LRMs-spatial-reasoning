PROMPT: Let SW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given assumptions

1) x SW y  
   ⇔ supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),

2) y B z  
   ⇔ infx(z) ≤ infx(y)  and  supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  and  infy(z) ≤ infy(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z),

we want to find all consistent ways to place x relative to z.  A convenient way to proceed is to see which of the nine cardinal‐direction definitions

• a B b   ⇔   infx(b) ≤ infx(a),  supx(a) ≤ supx(b),  infy(b) ≤ infy(a),  supy(a) ≤ supy(b),  
• a S b   ⇔   supy(a) ≤ infy(b),  infx(b) ≤ infx(a),  supx(a) ≤ supx(b),  
• a SW b  ⇔   supx(a) ≤ infx(b),  supy(a) ≤ infy(b),  
• a W b   ⇔   supx(a) ≤ infx(b),  infy(b) ≤ infy(a),  supy(a) ≤ supy(b),  
• a NW b  ⇔   supx(a) ≤ infx(b),  supy(b) ≤ infy(a),  
• a N b   ⇔   supy(b) ≤ infy(a),  infx(b) ≤ infx(a),  supx(a) ≤ supx(b),  
• a NE b  ⇔   supx(b) ≤ infx(a),  supy(b) ≤ infy(a),  
• a E b   ⇔   supx(b) ≤ infx(a),  infy(b) ≤ infy(a),  supy(a) ≤ supy(b),  
• a SE b  ⇔   supx(b) ≤ infx(a),  supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

can still hold between x and z once we know:

• supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

1. Checking x SW z

x SW z means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

We already know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≥ infx(z) from y B z, so supx(x) ≤ infx(z) can be achieved by placing x even farther left if desired.  
Similarly, supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≥ infy(z) allow supy(x) ≤ infy(z) if x is placed far enough below.  
Hence x SW z is possible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Checking x W z

x W z means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z)     and  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

The first part, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), is again a stronger requirement (farther left) than supx(x) ≤ infx(y).  But we can place x even farther left so that this holds.  
Meanwhile, requiring infy(x) ≥ infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) says x’s bounding box is vertically inside z’s.  Since y is inside z, there is no contradiction in letting x also fit vertically within z’s bounds (even though x is left of y).  
Hence x W z can also occur.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Checking x S z

x S z means  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(z)     and  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

We already know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≥ infy(z).  If we place x even lower so that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), that condition is satisfied.  
Also, “horizontally inside z” means infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z); that poses no contradiction because z can be large enough to contain both y and (horizontally) the region x (even though x sits below y).  
Thus x S z is achievable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Checking x B z

x B z means  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(z),  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

In words, x’s bounding rectangle is completely inside z’s.  Even though x is SW of y, that merely says x’s box is to the left and below y’s box, not that it lies outside z’s box.  Because y’s box is contained in z, and z can be large, x can still be wholly contained in z (for instance, place x “under and left of y” but still inside the bigger bounding box of z).  
Hence x B z is possible.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Why the others (N, NE, E, SE, NW) fail

Intuitively, x SW y already forces x left and below y; y is inside z, so typically y’s bounding box sits somewhere in the interior of z’s.  That setup precludes x from being to the right (E, NE, SE) or above (N, NW) of z as a whole.  A quick check of the inequalities in those definitions shows contradictions (for example, x NE z would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x), i.e. z is left of x, which cannot happen when x is already left of y which is inside z).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Conclusion

All combined, the only consistent possibilities for the relation between x and z, given x SW y and y B z, are:

   SW,  W,  S,  or  B.
