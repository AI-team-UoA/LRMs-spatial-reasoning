PROMPT: Let E and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one sees that “x E y” means

• supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and  
• supy(x) ≤ supy(y),

while “y B z” means

• infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
• supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
• supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combining these shows:

1) Since supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and y is itself inside z’s bounding box (so supx(y) ≤ supx(z)), there is no obstruction to x also fitting inside z’s bounding box in the x‐direction. In particular, one can have infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), making x B z possible.

2) It is also possible that z’s bounding box does not extend any farther in the x‐direction than y’s does, so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  In that case, one gets x E z.

All other cardinal‐direction placements of x relative to z fail when one checks the relative inequalities (because x is already “to the right” of y and also vertically contained in y, which in turn lies inside z).  Consequently, the only possible relations between x and z under “x E y” and “y B z” are:

E or B.
