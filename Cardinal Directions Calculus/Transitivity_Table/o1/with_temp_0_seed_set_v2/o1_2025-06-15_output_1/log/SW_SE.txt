PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x SW y” means

• supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y),

and “y SE z” means

• supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

In particular, supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so x lies strictly below z in the vertical direction (since supy(x) ≤ infy(z)). In the horizontal direction, however, the constraints only tell us that both x and z lie to the left of (or just touching) y (because supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)) but do not fix whether x is to the left or to the right of z, nor do they force x to lie fully under z in the x-dimension.

Consequently, looking at the possible cardinal‐direction definitions relative to z, the only feasible ways that x can lie “below” z (i.e., satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) are:

• x S z (they overlap in x, but x is below z),  
• x SW z (x is below and strictly to the left of z),  
• x SE z (x is below and strictly to the right of z).

No other relation (N, NE, NW, W, E, B) is compatible with x being strictly below z without further overlap/containment constraints. Thus the possible relations between x and z are

S, SW, or SE.
