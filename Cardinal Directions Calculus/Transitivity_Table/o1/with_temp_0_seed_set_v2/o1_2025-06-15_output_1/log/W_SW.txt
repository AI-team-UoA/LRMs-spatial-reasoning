PROMPT: Let W and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, saying  
• x W y means  
  1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
  2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
  3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

• y SW z means  
  4) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
  5) supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Chain these inequalities:

• From (1) and (4), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
  Hence supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
  meaning x is strictly to the left of z.  

• From (3) and (5), we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
  Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
  meaning x is strictly below z.  

Thus x is strictly left and strictly below z, which is precisely the definition of  
x SW z.  

No other cardinal‐direction definition can be satisfied under these constraints, so the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
