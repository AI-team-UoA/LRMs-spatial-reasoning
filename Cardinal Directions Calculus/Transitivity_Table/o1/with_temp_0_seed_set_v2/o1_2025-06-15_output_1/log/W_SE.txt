PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, x W y means

(1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
(2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and  
(3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

Also, y SE z means

(4) supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and  
(5) supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

From (3) and (5), we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so

supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hence, x is entirely below z (no vertical overlap).  In cardinal‐direction terms, when one region is entirely below another, the possible relations are precisely S, SW, or SE, depending on whether x sits directly underneath, underneath–and‐to‐the‐west, or underneath–and‐to‐the‐east of z.  Since we do not have enough information to pin down the horizontal positioning of x relative to z, all three are possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, or SE.
