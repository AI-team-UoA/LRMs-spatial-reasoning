PROMPT: Let N and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key is to translate  
• x N y  ⇒  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
• y N z  ⇒  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  

into constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z.  Chaining these inequalities shows:

1) Vertical ordering:  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   Hence supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so the top edge of z is at or below the bottom edge of x.  
   This places x strictly “above” z.  

2) Horizontal ordering:  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  
   Hence infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z),  
   so the bounding box of x is horizontally within that of z.  

Putting these together against the definitions of the nine relations rules out all but “x N z.”  In particular, “N” requires exactly:

• supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
• supx(x) ≤ supx(z),

all of which hold.  No other cardinal relation can be satisfied once x is already “north” of y and y is “north” of z.  Therefore, the only possible relation is:

x N z.
