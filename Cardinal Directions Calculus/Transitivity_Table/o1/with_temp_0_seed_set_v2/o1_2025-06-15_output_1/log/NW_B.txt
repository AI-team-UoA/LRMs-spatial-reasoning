PROMPT: Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one can show by explicit “bounding‐box” arguments (or by concrete examples) that when x is NW of y and y is B of z, then x can only be

• inside z (x B z),  
• strictly west of z (x W z),  
• strictly northwest of z (x NW z), or  
• strictly north of z (x N z).

All other directions (S, SE, E, NE, SW) can be ruled out by combining the two given constraints:

1)  x NW y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   (x is left of y and above y.)

2)  y B z    ⇒  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
   (y’s bounding box is contained in z’s.)

Depending on whether (and how) x’s bounding box also fits within or around z’s, one finds exactly these four possibilities for x relative to z:  B, W, NW, or N.
