PROMPT: Let E and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x E y” says that in the x-dimension, x lies strictly to the east of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)), while in the y-dimension, x is vertically contained in y’s bounding box (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)). Likewise, “y W z” says that y lies strictly to the west of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and y is vertically contained in z’s bounding box (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

Putting these together forces

• in the y-dimension: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  
  so x must also be vertically contained in z.  

• in the x-dimension, we only know supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), but there is no direct comparison between x and z.  

Checking each possible direction of x relative to z against these constraints shows that x can be:  
• B z (i.e., bounding-box contained in z),  
• W z (strictly west of z, with vertical containment),  
• or E z (strictly east of z, with vertical containment).  

All other directions (N, S, NE, NW, SE, SW) fail one or more of the required inequalities. Hence, the possible relations between x and z are B, W, or E.
