PROMPT: Let NE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given constraints,

•  x NE y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
•  y NW z  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),

one can chain the vertical inequalities to see that  
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
so in particular supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

This forces z to lie strictly below x.  However, there is no constraint fixing whether x is to the left, right, or “within” z horizontally.  Consequently, the only possible cardinal directions of x relative to z, compatible with x being strictly above z, are:

•  N  (if, roughly, x is “directly above” z),  
•  NE (if x is both above and to the right of z),  
•  NW (if x is both above and to the left of z).

Hence the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, or NW.
