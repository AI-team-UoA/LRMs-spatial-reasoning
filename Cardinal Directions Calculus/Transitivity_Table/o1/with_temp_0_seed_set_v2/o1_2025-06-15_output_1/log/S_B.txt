PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, the key observations are:

•  x S y means (1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and (2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
  In words, x is entirely south of y but is horizontally within y’s bounding box.  

•  y B z means y’s bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box:  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

We want all possible relations x ? z consistent with x S y and y B z.  

1)  Could x be S of z?  
   For x S z we require supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and x be horizontally within z.  
   -  We already know supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
   -  Since infy(z) ≤ infy(y), it is possible (though not guaranteed) that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
   -  Horizontally, because infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
      x is “within” z in the x-dimension.  
   Hence if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) also holds, then x S z.

2)  Could x be B of z?  
   For x B z we require x’s bounding box to be contained in z’s bounding box, i.e.  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
   Although x is south of y, it can still lie entirely within z’s (larger) bounding box, in which case x B z is satisfied.  

3)  Other directions (W, E, N, NW, NE, SE, SW) all fail under these constraints, essentially because  
   -  “y B z” places y (and hence the x-range of y, and therefore the x-range of x) inside z’s x-range.  
   -  “x S y” places x strictly or at most tangent below y, so x’s y-range either remains inside z’s y-range or drops below z (the “S” of z case).  

Consequently, the only viable relations of x to z, given x S y and y B z, are:

•  x S z  
•  x B z.
