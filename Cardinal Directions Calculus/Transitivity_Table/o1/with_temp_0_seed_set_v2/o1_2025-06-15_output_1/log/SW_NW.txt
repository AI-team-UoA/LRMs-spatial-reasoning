PROMPT: Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given relations

• x SW y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y NW z  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),

one can chain the x-coordinates to show that supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  Hence x must lie to the “left” of z (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).

For the y-coordinates, we only know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) but have no direct comparison between supy(x) and supy(z).  Consequently, x could lie below z (making x SW z), above z (x NW z), or with overlapping y-bounds but still to the left (x W z).  

Thus, the possible relations of x to z, under those premises, are exactly  
W, NW, or SW.
