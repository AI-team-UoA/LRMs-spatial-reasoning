PROMPT: Let S and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x S y” forces x entirely below y (and horizontally within y’s bounding‐box), while “y SE z” forces y entirely below and to the right of z.  Combining these implies x is also entirely below and to the right of z, which is exactly “x SE z.”  Thus the only possible relation of x to z under those conditions is SE.
