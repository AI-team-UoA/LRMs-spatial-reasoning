PROMPT: Let NW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the fact that x is NW of y tells us two things:  
• x is strictly to the left of y in bounding‐box terms (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)),  
• and x is strictly above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  

Similarly, y being NE of z tells us:  
• y is strictly to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y)),  
• and y is strictly above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  

Chaining these vertically, z is below y and y is below x; hence x is strictly above z.  In these cardinal‐direction definitions, a region “strictly above” another can be “N” (if it is also horizontally contained), “NW” (if it is also strictly to the left), or “NE” (if it is also strictly to the right).  Since we do not have enough information to decide how x and z compare horizontally, all three possibilities remain.  

Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are  
NW, N, or NE.
