PROMPT: Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x W y” means that x’s bounding box is strictly to the left of y’s (i.e., supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)) and, vertically, x’s bounding box is contained in y’s (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
Similarly, “y E z” means that y’s bounding box is strictly to the right of z’s (supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y)) and, vertically, y’s bounding box is contained in z’s (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

Combining these vertical containments shows that x’s bounding box is contained in z’s in the vertical dimension:  
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Hence, whenever we compare x and z, their y‐intervals nest as  
infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

What remains undetermined is how x’s and z’s bounding boxes lie relative to each other in the x‐dimension, since both are merely “to the left of y,” but with no direct constraint relating x and z.  Consequently, three scenarios can happen:

1. x can be entirely contained in z in both x and y dimensions (so x B z).  
2. x can lie strictly to the left of z (so x W z).  
3. x can lie strictly to the right of z (so x E z).  

All other relations (N, S, NW, NE, SW, SE) require vertical strictness that cannot occur here (because x is vertically contained within z).  

Therefore, the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W, E, or B.
