PROMPT: Let NE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given constraints

• x NE of y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• y S of z   ⇒  supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  and  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),

one can check each of the nine possible directions of x relative to z against these bounding‐box inequalities.  The only ones that cannot occur are those requiring x to lie strictly to the left of z (namely W, NW, and SW), because y is already “horizontally inside” z and x sits still farther to the right of y.  All other directions turn out to be compatible with the given constraints.  Concretely, the following six are possible:

• B  (x is inside z’s bounding box),  
• S  (x is strictly south of z),  
• SE,  
• E,  
• NE,  
• N.

Thus the possible relations between x and z are any of B, S, SE, E, NE, or N.
