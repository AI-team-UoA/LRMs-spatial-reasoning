PROMPT: Let B and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x B y” means that x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box, and “y W z” means that y’s bounding box is strictly to the left of z’s bounding box (with vertical containment).  Symbolically:

•  x B y  ⇒  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

•  y W z  ⇒  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combining these:

1.  From  x B y  we have  supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
    From  y W z  we have  supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
    Hence  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
    So  supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

2.  In the vertical direction, x is contained in y and y is contained in z, so  
    infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Now check whether x can be “W” of z.  By definition,  
x W z  ⇔  supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

•  We already have  supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  from (1).  
•  We also know  infy(z) ≤ infy(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(z)  from (2).  

These exactly match the conditions for x W z, so x W z is consistent with x B y and y W z.

All other cardinal‐direction possibilities fail because, in particular, x’s bounding box ends strictly to the left of z’s (so x cannot be inside z horizontally, nor can x lie above/below z, and so on).  

Hence, the only possible relation between x and z is:  
W.
