PROMPT: Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x B y” means x’s bounding box is contained within y’s bounding box in both x and y directions, and “y E z” means y’s bounding box is strictly to the right (east) of z’s bounding box (with vertical containment). Concretely:

1) x B y implies:  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

2) y E z implies:  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Because x is contained in y’s bounding box (from 1)), and y is to the east of z (from 2)), one deduces:

• In the x-direction, from supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x’s box is strictly to the right of (or just touching) z’s box.  
• In the y-direction, from infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), we see x’s box is vertically contained within z’s box.  

Checking each cardinal-direction definition against these constraints shows all but “x E z” fail (they require contradictions in x- or y-bounds). The only consistent relation is:

x E z.

Thus, if x is B of y and y is E of z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is E.
