PROMPT: Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, the key fact is that “x E y” forces x to lie strictly to the right of y in the x-dimension, while “y S z” forces y to lie strictly below z in the y-dimension.  Tracing these inequalities through, one finds that x also ends up strictly below z (because x is below y and y is below z), but there is no forced ordering between x and z in the x-dimension.  

Concretely:

• “x E y” ⇒ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x).  
• “y S z” ⇒ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).

Since x lies below y and y lies below z, one obtains supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z), so x is definitely below z.  However, no constraint forces x to be left, right, or horizontally contained with respect to z.  Consequently, x can be directly south of z (S), south‐west (SW), or south‐east (SE), depending on whether x’s bounding box sits inside, to the left of, or to the right of z’s bounding box in the x‐dimension.  

Hence, the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z are:  
S, SW, or SE.
