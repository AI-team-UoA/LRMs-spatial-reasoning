PROMPT: Let N and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Answer:  x can only be N, S, or B relative to z.

Explanation (concise):

1)  From x N y we have:  
   – supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (i.e., y lies below x),  
   – infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  (i.e., x is horizontally within y).

2)  From y S z we have:  
   – supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  (i.e., y lies below z),  
   – infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  (i.e., y is horizontally within z).

3)  Combining the horizontal constraints shows that x is also horizontally within z:
   – infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

4)  Vertically, however, we only know that y is below both x and z, and there is no forced ordering between the vertical extents of x and z.  Consequently the following scenarios are all possible:

   • x B z:  x’s bounding box is entirely contained in z’s bounding box.  
   • x N z:  x lies above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) while still horizontally within z.  
   • x S z:  x lies below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) while still horizontally within z.

All other direction relations (E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) require x to lie strictly to the left or right of z, which fails because x is horizontally contained in z. Hence N, S, or B are the only possibilities.
