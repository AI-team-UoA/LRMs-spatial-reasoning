PROMPT: Let NW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

All nine relations remain possible.  In effect, knowing that x is NW of y (x is left and above y) and that y is S of z (y is strictly below z) does not rule out any particular way that x can sit relative to z.  One can construct bounding‚Äêbox examples that realize each of the nine relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) for x with respect to z.
