PROMPT: Let NW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities it follows that x must lie strictly to the left of z (since x NW y forces x to lie left of y, and y SW z forces y to lie left of z).  Consequently, x cannot be in any “eastern” relation (E, NE, SE) or one that requires horizontal overlap (N, S).  

What remains is to check whether x can be NW, W, SW, or B with respect to z.  One finds that each of these is realizable by choosing suitable vertical placements and/or letting z’s bounding box be sufficiently large to contain x.  In short, the possible relations are exactly  
NW, W, SW, or B.
