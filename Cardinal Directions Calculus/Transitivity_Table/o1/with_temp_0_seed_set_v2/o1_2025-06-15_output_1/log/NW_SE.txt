PROMPT: Let NW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

All nine relations remain possible.  The conditions “x NW y” and “y SE z” merely force both x and z to lie to the northwest of y, but do not constrain how x and z lie relative to each other.  Consequently, any of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B can still hold between x and z.
