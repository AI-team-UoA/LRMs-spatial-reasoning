PROMPT: Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key observations are:  
•  “x W y” implies that x is strictly to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)), and x’s bounding box lies vertically within y’s (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
•  “y N z” implies that y is strictly below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)), and y’s bounding box lies horizontally within z’s (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).  

From x W y and y N z, we can chain the vertical information:

   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  

so the entire bounding box of x is strictly below that of z.  Hence, in the “cardinal‐direction” sense, x must be somewhere “south” of z.  The remaining question is how x compares horizontally with z:

•  If x’s bounding box also lies strictly to the left of z’s (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), then x is SW of z.  
•  If x’s bounding box is horizontally contained in that of z (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then x is S of z.  

No other configurations (E, SE, W, NW, N, NE, or B) can hold once one checks the detailed bounding‐box requirements and the fact that x is entirely below z.  Consequently, the only possible relations between x and z in this scenario are:

S or SW.
