PROMPT: Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees at once that having “x SE y” forces x to lie strictly to the right and strictly below y, while “y W z” forces y to lie strictly to the left of z and (vertically) be contained within z.  The key observation is that these conditions never impose that x be above z, because x is already below y (which itself sits inside z).  

A convenient way to check which relations x ? z can hold is to attempt each cardinal‐direction definition in turn and see whether one can place x and z so as to satisfy

• supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y)    (from  x SE y),  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)   (from  y W z).

One thus finds:

• N, NE, NW require x to be strictly above z (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), which cannot happen since x is already below y and y is inside z.  
• All of S, SE, E, W, SW, and B can be realized by placing x appropriately below or inside z (with x possibly to the left/right or contained).  

Hence the only possible relations of x to z under “x SE y” and “y W z” are:  
S, SE, E, W, SW, or B.
