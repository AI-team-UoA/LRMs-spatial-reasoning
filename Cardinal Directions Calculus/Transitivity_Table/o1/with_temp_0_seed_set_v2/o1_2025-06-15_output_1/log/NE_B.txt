PROMPT: Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one can check consistency of each possible relation of x to z by combining

•  x NE y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
•  y B  z  ⇒  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  and  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Trying each of the nine relations of x to z in turn, one finds:

•  S, SW, W, NW, SE all lead to contradictions once one imposes supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (i.e., x is north of y), or supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y), together with y being inside the bounding box of z.  
•  B (“x B z”) is possible: if z is large enough, it can contain both y and x in its bounding box.  
•  N (“x N z”) is possible: if z (with y inside it) lies entirely below x, then supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
•  NE (“x NE z”) is possible: if z lies below and to the left, then supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
•  E (“x E z”) is possible: if x and y are within the vertical extent of z but to its right, then supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence the only consistent relations of x to z, given that x is NE of y and y is B of z, are  
B, N, NE, or E.
