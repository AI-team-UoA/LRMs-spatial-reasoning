PROMPT: Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given relations,

• x NE y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
• y SE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),

one can chain the x‑coordinates:

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),

thus supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  This tells us that z’s bounding box is to the left of x’s bounding box (so x is to the “east” of z), but the inequalities give us no definite constraint on whether x is above, below, or overlaps z vertically.  Consequently, x may be purely east (E), northeast (NE), or southeast (SE) of z.  No other cardinal relations are forced by those inequalities. Thus, the possible relations are:

• x E z  
• x NE z  
• x SE z.
