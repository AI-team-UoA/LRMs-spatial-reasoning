PROMPT: Let E and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given relations

• x E y  ⇔  supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  and  supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• y NW z ⇔  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y),

one can deduce the following key facts:

1) Horizontal ordering:  
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y),  
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (z is to the right of y),  
   hence y is strictly to the left of both x and z, but there is no direct constraint between x and z in the horizontal direction.  In particular, x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or even horizontally contained within z’s bounding box (or vice versa), as long as both lie to the right of y.

2) Vertical ordering:  
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   Putting these together yields  
     supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   In other words, z is strictly below y, and x is vertically within or above y.  Consequently, z is strictly below x (since the top of z is at or below infy(x), while the bottom of x is at infy(x) or higher).

Because x is strictly above z, x cannot be S, SW, or SE of z (those require x to be below z).  Nor can x be “E of z” or “W of z,” because those relations require one bounding box to fit vertically within the other, whereas here z is completely below x.  Finally, neither can x or z bound the other (B) because there is no vertical overlap (one region’s top is below the other region’s bottom).

What remains possible, given that x is above z, is that x may be aligned anywhere horizontally relative to z:

• x N z  if horizontally x is contained in z (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  
• x NE z if x is above and to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  
• x NW z if x is above and to the left of z  (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  

Hence, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations from x to z, under x E y and y NW z, are:

N, NE, or NW.
