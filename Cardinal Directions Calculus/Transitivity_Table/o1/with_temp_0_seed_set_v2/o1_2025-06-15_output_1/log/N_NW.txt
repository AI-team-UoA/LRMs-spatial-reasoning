PROMPT: Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, the two key chains of inequalities forced by  
 • x N y  ⇒  supy(y) ≤ infy(x) , infx(y) ≤ infx(x) , supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
 • y NW z ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(z) , supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  

together imply, in particular:

1) Vertical chain:  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   So z is strictly below y, which is strictly below x.  

2) Horizontal chain:  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
   So x is strictly to the left of z.  

Hence, relative to z, region x sits above and to the left, i.e., x NW z.  

Trying to satisfy any other of the nine relations runs into contradictions with these same chains.  Thus, the only possible relation between x and z under “x N y and y NW z” is  
NW.
