PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, the key observations are:

• “x W y” means  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
  infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).

• “y B z” means  
  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z),  
  infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Because y’s bounding box is contained in z’s, we get in particular (vertically)  
  infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
  supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z),
so x’s bounding box is also vertically contained in z’s.  

Horizontally, however, we only know  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)  
and  
  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).
There is no forced ordering between supₓ(x) and infₓ(z), nor between infₓ(x) and infₓ(z). In other words:

• If infₓ(z) happens to be large enough (e.g. infₓ(z) = infₓ(y)), then supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z) can hold, making x lie strictly to the west of z (i.e. x W z).

• If instead infₓ(x) ≥ infₓ(z) (and we already know supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z) and the same vertical containment holds), then x’s bounding box is fully inside z’s bounding box (i.e. x B z).

• In other intermediate cases (where x partly overlaps z’s bounding box but is not fully contained and not strictly to the left), none of the nine “pure” relations apply.

Consequently, among the listed cardinal‐direction relations {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}, the only ones that can occur between x and z (consistent with x W y and y B z) are  
W or B.
