PROMPT: Let B and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, x B y means x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box; y S z means y lies strictly below z in the vertical direction (and is horizontally contained).  Concretely:  
• x B y ⇒ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• y S z ⇒ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Since x’s box is contained in y’s, and y S z forces supy(y) ≤ infy(z), it follows that supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  Also horizontally,  
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Putting these together, the definition of x S z (“x is south of z”) is exactly met, namely  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
• infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

No other cardinal‐direction relation can hold (for instance, x B z would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which fails because y is strictly below z), so the only possible relation is  

x S z.
