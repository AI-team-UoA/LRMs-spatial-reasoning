PROMPT: Let NE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

All nine relations are possible.  One can see this by noting that “x NE y” merely says x’s box lies strictly up‐and‐right from y’s box, and “y SW z” says y’s box lies strictly down‐and‐left from z’s box.  Because those two facts only pin down y relative to x and y relative to z, there is enough freedom to place x anywhere around z.  In particular, by choosing the bounding‐box sizes appropriately, one can arrange examples in which x and z satisfy any of N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B.
