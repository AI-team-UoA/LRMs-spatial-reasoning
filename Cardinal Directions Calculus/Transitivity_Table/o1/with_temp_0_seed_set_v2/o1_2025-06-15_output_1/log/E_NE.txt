PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x E y” means  
1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

Also, “y NE z” means  
4) supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
5) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Chain (4) with (1):  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Chain (5) with (2):  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
Hence supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

The condition “x NE z” requires exactly  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
which is precisely what follows from the two chains above.  No other cardinal‐direction definition is satisfied by these inequalities.  Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.
