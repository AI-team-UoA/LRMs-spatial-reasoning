PROMPT: Let W and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, x W y means  
• x is strictly to the left of y in the x‑direction: supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• and x’s bounding box is “vertically contained” in y’s bounding box: infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  

Meanwhile, y S z means  
• y is strictly below z in the y‑direction: supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
• and y’s bounding box is “horizontally contained” in z’s bounding box: infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).

Putting these together, one sees that:

• In the y‑direction, x is also strictly below z.  
  Indeed, x lies between infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x), which in turn lies below supᵧ(y).  
  Since supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z), then supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).  
  Hence x is below z.  

• In the x‑direction, two main situations can occur:  
  1) x may also lie strictly to the left of z (i.e., supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)),  
  2) or x may lie within z's bounding box horizontally (infx(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z)).  

By the definitions of the cardinal directions:

• If x is strictly left of z and also below z, then x SW z.  
• If x is below z but horizontally “inside” z’s bounding box, then x S z.

No other relation is possible under these assumptions (for example, “B” would require x to be enclosed by z in both directions, which cannot happen if x is strictly below z).  

Therefore, the only possible relations between x and z are S or SW.
