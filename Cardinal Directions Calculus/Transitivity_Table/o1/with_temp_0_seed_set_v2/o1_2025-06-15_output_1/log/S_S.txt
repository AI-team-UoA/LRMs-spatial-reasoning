PROMPT: Let S and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, x S y means:

1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Similarly, y S z means:

1) supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
2) infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
3) supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Combining these:

• Because supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), it follows that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
• Because infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
• Because supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), it follows that supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  

Those three bullet points are precisely the conditions needed for x S z (that is, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  

No other cardinal‐direction condition can be satisfied under these same chaining constraints (for instance, to be SW, one would need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we have infx(z) ≤ infx(x), etc.).  

Hence, if x is S of y and y is S of z, then the only possible relation of x to z is also S.
