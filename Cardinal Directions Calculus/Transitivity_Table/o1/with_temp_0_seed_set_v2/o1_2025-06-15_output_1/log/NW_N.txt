PROMPT: Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x NW y” means  
1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and  
2) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  

and “y N z” means  
3) supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
4) infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and  
5) supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

From (2) and (3) we can chain supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) to conclude  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
Hence, z’s bounding‐box top sits at or below x’s bounding‐box bottom, so x is “north” of z in the vertical sense.  

What remains is the horizontal placement of x relative to z.  Because neither set of inequalities (1) and (4), (5) fixes whether x’s bounding‐box lies to the left, inside, or to the right of z’s bounding‐box, x can be NW, N, or NE of z.  

Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are N, NW, or NE.
