PROMPT: Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

All nine are possible.  In other words, for each of the nine cardinal‐direction relations in  
{N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B}, one can construct an example of regions x, y, z ∈ REG  
satisfying  
• x SW y,  
• y NE z,  
and yet x stands in that chosen relation to z.  

A quick way to see this is by placing y “far to the northeast,” so that both x and z lie well southwest of y.  One then has considerable freedom to position x and z relative to each other (e.g., one can make x enclose z, or z enclose x, or put x below z, to the left of z, etc.).  With suitable choices of bounding boxes, one can realize each of the nine directions x might bear to z.
