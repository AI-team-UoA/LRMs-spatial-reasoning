PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can deduce two key facts:

•  “x N y” implies (i) y lies entirely below x (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and (ii) x’s bounding box is horizontally within y’s bounding box (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).  
•  “y SE z” implies (i) y lies entirely to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y)) and (ii) y lies entirely below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).  

Putting these together:

1) Since x is horizontally inside y and y is strictly to the right of z, it follows that x is strictly to the right of z as well.  
   In bounding‐box terms: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   Hence there is no overlap in x‐coordinates; x is to the east of z.

2) Vertically, there is no direct constraint forcing x to lie entirely above, entirely below, or be contained within z’s bounding box—only that y is below both x and z.  
   Thus x could be above z (making x NE of z), below z (making x SE of z), or vertically contained (making x E of z).

Consequently, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations of x with respect to z, given “x N y” and “y SE z,” are:  
• NE  
• E  
• SE
