PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x N y” means horizontally x is within y’s bounding box, and vertically x is completely above y.  Concretely:

• x N y ⇔ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

Similarly, “y B z” means y’s bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box:

• y B z ⇔ infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Putting these together forces x to lie horizontally inside z’s bounding box (because x is horizontally inside y, and y is in turn inside z).  Vertically, x could still be “inside” z (if supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) or could lie entirely above z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  Those two scenarios correspond to x B z (the inside case) or x N z (the above case).  No other cardinal‐direction relation is possible given these constraints.  

Hence, the only possible relations between x and z are B or N.
