PROMPT: Let SE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Answer:  All nine of them are possible (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B).  

Explanation (sketch):  
From “x SE y” we only know that x’s bounding box lies to the right (infx(x) ≥ supx(y)) and below (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) of y’s bounding box.  
From “y NW z” we only know that y’s bounding box lies to the left (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and above (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)) of z’s bounding box.  

Nothing in those two constraints forces a particular relative positioning of x with respect to z.  By suitably choosing the sizes and placements of x and z (while keeping x SE of y and y NW of z), one can realize each of the nine cardinal‐direction relations (including B) between x and z.
