PROMPT: Let B and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the bounding‐box definitions, the key inequalities are:

•  x B y  means  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

•  y NE z  means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Combining them:

1.  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

2.  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
   Hence supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

By the definition of the NE relation, for x NE z one needs  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
which is exactly what the combined inequalities show.  

Checking all other cardinal directions against those same bounds leads to contradictions (for instance, to be “x E z,” one would need supy(x) ≤ supy(z), but actually supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), etc.).  Consequently, the only possible relation is  

x NE z.
