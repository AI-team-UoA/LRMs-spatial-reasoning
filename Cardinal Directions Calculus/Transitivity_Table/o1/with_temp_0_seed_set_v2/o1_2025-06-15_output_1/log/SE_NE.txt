PROMPT: Let SE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can check first what “x SE y” and “y NE z” entail in terms of bounding‐box coordinates:

1) x SE y means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
   In words, x lies strictly to the right of y (its min x is to the right of y’s max x) and x lies strictly below y (its max y is below y’s min y).

2) y NE z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
   So y is strictly to the right of z and strictly above z.

From (1), x is to the right of y; from (2), y is to the right of z.  Consequently, chaining those x‐coordinates gives

   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),

so in particular

   supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence, x is to the right of z (in bounding‐box terms).  However, from the y‐coordinate inequalities we only know that both x and z lie below y, which does not force any particular ordering between x and z along the vertical axis.  In other words, x could be above z, below z, or “level” enough so that x’s y‐bounds fit wholly inside (or coincide with) z’s y‐bounds.  

Recalling the definitions for a NE b, a SE b, and a E b (all of which require a to be to the right of b), one sees that all three are consistent with supx(z) ≤ infx(x), depending on the relative positions of x and z in the y‐direction:

• x NE z requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)  (x above and to the right).  
• x E  z requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)  (x directly to the right, “within” z vertically).  
• x SE z requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  (x below and to the right).

No other cardinal‐direction definitions are compatible with always having supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  Therefore, the only possible directions of x relative to z are:  

NE, E, or SE.
