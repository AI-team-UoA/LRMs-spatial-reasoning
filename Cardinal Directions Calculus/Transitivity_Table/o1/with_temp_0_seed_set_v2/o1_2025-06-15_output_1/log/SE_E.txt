PROMPT: Let SE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x SE y” yields  
(1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)     and     (2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
while “y E z” yields  
(3) supx(z) ≤ infx(y),    (4) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),    (5) supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Combining (1) and (3) with the fact infx(y) ≤ supx(y), one obtains  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence, relative to z, region x must lie strictly to the east (in bounding‐box terms) of z.  In the list of possible relations (E, NE, SE, …), the only ones that require “supx(z) ≤ infx(x)” are E, NE, and SE.  No further information fixes whether x’s bounding box is above, below, or overlapping in the y‐direction with respect to z, so the only possible relations between x and z are:  

E, NE, or SE.
