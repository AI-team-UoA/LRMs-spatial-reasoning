PROMPT: Let B and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
• x B y means x’s bounding box is contained in y’s bounding box; formally,  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

• y NW z means that y lies northwest of z; formally,  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Combining these:

1) x B y implies  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

2) y NW z implies  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Because supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

And because supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Hence, from x’s perspective with respect to z, the two key inequalities are  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

By definition of the NW relation (“a NW b ⇔ supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)”), setting a = x and b = z matches exactly those two inequalities.  Therefore,

x NW z

is the only consistent possibility under these constraints.
