PROMPT: Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions one can show that the only impossible cases are those requiring x to lie entirely below z (i.e., S, SW, or SE).  In all of those “south”‐type relations, one would need

supy(x) ≤ infy(z),

but from x NW y and y E z one deduces

in fy(z) ≤ in fy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ in fy(x) ≤ supy(x),

so supy(x) cannot be less than or equal to in fy(z) unless all regions collapse (which they do not, being homeomorphic to disks).  By similar reasoning, none of the remaining inequalities forces any contradiction for B, W, NW, N, NE, or E.  Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are exactly

{ B, W, NW, N, NE, E }.
