PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

If x is N of y, then horizontally x lies within y’s bounding box, and vertically x lies entirely above y.  
Formally (using the definitions in your question),  
• x N y ⇒ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

If y is E of z, then vertically y lies within z’s bounding box, and horizontally y lies entirely to the right of z.  
Formally,  
• y E z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Combining these implies in particular that  
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence x’s bounding box starts at or to the right of supx(z).  In addition, because y’s bounding box is vertically within z’s bounding box, x (which is above y) can either remain within z’s bounding box vertically or lie wholly above it.  Concretely, the only two ways x can be placed relative to z, given that x’s bounding box is to the right of z’s bounding box, are:

• E (east) of z, provided x also remains within z’s bounding box vertically.  
• NE (north‐east) of z, if x also lies entirely above z’s bounding box vertically.  

No other cardinal relation is consistent with “x N y” and “y E z.” Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: E or NE.
