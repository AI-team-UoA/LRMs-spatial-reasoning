PROMPT: Let S and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x S y” (x is South of y) and “y N z” (y is North of z) each merely force both x and z to lie below y’s bounding‐box in the vertical dimension; neither imposes any direct constraint on how x and z must lie relative to one another (they could be side by side, one enclosing the other, etc.).  

Consequently, all nine of the listed cardinal‐direction relations between x and z (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) can be realized by suitable placements of x and z (both still below y). Hence every one of those nine relations is possible.
