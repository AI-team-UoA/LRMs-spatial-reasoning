PROMPT: Let SE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one can show that once x is southeast of y and y is “bounded” by z (i.e., y B z), the region x can end up either still inside z’s bounding‐box or else wholly outside it to the south, east, or southeast.  Concretely:

•  x SE y tells us  
   1)  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)    (x is to the right of y),  
   2)  supy(x) ≤ infy(y)    (x is below y).  

•  y B z tells us that y’s bounding‐box is contained in z’s, i.e.  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Because y lies completely inside z, yet x lies to the right/below y, one sees that x may or may not remain inside z’s bounding‐box.  Checking each of the nine relations shows that exactly the following four can occur:

1)  x B z.  This can happen if z is “big enough” in both x and y directions to enclose x as well as y.  
2)  x S z.  This occurs if x’s top is still below z’s bottom (so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), but horizontally x is within z’s left/right bounds.  
3)  x E z.  This occurs if x’s left is still to the right of z’s right (so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), but vertically x lies within z’s top/bottom.  
4)  x SE z.  This occurs if x is both strictly below (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) and strictly to the right (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) of z.

Hence the possible relations of x to z, given x SE y and y B z, are exactly  
B, S, E, or SE.
