PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given constraints,

•  x N y  ⇒  
   (1) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
   (2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and  
   (3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

•  y W z  ⇒  
   (4) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   (5) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   (6) supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From (3) and (4) together, we obtain  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
Thus x lies strictly to the left of z (i.e., no horizontal overlap).  

Regarding vertical placement, we know y is vertically within z [from (5) and (6)] and x is strictly above y [from (1)].  Because x is above y, and y is contained in z’s vertical span, x can either

• still remain inside z’s vertical bounding box (if z is “tall enough”), or  
• sit entirely above z (if z does not extend as far up as x).  

Checking the direction definitions:

• x NW z  means (i) supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we have) and (ii) supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  This can happen if z is not “tall enough” to reach x vertically, so that z’s top lies below x’s bottom.

• x W z   means (i) supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (again, already true) and (ii) infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  This can happen when x’s vertical bounding box is contained within z’s (z is “tall enough” to cover x in the vertical dimension).

No other cardinal directions can hold under these constraints (for instance, x SW z would require x below z, etc.).  

Hence, the only possible relations between x and z here are  
W or NW.
