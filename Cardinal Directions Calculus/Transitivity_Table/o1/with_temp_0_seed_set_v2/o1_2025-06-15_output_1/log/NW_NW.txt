PROMPT: Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that x NW y means  
  (1)  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)     and     (2)  supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
while y NW z means  
  (3)  supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)     and     (4)  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y).  

By chaining (1) and (3), we get  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)  
so  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z).  
Similarly, chaining (2) and (4) gives  
  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x)  
so  
  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x).  

Hence x satisfies exactly the NW inequalities with respect to z, namely  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)     and     supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x).  

Therefore, in all “generic” (nondegenerate) cases transitivity forces x to be NW of z.  

The only other possibility arises if x’s bounding box degenerates in the x‑direction so that supₓ(x) = infₓ(x).  In that special boundary‐case it can also happen that  
  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) = supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z)  
together with  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x).  
Those equalities satisfy the definition of x N z (since horizontally x’s bounding box is then “within” z’s).  

Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are either  
  NW  
or, in a degenerate boundary‐case,  
  N.
