PROMPT: Let SW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
• x SW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
• y W z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chain these horizontally first:  

supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  

Hence supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
This already tells us x is to the left of z in bounding‐box terms (i.e., x can only be W‐like or SW‐like relative to z).  

Next, note that vertically we know x is below y, i.e. supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but y’s bounding box is contained within z’s vertical extent (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  This does not fix x’s bounding box strictly above or below infy(z), so two scenarios can occur:

1) supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
   In this case, x is also below z, so we get x SW z.  

2) supy(x) > infy(z).  
   If moreover the bottom of x is still above (or equal to) infy(z) (which can happen depending on the shapes/sizes), then x can “fit” vertically inside z.  In that situation, the conditions for x W z can be satisfied.  

No other relations can hold (e.g., x cannot be N or B of z, etc.).  Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:

SW or W.
