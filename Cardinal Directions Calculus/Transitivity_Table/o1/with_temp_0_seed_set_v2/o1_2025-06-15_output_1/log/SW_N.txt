PROMPT: Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

All nine of the listed relations are consistent with “x SW y” and “y N z.”  In other words, knowing only that x is southwest of y and y is north of z does not fix how x must lie relative to z; one can arrange x and z so that any of N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B holds between them.
