PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x SW y” means  
(1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y),  
(2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  

and “y S z” means  
(3) supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
(4) infx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
(5) supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Combining (2) and (3) with the fact that infy(y) ≤ supy(y) for any region y, we get  
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  

so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  In other words, x must lie at or completely below z in the vertical direction.  

On the horizontal axis, however, (1) tells us only that supx(x) ≤ infx(y), and from (4) we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y); there is no forced ordering between supx(x) and infx(z).  Likewise, (5) only controls y’s and z’s bounding boxes, not directly how x compares to z horizontally.  

Hence, the only necessary vertical constraint is “x lies below z,” i.e. supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  Depending on how x’s bounding box sits horizontally compared with z, x can therefore be:  
• S of z, if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z),  
• SW of z, if supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
• SE of z, if supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

No other relation can hold because we already know x cannot lie above or contain/overlap z vertically.  Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are exactly  
S, SW, or SE.
