PROMPT: Let S and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one sees that x being S of y (i.e., x is entirely below y in the bounding‐box sense) enforces

1) supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y),

while y being W of z (i.e., y is entirely to the left of z) enforces

4) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
5) infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
6) supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From 3) and 4) together, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x’s bounding box lies strictly to the left of z’s bounding box.  In the given set of cardinal‐direction relations, placing x strictly to the left of z can only happen in one of three ways:

• x W z, if x’s box is also vertically contained in z’s box,  
• x NW z, if x’s box is above z’s box,  
• x SW z, if x’s box is below z’s box.

Hence the possible relations of x to z are precisely W, NW, or SW.
