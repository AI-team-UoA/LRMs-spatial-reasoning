PROMPT: Let S and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,  
•  x S y  ⇒  (supy(x) ≤ infy(y))  and  (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)),  
•  y E z  ⇒  (supx(z) ≤ infx(y))  and  (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

Putting these together shows, in particular, that  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).  

Hence, horizontally, x lies to the right of z (since z’s right‐most x‐value is no larger than x’s left‐most x‐value).  Vertically, however, x may or may not lie within z’s vertical extent.  

Checking the definitions of the possible relations a ? b for a = x and b = z:

•  x E z  requires  
   (1)  supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
   (2)  infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
   (3)  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
  The first is guaranteed by supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  If x’s vertical bounding box also sits inside z’s (conditions (2) and (3)), then x E z can hold.

•  x SE z  requires  
   (1)  supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
   (2)  supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
  The first again is guaranteed by supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  If x lies entirely below z (so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), then x SE z can hold.

All other relations fail because either they require x to be to the left of z (contradicted by supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) or to be above it, etc.  

Therefore, the only possible cardinal‐direction relations between x and z are E or SE.
