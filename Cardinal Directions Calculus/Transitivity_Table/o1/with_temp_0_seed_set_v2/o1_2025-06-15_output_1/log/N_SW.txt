PROMPT: Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key observations are:

•  x N y implies  
   –  supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
   –  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   –  supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

•  y SW z implies  
   –  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   –  supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Chain these together.  From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

Hence, x’s entire bounding box lies to the left of (or just touching) z’s bounding box horizontally.  Once x is to the left of z, the only cardinal‐direction relations (from the nine possible) that place one region strictly to the left of the other are W, NW, and SW:

•  x W z  requires  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
   supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

•  x NW z  requires  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

•  x SW z  requires  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

All other directions (N, S, E, NE, SE, B) would force either a horizontal overlap or a containment that contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  Consequently, the only possible relations between x and z are

W, NW, or SW.
