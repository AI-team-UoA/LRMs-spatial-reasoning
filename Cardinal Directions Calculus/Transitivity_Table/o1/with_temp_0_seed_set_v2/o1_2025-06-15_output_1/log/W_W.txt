PROMPT: Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x W y” means:

1) supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).

Similarly, “y W z” means:

4) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z),  
5) infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
6) supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Chaining these inequalities gives:

• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z),  
so supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z).  
• infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z),  
so infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Exactly those conditions mean “x W z,” namely  
1) supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
2) infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z).

All other cardinal‐direction definitions fail under these chained inequalities (for instance, S, N, NW, etc., require different vertical placements that contradict the above chains). Thus, if x is W of y and y is W of z, the only possible relation of x to z is W.
