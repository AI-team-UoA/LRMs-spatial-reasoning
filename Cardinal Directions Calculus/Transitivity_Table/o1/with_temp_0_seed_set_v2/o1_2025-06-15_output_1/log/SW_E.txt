PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions it follows that “x SW y” places x strictly to the left and below y, and “y E z” places y strictly to the right of and vertically within z.  Consequently, y sits somewhere inside z’s bounding‐box vertically, and x sits below y (hence “below” anything that contains y).  A straightforward check of the bounding‐box constraints then shows:

• x cannot be N, NW, or NE of z, because that would demand x lie above z (contradicting x lying below y, which in turn lies within or below z).  
• All other relations—B, S, SW, W, E, SE—can be realized by appropriate placements of x relative to z (for example, placing x entirely within z for B, strictly below for S, strictly left‐below for SW, strictly left with vertical overlap for W, strictly right for E, or right‐below for SE).

Hence the possible relations of x to z are exactly B, S, SW, W, E, or SE.
