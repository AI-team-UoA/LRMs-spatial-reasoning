PROMPT: Let NE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one sees that “x NE y” places x strictly above and to the right of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), while “y N z” places y strictly above (but horizontally inside) z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y), and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).  Chaining these:

• From x NE y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• From y N z, we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Hence  
  supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
so supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning x is definitely above z.  

Horizontally, however, nothing forces x to be contained within z’s bounding box or to lie entirely to its right.  This is precisely the distinction between “x N z” (x above z, horizontally contained) and “x NE z” (x above and to the right of z).  No other relation can hold without contradicting the inequalities above.  

Therefore, the only possible relations of x to z under “x NE y” and “y N z” are  
N or NE.
