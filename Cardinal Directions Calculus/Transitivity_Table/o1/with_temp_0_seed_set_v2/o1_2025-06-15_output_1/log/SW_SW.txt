PROMPT: Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions,

x SW y means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
y SW z means  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Since for each region r we have infx(r) ≤ supx(r) and infy(r) ≤ supy(r), chaining the above gives  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence we deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  This directly shows that x could be SW of z.  But since z can be arbitrarily large (horizontally and/or vertically), it can also encompass x in other ways:

• x can be SW of z (just established),  
• x can be S of z if z is wide enough to contain x in the horizontal dimension,  
• x can be W of z if z is tall enough to contain x in the vertical dimension,  
• x can be B of z if z is large enough to contain x’s bounding box in both dimensions.

No other relations fit the inequalities (for example, x cannot be above z).  Therefore, the only possible relations between x and z are  

S, SW, W, B.
