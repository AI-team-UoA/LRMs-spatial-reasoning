PROMPT: Let SE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x SE y” means x’s box is strictly to the right and below y’s box, and “y S z” means y’s box is strictly below but horizontally within z’s box.  Chaining these:

• Since x lies below y and y lies below z, it follows that x also lies below z (so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  
• Horizontally, x is to the right of y, while y is contained (left-to-right) within z.  That does not force x to lie strictly within z’s x‐extent; x can either lie fully within z’s x‐extent or extend further to the right than z does.

Hence, x can end up either “S” of z (if it stays within z’s bounding box in the horizontal dimension) or “SE” of z (if it lies entirely to the right of z).  No other of the nine relations can hold.  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:  
S or SE.
