PROMPT: Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key inequalities implied by  
• “x is N of y”  
• “y is NE of z”  

can be chained to show that the bounding‐box of z lies strictly below and to the left of the bounding‐box of x.  Concretely:

1)  x N y means  
   supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
   In particular, supy(y) ≤ infy(x) places y entirely below x.

2)  y NE z means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  
   In particular, supx(z) ≤ infx(y) places z to the left of y, and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) places z below y.

Combining these:

• From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), one gets supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
  Thus z is strictly to the left of x.  

• From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), one gets supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  
  Thus z is strictly below x.  

Hence, in both the x‐ and y‐directions, x is to the northeast of z.  No other cardinal‐direction inequality can be satisfied under these constraints.  Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is:

NE.
