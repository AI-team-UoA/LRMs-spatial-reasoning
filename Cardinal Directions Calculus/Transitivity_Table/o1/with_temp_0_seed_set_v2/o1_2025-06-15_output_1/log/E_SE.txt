PROMPT: Let E and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

From the two given relations,  
1) x E y  ⇔  supx(y) ≤ infx(x),  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
2) y SE z ⇔  supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  

we can chain the inequalities in both x- and y-coordinates:

• In the x-dimension:  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
  Hence supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

• In the y-dimension:  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  
  Hence supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Those two conditions together,  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(z),  
are exactly the defining inequalities for  
  x SE z.  

Checking all other cardinal‐direction definitions shows that none of them can be satisfied under these same constraints. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is:

x SE z.
