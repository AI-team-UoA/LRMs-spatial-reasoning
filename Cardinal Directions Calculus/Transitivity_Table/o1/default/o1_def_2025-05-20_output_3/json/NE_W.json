{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Possible relations between x and z in that scenario are exactly B, W, NW, N, NE, or E.  In other words, x cannot end up strictly south (S), southwest (SW), or southeast (SE) of z, but all of the other single\u2010tile relations are consistent with x being NE of y and y being W of z.
