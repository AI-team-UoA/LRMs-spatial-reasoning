{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Solely from \u201cx is SE of y\u201d and \u201cy is SW of z,\u201d one can deduce that x must lie strictly below z (because x lies below y, and y lies below z).  In the standard definitions given, that restriction on the y\u2010coordinates (supy(x) \u2264 infy(z)) is compatible only with the relations S, SW, or SE of x with respect to z.  Consequently, x could be S, SW, or SE of z.", "elapsed-time": 48.42962980270386, "reasoning-tokens": 4032, "completion-tokens": 4175}
