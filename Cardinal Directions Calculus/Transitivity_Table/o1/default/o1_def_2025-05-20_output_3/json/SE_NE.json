{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "From the given definitions, \u201cx SE y\u201d implies that x is strictly to the right of y and below y (in particular, supx(y)\u202f\u2264\u202finfx(x) and supy(x)\u202f\u2264\u202finfy(y)), while \u201cy NE z\u201d implies that y is strictly to the right of z and above z (supx(z)\u202f\u2264\u202finfx(y) and supy(z)\u202f\u2264\u202finfy(y)).  Chaining these shows that x is strictly to the right of z (since supx(z)\u202f\u2264\u202finfx(y)\u202f\u2264\u202fsupx(y)\u202f\u2264\u202finfx(x)), but the relative vertical positions of x and z are not fixed by the given inequalities.  \n\nTherefore, x can only be E, NE, or SE of z, depending on whether they overlap vertically, x is above z, or x is below z, respectively.", "elapsed-time": 50.37984323501587, "reasoning-tokens": 4416, "completion-tokens": 4650}
