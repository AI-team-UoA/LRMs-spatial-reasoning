{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "SW of y means x is strictly to the left and strictly below y (by the definition, supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y)).  \nNW of z means y is strictly to the left of z and y is strictly above z (supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(z) \u2264 infy(y)).\n\nFrom supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z), we deduce that x must be strictly to the left of z (supx(x) \u2264 infx(z)). As for the vertical ordering, because both x and z lie \u201cbelow\u201d y (in the sense that supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) and supy(z) \u2264 infy(y)), there is no forced ordering between x and z in the y\u2010coordinate. Consequently, x can be below z, vertically overlapping with z, or above z (while remaining strictly left).  \n\nHence the only possible single\u2010tile relations of x to z are:  \n\u2022 SW (strictly left and strictly below),  \n\u2022 W (strictly left and vertically contained),  \n\u2022 NW (strictly left and strictly above).
