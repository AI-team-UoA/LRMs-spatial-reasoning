{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Possible solutions are exactly those where x lies entirely below z, namely: S, SW, or SE. Indeed, from \u201cx is SW of y\u201d and \u201cy is S of z\u201d one concludes that supy(x) \u2264 infy(z), so x is below z. However, there is no information forcing x to lie strictly to the left or right of z\u2019s x\u2010interval, so x could be directly below z (S), below\u2010left (SW), or below\u2010right (SE).", "elapsed-time": 36.0982882976532, "reasoning-tokens": 2688, "completion-tokens": 2841}
