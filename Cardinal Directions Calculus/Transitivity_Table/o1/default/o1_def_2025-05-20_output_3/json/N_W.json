{"prompt": "If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Possible ways to see why only W or NW can hold:\n\n\u2022 From \u201cx is N of y,\u201d one gets that x is strictly above y and horizontally \u201cinside\u201d y (since N requires supy(y) \u2264 infy(x), infx(y) \u2264 infx(x), and supx(x) \u2264 supx(y)).  \n\u2022 From \u201cy is W of z,\u201d one gets that y is strictly left of z and vertically \u201cinside\u201d z (since W requires supx(y) \u2264 infx(z), infy(z) \u2264 infy(y), and supy(y) \u2264 supy(z)).  \n\nCombining these shows that x also ends up strictly to the left of z (because x \u2286 y horizontally and y is to the left of z \u21d2 supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)).  In the vertical dimension, x can lie entirely above z (making x NW of z) or can be contained in z\u2019s vertical span (making x W of z).  No other direction satisfies all constraints.  \n\nHence, the possible relations of x to z are W or NW.", "elapsed-time": 116.11536931991577, "reasoning-tokens": 7168, "completion-tokens": 7447}
