{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NE of y means x is to the right and above y\u2019s bounding box; E of z means y is to the right (horizontally) but vertically contained in z.  Chaining \u201cNE of y\u201d and \u201cE of z\u201d forces x to lie to the right of z but leaves open whether x is entirely above z or not.  Consequently, the only consistent possibilities are that x is E or NE of z.", "elapsed-time": 58.78923201560974, "reasoning-tokens": 4352, "completion-tokens": 4495}
