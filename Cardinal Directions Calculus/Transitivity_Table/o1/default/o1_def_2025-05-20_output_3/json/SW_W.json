{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "From the given definitions and constraints, one can show that x must lie strictly to the left of z (since x is SW of y and y is W of z).  The only question is whether x also lies entirely below z (making x SW of z) or else fits vertically inside z (making x W of z).  Concretely:\n\n\u2022 SW of y \u21d2 supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y).  \n\u2022 W of z  \u21d2 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).\n\nChain together supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z), so supx(x) \u2264 infx(z), which forces x to be to the left of z.  Vertically, either:\n1. supy(x) \u2264 infy(z), so x lies strictly below z \u21d2 x SW z, or  \n2. infy(z) \u2264 infy(x) and supy(x) \u2264 supy(z), so x\u2019s bounding box is contained in z\u2019s vertically \u21d2 x W z.\n\nNo other cardinal directions are consistent with those bounding\u2010box constraints.  Thus the possible relations of x to z are W or SW.", "elapsed-time": 84.27845597267151, "reasoning-tokens": 4928, "completion-tokens": 5261}
