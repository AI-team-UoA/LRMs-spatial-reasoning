{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NE of y forces x to lie to the right and above y (i.e., supx(y) \u2264 infx(x) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(x)).  \nSE of z forces y to lie to the right and below z (i.e., supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z)).  \n\nChaining these implies supx(z) \u2264 infx(x), so x must lie strictly to the right of z. However, there is no constraint fixing whether x is above, below, or \u201cvertically contained\u201d with respect to z. Consequently, x can only be E, NE, or SE of z.", "elapsed-time": 46.58843016624451, "reasoning-tokens": 3200, "completion-tokens": 3387}
