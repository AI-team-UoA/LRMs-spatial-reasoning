{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "E\u202fand\u202fSE.  \n\nReasoning (in brief):  \n\u2022 From \u201cx\u202fS\u202fy\u201d we know x lies strictly below y (their bounding boxes do not overlap vertically, and x\u2019s box is horizontally within y\u2019s box).  \n\u2022 From \u201cy\u202fE\u202fz\u201d we know y lies strictly to the right of z (their bounding boxes do not overlap horizontally, and y\u2019s box is vertically within z\u2019s box).  \n\u2022 Because x is horizontally within y and y is to the right of z, x must also lie to the right of z.  \n\u2022 Vertically, x can either sit wholly within z\u2019s vertical span (making x\u202fE\u202fz) or lie entirely below z (making x\u202fSE\u202fz).  \n\u2022 No other single\u2010tile relation is compatible with these constraints.
