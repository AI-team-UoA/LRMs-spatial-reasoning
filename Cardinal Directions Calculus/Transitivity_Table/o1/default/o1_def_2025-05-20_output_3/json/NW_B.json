{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N\u202fW of y means x is strictly to the left (in the x\u2010coordinate sense) and above (in the y\u2010coordinate sense) of y, while y\u202fB\u202fz means y sits entirely inside z\u2019s bounding box.  Because z can be made arbitrarily large (or small) around y, one finds that x can end up:\n\n\u2022 entirely inside z (B),  \n\u2022 directly above z (N),  \n\u2022 directly to the left of z (W), or  \n\u2022 up\u2010and\u2010to\u2010the\u2010left of z (NW).\n\nAll other placements (E,\u202fNE,\u202fSE,\u202fS,\u202fSW) contradict x being NW of y which itself is inside z.  Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are: B,\u202fN,\u202fW,\u202fNW.", "elapsed-time": 111.8186731338501, "reasoning-tokens": 8000, "completion-tokens": 8228}
