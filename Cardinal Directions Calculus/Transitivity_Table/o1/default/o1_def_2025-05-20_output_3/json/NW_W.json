{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W and NW are exactly the two possibilities.  In brief:\n\n\u2022 From x NW y we get sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) and sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x).  \n\u2022 From y W z we get sup\u2093(y) \u2264 inf\u2093(z) and inf\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z).\n\nPutting these together forces sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(z) (so x is to the left of z) but leaves open whether x\u2019s vertical extent lies within z\u2019s (giving x W z) or strictly above z\u2019s (giving x NW z).", "elapsed-time": 71.78124022483826, "reasoning-tokens": 4224, "completion-tokens": 4415}
