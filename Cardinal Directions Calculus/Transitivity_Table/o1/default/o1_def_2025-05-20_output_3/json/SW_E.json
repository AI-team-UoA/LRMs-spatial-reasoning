{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Possible relations are exactly those that place x at or below z (since x is below y and y is contained vertically in z).  Concretely, x can be B, S, SW, W, E, or SE of z.", "elapsed-time": 167.05594944953918, "reasoning-tokens": 7680, "completion-tokens": 7788}
