{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W of y means x is strictly to the left of y; E of z means y is strictly to the left of z. Chaining these gives that x is strictly to the left of z. The only single-tile cardinal\u2010direction relations that place x strictly to the left of z (according to the given definitions) are W, NW, or SW. Hence x could be W, NW, or SW of z.", "elapsed-time": 51.098376512527466, "reasoning-tokens": 3968, "completion-tokens": 4103}
