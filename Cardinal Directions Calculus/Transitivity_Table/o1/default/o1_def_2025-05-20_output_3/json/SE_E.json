{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "E and SE.\n\nExplanation (briefly):  \n\nFrom \u201cx is SE of y,\u201d one deduces supx(y) \u2264 infx(x), meaning x is strictly to the right of y, and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y), meaning x is strictly below y.  \nFrom \u201cy is E of z,\u201d one deduces supx(z) \u2264 infx(y), meaning y is strictly to the right of z, and that y\u2019s box lies vertically within z\u2019s box (in particular, infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) and supy(y) \u2264 supy(z)).  \n\nPutting these together shows that x must also be strictly to the right of z (so supx(z) \u2264 infx(x)) and below or within z\u2019s vertical extent.  Hence x can only be E or SE of z.", "elapsed-time": 76.48863577842712, "reasoning-tokens": 4160, "completion-tokens": 4392}
