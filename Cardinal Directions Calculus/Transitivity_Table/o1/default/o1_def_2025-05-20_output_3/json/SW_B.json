{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Possible relations between x and z, under the stated conditions, turn out to be exactly B, S, SW, or W.  In brief:\n\n\u2022 \u201cx SW y\u201d means supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y).  \n\u2022 \u201cy B z\u201d means y\u2019s bounding box is contained in z\u2019s bounding box.  \n\nBecause y is inside z, x (which lies to the left/below y) can end up:  \n\u2022 entirely inside z (B),  \n\u2022 strictly below z (S) if x\u2019s top lies below z\u2019s bottom but horizontally within z,  \n\u2022 strictly to the left of z (W) if x\u2019s right lies to the left of z\u2019s left but vertically within z,  \n\u2022 or both left and below z (SW).  \n\nAll other directions are ruled out by these bounding\u2010box constraints.", "elapsed-time": 64.40955400466919, "reasoning-tokens": 4928, "completion-tokens": 5177}
