{"prompt": "If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N, NE, or NW.\n\nExplanation (informal):  \nFrom \u201cx E y\u201d one deduces that x is strictly to the right of y (so supx(y) \u2264 infx(x)) and, in the vertical direction, x is \u201cwithin\u201d y (in particular, infy(y) \u2264 infy(x) and supy(x) \u2264 supy(y)).  \nFrom \u201cy NW z\u201d one sees y is to the left of z (supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)) and above z (supy(z) \u2264 infy(y)).  \n\nPutting these together forces z to lie strictly below x (because supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 infy(x)) but does not fix whether x is left, right, or horizontally contained by z.  Thus the only viable single\u2010tile directions of x relative to z are precisely the \u201cnorthern\u201d ones: N, NE, or NW.", "elapsed-time": 87.6509804725647, "reasoning-tokens": 6016, "completion-tokens": 6270}
