{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Satisfying both  \n\u2022 x\u202fSW\u202fy \u21d2 supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y),  \n\u2022 y\u202fSE\u202fz \u21d2 supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z),  \n\nforces x to lie strictly below z (since supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z) implies supy(x) \u2264 infy(z)).  However, nothing in those inequalities fixes whether x is left, right, or contained horizontally with respect to z.  Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are S, SW, or SE.", "elapsed-time": 79.99351215362549, "reasoning-tokens": 6144, "completion-tokens": 6345}
