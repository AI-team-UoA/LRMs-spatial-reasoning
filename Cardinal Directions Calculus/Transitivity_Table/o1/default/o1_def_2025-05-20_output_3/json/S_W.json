{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W and SW.  \n\nExplanation (briefly):  \n\u2022 From x\u202fS\u202fy we know that x lies entirely below y (their bounding boxes are disjoint in the y-direction) but is horizontally within y.  \n\u2022 From y\u202fW\u202fz we know that y lies entirely to the left of z (their bounding boxes are disjoint in the x-direction) but is vertically within z.  \n\u2022 Putting these together forces x also to lie to the left of z (so supx(x)\u202f\u2264\u202finfx(z)). Depending on whether x\u2019s top is still below z\u2019s bottom or is within z\u2019s vertical extent, x can be SW or W of z.
