For r1: N, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Possible ways to see why only W or NW can hold:

• From “x is N of y,” one gets that x is strictly above y and horizontally “inside” y (since N requires supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).  
• From “y is W of z,” one gets that y is strictly left of z and vertically “inside” z (since W requires supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

Combining these shows that x also ends up strictly to the left of z (because x ⊆ y horizontally and y is to the left of z ⇒ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).  In the vertical dimension, x can lie entirely above z (making x NW of z) or can be contained in z’s vertical span (making x W of z).  No other direction satisfies all constraints.  

Hence, the possible relations of x to z are W or NW.
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: E or NE.
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: N of y means that x is vertically above y (with horizontal containment), and S of z means that y is vertically below z (with horizontal containment).  From these it follows that x must lie horizontally within z (since x is within y and y is within z).  Vertically, however, x can end up entirely below z (S), entirely above z (N), or contained in z’s vertical span (B).  

Hence the possible single‐tile relations from x to z are N, S, or B.
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: SW, W, or NW. 

Explanation (sketch):  
• From x N y we have, in particular, supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x).  
• From y SW z we have supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).  
• Combining these shows supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z), so x is strictly to the “left” of z in bounding‐box terms.  
• Vertically, x could lie below z (making x SW z), could overlap z’s vertical extent (making x W z), or could lie above z (making x NW z).  
• No other cardinal directions are compatible with supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z). Hence the only possibilities are SW, W, or NW.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: x must lie strictly to the right (east) of z (since y is to the right of z and x is horizontally contained in y).  However, there is no constraint forcing x to be above or below z in the vertical direction.  Hence, the only possible single-tile relations of x with respect to z are E, NE, or SE.
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: N and B.
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: From the given definitions, one first sees that x W y forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)) and also vertically “inside” y (infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y)). Next, y N z forces y to lie strictly above z (supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y)) and horizontally “inside” z (infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)).

Combining these:

• Vertically, supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x). Hence x is strictly above z (no vertical overlap).  
• Horizontally, x is to the left of y, which is itself contained in z. There is no requirement that forces x either fully to the left of z or fully inside the horizontal extent of z—it could be either, depending on how z’s bounding box extends.

In the single-tile definitions given, a region a above b can only be “N” of b (if a is also horizontally contained in b) or “NW” of b (if a lies strictly to the left and above b). Because x is definitely above z, and depending on whether x is horizontally contained in z or disjoint on the left, the only possible single-tile relations of x with respect to z are N or NW.
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W.
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: W of y means x is strictly to the left of y; E of z means y is strictly to the left of z. Chaining these gives that x is strictly to the left of z. The only single-tile cardinal‐direction relations that place x strictly to the left of z (according to the given definitions) are W, NW, or SW. Hence x could be W, NW, or SW of z.
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Sifting through the definitions, the key points are:

•  “x W y” gives:  
   1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)     (x is to the left of y),  
   2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)  
      (x fits vertically within y’s bounding box).

•  “y S z” gives:  
   1) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)     (y is below z),  
   2) infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  
      (y fits horizontally within z’s bounding box).

From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), region x is always below z.  That means in any consistent arrangement, x’s top never goes above z’s bottom.  Consequently, the only viable “south-type” relations of x to z are either:

•  x S z, which additionally requires x to be horizontally inside z (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)),  
•  x SW z, which requires x to lie to the left (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and below (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

All other directions fail under these bounding‐box constraints.  Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are precisely S or SW.
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: Satisfying both “x W y” (x is west of y) and “y SE z” (y is southeast of z) forces x to lie strictly below z (because from “y SE z” one deduces supy(y) ≤ infy(z), and from “x W y” one sees supy(x) ≤ supy(y), so overall supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  Once x is strictly below z, the only possible single‐tile cardinal relations of x to z are precisely those in which x is below z: namely S, SW, or SE.
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: N, NE, or NW.
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: W and B are the only possibilities.  In short‐tile form:

• x W z is possible if x lies entirely to the left of z,  
• x B z is possible if x is (horizontally) inside z,  
while no other single‐tile relation can hold, because x is already “vertically within” z (through y).
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: N and NE are both consistent with the given constraints.  In brief:

• From “x is E of y” one deduces that x lies strictly to the right of y and is vertically contained in y.  
• From “y is N of z” one deduces that y lies strictly above z and is horizontally contained in z.  

Putting these together forces x to lie strictly above z (since y is above z and x is above y’s lower edge).  Horizontally, x may either lie entirely within z’s horizontal bounds (making x N of z) or lie to the right of z (making x NE of z).  No other single‐tile relation is compatible with those bounding‐box requirements.
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: E of y tells us that x lies strictly to the right of y but is vertically contained in y’s bounding box;  
W of z tells us that y lies strictly to the left of z but is vertically contained in z’s bounding box.  

Putting these together implies that x is also vertically contained by z (because y is vertically contained by z and x is vertically contained by y).  Horizontally, however, there is nothing to stop x from being to the left of, inside, or to the right of z’s bounding box.  Hence the only possible single-tile relations between x and z (given x E y and y W z) are:

• B (x is bounded by z),  
• E (x is to the east of z),  
• W (x is to the west of z).
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E.
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Satisfying “x E y” means x’s box is strictly to the right of y’s box (so supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) but vertically contained within y (in particular, infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
Satisfying “y S z” means y’s box is strictly below z’s box (so supy(y) ≤ infy(z)) but horizontally contained within z.

Putting these together forces x’s top to lie at or below z’s bottom (because supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)), so x is somewhere strictly south of z.  Depending on whether x’s box still fits within z’s horizontal extent or lies farther to the right than z, x can be either  
• “S” of z (if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), or  
• “SE” of z (if supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  

No other of the nine basic directions is compatible with those bounding‐box constraints. Thus, the possible relations are: S or SE.
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: N, NE, or NW.

Explanation (informal):  
From “x E y” one deduces that x is strictly to the right of y (so supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) and, in the vertical direction, x is “within” y (in particular, infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
From “y NW z” one sees y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  

Putting these together forces z to lie strictly below x (because supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)) but does not fix whether x is left, right, or horizontally contained by z.  Thus the only viable single‐tile directions of x relative to z are precisely the “northern” ones: N, NE, or NW.
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Solely from “x E y” we know that x lies strictly to the right of y (bounding‐box wise) and, from “y SW z,” that y lies strictly below and to the left of z.  Putting these together forces x entirely below z (since y is below z and x is no higher than y), but does not fix whether x is left, right, or centered relative to z.  

Concretely, “x E y” implies  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  

and “y SW z” implies  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) it follows that x is strictly below z’s bounding box.  However, infx(x) and supx(x) could lie entirely to the left of z, entirely to the right of z, or overlap horizontally with z (so long as x stays below).  

Hence the only consistent single‐tile cardinal directions from x to z are  
• S (x directly below z),  
• SW (x below‐left of z), or  
• SE (x below‐right of z).
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: B and E are both possible.  In outline:

• From x E y we know:  
  1) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)   (x is strictly to the right of y),  
  2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y)   (x is vertically “within” y).  

• From y B z we know y’s bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box:  
  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)   and   infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  

Putting these together, one sees:

1) x B z is possible if x also fits entirely inside z’s bounding box in both x and y directions (no contradiction prevents infₓ(x) ≥ infₓ(z) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z), along with y‐inclusions in y).  

2) x E z is possible if x lies strictly to the right of z’s bounding box, i.e. supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x), while still remaining “within” z vertically (infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z)).  

All other single‐tile relations fail under these constraints. Thus the possible relations between x and z are B or E.
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Satisfying “x S y” and “y N z” forces x and z to lie (vertically) on the same side of y and to have x’s bounding‐box horizontally within z’s.  Concretely:

• From x S y we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
• From y N z we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Putting these together shows  
infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z),  
so horizontally, x is contained in z.  Vertically, however, we only know both x and z lie below y, without a fixed ordering of x versus z.  Consequently, the only directions between x and z that do not contradict these constraints are:

• x S z,  
• x N z,  
• x B z.  
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: W and SW.  

Explanation (briefly):  
• From x S y we know that x lies entirely below y (their bounding boxes are disjoint in the y-direction) but is horizontally within y.  
• From y W z we know that y lies entirely to the left of z (their bounding boxes are disjoint in the x-direction) but is vertically within z.  
• Putting these together forces x also to lie to the left of z (so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)). Depending on whether x’s top is still below z’s bottom or is within z’s vertical extent, x can be SW or W of z.  
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: E and SE.  

Reasoning (in brief):  
• From “x S y” we know x lies strictly below y (their bounding boxes do not overlap vertically, and x’s box is horizontally within y’s box).  
• From “y E z” we know y lies strictly to the right of z (their bounding boxes do not overlap horizontally, and y’s box is vertically within z’s box).  
• Because x is horizontally within y and y is to the right of z, x must also lie to the right of z.  
• Vertically, x can either sit wholly within z’s vertical span (making x E z) or lie entirely below z (making x SE z).  
• No other single‐tile relation is compatible with these constraints.  
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: SW, W, or NW.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: NE, E, or SE.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: S and B.
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: N, NW.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: W and NW are exactly the two possibilities.  In brief:

• From x NW y we get supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x).  
• From y W z we get supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) and infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Putting these together forces supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z) (so x is to the left of z) but leaves open whether x’s vertical extent lies within z’s (giving x W z) or strictly above z’s (giving x NW z).
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: Possible relations are exactly B, W, NW, N, NE, or E. A quick way to see why S, SW, and SE cannot occur is that x is “above” y (since x NW y) while y is vertically inside z.  Hence x cannot end up wholly below z (which would be required by S, SW, or SE).  On the other hand, if z is large enough, x can be contained in z (B), or lie to its west (W), northwest (NW), north (N), northeast (NE), or east (E).
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B are all possible. The reason is that “x NW y” only constrains x to lie left of and above y (in terms of bounding boxes), while “y S z” only constrains y to lie below (and horizontally within) z.  There is no further requirement forcing x to occupy any particular position relative to z, so any of the nine relations can still hold between x and z.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW.
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: NW of y tells us that x lies strictly to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  
SW of z tells us that y lies strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).

From these, one deduces supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is strictly to the left of z. Consequently, any relation of x to z requiring horizontal overlap (B, N, S) or x’s being to the right (E, NE, SE) is ruled out. The only remaining possibilities are the strict “left” cases:

• NW (if x is also above z),  
• W (if x is vertically within z’s bounding box),  
• SW (if x is also below z).

Hence, the possible relations are {NW, W, SW}.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B are all possible. Indeed, from  
• x NW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• y SE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  

one can arrange x and z in each of the nine cardinal‐direction ways without contradicting those two conditions.
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: N, NE, or NW.
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: N W of y means x is strictly to the left (in the x‐coordinate sense) and above (in the y‐coordinate sense) of y, while y B z means y sits entirely inside z’s bounding box.  Because z can be made arbitrarily large (or small) around y, one finds that x can end up:

• entirely inside z (B),  
• directly above z (N),  
• directly to the left of z (W), or  
• up‐and‐to‐the‐left of z (NW).

All other placements (E, NE, SE, S, SW) contradict x being NW of y which itself is inside z.  Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are: B, N, W, NW.
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: N, NE, and SE all require x to lie strictly “to the right” of z (i.e., supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)) in their definitions.  But from  
• x SW y ⇒ supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• y N  z ⇒ infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z),  

one sees y is horizontally contained in z, while x is to the left of y.  There is no way then for x’s box to begin (infx(x)) strictly to the right of z’s entire box (supx(z)), since z must already stretch at least as far right as y does.  Consequently, x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z.

All of the other single‐tile relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N) can be satisfied by suitably positioning x (for example, letting z be large enough or placing x far enough above/below/left while still meeting x SW y and y N z).  Hence the possible relations between x and z are:  

B, S, SW, W, NW, N.
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: From the given definitions and constraints, one can show that x must lie strictly to the left of z (since x is SW of y and y is W of z).  The only question is whether x also lies entirely below z (making x SW of z) or else fits vertically inside z (making x W of z).  Concretely:

• SW of y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
• W of z  ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Chain together supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which forces x to be to the left of z.  Vertically, either:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x lies strictly below z ⇒ x SW z, or  
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), so x’s bounding box is contained in z’s vertically ⇒ x W z.

No other cardinal directions are consistent with those bounding‐box constraints.  Thus the possible relations of x to z are W or SW.
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Possible relations are exactly those that place x at or below z (since x is below y and y is contained vertically in z).  Concretely, x can be B, S, SW, W, E, or SE of z.
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Possible solutions are exactly those where x lies entirely below z, namely: S, SW, or SE. Indeed, from “x is SW of y” and “y is S of z” one concludes that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x is below z. However, there is no information forcing x to lie strictly to the left or right of z’s x‐interval, so x could be directly below z (S), below‐left (SW), or below‐right (SE).
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: SW of y means x is strictly to the left and strictly below y (by the definition, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).  
NW of z means y is strictly to the left of z and y is strictly above z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).

From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we deduce that x must be strictly to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)). As for the vertical ordering, because both x and z lie “below” y (in the sense that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)), there is no forced ordering between x and z in the y‐coordinate. Consequently, x can be below z, vertically overlapping with z, or above z (while remaining strictly left).  

Hence the only possible single‐tile relations of x to z are:  
• SW (strictly left and strictly below),  
• W (strictly left and vertically contained),  
• NW (strictly left and strictly above).  
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Satisfying both  
• x SW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y SE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  

forces x to lie strictly below z (since supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) implies supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  However, nothing in those inequalities fixes whether x is left, right, or contained horizontally with respect to z.  Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are S, SW, or SE.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B. All nine are possible.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Possible relations between x and z, under the stated conditions, turn out to be exactly B, S, SW, or W.  In brief:

• “x SW y” means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
• “y B z” means y’s bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box.  

Because y is inside z, x (which lies to the left/below y) can end up:  
• entirely inside z (B),  
• strictly below z (S) if x’s top lies below z’s bottom but horizontally within z,  
• strictly to the left of z (W) if x’s right lies to the left of z’s left but vertically within z,  
• or both left and below z (SW).  

All other directions are ruled out by these bounding‐box constraints.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Possible ways to see this are easiest by comparing bounding‐box inequalities.  From “x SE y” one knows, in particular, that  
• x is strictly to the right of y (supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)),  
• x is strictly below y (supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y)).  

From “y N z” one has  
• y is strictly above z (supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y)),  
• y’s bounding box is horizontally contained in z’s (infx(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)).  

Putting these together does not fix a unique relative position of x to z.  In particular, x might lie completely inside z’s bounding box, or might be to the right/east of z, or might be above or below z, etc.  One finds that all of the following can occur without contradiction:

• N  
• NE  
• E  
• SE  
• S  
• B  

On the other hand, the “west”‐type relations (W, SW, NW) are ruled out by the fact that x is already to the right of y, which is itself inside (or no wider than) z. Thus the possible relations between x and z are:

N, NE, E, SE, S, B.
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: B, S, SW, W, E, or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: E and SE.

Explanation (briefly):  

From “x is SE of y,” one deduces supx(y) ≤ infx(x), meaning x is strictly to the right of y, and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), meaning x is strictly below y.  
From “y is E of z,” one deduces supx(z) ≤ infx(y), meaning y is strictly to the right of z, and that y’s box lies vertically within z’s box (in particular, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

Putting these together shows that x must also be strictly to the right of z (so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and below or within z’s vertical extent.  Hence x can only be E or SE of z.
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: S and SE.
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, and B are all possible.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Solely from “x is SE of y” and “y is SW of z,” one can deduce that x must lie strictly below z (because x lies below y, and y lies below z).  In the standard definitions given, that restriction on the y‐coordinates (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) is compatible only with the relations S, SW, or SE of x with respect to z.  Consequently, x could be S, SW, or SE of z.
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: x is SE of y means:  
1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is strictly to the right of y),  
2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y)   (x is strictly below y).  

y is SE of z means:  
3) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   (y is strictly to the right of z),  
4) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (y is strictly below z).  

From (1) and (3), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
From (2) and (4), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence, relative to z, region x is to the right (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and below (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  
By the definition of “SE”, those two inequalities are exactly the conditions for x SE z.  

Therefore, the only possible relation(s) between x and z is SE.
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: From the given definitions, “x SE y” implies that x is strictly to the right of y and below y (in particular, supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), while “y NE z” implies that y is strictly to the right of z and above z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Chaining these shows that x is strictly to the right of z (since supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)), but the relative vertical positions of x and z are not fixed by the given inequalities.  

Therefore, x can only be E, NE, or SE of z, depending on whether they overlap vertically, x is above z, or x is below z, respectively.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: Possible relations are exactly those for which x can still lie inside z, or be strictly south of z, or strictly east of z, or southeast of z.  Concretely, that means the only cardinal directions consistent with “x SE y” and “y B z” are:

• B  
• S  
• E  
• SE  
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: N and NE.
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Possible relations between x and z in that scenario are exactly B, W, NW, N, NE, or E.  In other words, x cannot end up strictly south (S), southwest (SW), or southeast (SE) of z, but all of the other single‐tile relations are consistent with x being NE of y and y being W of z.  
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: NE of y means x is to the right and above y’s bounding box; E of z means y is to the right (horizontally) but vertically contained in z.  Chaining “NE of y” and “E of z” forces x to lie to the right of z but leaves open whether x is entirely above z or not.  Consequently, the only consistent possibilities are that x is E or NE of z.
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, or B.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: NE of y forces x strictly above and to the right of y, and NW of z forces y strictly above and to the left of z.  Chaining these implies that x is strictly above z (because z lies below y and y lies below x), but without forcing x to lie strictly to the left or to the right of z.  In the nine‐relation scheme given, this is precisely the condition for x to be NW, N, or NE of z.
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B are all still possible between x and z. The conditions “x is NE of y” and “y is SW of z” fix only how both x and z lie (to the “northeast” and “southwest,” respectively) with respect to y, but do not fix any direct constraints between x and z themselves; hence any of the nine relations can still hold.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: NE of y forces x to lie to the right and above y (i.e., supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  
SE of z forces y to lie to the right and below z (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).  

Chaining these implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so x must lie strictly to the right of z. However, there is no constraint fixing whether x is above, below, or “vertically contained” with respect to z. Consequently, x can only be E, NE, or SE of z.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: N, E, NE, or B.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: x is B of y means, in terms of bounding boxes, that  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

y is W of z means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), it follows that  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
which places the entire x‐bounding‐box to the left of (or just touching) z’s bounding box in the x‐dimension.  

In the y‐dimension, combining infy(y) ≤ infy(x) with infy(z) ≤ infy(y) yields  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) with supy(y) ≤ supy(z) yields  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence, in y, x’s bounding box is “within” z’s bounding box (possibly just touching top/bottom). Putting those together:

• x cannot be N or S of z, because that would require x to lie entirely above or below z in the y‐dimension (contradicted by infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  
• x cannot be any NE, SE, NW, or SW of z, because those require x also to lie strictly above or below, which again fails the y‐overlap just shown.  
• x cannot be B of z (enclosed by z’s bounding box) because that would need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), whereas we already have supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

The only remaining consistent relation is x W z, namely:  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

Therefore, the possible (and in fact only) relation between x and z is:  
W.
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: E.
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: From the given definitions, the key facts are:

•  x B y means the bounding box of x is fully inside that of y:  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

•  y NW z means y is strictly to the left and above z:  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Because x is inside y’s bounding box, all of x’s x-coordinates and y-coordinates lie between those of y.  In particular,

   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

These two inequalities match exactly the definition of x NW z, namely

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Checking all other cardinal‐direction definitions quickly leads to contradictions in either the x‐ or y‐coordinate ordering when combined with the above two facts.  Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is:

NW.
