PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NE of y means x is to the right and above y’s bounding box; E of z means y is to the right (horizontally) but vertically contained in z.  Chaining “NE of y” and “E of z” forces x to lie to the right of z but leaves open whether x is entirely above z or not.  Consequently, the only consistent possibilities are that x is E or NE of z.
