PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Solely from “x is SE of y” and “y is SW of z,” one can deduce that x must lie strictly below z (because x lies below y, and y lies below z).  In the standard definitions given, that restriction on the y‐coordinates (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) is compatible only with the relations S, SW, or SE of x with respect to z.  Consequently, x could be S, SW, or SE of z.
