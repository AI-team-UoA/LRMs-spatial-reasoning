PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible ways to see why only W or NW can hold:

• From “x is N of y,” one gets that x is strictly above y and horizontally “inside” y (since N requires supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).  
• From “y is W of z,” one gets that y is strictly left of z and vertically “inside” z (since W requires supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

Combining these shows that x also ends up strictly to the left of z (because x ⊆ y horizontally and y is to the left of z ⇒ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).  In the vertical dimension, x can lie entirely above z (making x NW of z) or can be contained in z’s vertical span (making x W of z).  No other direction satisfies all constraints.  

Hence, the possible relations of x to z are W or NW.
