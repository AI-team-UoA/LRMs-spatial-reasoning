PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

SW of y means x is strictly to the left and strictly below y (by the definition, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).  
NW of z means y is strictly to the left of z and y is strictly above z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).

From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we deduce that x must be strictly to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)). As for the vertical ordering, because both x and z lie “below” y (in the sense that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)), there is no forced ordering between x and z in the y‐coordinate. Consequently, x can be below z, vertically overlapping with z, or above z (while remaining strictly left).  

Hence the only possible single‐tile relations of x to z are:  
• SW (strictly left and strictly below),  
• W (strictly left and vertically contained),  
• NW (strictly left and strictly above).
