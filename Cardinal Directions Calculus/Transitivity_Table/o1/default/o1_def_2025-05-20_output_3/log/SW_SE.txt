PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying both  
• x SW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y SE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  

forces x to lie strictly below z (since supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) implies supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  However, nothing in those inequalities fixes whether x is left, right, or contained horizontally with respect to z.  Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are S, SW, or SE.
