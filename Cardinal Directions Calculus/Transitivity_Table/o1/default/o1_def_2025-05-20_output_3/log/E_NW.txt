PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, or NW.

Explanation (informal):  
From “x E y” one deduces that x is strictly to the right of y (so supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) and, in the vertical direction, x is “within” y (in particular, infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
From “y NW z” one sees y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  

Putting these together forces z to lie strictly below x (because supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)) but does not fix whether x is left, right, or horizontally contained by z.  Thus the only viable single‐tile directions of x relative to z are precisely the “northern” ones: N, NE, or NW.
