PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W of y means x is strictly to the left of y; E of z means y is strictly to the left of z. Chaining these gives that x is strictly to the left of z. The only single-tile cardinal‚Äêdirection relations that place x strictly to the left of z (according to the given definitions) are W, NW, or SW. Hence x could be W, NW, or SW of z.
