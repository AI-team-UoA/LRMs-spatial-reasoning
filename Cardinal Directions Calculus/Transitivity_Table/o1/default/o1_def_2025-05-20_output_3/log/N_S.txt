PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N of y means that x is vertically above y (with horizontal containment), and S of z means that y is vertically below z (with horizontal containment).  From these it follows that x must lie horizontally within z (since x is within y and y is within z).  Vertically, however, x can end up entirely below z (S), entirely above z (N), or contained in z’s vertical span (B).  

Hence the possible single‐tile relations from x to z are N, S, or B.
