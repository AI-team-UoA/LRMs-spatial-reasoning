PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible ways to see this are easiest by comparing bounding‐box inequalities.  From “x SE y” one knows, in particular, that  
• x is strictly to the right of y (supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)),  
• x is strictly below y (supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y)).  

From “y N z” one has  
• y is strictly above z (supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y)),  
• y’s bounding box is horizontally contained in z’s (infx(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)).  

Putting these together does not fix a unique relative position of x to z.  In particular, x might lie completely inside z’s bounding box, or might be to the right/east of z, or might be above or below z, etc.  One finds that all of the following can occur without contradiction:

• N  
• NE  
• E  
• SE  
• S  
• B  

On the other hand, the “west”‐type relations (W, SW, NW) are ruled out by the fact that x is already to the right of y, which is itself inside (or no wider than) z. Thus the possible relations between x and z are:

N, NE, E, SE, S, B.
