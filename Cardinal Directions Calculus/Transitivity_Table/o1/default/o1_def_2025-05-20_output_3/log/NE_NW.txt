PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NE of y forces x strictly above and to the right of y, and NW of z forces y strictly above and to the left of z.  Chaining these implies that x is strictly above z (because z lies below y and y lies below x), but without forcing x to lie strictly to the left or to the right of z.  In the nine‚Äêrelation scheme given, this is precisely the condition for x to be NW, N, or NE of z.
