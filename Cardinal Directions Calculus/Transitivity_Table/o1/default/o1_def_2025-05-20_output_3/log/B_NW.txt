PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, the key facts are:

•  x B y means the bounding box of x is fully inside that of y:  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

•  y NW z means y is strictly to the left and above z:  
   supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  and  supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Because x is inside y’s bounding box, all of x’s x-coordinates and y-coordinates lie between those of y.  In particular,

   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).  

These two inequalities match exactly the definition of x NW z, namely

   supx(x) ≤ infx(z)   and   supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Checking all other cardinal‐direction definitions quickly leads to contradictions in either the x‐ or y‐coordinate ordering when combined with the above two facts.  Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is:

NW.
