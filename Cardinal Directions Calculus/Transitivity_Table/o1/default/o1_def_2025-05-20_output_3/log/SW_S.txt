PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible solutions are exactly those where x lies entirely below z, namely: S, SW, or SE. Indeed, from “x is SW of y” and “y is S of z” one concludes that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x is below z. However, there is no information forcing x to lie strictly to the left or right of z’s x‐interval, so x could be directly below z (S), below‐left (SW), or below‐right (SE).
