PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E and SE.  

Reasoning (in brief):  
• From “x S y” we know x lies strictly below y (their bounding boxes do not overlap vertically, and x’s box is horizontally within y’s box).  
• From “y E z” we know y lies strictly to the right of z (their bounding boxes do not overlap horizontally, and y’s box is vertically within z’s box).  
• Because x is horizontally within y and y is to the right of z, x must also lie to the right of z.  
• Vertically, x can either sit wholly within z’s vertical span (making x E z) or lie entirely below z (making x SE z).  
• No other single‐tile relation is compatible with these constraints.
