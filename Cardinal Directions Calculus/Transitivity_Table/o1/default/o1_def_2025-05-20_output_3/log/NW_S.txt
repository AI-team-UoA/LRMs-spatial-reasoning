PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B are all possible. The reason is that “x NW y” only constrains x to lie left of and above y (in terms of bounding boxes), while “y S z” only constrains y to lie below (and horizontally within) z.  There is no further requirement forcing x to occupy any particular position relative to z, so any of the nine relations can still hold between x and z.
