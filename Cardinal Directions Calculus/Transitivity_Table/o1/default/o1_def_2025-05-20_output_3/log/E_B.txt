PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

B and E are both possible.  In outline:

• From x E y we know:  
  1) supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)   (x is strictly to the right of y),  
  2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y)   (x is vertically “within” y).  

• From y B z we know y’s bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box:  
  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)   and   infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  

Putting these together, one sees:

1) x B z is possible if x also fits entirely inside z’s bounding box in both x and y directions (no contradiction prevents infₓ(x) ≥ infₓ(z) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z), along with y‐inclusions in y).  

2) x E z is possible if x lies strictly to the right of z’s bounding box, i.e. supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x), while still remaining “within” z vertically (infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(z)).  

All other single‐tile relations fail under these constraints. Thus the possible relations between x and z are B or E.
