PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N and NE are both consistent with the given constraints.  In brief:

• From “x is E of y” one deduces that x lies strictly to the right of y and is vertically contained in y.  
• From “y is N of z” one deduces that y lies strictly above z and is horizontally contained in z.  

Putting these together forces x to lie strictly above z (since y is above z and x is above y’s lower edge).  Horizontally, x may either lie entirely within z’s horizontal bounds (making x N of z) or lie to the right of z (making x NE of z).  No other single‐tile relation is compatible with those bounding‐box requirements.
