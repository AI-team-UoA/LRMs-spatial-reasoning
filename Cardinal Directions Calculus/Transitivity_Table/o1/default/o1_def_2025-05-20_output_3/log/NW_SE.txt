PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B are all possible. Indeed, from  
• x NW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
• y SE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  

one can arrange x and z in each of the nine cardinal‐direction ways without contradicting those two conditions.
