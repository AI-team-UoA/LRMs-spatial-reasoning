PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Solely from “x E y” we know that x lies strictly to the right of y (bounding‐box wise) and, from “y SW z,” that y lies strictly below and to the left of z.  Putting these together forces x entirely below z (since y is below z and x is no higher than y), but does not fix whether x is left, right, or centered relative to z.  

Concretely, “x E y” implies  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  

and “y SW z” implies  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) it follows that x is strictly below z’s bounding box.  However, infx(x) and supx(x) could lie entirely to the left of z, entirely to the right of z, or overlap horizontally with z (so long as x stays below).  

Hence the only consistent single‐tile cardinal directions from x to z are  
• S (x directly below z),  
• SW (x below‐left of z), or  
• SE (x below‐right of z).
