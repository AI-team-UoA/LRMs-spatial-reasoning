PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NE of y forces x to lie to the right and above y (i.e., supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  
SE of z forces y to lie to the right and below z (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).  

Chaining these implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so x must lie strictly to the right of z. However, there is no constraint fixing whether x is above, below, or “vertically contained” with respect to z. Consequently, x can only be E, NE, or SE of z.
