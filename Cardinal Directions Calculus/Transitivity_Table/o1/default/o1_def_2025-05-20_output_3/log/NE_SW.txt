PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B are all still possible between x and z. The conditions “x is NE of y” and “y is SW of z” fix only how both x and z lie (to the “northeast” and “southwest,” respectively) with respect to y, but do not fix any direct constraints between x and z themselves; hence any of the nine relations can still hold.
