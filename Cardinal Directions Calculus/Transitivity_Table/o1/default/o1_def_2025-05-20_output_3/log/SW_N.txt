PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, and SE all require x to lie strictly “to the right” of z (i.e., supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)) in their definitions.  But from  
• x SW y ⇒ supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
• y N  z ⇒ infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z),  

one sees y is horizontally contained in z, while x is to the left of y.  There is no way then for x’s box to begin (infx(x)) strictly to the right of z’s entire box (supx(z)), since z must already stretch at least as far right as y does.  Consequently, x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z.

All of the other single‐tile relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N) can be satisfied by suitably positioning x (for example, letting z be large enough or placing x far enough above/below/left while still meeting x SW y and y N z).  Hence the possible relations between x and z are:  

B, S, SW, W, NW, N.
