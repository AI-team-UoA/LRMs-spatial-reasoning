PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x is SE of y means:  
1) supx(y) ≤ infx(x)   (x is strictly to the right of y),  
2) supy(x) ≤ infy(y)   (x is strictly below y).  

y is SE of z means:  
3) supx(z) ≤ infx(y)   (y is strictly to the right of z),  
4) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)   (y is strictly below z).  

From (1) and (3), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
From (2) and (4), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence, relative to z, region x is to the right (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and below (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  
By the definition of “SE”, those two inequalities are exactly the conditions for x SE z.  

Therefore, the only possible relation(s) between x and z is SE.
