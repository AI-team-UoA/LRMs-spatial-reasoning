PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible relations between x and z, under the stated conditions, turn out to be exactly B, S, SW, or W.  In brief:

• “x SW y” means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
• “y B z” means y’s bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box.  

Because y is inside z, x (which lies to the left/below y) can end up:  
• entirely inside z (B),  
• strictly below z (S) if x’s top lies below z’s bottom but horizontally within z,  
• strictly to the left of z (W) if x’s right lies to the left of z’s left but vertically within z,  
• or both left and below z (SW).  

All other directions are ruled out by these bounding‐box constraints.
