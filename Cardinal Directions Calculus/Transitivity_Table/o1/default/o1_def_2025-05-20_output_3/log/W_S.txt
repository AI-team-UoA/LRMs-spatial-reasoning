PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Sifting through the definitions, the key points are:

•  “x W y” gives:  
   1) supx(x) ≤ infx(y)     (x is to the left of y),  
   2) infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)  
      (x fits vertically within y’s bounding box).

•  “y S z” gives:  
   1) supy(y) ≤ infy(z)     (y is below z),  
   2) infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  
      (y fits horizontally within z’s bounding box).

From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), region x is always below z.  That means in any consistent arrangement, x’s top never goes above z’s bottom.  Consequently, the only viable “south-type” relations of x to z are either:

•  x S z, which additionally requires x to be horizontally inside z (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)),  
•  x SW z, which requires x to lie to the left (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and below (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

All other directions fail under these bounding‐box constraints.  Therefore, the possible relations of x to z are precisely S or SW.
