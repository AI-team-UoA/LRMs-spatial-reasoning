PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible relations are exactly those that place x at or below z (since x is below y and y is contained vertically in z).  Concretely, x can be B, S, SW, W, E, or SE of z.
