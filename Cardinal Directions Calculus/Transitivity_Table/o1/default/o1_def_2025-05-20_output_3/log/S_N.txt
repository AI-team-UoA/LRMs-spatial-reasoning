PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x S y” and “y N z” forces x and z to lie (vertically) on the same side of y and to have x’s bounding‐box horizontally within z’s.  Concretely:

• From x S y we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
• From y N z we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Putting these together shows  
infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z),  
so horizontally, x is contained in z.  Vertically, however, we only know both x and z lie below y, without a fixed ordering of x versus z.  Consequently, the only directions between x and z that do not contradict these constraints are:

• x S z,  
• x N z,  
• x B z.
