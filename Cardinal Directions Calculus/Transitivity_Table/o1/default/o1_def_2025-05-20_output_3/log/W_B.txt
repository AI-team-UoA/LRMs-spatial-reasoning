PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W and B are the only possibilities.  In short‐tile form:

• x W z is possible if x lies entirely to the left of z,  
• x B z is possible if x is (horizontally) inside z,  
while no other single‐tile relation can hold, because x is already “vertically within” z (through y).
