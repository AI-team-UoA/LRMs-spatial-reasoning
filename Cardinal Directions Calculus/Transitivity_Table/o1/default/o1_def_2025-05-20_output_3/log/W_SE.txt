PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying both “x W y” (x is west of y) and “y SE z” (y is southeast of z) forces x to lie strictly below z (because from “y SE z” one deduces supy(y) ≤ infy(z), and from “x W y” one sees supy(x) ≤ supy(y), so overall supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  Once x is strictly below z, the only possible single‐tile cardinal relations of x to z are precisely those in which x is below z: namely S, SW, or SE.
