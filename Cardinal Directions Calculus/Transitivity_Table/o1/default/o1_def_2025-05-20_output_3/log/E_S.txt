PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x E y” means x’s box is strictly to the right of y’s box (so supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) but vertically contained within y (in particular, infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).  
Satisfying “y S z” means y’s box is strictly below z’s box (so supy(y) ≤ infy(z)) but horizontally contained within z.

Putting these together forces x’s top to lie at or below z’s bottom (because supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)), so x is somewhere strictly south of z.  Depending on whether x’s box still fits within z’s horizontal extent or lies farther to the right than z, x can be either  
• “S” of z (if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), or  
• “SE” of z (if supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  

No other of the nine basic directions is compatible with those bounding‐box constraints. Thus, the possible relations are: S or SE.
