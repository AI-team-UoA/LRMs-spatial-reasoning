PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible relations are exactly those for which x can still lie inside z, or be strictly south of z, or strictly east of z, or southeast of z.  Concretely, that means the only cardinal directions consistent with “x SE y” and “y B z” are:

• B  
• S  
• E  
• SE
