PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W and SW.  

Explanation (briefly):  
• From x S y we know that x lies entirely below y (their bounding boxes are disjoint in the y-direction) but is horizontally within y.  
• From y W z we know that y lies entirely to the left of z (their bounding boxes are disjoint in the x-direction) but is vertically within z.  
• Putting these together forces x also to lie to the left of z (so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)). Depending on whether x’s top is still below z’s bottom or is within z’s vertical extent, x can be SW or W of z.
