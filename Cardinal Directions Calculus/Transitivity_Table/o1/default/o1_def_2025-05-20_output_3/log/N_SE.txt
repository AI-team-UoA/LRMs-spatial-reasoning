PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x must lie strictly to the right (east) of z (since y is to the right of z and x is horizontally contained in y).  However, there is no constraint forcing x to be above or below z in the vertical direction.  Hence, the only possible single-tile relations of x with respect to z are E, NE, or SE.
