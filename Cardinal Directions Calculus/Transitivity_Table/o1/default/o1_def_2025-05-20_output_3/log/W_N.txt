PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, one first sees that x W y forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)) and also vertically “inside” y (infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y)). Next, y N z forces y to lie strictly above z (supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y)) and horizontally “inside” z (infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)).

Combining these:

• Vertically, supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x). Hence x is strictly above z (no vertical overlap).  
• Horizontally, x is to the left of y, which is itself contained in z. There is no requirement that forces x either fully to the left of z or fully inside the horizontal extent of z—it could be either, depending on how z’s bounding box extends.

In the single-tile definitions given, a region a above b can only be “N” of b (if a is also horizontally contained in b) or “NW” of b (if a lies strictly to the left and above b). Because x is definitely above z, and depending on whether x is horizontally contained in z or disjoint on the left, the only possible single-tile relations of x with respect to z are N or NW.
