PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W and NW are exactly the two possibilities.  In brief:

• From x NW y we get supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x).  
• From y W z we get supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) and infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

Putting these together forces supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z) (so x is to the left of z) but leaves open whether x’s vertical extent lies within z’s (giving x W z) or strictly above z’s (giving x NW z).
