PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

SW, W, or NW. 

Explanation (sketch):  
• From x N y we have, in particular, supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x).  
• From y SW z we have supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).  
• Combining these shows supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z), so x is strictly to the “left” of z in bounding‐box terms.  
• Vertically, x could lie below z (making x SW z), could overlap z’s vertical extent (making x W z), or could lie above z (making x NW z).  
• No other cardinal directions are compatible with supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z). Hence the only possibilities are SW, W, or NW.
