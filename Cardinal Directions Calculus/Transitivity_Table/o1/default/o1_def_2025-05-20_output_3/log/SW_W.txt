PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions and constraints, one can show that x must lie strictly to the left of z (since x is SW of y and y is W of z).  The only question is whether x also lies entirely below z (making x SW of z) or else fits vertically inside z (making x W of z).  Concretely:

• SW of y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
• W of z  ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Chain together supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which forces x to be to the left of z.  Vertically, either:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x lies strictly below z ⇒ x SW z, or  
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), so x’s bounding box is contained in z’s vertically ⇒ x W z.

No other cardinal directions are consistent with those bounding‐box constraints.  Thus the possible relations of x to z are W or SW.
