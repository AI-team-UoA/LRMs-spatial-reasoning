PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N W of y means x is strictly to the left (in the x‐coordinate sense) and above (in the y‐coordinate sense) of y, while y B z means y sits entirely inside z’s bounding box.  Because z can be made arbitrarily large (or small) around y, one finds that x can end up:

• entirely inside z (B),  
• directly above z (N),  
• directly to the left of z (W), or  
• up‐and‐to‐the‐left of z (NW).

All other placements (E, NE, SE, S, SW) contradict x being NW of y which itself is inside z.  Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are: B, N, W, NW.
