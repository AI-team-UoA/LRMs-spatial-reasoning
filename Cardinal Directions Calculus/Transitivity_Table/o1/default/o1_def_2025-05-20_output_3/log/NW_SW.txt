PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NW of y tells us that x lies strictly to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  
SW of z tells us that y lies strictly to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).

From these, one deduces supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is strictly to the left of z. Consequently, any relation of x to z requiring horizontal overlap (B, N, S) or x’s being to the right (E, NE, SE) is ruled out. The only remaining possibilities are the strict “left” cases:

• NW (if x is also above z),  
• W (if x is vertically within z’s bounding box),  
• SW (if x is also below z).

Hence, the possible relations are {NW, W, SW}.
