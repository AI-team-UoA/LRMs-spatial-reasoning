PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible relations are exactly B, W, NW, N, NE, or E. A quick way to see why S, SW, and SE cannot occur is that x is “above” y (since x NW y) while y is vertically inside z.  Hence x cannot end up wholly below z (which would be required by S, SW, or SE).  On the other hand, if z is large enough, x can be contained in z (B), or lie to its west (W), northwest (NW), north (N), northeast (NE), or east (E).
