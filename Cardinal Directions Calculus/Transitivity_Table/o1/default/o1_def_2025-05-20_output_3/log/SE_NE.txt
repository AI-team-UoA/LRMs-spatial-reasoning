PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x SE y” implies that x is strictly to the right of y and below y (in particular, supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), while “y NE z” implies that y is strictly to the right of z and above z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).  Chaining these shows that x is strictly to the right of z (since supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)), but the relative vertical positions of x and z are not fixed by the given inequalities.  

Therefore, x can only be E, NE, or SE of z, depending on whether they overlap vertically, x is above z, or x is below z, respectively.
