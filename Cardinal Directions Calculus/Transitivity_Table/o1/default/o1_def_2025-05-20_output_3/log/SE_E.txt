PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E and SE.

Explanation (briefly):  

From “x is SE of y,” one deduces supx(y) ≤ infx(x), meaning x is strictly to the right of y, and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), meaning x is strictly below y.  
From “y is E of z,” one deduces supx(z) ≤ infx(y), meaning y is strictly to the right of z, and that y’s box lies vertically within z’s box (in particular, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

Putting these together shows that x must also be strictly to the right of z (so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and below or within z’s vertical extent.  Hence x can only be E or SE of z.
