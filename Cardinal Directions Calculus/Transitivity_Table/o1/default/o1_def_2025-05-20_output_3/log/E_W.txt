PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E of y tells us that x lies strictly to the right of y but is vertically contained in y’s bounding box;  
W of z tells us that y lies strictly to the left of z but is vertically contained in z’s bounding box.  

Putting these together implies that x is also vertically contained by z (because y is vertically contained by z and x is vertically contained by y).  Horizontally, however, there is nothing to stop x from being to the left of, inside, or to the right of z’s bounding box.  Hence the only possible single-tile relations between x and z (given x E y and y W z) are:

• B (x is bounded by z),  
• E (x is to the east of z),  
• W (x is to the west of z).
