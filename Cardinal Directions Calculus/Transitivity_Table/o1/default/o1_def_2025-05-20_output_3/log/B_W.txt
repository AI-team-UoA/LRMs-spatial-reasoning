PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x is B of y means, in terms of bounding boxes, that  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

y is W of z means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), it follows that  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
which places the entire x‐bounding‐box to the left of (or just touching) z’s bounding box in the x‐dimension.  

In the y‐dimension, combining infy(y) ≤ infy(x) with infy(z) ≤ infy(y) yields  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) with supy(y) ≤ supy(z) yields  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence, in y, x’s bounding box is “within” z’s bounding box (possibly just touching top/bottom). Putting those together:

• x cannot be N or S of z, because that would require x to lie entirely above or below z in the y‐dimension (contradicted by infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  
• x cannot be any NE, SE, NW, or SW of z, because those require x also to lie strictly above or below, which again fails the y‐overlap just shown.  
• x cannot be B of z (enclosed by z’s bounding box) because that would need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), whereas we already have supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  

The only remaining consistent relation is x W z, namely:  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  

Therefore, the possible (and in fact only) relation between x and z is:  
W.
