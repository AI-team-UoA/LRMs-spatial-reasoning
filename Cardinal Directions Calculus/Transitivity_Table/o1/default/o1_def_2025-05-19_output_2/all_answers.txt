For r1: N, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: W and NW are the only possibilities.  

Explanation (informal):  
• From “x is N of y” it follows that, horizontally, x’s bounding box is contained in (or equal to) y’s bounding box, while vertically x lies strictly above y.  
• From “y is W of z” it follows that, vertically, y’s bounding box is contained in (or equal to) z’s bounding box, while horizontally y lies strictly to the left of z.  

Putting these together implies that x also lies strictly to the left of z (because x is horizontally within y, and y is to the left of z). Vertically, x may or may not lie fully above z. Consequently the only valid cardinal‐direction placements of x relative to z are W (same vertical extent as, or contained within, z) or NW (strictly above z).
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: NE, E, and SE.  

Explanation (informally):  
• From “x is N of y” one knows y lies strictly below x (so supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and horizontally x is contained in y.  
• From “y is E of z” one knows z lies strictly to the left of y (so supx(z) ≤ infx(y)) and vertically y is contained in z.  
• Combining these shows z is strictly to the left of x (so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), meaning x must be somewhere to the east of z. Vertically, x can lie above, roughly aligned, or below z without contradiction.  
• Hence the only possible single‐tile relations between x and z are NE, E, or SE.  
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: From the defining inequalities, “x N y” implies:

1) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

And “y NW z” implies:

4) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
5) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

From (3) and (4), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x lies entirely to the left of (or just touching) z. From (1) and (5), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so x lies entirely above (or just touching) z. Hence x is northwest of z.

Thus the only possible relation between x and z under those conditions is “NW.”
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: From “x N y” we know x is directly above y (horizontally inside y’s box), and from “y SW z” we know y is strictly left‐and‐below z.  In particular:

• x N y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infx(x) ≥ infx(y), plus supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• y SW z ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Putting these together, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x lies strictly to the left of z.  However, nothing fixes the vertical ordering of x relative to z (x could be above, below, or within z’s vertical span), so x can be W, NW, or SW of z.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: From the definitions one sees that “x N y” forces x to lie strictly above y but horizontally within y’s bounding box, and “y SE z” forces y to lie strictly southeast (of) z.  In particular, z lies to the left of y, which in turn contains x horizontally, so x must lie to the right of z.  That rules out W, NW, SW, S, N, or B (because all of those require x either to the left of, or contained within, z).  

What remains possible are exactly the three “to‐the‐right” relations E, NE, SE.  One can construct explicit examples showing that x can indeed be due east of z (same vertical span), northeast (x is both to the right and above), or southeast (x is to the right and below).  Thus the only single‐tile cardinal directions x can have relative to z are:  

E, NE, or SE.
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: N and B are both consistent with those two constraints.  In outline:

• From “x is N of y” one deduces that x lies entirely above y (so supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), and in the horizontal direction x is contained within y’s bounding box.  
• From “y is B of z” one deduces that y (and hence anything horizontally within y) is also horizontally within z, and vertically between infy(z) and supy(z).  

Putting these together, x can either lie entirely above z (making x N of z) or else still fit vertically within z’s bounding box (making x B of z).  No other cardinal‐direction relations remain possible under these conditions.
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: N.B. abbreviations:  
• “x W y” means x is west of y, i.e. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) with vertical containment  
• “y N z” means y is north of z, i.e. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) with horizontal containment  

From x W y we know x is strictly to the left of y (in the x‐axis), but they overlap vertically.  
From y N z we know y is strictly above z (in the y‐axis), but they overlap horizontally.  

Because x’s vertical extent is contained in y’s, and y sits entirely above z, x must also lie strictly above z (no vertical overlap).  In symbols, that forces supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Hence x cannot be South, West, East, or inside (“B”) relative to z, because all of those require at least some vertical overlap or containment.  What does remain possible is that x sits above z and is either horizontally contained in z or else lines up exactly on one side or the other in degenerate (boundary‐touching) cases.  Concretely, the only relations that can hold are:

• N (x above z, horizontally contained): supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  
• NW (x above and to the left): supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
• NE (x above and to the right): supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are N, NW, or NE.
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W.
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: From the defining inequalities one sees that both x and z lie strictly to the left of y but are each vertically “contained” in y, and y is in turn vertically contained in z.  In particular this fixes no direct horizontal ordering between x and z (they could be disjoint in x or one could contain the other), but it does force x to lie within z in the vertical dimension.  Checking the single‐tile definitions then shows that the only ways for x to relate to z are:

• x W z (if x is strictly to the left),  
• x E z (if x is strictly to the right), or  
• x B z (if x is fully contained in z’s bounding box).
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Sifting through the definitions, the key facts are:

•  x W y means  
   1) supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
   2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
   3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  

•  y S z means  
   1) supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
   2) infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
   3) supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).  

From (x W y), x is strictly to the left of y, and x’s vertical span is contained within or equal to y’s. From (y S z), y is strictly below z, and y’s horizontal span is contained within or equal to z’s.

Putting these together forces:

•  supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
  so x is also below z (its top is at or below the bottom of z).  

•  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y), but we only know infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y).  
  Hence x might be horizontally inside z’s bounding box (if z is “wide”) or it might lie entirely to the left of z (if infₓ(z) is still ≥ supₓ(x)).

Checking each single‐tile relation a R b systematically shows that the only ways to satisfy supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z) (x below z) together with the possible horizontal placements are:

1) x S z, which requires  
   – supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
   – infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z).  
   One can choose z large enough horizontally so that x fits inside z’s left/right bounds and still remains below.

2) x SW z, which requires  
   – supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
   – supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  
   One can choose z so that its left edge is to the right of x’s right edge, and x sits entirely below (southwest of) z.

All other single‐tile directions (N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, B) either contradict the “x is below z” placement or contradict the horizontal‐containment requirements.  

Thus, if x W y and y S z, then x can only be S or SW of z.
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: From the two given constraints

• x W y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• y SE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),

one key deduction is supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  Hence the top of x lies at or below the bottom of z, so x must lie strictly to the south of z (i.e., there is no vertical overlap).

Whether x is directly south, southwest, or southeast of z depends on their x‐coordinates, which are not pinned down by the inequalities above.  Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are

S, SW, SE.
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: N, NW or NE.
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Possible ways to see this most directly are by checking the defining inequalities:

1)  x W y means  
   • supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
   • infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  
   So, in the y‑direction, x is “vertically inside” y; in the x‑direction, x lies strictly to the left.

2)  y B z means  
   • infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z),  
   • infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  
   So y’s entire bounding box lies inside z’s bounding box.

From 1) and 2) combined, in the y‑direction x is also inside z (since x is inside y and y is inside z). Hence x cannot be wholly above (N, NE, NW) or below (S, SE, SW) z, because that would require x to lie outside z’s y‑extent.  

In the x‑direction, two scenarios remain consistent:

• x is still inside z’s x‑extent as well, i.e.  
  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z),  
  which is exactly x B z.  

• x lies wholly to the left of z, i.e.  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
  matching x W z.

No other single-tile relation can hold without contradicting the “x inside y and y inside z” setup. Thus, the only possible relations between x and z are:

W or B.
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: From the given definitions, “x E y” forces x to lie strictly to the right of y (so supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)), and “y N z” forces y to lie strictly above z (so supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y)).  Putting these together implies that x also lies above z (because supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x)), and x is at least as far right as y, which is inside z horizontally.  

Depending on whether x remains within z’s bounding box horizontally or sits entirely to the right of it, x can be either  
• N of z (if infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z)), or  
• NE of z (if supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)).  

Hence the possible single‐tile cardinal relations between x and z are N or NE.
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: E‐of and W‐of impose only that both x and z lie (in the x‐direction) to the right of y (with no fixed order between x and z) and that, in the y‐direction, z’s bounding box can “cover” x’s.  Concretely:

•  x E y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
•  y W z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From these, one finds that in the y‐direction:  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

In the x‐direction, both infx(x) and infx(z) lie to the right of supx(y), but there is no constraint on which of infx(x) or infx(z) is further right.  As a result, x can be to the left of z, to the right of z, or even be contained by z’s bounding box (if z is large enough), and still satisfy the above.  Checking each cardinal‐direction definition shows that the only compatible relations are:

•  x W z  (if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)),  
•  x E z  (if supx(z) ≤ infx(x)),  
•  x B z  (if z’s bounding box is large enough to include x).

No pure north–south or diagonal relation is consistent with the y‐bounds (it would force x or z to be stacked vertically in a way that contradicts x E y and y W z).  Thus the possible relations between x and z are W, E, or B.
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E.  

From the defining inequalities, “x E y” implies  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
and “y E z” implies  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chain these together in the x‐coordinate:  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Chain the y‐coordinate:  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence, x’s bounding box remains within z’s bounding box vertically and is to the right of z horizontally.  That exactly matches “x E z,” and no other single‐tile cardinal direction can hold.  
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: S and SE.
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: N, NE, or NW.
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: From the given definitions, we have:

• “x E y” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

• “y SW z” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, one key deduction comes from the y-coordinates:

1) supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

This shows that x is completely below z (its highest y-value is at or below z’s lowest y-value).  Hence, any cardinal direction from x to z must place x strictly below z (no vertical overlap).

Horizontally, however, we only know that y is to the left of both x and z (supx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), but we do not know whether x itself lies left of, right of, or directly under z.  Consequently, x could be:

• directly below z (S),  
• below and strictly to the left (SW),  
• or below and strictly to the right (SE).

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are precisely S, SW, or SE.
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: B and E.
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Sitting “below” y and with y “above” z forces x and z to share horizontal overlap (x is “inside” y, which is in turn “inside” z horizontally).  Hence x cannot be purely to the west or east of z (nor any diagonal that requires disjoint x‐ranges).  Vertically, however, x could lie wholly below z (“x S z”), wholly above z (“x N z”), or be contained within z (“x B z”) if z happens to extend far enough up and down.  Thus the only possible relations are S, N, or B.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: x being S of y means, in effect, that x lies strictly below y (in the sense that the top of x’s bounding box is at or below the bottom of y’s). Meanwhile y being W of z means y lies strictly to the left of z (the right edge of y is at or left of the left edge of z).  

Putting these together forces x to lie to the left of z (because x ⊆ y in the x-dimension, and y lies to the left of z). In the y-dimension, however, x may either lie entirely below z or else still fit vertically within z’s bounding box. Consequently, the only possible single-tile relations from x to z are:

• W (West), if x also fits inside z in the y-dimension,  
• SW (South-West), if x is strictly below z in the y-dimension.
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: E (East) and SE (South‐East) are the only possibilities.  

Briefly, from x S y we have:  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

From y E z we have:  
• supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Together, these imply supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so x is necessarily to the right of z.  Checking each cardinal‐direction definition shows that exactly E (East) or SE (South‐East) can hold between x and z without contradiction.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: x being S of y tells us that x is directly “below” y in the bounding‐box sense, and y being NW of z tells us y is strictly “above and to the left” of z.  From these two facts one can deduce that x also lies strictly to the left of z (since x ⊆ y in the x‐direction and y is to the left of z).  However, vertically, x can lie above, below, or overlap z’s bounding box, so the only consistent possibilities are:

• x NW z,  
• x W z,  
• x SW z.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: E, NE, or SE.  

Explanation (informally):  
• From “x is S of y” one infers x lies strictly below y but horizontally within y’s bounding box.  
• From “y is NE of z” one infers y lies strictly to the right of z and above z.  
Putting these together forces x to lie (at least) to the right of z (because x is to the right of y’s left boundary, while y itself is entirely to the right of z). The vertical positioning of x relative to z, however, is unconstrained by those two facts (x could be above, below, or within z’s vertical extent). Consequently, the only single‐tile cardinal directions consistent with x’s being “to the right of z” are E, NE, or SE.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: Satisfying “x S y” forces x’s bounding box to lie directly below y’s (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and horizontally inside y), while “y B z” means y is fully contained in z’s bounding box (i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ … ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ … ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

Putting these together leaves only two ways x can relate to z:

• x B z (x is also contained in z’s bounding box),  
• x S z (x lies entirely below z’s bounding box).  

No other cardinal‐direction relation is consistent with those two premises.
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: N, NE, or NW.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: N and S directions require x to lie horizontally within z; E and W directions require x to lie vertically within z; NE, SE, SW require the “wrong” horizontal ordering; and B requires overlap rather than strict separation in x.  

From x NW y we have:  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is to the left of y)  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (x is above y)  

From y W z we have:  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z)  (y is vertically inside z)  

Putting these together forces supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is also to the left of z.  The only remaining possibilities among the defined directions that require “x left of z” are NW, W, or SW.  However, SW would force x below z, contradicting x being above y (which is inside z).  

Hence the only possible relations of x with respect to z are W or NW.
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: N, NE, NW, W, E, and B are all consistent with “x NW y and y E z.” The three pure‐south relations (S, SE, SW) cannot occur, because x sits above y (from x NW y), while y is already within z’s vertical extent (from y E z). Consequently x cannot lie strictly below z. Thus the possible relations are exactly N, NE, NW, W, E, or B.
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: N, NW, W, SW, S, B.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW.
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: NW, W, or SW.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B are all consistent with those two constraints. In other words, no cardinal relation between x and z is ruled out by “x NW y” together with “y SE z.”
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: N, NE, or NW.
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: x being “NW” of y means, in bounding‐box terms,  
   supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)    and    supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x).  

Meanwhile, y being “B” of z means  
   infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)  
   infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  

Since y’s box is contained in z’s, placing x “NW” of y still allows x to be:  

• Inside z’s box (“B”),  
• Strictly to the left of z (“W”),  
• Strictly above z (“N”),  
• Or both left and above z (“NW”).  

None of the other single‐tile relations (S, SE, E, NE, SW) can occur consistently with x “NW” of y and y “B” of z.  

Hence the possible relations of x to z are: B, W, N, or NW.
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B are all possible.
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: W and SW.  

Reasoning (sketch):  
From x SW y we get supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
From y W z we get supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z), placing x to the left of z.  
• If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is also below z, so x SW z.  
• If infy(x) ≥ infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x lies in z’s vertical span, so x W z.  

No other relations can hold under these constraints. Hence the possible relations are W or SW.
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Satisfying “x SW y” means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
while “y E z” means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

From these it is straightforward to construct examples showing that x can lie in any of the following relations to z:

• SW (South‐West),  
• W  (West),  
• S  (South),  
• SE (South‐East),  
• E  (East),  
• B  (Bounding box contained in z).

Conversely, requiring x to be N, NE, or NW of z leads to contradictions once one also enforces “x SW y” and “y E z.”  

Hence, the possible relations of x to z are:  
B, S, SW, W, SE, E.
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Solely from the defining inequalities, one finds that x must lie strictly below z (because x lies below y and y lies below z).  In the horizontal direction, x can either be entirely “under” z (making x S z) or lie strictly to the left of z (making x SW z).  Consequently, the only possible single‐tile relations of x to z are S or SW.
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: x being SW of y tells us that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
y being NW of z tells us that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z.  In the standard single-tile cardinal‐direction definitions, “strictly left” only occurs in W, NW, or SW.  

Because there is no information forcing x and z to be aligned or ordered in the y‐coordinate (that is, we do not know infy(x) ≤ infy(z) or infy(z) ≤ infy(x), etc.), all three of W, NW, or SW remain possible.  

Hence, x can be W, NW, or SW of z.
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW.
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Sifting through the definitions shows that “x below y” and “y below z” force x below z, ruling out the three “north”‐type relations (N, NE, NW) from x to z.  On the other hand, there is no contradiction preventing x from being contained in z (B), or lying directly south (S), southwest (SW), west (W), east (E), or southeast (SE) of z.  Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are:  
B, S, SW, W, E, SE.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B are all possible. The constraints “x SW y” and “y NE z” say nothing that forces a unique relative placement of x and z. Hence any of the nine relations between x and z can occur.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Basing ourselves strictly on the definitions:

•  x SW y  ⇒  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)  and  supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y).  
•  y B  z  ⇒  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z),  infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y),  supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

From these it follows that x is strictly to the southwest of y, while y’s bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box.  One can check by constructing examples (placing the three bounding boxes consistently) that the only ways x can relate to z are:

•  x B z  (x’s box is also fully inside z),  
•  x S z  (x lies strictly below z),  
•  x SW z (x lies southwest of z), or  
•  x W z  (x lies strictly to the left of z).

No other cardinal‐direction relation can be made consistent with x SW y and y B z. Thus the possible relations between x and z are:

B, S, SW, W.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Narrowing down all possibilities systematically shows that the only impossible cases are precisely those that would force x to lie strictly to the left of z (namely W, NW, SW).  All other single‐tile relations can be realized by suitably placing x and z while still satisfying x SE y and y N z. 

Hence, the possible relations of x to z are:  
• N  
• NE  
• E  
• SE  
• S  
• B  
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: Basing the answer strictly on the bounding‐box definitions given, one finds that x cannot lie above z (which would require x to be N, NW, or NE of z) because x is below y and y is itself vertically contained in z.  All the other directions (B, S, SW, W, E, SE) can be realized by suitable placements of the boxes.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are:

B, S, SW, W, E, SE.
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: E, SE
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: From the defining inequalities one can show that once x is “SE of” y and y is “S of” z, then x must lie strictly below z (because x lies below y and y lies below z).  Also, x cannot end up to the left of or above z (that would contradict x being to the right/below y, which itself is contained in or bounded by z).  The only ways to satisfy all bounding‐box constraints are that x is either

 • S of z (directly south, horizontally within z),  
 • SE of z (south‐east),  
 • E of z (directly east, vertically within z), or  
 • B of z (completely inside z’s bounding box).  

Hence the possible relations between x and z are: S, SE, E, or B.
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B are all possible. By suitably placing x and z (both lying SE of y) one can construct examples realizing each of the nine single‐tile relations between x and z.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Solely from “x is SE of y” and “y is SW of z,” one can deduce only that x must lie somewhere strictly south of z (because the top of x is below the bottom of y, and the bottom of y is below the bottom of z).  Horizontally, x can be to the left, contained, or to the right of z.  Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are exactly S, SW, or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: SE.
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: E, NE, SE.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: Basing ourselves strictly on the given definitions:

•  x SE y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
•  y B  z  ⇒  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  and  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

We ask which relations x can have to z that do not contradict these two facts.

1) x B z  
   If z is “large enough,” x’s bounding box can also lie fully within z.  
   Formally, x B z  requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
   Since y is inside z, there is no requirement that forces x outside. Hence x B z is possible.

2) x S z  
   This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  
   Because supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and y itself is inside z (so infy(z) ≤ infy(y)), it can happen that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
   So x can lie entirely below z.

3) x E z  
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  
   Since supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and y’s bounding box is contained in z (so supx(y) ≤ supx(z)), one can have supx(z) = supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   Thus x can lie entirely to the right of z.

4) x SE z  
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
   By the same reasoning above (z could “end” exactly where y’s bounding box ends in the x-direction, and x can be far enough below y to be below z as well), x can be strictly southeast of z.

All other directions (N, NE, NW, W, SW) lead to contradictions with x being already southeast of y and y inside z.  

Therefore, the possible single-tile cardinal relations that x can bear to z are:  
B, S, E, or SE.
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: N of z, NE of z, or NW of z.
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: B, W, NW, N, NE, or E.
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: NE and E are both possible. A quick way to see why is to note that “x NE y” forces x to lie strictly northeast of y, and “y E z” forces y to lie strictly east of z.  Chaining these implies x is strictly to the right of z, but in the vertical dimension x can lie either above all of z (making x NE of z) or still within z’s vertical extent (making x E of z).
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are all consistent possibilities, whereas W, SW, and NW cannot occur. Intuitively, once x is known to lie to the northeast of y, and y is south of z, it is impossible for x to end up to the west of z. All other directions (above, to the right, or contained in z) remain possible under those constraints.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: NE (x,y) means x is strictly to the right and strictly above y.  
NW (y,z) means y is strictly to the left and strictly above z.  

From NW (y,z), we know z is “down‐right” from y; from NE (x,y), x is “up‐right” from y.  
• In the vertical dimension, these force z below y and y below x, so z is strictly below x.  
• In the horizontal dimension, both x and z lie to the right of y, but no constraint fixes whether x is to the left, right, or overlapping in x relative to z.  

Hence x can only be strictly above z (N), or above‐left (NW), or above‐right (NE).  
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: E, NE, or SE.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: N, NE, E, or B.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: N.

Explanation (for completeness):  

1) From x B y, we have  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

2) From y N z, we have  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and  
   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Combining, one finds in particular supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so the entire bounding‐box of z lies strictly below that of x.  Meanwhile, horizontally,  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
so x’s bounding‐box is contained (in the x‐direction) within z’s bounding‐box.  

Hence x is “north” of z, and no other single‐tile relation is possible under these constraints.  
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: From  
• x B y ⇒ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• y W z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  

one deduces  
1) supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
2) infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence, relative to z, x satisfies  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
• supy(x) ≤ supy(z),  

which is exactly the definition of x W z. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is W.
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: E.
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: S.
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: B.  

From the definition of “a B b,” we require that  
infx(b) ≤ infx(a),  supx(a) ≤ supx(b),  infy(b) ≤ infy(a),  supy(a) ≤ supy(b).  

Since x is B of y and y is B of z, chaining the inequalities for x and y with those for y and z shows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  By definition, these exactly satisfy x B z.  No other single‐tile cardinal relation can hold under these circumstances.
