PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Sifting through the definitions shows that “x below y” and “y below z” force x below z, ruling out the three “north”‐type relations (N, NE, NW) from x to z.  On the other hand, there is no contradiction preventing x from being contained in z (B), or lying directly south (S), southwest (SW), west (W), east (E), or southeast (SE) of z.  Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are:  
B, S, SW, W, E, SE.
