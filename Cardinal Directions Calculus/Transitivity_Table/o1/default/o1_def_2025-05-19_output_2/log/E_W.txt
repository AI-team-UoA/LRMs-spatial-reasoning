PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E‐of and W‐of impose only that both x and z lie (in the x‐direction) to the right of y (with no fixed order between x and z) and that, in the y‐direction, z’s bounding box can “cover” x’s.  Concretely:

•  x E y ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  
•  y W z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From these, one finds that in the y‐direction:  
   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

In the x‐direction, both infx(x) and infx(z) lie to the right of supx(y), but there is no constraint on which of infx(x) or infx(z) is further right.  As a result, x can be to the left of z, to the right of z, or even be contained by z’s bounding box (if z is large enough), and still satisfy the above.  Checking each cardinal‐direction definition shows that the only compatible relations are:

•  x W z  (if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)),  
•  x E z  (if supx(z) ≤ infx(x)),  
•  x B z  (if z’s bounding box is large enough to include x).

No pure north–south or diagonal relation is consistent with the y‐bounds (it would force x or z to be stacked vertically in a way that contradicts x E y and y W z).  Thus the possible relations between x and z are W, E, or B.
