PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one sees that both x and z lie strictly to the left of y but are each vertically “contained” in y, and y is in turn vertically contained in z.  In particular this fixes no direct horizontal ordering between x and z (they could be disjoint in x or one could contain the other), but it does force x to lie within z in the vertical dimension.  Checking the single‐tile definitions then shows that the only ways for x to relate to z are:

• x W z (if x is strictly to the left),  
• x E z (if x is strictly to the right), or  
• x B z (if x is fully contained in z’s bounding box).
