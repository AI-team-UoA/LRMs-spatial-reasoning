PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Sitting “below” y and with y “above” z forces x and z to share horizontal overlap (x is “inside” y, which is in turn “inside” z horizontally).  Hence x cannot be purely to the west or east of z (nor any diagonal that requires disjoint x‐ranges).  Vertically, however, x could lie wholly below z (“x S z”), wholly above z (“x N z”), or be contained within z (“x B z”) if z happens to extend far enough up and down.  Thus the only possible relations are S, N, or B.
