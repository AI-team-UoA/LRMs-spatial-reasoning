PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Sifting through the definitions, the key facts are:

•  x W y means  
   1) supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
   2) infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x),  
   3) supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  

•  y S z means  
   1) supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
   2) infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  
   3) supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).  

From (x W y), x is strictly to the left of y, and x’s vertical span is contained within or equal to y’s. From (y S z), y is strictly below z, and y’s horizontal span is contained within or equal to z’s.

Putting these together forces:

•  supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
  so x is also below z (its top is at or below the bottom of z).  

•  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y), but we only know infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y).  
  Hence x might be horizontally inside z’s bounding box (if z is “wide”) or it might lie entirely to the left of z (if infₓ(z) is still ≥ supₓ(x)).

Checking each single‐tile relation a R b systematically shows that the only ways to satisfy supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z) (x below z) together with the possible horizontal placements are:

1) x S z, which requires  
   – supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
   – infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z).  
   One can choose z large enough horizontally so that x fits inside z’s left/right bounds and still remains below.

2) x SW z, which requires  
   – supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
   – supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  
   One can choose z so that its left edge is to the right of x’s right edge, and x sits entirely below (southwest of) z.

All other single‐tile directions (N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, B) either contradict the “x is below z” placement or contradict the horizontal‐containment requirements.  

Thus, if x W y and y S z, then x can only be S or SW of z.
