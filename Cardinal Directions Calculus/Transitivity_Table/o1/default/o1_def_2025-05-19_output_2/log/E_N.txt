PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x E y” forces x to lie strictly to the right of y (so supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x)), and “y N z” forces y to lie strictly above z (so supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y)).  Putting these together implies that x also lies above z (because supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x)), and x is at least as far right as y, which is inside z horizontally.  

Depending on whether x remains within z’s bounding box horizontally or sits entirely to the right of it, x can be either  
• N of z (if infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z)), or  
• NE of z (if supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)).  

Hence the possible single‐tile cardinal relations between x and z are N or NE.
