PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Basing ourselves strictly on the given definitions:

•  x SE y  ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
•  y B  z  ⇒  infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)  and  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

We ask which relations x can have to z that do not contradict these two facts.

1) x B z  
   If z is “large enough,” x’s bounding box can also lie fully within z.  
   Formally, x B z  requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  
   Since y is inside z, there is no requirement that forces x outside. Hence x B z is possible.

2) x S z  
   This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  
   Because supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and y itself is inside z (so infy(z) ≤ infy(y)), it can happen that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
   So x can lie entirely below z.

3) x E z  
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).  
   Since supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and y’s bounding box is contained in z (so supx(y) ≤ supx(z)), one can have supx(z) = supx(y) ≤ infx(x).  
   Thus x can lie entirely to the right of z.

4) x SE z  
   This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
   By the same reasoning above (z could “end” exactly where y’s bounding box ends in the x-direction, and x can be far enough below y to be below z as well), x can be strictly southeast of z.

All other directions (N, NE, NW, W, SW) lead to contradictions with x being already southeast of y and y inside z.  

Therefore, the possible single-tile cardinal relations that x can bear to z are:  
B, S, E, or SE.
