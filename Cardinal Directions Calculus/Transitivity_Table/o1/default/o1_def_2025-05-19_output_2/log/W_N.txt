PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N.B. abbreviations:  
• “x W y” means x is west of y, i.e. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) with vertical containment  
• “y N z” means y is north of z, i.e. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) with horizontal containment  

From x W y we know x is strictly to the left of y (in the x‐axis), but they overlap vertically.  
From y N z we know y is strictly above z (in the y‐axis), but they overlap horizontally.  

Because x’s vertical extent is contained in y’s, and y sits entirely above z, x must also lie strictly above z (no vertical overlap).  In symbols, that forces supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

Hence x cannot be South, West, East, or inside (“B”) relative to z, because all of those require at least some vertical overlap or containment.  What does remain possible is that x sits above z and is either horizontally contained in z or else lines up exactly on one side or the other in degenerate (boundary‐touching) cases.  Concretely, the only relations that can hold are:

• N (x above z, horizontally contained): supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).  
• NW (x above and to the left): supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
• NE (x above and to the right): supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are N, NW, or NE.
