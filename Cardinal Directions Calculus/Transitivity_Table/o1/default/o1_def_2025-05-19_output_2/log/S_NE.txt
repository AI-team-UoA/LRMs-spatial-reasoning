PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E, NE, or SE.  

Explanation (informally):  
• From “x is S of y” one infers x lies strictly below y but horizontally within y’s bounding box.  
• From “y is NE of z” one infers y lies strictly to the right of z and above z.  
Putting these together forces x to lie (at least) to the right of z (because x is to the right of y’s left boundary, while y itself is entirely to the right of z). The vertical positioning of x relative to z, however, is unconstrained by those two facts (x could be above, below, or within z’s vertical extent). Consequently, the only single‐tile cardinal directions consistent with x’s being “to the right of z” are E, NE, or SE.
