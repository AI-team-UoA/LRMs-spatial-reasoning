PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E.  

From the defining inequalities, “x E y” implies  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x),   infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
and “y E z” implies  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y),   infy(z) ≤ infy(y),   supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Chain these together in the x‐coordinate:  
  supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  

Chain the y‐coordinate:  
  infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence, x’s bounding box remains within z’s bounding box vertically and is to the right of z horizontally.  That exactly matches “x E z,” and no other single‐tile cardinal direction can hold.
