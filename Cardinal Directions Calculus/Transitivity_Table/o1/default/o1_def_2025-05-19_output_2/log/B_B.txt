PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

B.  

From the definition of “a B b,” we require that  
infx(b) ≤ infx(a),  supx(a) ≤ supx(b),  infy(b) ≤ infy(a),  supy(a) ≤ supy(b).  

Since x is B of y and y is B of z, chaining the inequalities for x and y with those for y and z shows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  By definition, these exactly satisfy x B z.  No other single‐tile cardinal relation can hold under these circumstances.
