PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Solely from “x is SE of y” and “y is SW of z,” one can deduce only that x must lie somewhere strictly south of z (because the top of x is below the bottom of y, and the bottom of y is below the bottom of z).  Horizontally, x can be to the left, contained, or to the right of z.  Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are exactly S, SW, or SE.
