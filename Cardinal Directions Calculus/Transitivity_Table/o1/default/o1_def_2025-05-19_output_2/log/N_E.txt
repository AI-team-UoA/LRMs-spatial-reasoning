PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NE, E, and SE.  

Explanation (informally):  
• From “x is N of y” one knows y lies strictly below x (so supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and horizontally x is contained in y.  
• From “y is E of z” one knows z lies strictly to the left of y (so supx(z) ≤ infx(y)) and vertically y is contained in z.  
• Combining these shows z is strictly to the left of x (so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), meaning x must be somewhere to the east of z. Vertically, x can lie above, roughly aligned, or below z without contradiction.  
• Hence the only possible single‐tile relations between x and z are NE, E, or SE.
