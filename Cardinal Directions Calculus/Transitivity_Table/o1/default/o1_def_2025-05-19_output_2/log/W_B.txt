PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible ways to see this most directly are by checking the defining inequalities:

1)  x W y means  
   • supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y),  
   • infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y).  
   So, in the y‑direction, x is “vertically inside” y; in the x‑direction, x lies strictly to the left.

2)  y B z means  
   • infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z),  
   • infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  
   So y’s entire bounding box lies inside z’s bounding box.

From 1) and 2) combined, in the y‑direction x is also inside z (since x is inside y and y is inside z). Hence x cannot be wholly above (N, NE, NW) or below (S, SE, SW) z, because that would require x to lie outside z’s y‑extent.  

In the x‑direction, two scenarios remain consistent:

• x is still inside z’s x‑extent as well, i.e.  
  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z),  
  which is exactly x B z.  

• x lies wholly to the left of z, i.e.  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
  matching x W z.

No other single-tile relation can hold without contradicting the “x inside y and y inside z” setup. Thus, the only possible relations between x and z are:

W or B.
