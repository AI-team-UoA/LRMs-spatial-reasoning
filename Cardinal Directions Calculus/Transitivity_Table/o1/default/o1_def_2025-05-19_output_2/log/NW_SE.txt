PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B are all consistent with those two constraints. In other words, no cardinal relation between x and z is ruled out by “x NW y” together with “y SE z.”
