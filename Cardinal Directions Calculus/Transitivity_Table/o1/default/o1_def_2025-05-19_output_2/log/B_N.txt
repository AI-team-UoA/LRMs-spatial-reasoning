PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N.

Explanation (for completeness):  

1) From x B y, we have  
   infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and  
   infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

2) From y N z, we have  
   supy(z) ≤ infy(y),  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and  
   supx(y) ≤ supx(z).  

Combining, one finds in particular supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so the entire bounding‐box of z lies strictly below that of x.  Meanwhile, horizontally,  
   infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and  
   supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z),  
so x’s bounding‐box is contained (in the x‐direction) within z’s bounding‐box.  

Hence x is “north” of z, and no other single‐tile relation is possible under these constraints.
