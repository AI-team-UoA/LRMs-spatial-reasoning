PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions one sees that “x N y” forces x to lie strictly above y but horizontally within y’s bounding box, and “y SE z” forces y to lie strictly southeast (of) z.  In particular, z lies to the left of y, which in turn contains x horizontally, so x must lie to the right of z.  That rules out W, NW, SW, S, N, or B (because all of those require x either to the left of, or contained within, z).  

What remains possible are exactly the three “to‐the‐right” relations E, NE, SE.  One can construct explicit examples showing that x can indeed be due east of z (same vertical span), northeast (x is both to the right and above), or southeast (x is to the right and below).  Thus the only single‐tile cardinal directions x can have relative to z are:  

E, NE, or SE.
