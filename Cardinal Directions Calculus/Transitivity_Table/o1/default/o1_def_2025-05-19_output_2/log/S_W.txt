PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x being S of y means, in effect, that x lies strictly below y (in the sense that the top of x’s bounding box is at or below the bottom of y’s). Meanwhile y being W of z means y lies strictly to the left of z (the right edge of y is at or left of the left edge of z).  

Putting these together forces x to lie to the left of z (because x ⊆ y in the x-dimension, and y lies to the left of z). In the y-dimension, however, x may either lie entirely below z or else still fit vertically within z’s bounding box. Consequently, the only possible single-tile relations from x to z are:

• W (West), if x also fits inside z in the y-dimension,  
• SW (South-West), if x is strictly below z in the y-dimension.
