PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W and SW.  

Reasoning (sketch):  
From x SW y we get supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
From y W z we get supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z), placing x to the left of z.  
• If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is also below z, so x SW z.  
• If infy(x) ≥ infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x lies in z’s vertical span, so x W z.  

No other relations can hold under these constraints. Hence the possible relations are W or SW.
