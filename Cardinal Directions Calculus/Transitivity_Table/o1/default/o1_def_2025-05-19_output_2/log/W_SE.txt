PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the two given constraints

• x W y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• y SE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),

one key deduction is supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  Hence the top of x lies at or below the bottom of z, so x must lie strictly to the south of z (i.e., there is no vertical overlap).

Whether x is directly south, southwest, or southeast of z depends on their x‐coordinates, which are not pinned down by the inequalities above.  Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are

S, SW, SE.
