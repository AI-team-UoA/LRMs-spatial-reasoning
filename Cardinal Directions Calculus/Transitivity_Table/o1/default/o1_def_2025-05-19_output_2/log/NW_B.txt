PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x being “NW” of y means, in bounding‐box terms,  
   supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)    and    supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x).  

Meanwhile, y being “B” of z means  
   infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)  
   infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).  

Since y’s box is contained in z’s, placing x “NW” of y still allows x to be:  

• Inside z’s box (“B”),  
• Strictly to the left of z (“W”),  
• Strictly above z (“N”),  
• Or both left and above z (“NW”).  

None of the other single‐tile relations (S, SE, E, NE, SW) can occur consistently with x “NW” of y and y “B” of z.  

Hence the possible relations of x to z are: B, W, N, or NW.
