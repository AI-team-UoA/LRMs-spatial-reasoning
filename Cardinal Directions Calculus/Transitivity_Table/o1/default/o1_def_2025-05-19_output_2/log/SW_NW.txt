PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x being SW of y tells us that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).  
y being NW of z tells us that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z.  In the standard single-tile cardinal‐direction definitions, “strictly left” only occurs in W, NW, or SW.  

Because there is no information forcing x and z to be aligned or ordered in the y‐coordinate (that is, we do not know infy(x) ≤ infy(z) or infy(z) ≤ infy(x), etc.), all three of W, NW, or SW remain possible.  

Hence, x can be W, NW, or SW of z.
