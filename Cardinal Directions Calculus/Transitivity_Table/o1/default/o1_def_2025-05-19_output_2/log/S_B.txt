PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x S y” forces x’s bounding box to lie directly below y’s (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and horizontally inside y), while “y B z” means y is fully contained in z’s bounding box (i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ … ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ … ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  

Putting these together leaves only two ways x can relate to z:

• x B z (x is also contained in z’s bounding box),  
• x S z (x lies entirely below z’s bounding box).  

No other cardinal‐direction relation is consistent with those two premises.
