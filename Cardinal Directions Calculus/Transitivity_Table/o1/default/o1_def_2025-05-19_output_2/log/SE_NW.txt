PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B are all possible. By suitably placing x and z (both lying SE of y) one can construct examples realizing each of the nine single‚Äêtile relations between x and z.
