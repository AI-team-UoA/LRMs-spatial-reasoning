PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W and NW are the only possibilities.  

Explanation (informal):  
• From “x is N of y” it follows that, horizontally, x’s bounding box is contained in (or equal to) y’s bounding box, while vertically x lies strictly above y.  
• From “y is W of z” it follows that, vertically, y’s bounding box is contained in (or equal to) z’s bounding box, while horizontally y lies strictly to the left of z.  

Putting these together implies that x also lies strictly to the left of z (because x is horizontally within y, and y is to the left of z). Vertically, x may or may not lie fully above z. Consequently the only valid cardinal‐direction placements of x relative to z are W (same vertical extent as, or contained within, z) or NW (strictly above z).
