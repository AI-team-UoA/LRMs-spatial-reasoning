PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E (East) and SE (South‐East) are the only possibilities.  

Briefly, from x S y we have:  
• supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  

From y E z we have:  
• supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Together, these imply supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so x is necessarily to the right of z.  Checking each cardinal‐direction definition shows that exactly E (East) or SE (South‐East) can hold between x and z without contradiction.
