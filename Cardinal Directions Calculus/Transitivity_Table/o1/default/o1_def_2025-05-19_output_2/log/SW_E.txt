PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x SW y” means  
   supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  and  supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
while “y E z” means  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y),  infy(z) ≤ infy(y),  and  supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

From these it is straightforward to construct examples showing that x can lie in any of the following relations to z:

• SW (South‐West),  
• W  (West),  
• S  (South),  
• SE (South‐East),  
• E  (East),  
• B  (Bounding box contained in z).

Conversely, requiring x to be N, NE, or NW of z leads to contradictions once one also enforces “x SW y” and “y E z.”  

Hence, the possible relations of x to z are:  
B, S, SW, W, SE, E.
