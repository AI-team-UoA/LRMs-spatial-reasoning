PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NE (x,y) means x is strictly to the right and strictly above y.  
NW (y,z) means y is strictly to the left and strictly above z.  

From NW (y,z), we know z is “down‐right” from y; from NE (x,y), x is “up‐right” from y.  
• In the vertical dimension, these force z below y and y below x, so z is strictly below x.  
• In the horizontal dimension, both x and z lie to the right of y, but no constraint fixes whether x is to the left, right, or overlapping in x relative to z.  

Hence x can only be strictly above z (N), or above‐left (NW), or above‐right (NE).
