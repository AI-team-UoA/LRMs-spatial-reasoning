PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Narrowing down all possibilities systematically shows that the only impossible cases are precisely those that would force x to lie strictly to the left of z (namely W, NW, SW).  All other single‐tile relations can be realized by suitably placing x and z while still satisfying x SE y and y N z. 

Hence, the possible relations of x to z are:  
• N  
• NE  
• E  
• SE  
• S  
• B
