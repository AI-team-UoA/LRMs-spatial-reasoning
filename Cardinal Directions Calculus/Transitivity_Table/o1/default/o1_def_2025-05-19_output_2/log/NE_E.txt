PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NE and E are both possible. A quick way to see why is to note that “x NE y” forces x to lie strictly northeast of y, and “y E z” forces y to lie strictly east of z.  Chaining these implies x is strictly to the right of z, but in the vertical dimension x can lie either above all of z (making x NE of z) or still within z’s vertical extent (making x E of z).
