PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Basing ourselves strictly on the definitions:

•  x SW y  ⇒  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)  and  supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y).  
•  y B  z  ⇒  infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y),  supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z),  infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y),  supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z).

From these it follows that x is strictly to the southwest of y, while y’s bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box.  One can check by constructing examples (placing the three bounding boxes consistently) that the only ways x can relate to z are:

•  x B z  (x’s box is also fully inside z),  
•  x S z  (x lies strictly below z),  
•  x SW z (x lies southwest of z), or  
•  x W z  (x lies strictly to the left of z).

No other cardinal‐direction relation can be made consistent with x SW y and y B z. Thus the possible relations between x and z are:

B, S, SW, W.
