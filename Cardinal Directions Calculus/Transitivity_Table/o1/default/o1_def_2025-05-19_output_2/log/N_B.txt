PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N and B are both consistent with those two constraints.  In outline:

• From “x is N of y” one deduces that x lies entirely above y (so supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), and in the horizontal direction x is contained within y’s bounding box.  
• From “y is B of z” one deduces that y (and hence anything horizontally within y) is also horizontally within z, and vertically between infy(z) and supy(z).  

Putting these together, x can either lie entirely above z (making x N of z) or else still fit vertically within z’s bounding box (making x B of z).  No other cardinal‐direction relations remain possible under these conditions.
