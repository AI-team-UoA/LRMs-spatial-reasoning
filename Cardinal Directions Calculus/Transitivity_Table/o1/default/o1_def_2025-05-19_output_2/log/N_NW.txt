PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities, “x N y” implies:

1) supy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
2) infx(y) ≤ infx(x),  
3) supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

And “y NW z” implies:

4) supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
5) supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

From (3) and (4), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x lies entirely to the left of (or just touching) z. From (1) and (5), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so x lies entirely above (or just touching) z. Hence x is northwest of z.

Thus the only possible relation between x and z under those conditions is “NW.”
