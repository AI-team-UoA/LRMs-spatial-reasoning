PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are all consistent possibilities, whereas W, SW, and NW cannot occur. Intuitively, once x is known to lie to the northeast of y, and y is south of z, it is impossible for x to end up to the west of z. All other directions (above, to the right, or contained in z) remain possible under those constraints.
