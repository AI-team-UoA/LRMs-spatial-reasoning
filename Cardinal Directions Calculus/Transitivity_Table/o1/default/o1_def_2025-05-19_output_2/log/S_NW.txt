PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x being S of y tells us that x is directly “below” y in the bounding‐box sense, and y being NW of z tells us y is strictly “above and to the left” of z.  From these two facts one can deduce that x also lies strictly to the left of z (since x ⊆ y in the x‐direction and y is to the left of z).  However, vertically, x can lie above, below, or overlap z’s bounding box, so the only consistent possibilities are:

• x NW z,  
• x W z,  
• x SW z.
