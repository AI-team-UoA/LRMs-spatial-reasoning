PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, NW, W, E, and B are all consistent with “x NW y and y E z.” The three pure‐south relations (S, SE, SW) cannot occur, because x sits above y (from x NW y), while y is already within z’s vertical extent (from y E z). Consequently x cannot lie strictly below z. Thus the possible relations are exactly N, NE, NW, W, E, or B.
