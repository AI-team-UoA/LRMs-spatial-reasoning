PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities one can show that once x is “SE of” y and y is “S of” z, then x must lie strictly below z (because x lies below y and y lies below z).  Also, x cannot end up to the left of or above z (that would contradict x being to the right/below y, which itself is contained in or bounded by z).  The only ways to satisfy all bounding‐box constraints are that x is either

 • S of z (directly south, horizontally within z),  
 • SE of z (south‐east),  
 • E of z (directly east, vertically within z), or  
 • B of z (completely inside z’s bounding box).  

Hence the possible relations between x and z are: S, SE, E, or B.
