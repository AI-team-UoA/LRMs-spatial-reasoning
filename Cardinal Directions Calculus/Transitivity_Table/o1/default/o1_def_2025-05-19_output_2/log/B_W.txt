PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From  
• x B y ⇒ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  
• y W z ⇒ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z),  

one deduces  
1) supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
2) infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),  
3) supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  

Hence, relative to z, x satisfies  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(z),  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(x),  
• supy(x) ≤ supy(z),  

which is exactly the definition of x W z. Consequently, the only possible relation between x and z is W.
