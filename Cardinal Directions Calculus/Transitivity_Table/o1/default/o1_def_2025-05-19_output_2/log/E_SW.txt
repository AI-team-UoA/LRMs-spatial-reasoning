PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, we have:

• “x E y” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x)  
  supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

• “y SW z” means  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  
  supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, one key deduction comes from the y-coordinates:

1) supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

This shows that x is completely below z (its highest y-value is at or below z’s lowest y-value).  Hence, any cardinal direction from x to z must place x strictly below z (no vertical overlap).

Horizontally, however, we only know that y is to the left of both x and z (supx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), but we do not know whether x itself lies left of, right of, or directly under z.  Consequently, x could be:

• directly below z (S),  
• below and strictly to the left (SW),  
• or below and strictly to the right (SE).

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are precisely S, SW, or SE.
