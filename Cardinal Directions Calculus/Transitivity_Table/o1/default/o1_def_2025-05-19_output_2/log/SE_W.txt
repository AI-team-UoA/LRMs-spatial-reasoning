PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Basing the answer strictly on the bounding‚Äêbox definitions given, one finds that x cannot lie above z (which would require x to be N, NW, or NE of z) because x is below y and y is itself vertically contained in z.  All the other directions (B, S, SW, W, E, SE) can be realized by suitable placements of the boxes.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are:

B, S, SW, W, E, SE.
