PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B are all possible. The constraints “x SW y” and “y NE z” say nothing that forces a unique relative placement of x and z. Hence any of the nine relations between x and z can occur.
