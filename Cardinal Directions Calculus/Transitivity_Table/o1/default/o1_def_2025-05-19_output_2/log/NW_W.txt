PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N and S directions require x to lie horizontally within z; E and W directions require x to lie vertically within z; NE, SE, SW require the “wrong” horizontal ordering; and B requires overlap rather than strict separation in x.  

From x NW y we have:  
• supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is to the left of y)  
• supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (x is above y)  

From y W z we have:  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  
• infy(z) ≤ infy(y), supy(y) ≤ supy(z)  (y is vertically inside z)  

Putting these together forces supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is also to the left of z.  The only remaining possibilities among the defined directions that require “x left of z” are NW, W, or SW.  However, SW would force x below z, contradicting x being above y (which is inside z).  

Hence the only possible relations of x with respect to z are W or NW.
