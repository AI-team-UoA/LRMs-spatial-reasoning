PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From “x N y” we know x is directly above y (horizontally inside y’s box), and from “y SW z” we know y is strictly left‐and‐below z.  In particular:

• x N y  ⇒  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infx(x) ≥ infx(y), plus supy(y) ≤ infy(x).  
• y SW z ⇒  supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Putting these together, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x lies strictly to the left of z.  However, nothing fixes the vertical ordering of x relative to z (x could be above, below, or within z’s vertical span), so x can be W, NW, or SW of z.
