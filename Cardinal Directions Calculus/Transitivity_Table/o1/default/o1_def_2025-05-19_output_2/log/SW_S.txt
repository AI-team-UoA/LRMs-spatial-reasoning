PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Solely from the defining inequalities, one finds that x must lie strictly below z (because x lies below y and y lies below z).  In the horizontal direction, x can either be entirely “under” z (making x S z) or lie strictly to the left of z (making x SW z).  Consequently, the only possible single‐tile relations of x to z are S or SW.
