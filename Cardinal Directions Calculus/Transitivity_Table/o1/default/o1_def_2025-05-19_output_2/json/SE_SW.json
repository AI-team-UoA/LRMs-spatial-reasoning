{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Solely from \u201cx is SE of y\u201d and \u201cy is SW of z,\u201d one can deduce only that x must lie somewhere strictly south of z (because the top of x is below the bottom of y, and the bottom of y is below the bottom of z).  Horizontally, x can be to the left, contained, or to the right of z.  Consequently, the possible relations of x to z are exactly S, SW, or SE.", "elapsed-time": 29.714701414108276, "reasoning-tokens": 3584, "completion-tokens": 3732}
