{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "From the two given constraints\n\n\u2022 x W y \u21d2 supx(x) \u2264 infx(y), infy(y) \u2264 infy(x), and supy(x) \u2264 supy(y),  \n\u2022 y SE z \u21d2 supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z),\n\none key deduction is supy(x) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 infy(z).  Hence the top of x lies at or below the bottom of z, so x must lie strictly to the south of z (i.e., there is no vertical overlap).\n\nWhether x is directly south, southwest, or southeast of z depends on their x\u2010coordinates, which are not pinned down by the inequalities above.  Consequently, the only possible relations of x to z are\n\nS, SW, SE.", "elapsed-time": 66.14930319786072, "reasoning-tokens": 4608, "completion-tokens": 4823}
