{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NE (x,y) means x is strictly to the right and strictly above y.  \nNW (y,z) means y is strictly to the left and strictly above z.  \n\nFrom NW (y,z), we know z is \u201cdown\u2010right\u201d from y; from NE (x,y), x is \u201cup\u2010right\u201d from y.  \n\u2022 In the vertical dimension, these force z below y and y below x, so z is strictly below x.  \n\u2022 In the horizontal dimension, both x and z lie to the right of y, but no constraint fixes whether x is to the left, right, or overlapping in x relative to z.  \n\nHence x can only be strictly above z (N), or above\u2010left (NW), or above\u2010right (NE).
