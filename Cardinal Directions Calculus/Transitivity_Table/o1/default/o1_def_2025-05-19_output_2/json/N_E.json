{"prompt": "If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NE, E, and SE.  \n\nExplanation (informally):  \n\u2022 From \u201cx is N of y\u201d one knows y lies strictly below x (so supy(y) \u2264 infy(x)) and horizontally x is contained in y.  \n\u2022 From \u201cy is E of z\u201d one knows z lies strictly to the left of y (so supx(z) \u2264 infx(y)) and vertically y is contained in z.  \n\u2022 Combining these shows z is strictly to the left of x (so supx(z) \u2264 infx(x)), meaning x must be somewhere to the east of z. Vertically, x can lie above, roughly aligned, or below z without contradiction.  \n\u2022 Hence the only possible single\u2010tile relations between x and z are NE, E, or SE.
