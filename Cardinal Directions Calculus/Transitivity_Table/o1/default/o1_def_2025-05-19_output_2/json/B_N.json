{"prompt": "If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N.\n\nExplanation (for completeness):  \n\n1) From x B y, we have  \n   infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) \u2264 supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) and  \n   infy(y) \u2264 infy(x) \u2264 supy(x) \u2264 supy(y).  \n\n2) From y N z, we have  \n   supy(z) \u2264 infy(y),  \n   infx(z) \u2264 infx(y), and  \n   supx(y) \u2264 supx(z).  \n\nCombining, one finds in particular supy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 infy(x), so the entire bounding\u2010box of z lies strictly below that of x.  Meanwhile, horizontally,  \n   infx(z) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) and  \n   supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 supx(z),  \nso x\u2019s bounding\u2010box is contained (in the x\u2010direction) within z\u2019s bounding\u2010box.  \n\nHence x is \u201cnorth\u201d of z, and no other single\u2010tile relation is possible under these constraints.
