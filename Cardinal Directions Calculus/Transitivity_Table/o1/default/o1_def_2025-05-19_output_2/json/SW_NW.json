{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "x being SW of y tells us that supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y).  \ny being NW of z tells us that supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(z) \u2264 infy(y).  \n\nFrom supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z), we deduce supx(x) \u2264 infx(z), which means x is strictly to the left of z.  In the standard single-tile cardinal\u2010direction definitions, \u201cstrictly left\u201d only occurs in W, NW, or SW.  \n\nBecause there is no information forcing x and z to be aligned or ordered in the y\u2010coordinate (that is, we do not know infy(x) \u2264 infy(z) or infy(z) \u2264 infy(x), etc.), all three of W, NW, or SW remain possible.  \n\nHence, x can be W, NW, or SW of z.", "elapsed-time": 45.36040019989014, "reasoning-tokens": 3392, "completion-tokens": 3646}
