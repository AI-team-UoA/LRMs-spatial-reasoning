{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Basing ourselves strictly on the definitions:\n\n\u2022  x SW y  \u21d2  sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y)  and  sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y).  \n\u2022  y B  z  \u21d2  inf\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y),  sup\u2093(y) \u2264 sup\u2093(z),  inf\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y),  sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z).\n\nFrom these it follows that x is strictly to the southwest of y, while y\u2019s bounding box is contained in z\u2019s bounding box.  One can check by constructing examples (placing the three bounding boxes consistently) that the only ways x can relate to z are:\n\n\u2022  x B z  (x\u2019s box is also fully inside z),  \n\u2022  x S z  (x lies strictly below z),  \n\u2022  x SW z (x lies southwest of z), or  \n\u2022  x W z  (x lies strictly to the left of z).\n\nNo other cardinal\u2010direction relation can be made consistent with x SW y and y B z. Thus the possible relations between x and z are:\n\nB, S, SW, W.", "elapsed-time": 64.92020916938782, "reasoning-tokens": 5504, "completion-tokens": 5808}
