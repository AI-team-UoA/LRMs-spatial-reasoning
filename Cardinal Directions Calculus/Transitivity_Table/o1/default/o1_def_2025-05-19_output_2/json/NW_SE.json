{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B are all consistent with those two constraints. In other words, no cardinal relation between x and z is ruled out by \u201cx NW y\u201d together with \u201cy SE z.\u201d", "elapsed-time": 54.16852021217346, "reasoning-tokens": 4096, "completion-tokens": 4189}
