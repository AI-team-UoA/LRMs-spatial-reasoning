{"prompt": "If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N and B are both consistent with those two constraints.  In outline:\n\n\u2022 From \u201cx is N of y\u201d one deduces that x lies entirely above y (so supy(y) \u2264 infy(x)), and in the horizontal direction x is contained within y\u2019s bounding box.  \n\u2022 From \u201cy is B of z\u201d one deduces that y (and hence anything horizontally within y) is also horizontally within z, and vertically between infy(z) and supy(z).  \n\nPutting these together, x can either lie entirely above z (making x N of z) or else still fit vertically within z\u2019s bounding box (making x B of z).  No other cardinal\u2010direction relations remain possible under these conditions.", "elapsed-time": 94.51424980163574, "reasoning-tokens": 5824, "completion-tokens": 6016}
