{"prompt": "If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "B.  \n\nFrom the definition of \u201ca B b,\u201d we require that  \ninfx(b) \u2264 infx(a),  supx(a) \u2264 supx(b),  infy(b) \u2264 infy(a),  supy(a) \u2264 supy(b).  \n\nSince x is B of y and y is B of z, chaining the inequalities for x and y with those for y and z shows that infx(z) \u2264 infx(x) \u2264 supx(x) \u2264 supx(z) and infy(z) \u2264 infy(x) \u2264 supy(x) \u2264 supy(z).  By definition, these exactly satisfy x B z.  No other single\u2010tile cardinal relation can hold under these circumstances.", "elapsed-time": 32.972137451171875, "reasoning-tokens": 2752, "completion-tokens": 2936}
