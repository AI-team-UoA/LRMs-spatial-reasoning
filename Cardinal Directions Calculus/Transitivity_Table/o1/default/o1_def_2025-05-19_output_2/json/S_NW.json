{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "x being S of y tells us that x is directly \u201cbelow\u201d y in the bounding\u2010box sense, and y being NW of z tells us y is strictly \u201cabove and to the left\u201d of z.  From these two facts one can deduce that x also lies strictly to the left of z (since x \u2286 y in the x\u2010direction and y is to the left of z).  However, vertically, x can lie above, below, or overlap z\u2019s bounding box, so the only consistent possibilities are:\n\n\u2022 x NW z,  \n\u2022 x W z,  \n\u2022 x SW z.", "elapsed-time": 55.70442223548889, "reasoning-tokens": 3392, "completion-tokens": 3570}
