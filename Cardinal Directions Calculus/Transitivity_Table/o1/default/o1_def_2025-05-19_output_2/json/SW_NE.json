{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, or B are all possible. The constraints \u201cx SW y\u201d and \u201cy NE z\u201d say nothing that forces a unique relative placement of x and z. Hence any of the nine relations between x and z can occur.", "elapsed-time": 54.36938166618347, "reasoning-tokens": 3392, "completion-tokens": 3501}
