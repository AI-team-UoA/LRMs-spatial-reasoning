{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Satisfying \u201cx SW y\u201d means  \n   supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)  and  supy(x) \u2264 infy(y),  \nwhile \u201cy E z\u201d means  \n   supx(z) \u2264 infx(y),  infy(z) \u2264 infy(y),  and  supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).  \n\nFrom these it is straightforward to construct examples showing that x can lie in any of the following relations to z:\n\n\u2022 SW (South\u2010West),  \n\u2022 W  (West),  \n\u2022 S  (South),  \n\u2022 SE (South\u2010East),  \n\u2022 E  (East),  \n\u2022 B  (Bounding box contained in z).\n\nConversely, requiring x to be N, NE, or NW of z leads to contradictions once one also enforces \u201cx SW y\u201d and \u201cy E z.\u201d  \n\nHence, the possible relations of x to z are:  \nB, S, SW, W, SE, E.", "elapsed-time": 84.27242255210876, "reasoning-tokens": 7680, "completion-tokens": 7949}
