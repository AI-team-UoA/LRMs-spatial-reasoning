{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Solely from the defining inequalities, one finds that x must lie strictly below z (because x lies below y and y lies below z).  In the horizontal direction, x can either be entirely \u201cunder\u201d z (making x S z) or lie strictly to the left of z (making x SW z).  Consequently, the only possible single\u2010tile relations of x to z are S or SW.", "elapsed-time": 83.76181674003601, "reasoning-tokens": 6592, "completion-tokens": 6717}
