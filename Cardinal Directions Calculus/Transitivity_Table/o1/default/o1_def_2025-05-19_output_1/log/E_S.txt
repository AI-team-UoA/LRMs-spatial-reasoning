PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x is E of y” forces x’s bounding box to lie entirely to the right of y’s (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) but vertically within y’s bounding box. Meanwhile, “y is S of z” forces y’s bounding box entirely below z’s (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)) but horizontally within z’s. Putting these together shows that x must also lie strictly below z (since supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).

What remains undetermined is whether x fits horizontally inside z’s bounding box or sits entirely to the right of it. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is “S” of z. If instead supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is “SE” of z. Thus, the only possible relations of x to z are: S or SE.
