PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

B is transitive in the sense that from x B y and y B z it follows that x B z as well (the chain of inequalities for bounding boxes carries over). None of the other eight relations can hold once those B‚Äêinclusions have been assumed. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z in this scenario is B.
