PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B are all consistent with “x NE y” together with “y SW z.” In other words, every one of the nine single‐tile relations between x and z can be realized without violating x NE y and y SW z.
