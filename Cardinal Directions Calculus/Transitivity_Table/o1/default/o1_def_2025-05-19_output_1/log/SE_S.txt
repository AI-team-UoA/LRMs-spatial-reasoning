PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Sitting “SE of y” means that x lies strictly to the right and below y, and “y S of z” means that y lies strictly below z (with y horizontally within z).  Putting these together forces x also strictly below z.  Horizontally, x may lie entirely within z’s bounding box (making x “S” of z) or lie entirely to the right of z (making x “SE” of z).  Hence, the only possible relations of x to z are:  
• S  
• SE
