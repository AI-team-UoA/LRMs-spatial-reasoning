PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W of y tells us that x’s box is completely to the left of y’s box (i.e. supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)) and is “vertically contained” by y (in other words, infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y)).  
B of z tells us that y’s box lies entirely within z’s box (in both x and y dimensions).

Putting these together, x is vertically contained in y, and y is vertically contained in z, so x is also vertically contained in z.  
Horizontally, we only know supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y), so supₓ(x) might be either strictly to the left of infₓ(z) (making x W of z) or else lie between infₓ(z) and supₓ(z) (allowing x to be B of z if its infₓ(x) ≥ infₓ(z)).  

Hence, the only possible relations of x to z under these conditions are W or B.
