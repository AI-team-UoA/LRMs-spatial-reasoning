PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

SW of y means x is strictly to the left of y (supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)) and strictly below y (supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y)).  
W of z means y is strictly to the left of z (supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)) but vertically contained in z (infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z)).

Putting these together shows that x is strictly to the left of z (because supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)).  As for the vertical dimension, x could end up entirely below z (making x SW of z) or it could fit within the vertical extent of z (making x W of z).  No other single‐tile relations remain consistent with those bounding‐box constraints.  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: W, SW.
