PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x must lie strictly above and to the left of z.  In particular, from x B y we have  
• infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
• infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y),  

and from y NW z we have  
• supx(y) ≤ infx(z),  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y).  

Chain these together:

• supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is strictly to the left of z.  
• supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so x is strictly above z.  

Those two conditions exactly match x NW z and rule out all other single-tile relations.  

Thus, the only possible relation is NW.
