PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Narrowing down from the definitions, we know first that x W y implies:

• supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)  (x is strictly to the left of y),  
• infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y)  (x is vertically contained within y).

Next, y N z implies:

• supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y)  (z is strictly below y),  
• infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)  (y is horizontally contained within z).

Putting these together:

• Since supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) and infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x), it follows that supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x).  
  In other words, z is strictly below x (there is no vertical overlap).  
• Horizontally, we only know x is to the left of y and y is inside z; this does not fix x’s horizontal position relative to z.  
  – If supₓ(x) still lies to the left of infₓ(z), then x is “NW” of z.  
  – If instead infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z), then x is “N” of z.  

No other single‐tile relations (S, SE, E, NE, W, SW, B) can hold consistently with “x W y” and “y N z” under the given definitions.  Consequently, the possible relations between x and z are:

• N  
• NW
