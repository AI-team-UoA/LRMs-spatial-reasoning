PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the defining inequalities it follows that once x is “south” of y and y is “east” of z, x must lie strictly to the right of z (because y is to the right of z and x is horizontally contained in y) and can lie either level‐with or below z.  In terms of the nine cardinal‐direction definitions given, exactly those two possibilities can occur:

• x E z  
• x SE z  

No other cardinal‐direction relation between x and z is consistent with x S y and y E z.
