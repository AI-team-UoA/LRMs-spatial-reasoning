PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

SW of y means x is strictly to the left and below y (i.e. supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y)), while N of z means y is strictly above z (supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y), etc.).  From supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and infₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z) it follows that

supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),

so x must lie strictly to the left of z’s bounding box.  Depending on their relative vertical placements (which are unconstrained by x SW y and y N z alone), x can be below z, above z, or overlapped vertically (but still all to the left).  Hence the only possible relations of x to z are SW, W, or NW.
