PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x being N of y forces x to lie strictly above y in the vertical direction but still (horizontally) within y’s bounding box.  
y being SW of z forces y to lie strictly below and to the left of z in both coordinates.  

From y SW z one gets supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  
But since x N y also implies supx(x) ≤ supx(y), chaining these gives supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).  

Hence, x must lie entirely to the left of (or just touching) z in the x-coordinate.  In the y‑coordinate, however, no direct constraint emerges between x and z: x could be above, below, or vertically overlapping with z’s bounding box.  

By the definitions of the single-tile relations, for one region a to be strictly to the left of another region b, we need supx(a) ≤ infx(b); then whether a is above, below, or overlapping vertically with b decides whether the relation is NW, SW, or W.  

Therefore, given that x is “to the left” of z and we do not know their precise vertical stacking, the only possible single-tile cardinal relations between x and z are NW, W, or SW.
