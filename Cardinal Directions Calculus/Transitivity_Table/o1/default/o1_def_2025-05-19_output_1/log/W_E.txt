PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W of y tells us that x sits strictly to the left of y (no horizontal overlap) but is vertically contained in y.  
E of z tells us that y sits strictly to the right of z (again, no horizontal overlap) but is vertically contained in z.  

Putting these together forces x to be vertically contained in z as well (because x is contained in y and y is contained in z, so x is contained in z vertically).  However, there is no forced left‐right ordering between x and z: x could be still further left than z, or further right than z, or even be horizontally contained in z.  

Hence the only single‐tile cardinal relations x can bear to z (which require either no horizontal overlap or complete containment, and no vertical separation) are:

• W  (x strictly to the left of z),  
• E  (x strictly to the right of z),  
• B  (x is contained in z’s bounding box).

All other single‐tile relations (N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW) require a vertical separation that is impossible here, so they cannot arise.
