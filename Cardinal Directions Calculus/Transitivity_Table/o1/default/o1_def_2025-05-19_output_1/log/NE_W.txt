PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Narrowing down the possibilities amounts to checking which of the nine basic relations  
{N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B}  
can still hold between x and z when

• x is NE of y (so supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)),  
• y is W of z (so supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

One sees that x cannot be south (S, SE, SW) of z, because x lies above y—which itself lies vertically within z.  However, by choosing suitable bounding‐box sizes and placements, x may be contained in z (B), may lie strictly west (W) or east (E) of z (while still above y), or may lie above z (N, NW, NE).  

Hence the possible relations between x and z are exactly  
{W, NW, N, NE, E, B}.
