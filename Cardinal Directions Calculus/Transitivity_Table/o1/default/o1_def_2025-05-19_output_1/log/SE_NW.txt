PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B are all possible. The reason is that “x SE y” and “y NW z” only place x and z both to the right and both below y but do not impose any direct constraint fixing x’s position relative to z. Consequently, x can lie in any of the nine cardinal‐direction configurations with respect to z.
