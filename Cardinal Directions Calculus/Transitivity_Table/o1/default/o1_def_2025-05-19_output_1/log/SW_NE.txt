PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B. All nine are possible. Because x and z are both only required to lie to the southwest of y, no further constraint is imposed that would rule out any particular relative positioning of x with respect to z.
