PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x SE y” forces x to lie strictly to the right and below y (i.e., supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), while “y W z” forces y strictly to the left of z but vertically inside z (i.e., supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).  From these two facts alone, one cannot pin down a single relative position of x with respect to z because x could end up anywhere “below” y (which is itself inside z vertically) and either to the left, inside, or to the right of z.  

A straightforward check of each of the nine cardinal‐direction definitions shows that x cannot be above z (so N, NE, NW are impossible), but all of B, S, W, SW, E, SE can be realized by suitable choices of bounding boxes.  Hence the possible relations between x and z are:  

B, S, W, SW, E, SE.
