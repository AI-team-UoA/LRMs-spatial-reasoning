PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E of y tells us that x lies strictly to the right of y but is vertically contained within y. Meanwhile, B of z tells us that y’s entire bounding box is contained in z’s bounding box. Putting these together, one sees that x can either remain fully inside z’s bounding box (so x B z) or lie entirely to the right of z (so x E z). None of the other directions can be satisfied without contradicting vertical or horizontal containment. 

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are: B or E.
