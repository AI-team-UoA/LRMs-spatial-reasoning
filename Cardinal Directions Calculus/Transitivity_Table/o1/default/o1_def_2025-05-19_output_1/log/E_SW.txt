PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x is E of y” means, in particular, that x lies (at least) strictly to the right of y in the x‐direction, and satisfying “y is SW of z” means y lies strictly below and to the left of z.  From these it follows that x itself must lie strictly below z (because y is below z and x is contained vertically within y’s bounding box).  Horizontally, however, x could be entirely to the left of z, entirely to the right of z, or “underneath” z (i.e., horizontally within z’s bounding box).  Hence the only possible relations between x and z are S, SW, or SE.
