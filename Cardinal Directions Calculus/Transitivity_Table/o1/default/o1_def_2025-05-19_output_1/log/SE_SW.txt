PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the definitions, “x SE y” means x lies strictly to the right and below y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), and “y SW z” means y lies strictly to the left and below z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).  One can show by explicit “bounding‐box” constructions that under these two constraints, x can only end up:

• strictly below z (possibly lined up in x, or to the left, or to the right), or  
• wholly inside z’s bounding box.  

In terms of the single‐tile relations, those possibilities correspond exactly to x being S, SW, SE, or B relative to z.  One can construct concrete examples realizing each of these four cases, and no other cardinal‐direction relations are consistent with “x SE y” and “y SW z.”  

Hence the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, SE, or B.
