PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x SW y” (so x is left‐and‐below y) together with “y E z” (so y is right‐and‐within z vertically) forces x to lie somewhere to the left of y and below y, while z is to the left of y but vertically large enough to contain y.  One can check by constructing explicit bounding‐box examples that x may then be:

• fully inside z (B),  
• strictly to the left of z (W),  
• strictly to the left‐and‐below z (SW),  
• strictly below z (S),  
• strictly right‐and‐below z (SE), or  
• strictly to the right of z (E).  

What cannot happen is for x to lie wholly above z (N, NE, NW), because that would contradict x’s being below y while y is itself contained (vertically) in z.  

Hence the possible relations of x to z are  
B, S, SW, W, SE, E.
