PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NE, E, or SE.  

Explanation (informally):  
• From “x is S of y” and “y is NE of z,” one deduces supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x).  
  That places x strictly to the right of z.  
• In the vertical dimension, however, there is no forced ordering between x and z (they could be aligned or one could be above/below the other).  
• Hence x can only be NE, E, or SE of z.
