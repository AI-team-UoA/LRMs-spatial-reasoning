PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Narrowing down all possibilities systematically shows that X cannot lie strictly below Z (which would be “S”, “SW”, or “SE”) once X is northwest of Y and Y in turn is east of Z.  However, one can construct examples realizing all of the remaining six directions (B, W, NW, N, NE, E).  Consequently, the possible single‐tile relations of X to Z are exactly:

B, W, NW, N, NE, or E.
