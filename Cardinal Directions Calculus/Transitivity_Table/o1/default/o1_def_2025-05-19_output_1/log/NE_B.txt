PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NE, E, or B.  

Explanation (informally):  
• From “x NE y” we know, in bounding‐box terms, that x lies strictly to the right and above y.  
• From “y B z” we know that y’s bounding box lies entirely within z’s bounding box.  
• Putting these together, x can still lie within z’s bounding box (which would make x B z), or else x can overshoot z in the rightward, upward, or both right‐and‐upward directions (making x E z, N z, or NE z).  
• All other directions force contradictions once one observes that y is itself contained in z but x is strictly to the northeast of y.
