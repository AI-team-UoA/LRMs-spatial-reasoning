PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

E of y puts x strictly to the right of y (with x’s box within y’s vertical bounds), and W of z puts y strictly to the left of z (with y’s box within z’s vertical bounds).  Altogether this forces x to lie within the vertical extent of z but does not fix whether x is to the left of z, to the right of z, or wholly inside z’s bounding box horizontally.  Consequently, x can only be  
• E of z,  
• W of z, or  
• B of z  

(and no other single‐tile relation).
