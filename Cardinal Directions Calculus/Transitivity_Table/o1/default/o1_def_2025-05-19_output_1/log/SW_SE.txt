PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

S, SW, and SE are all possible. Specifically, from  
• x SW y ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y),  
• y SE z ⇒ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  

one deduces supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), i.e. the top of x is below the bottom of z. This rules out any relation where x and z must vertically overlap or x is above z (so W, NW, N, NE, E, B are impossible). What remains feasible, depending on how one arranges their x-coordinates, are precisely S (directly below), SW (below and to the left), or SE (below and to the right).
