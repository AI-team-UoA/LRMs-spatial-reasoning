PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W and SW are the only possibilities.  In outline:  
• From “x S y” one has supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y).  
• From “y W z” one has supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).  
Combining these implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is strictly to the left of z.  Vertically, x may lie fully below z (making x SW of z) or may overlap z’s y‐range (making x W of z).  No other cardinal directions satisfy those bounding‐box constraints.
