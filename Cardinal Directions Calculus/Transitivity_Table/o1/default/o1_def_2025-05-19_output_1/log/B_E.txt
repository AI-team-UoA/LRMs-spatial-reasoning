PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the given definitions, “x B y” entails that x’s bounding box is contained inside y’s bounding box; and “y E z” entails that y lies entirely to the right of z (with vertical extents of y contained in those of z).  Chaining these gives:

•  Because x B y, x’s box is inside y’s box.  
•  Because y E z, y (hence also x) must lie to the right of z, and vertically y (and thus x) is contained in z’s vertical bounds.

Concretely, one obtains  
   supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)   and   infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

These are precisely the conditions for “x E z”:  
   1) supx(z) ≤ infx(x),  
   2) infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

No other single‐tile relation can hold under these constraints.  Hence, the only possible relation between x and z is:  
E.
