PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Solely from “x W y” one deduces that x is strictly to the left of y (supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y)) and vertically contained in y’s bounding box (infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) and supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y)).  
From “y S z” one deduces y is strictly below z (supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z)) and horizontally contained in z’s bounding box (infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z)).  

Putting these together forces  
• supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
so x also lies entirely below z in the vertical direction.  

Once x is below z, the only ways x can relate to z in the nine‐direction scheme are “S” (if x’s bounding box lies horizontally within z’s) or “SW” (if x is both left and below).  Indeed:

• x S z happens exactly when  
  – supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z),  
  – infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z).  

• x SW z happens exactly when  
  – supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z),  
  – supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).  

Both can be realized by appropriate placements of the three regions (one can construct explicit examples for each).  No other cardinal‐direction relation for x with respect to z is consistent with “x W y” and “y S z.”  

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: S, SW.
