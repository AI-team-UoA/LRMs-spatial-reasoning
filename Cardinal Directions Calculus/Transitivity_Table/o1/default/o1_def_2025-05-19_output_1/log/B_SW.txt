PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From “x B y” we know that the bounding box of x is contained in that of y, i.e.  
  infx(y) ≤ infx(x),   supx(x) ≤ supx(y),  
  infy(y) ≤ infy(x),   supy(x) ≤ supy(y).  

From “y SW z” we know that  
  supx(y) ≤ infx(z),   supy(y) ≤ infy(z).  

Together, these imply  
  supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)   and   supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z),  
which exactly matches the defining condition  
  supx(x) ≤ infx(z)   and   supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Hence, x can only be SW of z.
