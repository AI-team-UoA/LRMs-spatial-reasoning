PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible relations are exactly those for which one can construct a configuration satisfying both “x NW y” and “y S z.”  A straightforward geometric check shows that x can end up NW, N, W, SW, S, or B of z, and cannot be NE, E, or SE of z. Thus the possible answers are:

NW, N, W, SW, S, B.
