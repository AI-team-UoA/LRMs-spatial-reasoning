PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Satisfying “x W y” forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (and vertically contained in y), while “y SE z” forces y to lie strictly to the right and below z.  From this, x must also lie strictly below z (since x is contained in y’s vertical span and y is below z).  However, there is no information fixing x’s horizontal position relative to z.  Consequently, x can only be below z in one of three ways:

• purely south of z (S),  
• south‐west of z (SW), or  
• south‐east of z (SE).
