PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W and NW are both possible.  

Explanation (sketch):  
• From “x N y,” one deduces that x’s bounding box lies strictly above y’s bounding box yet is horizontally contained within y.  
• From “y W z,” one deduces that y’s bounding box lies strictly to the left of z’s bounding box yet is vertically contained within z.  
• Putting these together forces x also to lie to the left of z (since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).  
• Vertically, x may either sit entirely within z’s vertical extent (making x W z) or lie strictly above z (making x NW z).  
• Other cardinal relations are ruled out by the requisite bounding‐box inequalities.
