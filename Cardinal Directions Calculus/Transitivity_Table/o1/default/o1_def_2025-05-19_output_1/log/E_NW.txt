PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, NW, or NE are all possible. The key point is that from “x E y” and “y NW z,” one deduces that x lies strictly above z (since y is above z and x is within y’s vertical extent), but there is no constraint forcing x to be left, right, or horizontally contained relative to z. Thus x can be directly above z (N) or else above and to the left (NW) or above and to the right (NE).
