PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x must lie strictly to the left of z (since, chaining the two relations, one obtains supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).  However, no vertical ordering between x and z is forced by the given constraints.  Consequently, the only possibilities are that x is NW, W, or SW of z.
