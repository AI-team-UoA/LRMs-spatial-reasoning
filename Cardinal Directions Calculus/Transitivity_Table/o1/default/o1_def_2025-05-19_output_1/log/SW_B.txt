PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

From the two given constraints  
• x SW y ⇒ supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
• y B z  ⇒ infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z) and infᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(z),  

one can show that the only ways to place x relative to z (so as not to violate those bounding‐box inequalities) are:

• x B z,  
• x S z,  
• x W z,  
• x SW z.  

All other directions (N, NE, NW, E, SE) require x to lie above or to the right of z or both, which is incompatible with having x below‐left of y while y itself sits fully inside z. Thus the possible relations between x and z are precisely {B, S, W, SW}.
