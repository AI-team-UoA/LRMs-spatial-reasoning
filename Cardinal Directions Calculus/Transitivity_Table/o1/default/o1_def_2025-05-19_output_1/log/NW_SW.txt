PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NW of y means x is strictly to the left of y and strictly above y (so supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).  
SW of z means y is strictly to the left of z and strictly below z (so supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).  

Chaining these gives supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is strictly to the left of z.  However, there is no forced vertical ordering between x and z: x could lie entirely above z, entirely below z, or be “vertically inside” z’s bounding box.  Consequently, the only consistent single‐tile relations of x to z are exactly  
• NW (x strictly left and strictly above z),  
• W  (x strictly left of z and vertically contained),  
• SW (x strictly left and strictly below z).
