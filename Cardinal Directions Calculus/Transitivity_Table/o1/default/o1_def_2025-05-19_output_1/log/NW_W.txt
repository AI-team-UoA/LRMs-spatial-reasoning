PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

W and NW.  

Reasoning (in brief):  
• From x NW y we get:  
  – supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is strictly to the left of y),  
  – supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (x is strictly above y).  

• From y W z we get:  
  – supx(y) ≤ infx(z)  (y is strictly to the left of z),  
  – infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)  (y is vertically contained in z).  

Chaining supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) shows that x must also lie strictly to the left of z.  In the vertical dimension, x can either lie entirely within z’s vertical span (making x W of z) or lie entirely above z (making x NW of z).  No other single‐tile relations satisfy all these bounding‐box constraints.
