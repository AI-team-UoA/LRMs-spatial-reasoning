PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

N, B, and S are all consistent possibilities.  In short:

• N of z can happen if x is placed entirely above z (so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)),  
• B of z can happen if x’s bounding box is contained in z’s (so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)),  
• S of z can happen if x is placed entirely below z (so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).
