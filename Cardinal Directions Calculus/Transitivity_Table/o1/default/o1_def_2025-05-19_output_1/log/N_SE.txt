PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x must lie strictly to the right of z (since from “y is SE of z” we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y), and from “x is N of y” we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).  However, nothing in the given constraints fixes whether x is above, below, or overlapping z vertically.  Consequently, the only consistent single‐tile relations of x to z are E, NE, or SE.
