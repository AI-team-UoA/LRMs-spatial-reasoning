PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Sitting “south” of y only tells us that x lies strictly below y (with horizontal bounding‐box overlap), and y being “north” of z tells us that z lies strictly below y (again with horizontal overlap).  From these two facts alone there is no forced vertical ordering between x and z, nor is there any forced containment one way or the other.  However, one can rule out purely “east,” “west,” or diagonal relations (SW, NW, SE, NE), because x’s bounding box is ‟inside” y’s in the horizontal direction and y’s is inside z’s—so x cannot lie strictly to one side of z.  

What remains possible are:

• x S z  (if x ends up entirely below z),  
• x N z  (if x ends up entirely above z), or  
• x B z  (if x is contained in z’s bounding box).

Thus the possible single‐tile relations between x and z are {S, N, B}.
