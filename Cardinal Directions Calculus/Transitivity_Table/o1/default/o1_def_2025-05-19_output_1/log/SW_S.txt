PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Solely from the definitions, we know that  
•  x SW y ⇒ supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y),  
•  y S z  ⇒ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z) and infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z).  

From these it follows that supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(y) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z), so x must lie entirely below z (i.e., supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z)).  However, in the x‐direction, since supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) and infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y), x can either lie strictly to the left of z (so supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)) or else be horizontally within z’s bounding box (so infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z)).  

By the cardinal‐direction definitions, those two possibilities correspond exactly to x being “SW of z” (when supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z) and supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z)) or “S of z” (when infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x) and supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(z), with supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z)).  

Hence, the possible relations between x and z are: S or SW.
