{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "SW of y means x is strictly to the left of y (sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y)) and strictly below y (sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y)).  \nW of z means y is strictly to the left of z (sup\u2093(y) \u2264 inf\u2093(z)) but vertically contained in z (inf\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y) and sup\u1d67(y) \u2264 sup\u1d67(z)).\n\nPutting these together shows that x is strictly to the left of z (because sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) \u2264 sup\u2093(y) \u2264 inf\u2093(z)).  As for the vertical dimension, x could end up entirely below z (making x SW of z) or it could fit within the vertical extent of z (making x W of z).  No other single\u2010tile relations remain consistent with those bounding\u2010box constraints.  \n\nThus, the possible relations between x and z are: W, SW.", "elapsed-time": 75.36535882949829, "reasoning-tokens": 5376, "completion-tokens": 5636}
