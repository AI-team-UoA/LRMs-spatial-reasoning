{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Narrowing down from the definitions, we know first that x\u202fW\u202fy implies:\n\n\u2022 sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y)  (x is strictly to the left of y),  \n\u2022 inf\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x) and sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 sup\u1d67(y)  (x is vertically contained within y).\n\nNext, y\u202fN\u202fz implies:\n\n\u2022 sup\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y)  (z is strictly below y),  \n\u2022 inf\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) and sup\u2093(y) \u2264 sup\u2093(z)  (y is horizontally contained within z).\n\nPutting these together:\n\n\u2022 Since sup\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y) and inf\u1d67(y) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x), it follows that sup\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(x).  \n  In other words, z is strictly below x (there is no vertical overlap).  \n\u2022 Horizontally, we only know x is to the left of y and y is inside z; this does not fix x\u2019s horizontal position relative to z.  \n  \u2013 If sup\u2093(x) still lies to the left of inf\u2093(z), then x is \u201cNW\u201d of z.  \n  \u2013 If instead inf\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(x) and sup\u2093(x) \u2264 sup\u2093(z), then x is \u201cN\u201d of z.  \n\nNo other single\u2010tile relations (S, SE, E, NE, W, SW, B) can hold consistently with \u201cx\u202fW\u202fy\u201d and \u201cy\u202fN\u202fz\u201d under the given definitions.
