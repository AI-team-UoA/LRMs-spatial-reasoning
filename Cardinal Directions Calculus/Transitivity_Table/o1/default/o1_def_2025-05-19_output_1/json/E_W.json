{"prompt": "If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "E of y puts x strictly to the right of y (with x\u2019s box within y\u2019s vertical bounds), and W of z puts y strictly to the left of z (with y\u2019s box within z\u2019s vertical bounds).  Altogether this forces x to lie within the vertical extent of z but does not fix whether x is to the left of z, to the right of z, or wholly inside z\u2019s bounding box horizontally.  Consequently, x can only be  \n\u2022 E of z,  \n\u2022 W of z, or  \n\u2022 B of z  \n\n(and no other single\u2010tile relation).", "elapsed-time": 86.21888065338135, "reasoning-tokens": 6464, "completion-tokens": 6649}
