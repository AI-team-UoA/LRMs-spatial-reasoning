{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NE, E, or SE.  \n\nExplanation (informally):  \n\u2022 From \u201cx is S of y\u201d and \u201cy is NE of z,\u201d one deduces sup\u2093(z) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) \u2264 inf\u2093(x).  \n  That places x strictly to the right of z.  \n\u2022 In the vertical dimension, however, there is no forced ordering between x and z (they could be aligned or one could be above/below the other).  \n\u2022 Hence x can only be NE, E, or SE of z.", "elapsed-time": 68.09817695617676, "reasoning-tokens": 4416, "completion-tokens": 4572}
