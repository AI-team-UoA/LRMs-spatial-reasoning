{"prompt": "If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Satisfying \u201cx is E of y\u201d means, in particular, that x lies (at least) strictly to the right of y in the x\u2010direction, and satisfying \u201cy is SW of z\u201d means y lies strictly below and to the left of z.  From these it follows that x itself must lie strictly below z (because y is below z and x is contained vertically within y\u2019s bounding box).  Horizontally, however, x could be entirely to the left of z, entirely to the right of z, or \u201cunderneath\u201d z (i.e., horizontally within z\u2019s bounding box).  Hence the only possible relations between x and z are S, SW, or SE.", "elapsed-time": 49.55982995033264, "reasoning-tokens": 3456, "completion-tokens": 3661}
