{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "SW of y means x is strictly to the left and below y (i.e. sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) and sup\u1d67(x) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y)), while N of z means y is strictly above z (sup\u1d67(z) \u2264 inf\u1d67(y), etc.).  From sup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(y) and inf\u2093(y) \u2264 inf\u2093(z) it follows that\n\nsup\u2093(x) \u2264 inf\u2093(z),\n\nso x must lie strictly to the left of z\u2019s bounding box.  Depending on their relative vertical placements (which are unconstrained by x SW y and y N z alone), x can be below z, above z, or overlapped vertically (but still all to the left).  Hence the only possible relations of x to z are SW, W, or NW.", "elapsed-time": 42.084405183792114, "reasoning-tokens": 3136, "completion-tokens": 3365}
