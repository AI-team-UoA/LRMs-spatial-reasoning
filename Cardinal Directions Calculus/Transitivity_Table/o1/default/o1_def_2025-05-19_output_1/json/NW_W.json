{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W and NW.  \n\nReasoning (in brief):  \n\u2022 From x NW y we get:  \n  \u2013 supx(x) \u2264 infx(y)  (x is strictly to the left of y),  \n  \u2013 supy(y) \u2264 infy(x)  (x is strictly above y).  \n\n\u2022 From y W z we get:  \n  \u2013 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)  (y is strictly to the left of z),  \n  \u2013 infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) and supy(y) \u2264 supy(z)  (y is vertically contained in z).  \n\nChaining supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) shows that x must also lie strictly to the left of z.  In the vertical dimension, x can either lie entirely within z\u2019s vertical span (making x W of z) or lie entirely above z (making x NW of z).  No other single\u2010tile relations satisfy all these bounding\u2010box constraints.", "elapsed-time": 86.8341932296753, "reasoning-tokens": 5760, "completion-tokens": 6022}
