{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Satisfying \u201cx W y\u201d forces x to lie strictly to the left of y (and vertically contained in y), while \u201cy SE z\u201d forces y to lie strictly to the right and below z.  From this, x must also lie strictly below z (since x is contained in y\u2019s vertical span and y is below z).  However, there is no information fixing x\u2019s horizontal position relative to z.  Consequently, x can only be below z in one of three ways:\n\n\u2022 purely south of z (S),  \n\u2022 south\u2010west of z (SW), or  \n\u2022 south\u2010east of z (SE).", "elapsed-time": 45.05526947975159, "reasoning-tokens": 3264, "completion-tokens": 3442}
