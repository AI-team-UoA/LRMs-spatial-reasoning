{"prompt": "If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W and NW are both possible.  \n\nExplanation (sketch):  \n\u2022 From \u201cx\u202fN\u202fy,\u201d one deduces that x\u2019s bounding box lies strictly above y\u2019s bounding box yet is horizontally contained within y.  \n\u2022 From \u201cy\u202fW\u202fz,\u201d one deduces that y\u2019s bounding box lies strictly to the left of z\u2019s bounding box yet is vertically contained within z.  \n\u2022 Putting these together forces x also to lie to the left of z (since supx(x) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)).  \n\u2022 Vertically, x may either sit entirely within z\u2019s vertical extent (making x\u202fW\u202fz) or lie strictly above z (making x\u202fNW\u202fz).  \n\u2022 Other cardinal relations are ruled out by the requisite bounding\u2010box inequalities.", "elapsed-time": 81.49924778938293, "reasoning-tokens": 6272, "completion-tokens": 6488}
