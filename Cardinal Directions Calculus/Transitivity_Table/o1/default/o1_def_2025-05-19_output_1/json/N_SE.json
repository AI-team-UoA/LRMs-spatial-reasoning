{"prompt": "If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "x must lie strictly to the right of z (since from \u201cy is SE of z\u201d we get supx(z) \u2264 infx(y), and from \u201cx is N of y\u201d we have infx(y) \u2264 infx(x), so supx(z) \u2264 infx(x)).  However, nothing in the given constraints fixes whether x is above, below, or overlapping z vertically.  Consequently, the only consistent single\u2010tile relations of x to z are E, NE, or SE.", "elapsed-time": 51.456860065460205, "reasoning-tokens": 3520, "completion-tokens": 3684}
