{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "S, SW, and SE are all possible. Specifically, from  \n\u2022 x SW y \u21d2 supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(x) \u2264 infy(y),  \n\u2022 y SE z \u21d2 supx(z) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z),  \n\none deduces supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 infy(z), i.e. the top of x is below the bottom of z. This rules out any relation where x and z must vertically overlap or x is above z (so W, NW, N, NE, E, B are impossible). What remains feasible, depending on how one arranges their x-coordinates, are precisely S (directly below), SW (below and to the left), or SE (below and to the right).", "elapsed-time": 67.05021858215332, "reasoning-tokens": 4288, "completion-tokens": 4509}
