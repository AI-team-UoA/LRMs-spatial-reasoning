{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N and NW.  In brief, x must lie strictly above z (since x is above y and y is above z), so x cannot be S, SE, SW, or B of z.  Furthermore, because x is to the left of y (x NW y) while y is horizontally inside z (y N z), x can either sit wholly to the left of z (making x NW z) or be horizontally within z\u2019s bounds (making x N z).", "elapsed-time": 87.959308385849, "reasoning-tokens": 5888, "completion-tokens": 6032}
