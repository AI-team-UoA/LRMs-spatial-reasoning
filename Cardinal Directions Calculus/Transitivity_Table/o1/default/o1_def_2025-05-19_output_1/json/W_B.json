{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W\u202fof\u202fy tells us that x\u2019s box is completely to the left of y\u2019s box (i.e. sup\u2093(x)\u202f\u2264\u202finf\u2093(y)) and is \u201cvertically contained\u201d by y (in other words, inf\u1d67(y)\u202f\u2264\u202finf\u1d67(x) and sup\u1d67(x)\u202f\u2264\u202fsup\u1d67(y)).  \nB\u202fof\u202fz tells us that y\u2019s box lies entirely within z\u2019s box (in both x and y dimensions).\n\nPutting these together, x is vertically contained in y, and y is vertically contained in z, so x is also vertically contained in z.  \nHorizontally, we only know sup\u2093(x)\u202f\u2264\u202finf\u2093(y) and inf\u2093(z)\u202f\u2264\u202finf\u2093(y), so sup\u2093(x) might be either strictly to the left of inf\u2093(z) (making x W\u202fof\u202fz) or else lie between inf\u2093(z) and sup\u2093(z) (allowing x to be B\u202fof\u202fz if its inf\u2093(x) \u2265 inf\u2093(z)).  \n\nHence, the only possible relations of x to z under these conditions are W or B.", "elapsed-time": 81.81437563896179, "reasoning-tokens": 4800, "completion-tokens": 5103}
