{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "x must lie strictly to the left of z (since, chaining the two relations, one obtains supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z)).  However, no vertical ordering between x and z is forced by the given constraints.  Consequently, the only possibilities are that x is NW, W, or SW of z.", "elapsed-time": 32.45830297470093, "reasoning-tokens": 2048, "completion-tokens": 2171}
