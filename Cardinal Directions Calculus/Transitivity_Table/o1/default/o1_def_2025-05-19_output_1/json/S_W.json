{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "W and SW are the only possibilities.  In outline:  \n\u2022 From \u201cx S y\u201d one has supy(x) \u2264 infy(y) and infx(y) \u2264 infx(x) \u2264 supx(x) \u2264 supx(y).  \n\u2022 From \u201cy W z\u201d one has supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and infy(z) \u2264 infy(y) \u2264 supy(y) \u2264 supy(z).  \nCombining these implies supx(x) \u2264 infx(z), so x is strictly to the left of z.  Vertically, x may lie fully below z (making x SW of z) or may overlap z\u2019s y\u2010range (making x W of z).
