{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "N, NE, E, or B.  \n\nExplanation (informally):  \n\u2022 From \u201cx NE y\u201d we know, in bounding\u2010box terms, that x lies strictly to the right and above y.  \n\u2022 From \u201cy B z\u201d we know that y\u2019s bounding box lies entirely within z\u2019s bounding box.  \n\u2022 Putting these together, x can still lie within z\u2019s bounding box (which would make x B z), or else x can overshoot z in the rightward, upward, or both right\u2010and\u2010upward directions (making x E z, N z, or NE z).  \n\u2022 All other directions force contradictions once one observes that y is itself contained in z but x is strictly to the northeast of y.
