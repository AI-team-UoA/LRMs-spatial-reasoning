{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "NW of y means x is strictly to the left of y and strictly above y (so supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(x)).  \nSW of z means y is strictly to the left of z and strictly below z (so supx(y) \u2264 infx(z) and supy(y) \u2264 infy(z)).  \n\nChaining these gives supx(x) \u2264 infx(y) \u2264 supx(y) \u2264 infx(z), so x is strictly to the left of z.  However, there is no forced vertical ordering between x and z: x could lie entirely above z, entirely below z, or be \u201cvertically inside\u201d z\u2019s bounding box.  Consequently, the only consistent single\u2010tile relations of x to z are exactly  \n\u2022 NW (x strictly left and strictly above z),  \n\u2022 W  (x strictly left of z and vertically contained),  \n\u2022 SW (x strictly left and strictly below z).", "elapsed-time": 58.16035175323486, "reasoning-tokens": 4352, "completion-tokens": 4608}
