PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. We are given the following relations:
1.  x S y
2.  y N z

Let's write down the definitions of these relations in terms of bounding box coordinates:
x S y means:
supy(x) <= infy(y)
infx(y) <= infx(x)
supx(x) <= supx(y)

y N z means:
supy(z) <= infy(y)
infx(z) <= infx(y)
supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints these conditions impose on the bounding boxes of x and z.

Combining the horizontal constraints:
From x S y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
From y N z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Transitivity of inequalities gives us:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) => infx(z) <= infx(x)
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) => supx(x) <= supx(z)

These are the necessary horizontal conditions that must hold between x and z:
(H1) infx(z) <= infx(x)
(H2) supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now let's consider the vertical constraints:
From x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
From y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

These conditions state that both supy(x) and supy(z) are less than or equal to infy(y). This puts both regions x and z (at least their top boundaries) below or at the bottom boundary of y. This doesn't give a direct vertical relationship between x and z's bounding boxes, such as supy(x) vs infy(z) or infy(x) vs supy(z).

Let's examine the possible cardinal relations R between x and z (x R z) and check if their definitions are consistent with (H1), (H2) and if a consistent vertical relationship is possible. The regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, implying their bounding boxes are non-degenerate (infx < supx, infy < supy).

1.  x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    - Horizontal conditions match (H1) and (H2).
    - Vertical condition: supy(z) <= infy(x). Is this possible given supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)?
      Let y be [0,1]x[0,1]. infy(y)=0.
      x S y => supy(x) <= 0. Let x = [0,1]x[-0.5, 0]. infy(x)=-0.5, supy(x)=0.
      y N z => supy(z) <= 0. Let z = [0,1]x[-1, -0.6]. infy(z)=-1, supy(z)=-0.6.
      (We need to ensure the horizontal conditions for x S y and y N z also hold, but we can choose x and z to have their x-spans within y's x-span, and y's x-span within z's x-span by adjusting infx/supx values. For simplicity in vertical check, let x, y, z have x-span [0,1], [-1,1], [-2,2] respectively, which satisfies the nested horizontal conditions derived earlier).
      Let y=[-1,1]x[0,1]. x=[-0.5,0.5]x[-0.5,-0.1]. z=[-2,2]x[-1,-0.6].
      x S y: supy(x)=-0.1 <= infy(y)=0 (Yes). infx(y)=-1 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (Yes). supx(x)=0.5 <= supx(y)=1 (Yes). Holds.
      y N z: supy(z)=-0.6 <= infy(y)=0 (Yes). infx(z)=-2 <= infx(y)=-1 (Yes). supx(y)=1 <= supx(z)=2 (Yes). Holds.
      Check x N z: supy(z)=-0.6 <= infy(x)=-0.5 (Yes). infx(z)=-2 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (Yes). supx(x)=0.5 <= supx(z)=2 (Yes). Holds.
      So, N is a possible relation.

2.  x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    - Horizontal conditions match (H1) and (H2).
    - Vertical condition: supy(x) <= infy(z). Is this possible?
      Let y=[-1,1]x[0,1].
      x S y: x=[-0.5,0.5]x[-1,-0.5]. infy(x)=-1, supy(x)=-0.5. (Horizontal holds).
      y N z: z=[-2,2]x[-0.4,-0.1]. infy(z)=-0.4, supy(z)=-0.1. (Horizontal holds).
      Check x S z: supy(x)=-0.5 <= infy(z)=-0.4 (Yes). infx(z)=-2 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (Yes). supx(x)=0.5 <= supx(z)=2 (Yes). Holds.
      So, S is a possible relation.

3.  x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    - Horizontal conditions match (H1) and (H2).
    - Vertical conditions: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Is this possible?
      Let x = [0,1]x[0,1]. Let z = [-1,2]x[-1,2]. x B z holds: infx(z)=-1<=0, supx(x)=1<=2, infy(z)=-1<=0, supy(x)=1<=2.
      Can we find y such that x S y and y N z?
      x S y: supy(x)=1 <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1 <= supx(y).
      y N z: supy(z)=2 <= infy(y), infx(z)=-1 <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)=2.
      Combining: infy(y) >= 1 and infy(y) >= 2 => infy(y) >= 2.
      infx(y) <= 0 and infx(y) >= -1 => -1 <= infx(y) <= 0.
      supx(y) >= 1 and supx(y) <= 2 => 1 <= supx(y) <= 2.
      Also, infy(y) < supy(y) and infx(y) < supx(y) for non-degenerate y.
      Let y = [-0.5, 1.5]x[2.1, 2.5].
      Check x S y: x=[0,1]x[0,1], y=[-0.5,1.5]x[2.1,2.5]. supy(x)=1<=2.1 (Yes). infx(y)=-0.5<=0 (Yes). supx(x)=1<=1.5 (Yes). Holds.
      Check y N z: y=[-0.5,1.5]x[2.1,2.5], z=[-1,2]x[-1,2]. supy(z)=2<=2.1 (Yes). infx(z)=-1<=-0.5 (Yes). supx(y)=1.5<=2 (Yes). Holds.
      Check x B z: x=[0,1]x[0,1], z=[-1,2]x[-1,2]. infx(z)=-1<=0 (Yes). supx(x)=1<=2 (Yes). infy(z)=-1<=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1<=2 (Yes). Holds.
      So, B is a possible relation.

4.  Other relations (NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW):
    - x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts (H2) supx(x) <= supx(z) unless supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). For non-degenerate regions, supx(x) > infx(x), so this is impossible.
    - x SE z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts (H1) infx(z) <= infx(x) unless supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). For non-degenerate regions, supx(x) > infx(x), so this is impossible.
    - x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Contradicts (H2). Impossible.
    - x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). Contradicts (H1). Impossible.
    - x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Contradicts (H1). Impossible.
    - x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). Contradicts (H1). Impossible.

Therefore, the only possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, S, B}$.
