PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of the projection of a region r on the x and y axes, respectively. For any region r in REG, we know that infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r) because regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk and thus have positive area.

The given relations are:
1.  x B y:
    *   infx(y) <= infx(x)
    *   supx(x) <= supx(y)
    *   infy(y) <= infy(x)
    *   supy(x) <= supy(y)

2.  y SE z:
    *   supx(z) <= infx(y)
    *   supy(y) <= infy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's combine the inequalities from the given relations to derive constraints on the bounds of x and z.

Combining the x-bounds:
From (2) supx(z) <= infx(y)
From (1) infx(y) <= infx(x)
Therefore, **supx(z) <= infx(x)**. (Inequality A)

Combining the y-bounds:
From (1) supy(x) <= supy(y)
From (2) supy(y) <= infy(z)
Therefore, **supy(x) <= infy(z)**. (Inequality B)

These two inequalities, supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), must hold for any regions x, y, z in REG satisfying x B y and y SE z.

Now let's check which of the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with these necessary conditions. The definitions of the single-tile relations are based solely on these bounding box inequalities.

*   **x B z**: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Inequality A (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z) together imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) < supx(x) for a region in REG, this is impossible. Thus, x B z is not possible.

*   **x S z**: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Inequality B (supy(x) <= infy(z)) holds.
    Inequality A (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z) together imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x). Thus, x S z is not possible.

*   **x SW z**: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Inequality B (supy(x) <= infy(z)) holds.
    The requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) and Inequality A (supx(z) <= infx(x)) imply supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x). For non-degenerate regions (infx < supx), these two conditions on the x-intervals [infx(x), supx(x)] and [infx(z), supx(z)] can only simultaneously hold if the intervals are points, which is not the case for regions in REG. Thus, x SW z is not possible.

*   **x W z**: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    The requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts Inequality A (supx(z) <= infx(x)) for non-degenerate regions, as explained for SW. Thus, x W z is not possible.

*   **x NW z**: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    The requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts Inequality A. Thus, x NW z is not possible.

*   **x N z**: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    The requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts Inequality B (supy(x) <= infy(z)) for non-degenerate regions (supy > infy). Thus, x N z is not possible.

*   **x NE z**: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Inequality A (supx(z) <= infx(x)) holds.
    The requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts Inequality B (supy(x) <= infy(z)) for non-degenerate regions. Thus, x NE z is not possible.

*   **x E z**: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Inequality A (supx(z) <= infx(x)) holds.
    Inequality B (supy(x) <= infy(z)) and the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) together imply supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This requires supy(x) <= infy(x). Since infy(x) < supy(x) for a region in REG, this is impossible. Thus, x E z is not possible.

*   **x SE z**: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    These are exactly the two inequalities (A and B) that we derived directly from the given premises.
    Since these inequalities must hold whenever x B y and y SE z, the definition of x SE z is always satisfied.
    We can also construct an example of regions in REG satisfying the conditions (e.g., spheres with appropriate centers and radii such that their bounding boxes satisfy the relations), confirming that x SE z is indeed possible.

Based on the bounding box definitions of the cardinal directions and the properties of regions in REG, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{SE}$.
