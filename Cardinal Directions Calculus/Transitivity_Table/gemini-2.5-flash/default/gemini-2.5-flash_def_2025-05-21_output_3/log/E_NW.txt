PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are:
1.  Region x is E of region y (x E y).
2.  Region y is NW of region z (y NW z).

The definitions of these single-tile cardinal directions based on minimum bounding boxes (MBRs) are:
*   a E b: `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`
*   a NW b: `supx(a) <= infx(b)`, `supy(b) <= infy(a)`

Applying these definitions to the given relations:
1.  x E y:
    *   `supx(y) <= infx(x)` (x's left edge is to the right of or aligned with y's right edge)
    *   `infy(y) <= infy(x)` (x's bottom edge is below or aligned with y's bottom edge)
    *   `supy(x) <= supy(y)` (x's top edge is below or aligned with y's top edge)

2.  y NW z:
    *   `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (y's right edge is to the left of or aligned with z's left edge)
    *   `supy(z) <= infy(y)` (z's top edge is below or aligned with y's bottom edge)

Now let's combine the inequalities to find relations between x and z.

Consider the y-coordinates:
From (1b): `infy(y) <= infy(x)`
From (2b): `supy(z) <= infy(y)`
Combining these, we get `supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)`.
This implies `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
This means the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x. In other words, the bounding box of z is entirely below or touching the bottom edge of the bounding box of x. Region x is therefore in a North direction relative to region z.

Let's examine the implications of `supy(z) <= infy(x)` for all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z (x R z). The possible relations are {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

A relation R(a, b) is defined by conditions on `infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a)` and `infx(b), supx(b), infy(b), supy(b)`. Let a=x and b=z.

*   x S z: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. This requires x to be below z. This contradicts `supy(z) <= infy(x)` unless x and z are just points (not regions).
*   x SW z: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Same as S, requires x below z. Contradiction.
*   x SE z: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Same as S, requires x below z. Contradiction.

For relations B, W, and E, the vertical condition is `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
We know `supy(z) <= infy(y)` and `infy(y) <= infy(x)`. This implies `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
If B, W, or E holds, we must also have `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
Combining `supy(x) <= supy(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`, we get `supy(x) <= infy(y)`.
We also have `infy(y) <= infy(x)`.
So, if B, W, or E holds, we must have `supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)`.
This implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`.
For any region homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, the supremum of its y-projection must be strictly greater than the infimum of its y-projection (`supy(x) > infy(x)`). The condition `supy(x) <= infy(x)` can only be satisfied if `supy(x) = infy(x)`, which means the region is a horizontal line segment or a point. Regions in REG are not such degenerate shapes.
Therefore, relations B, W, and E are impossible.

The only remaining possible relations are N, NW, and NE, as their vertical condition on a and b is `supy(b) <= infy(a)`, which translates to `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, and we have shown this condition is always true given the initial relations.

Let's check if N, NW, and NE are indeed possible:

*   x NW z: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    *   `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is always true.
    *   We need to check if `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is possible given the original horizontal constraints: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supx(y) <= infx(z)`.
    *   Let's construct an example bounding box configuration:
        *   y: [0, 1] x [1, 2] (`infx=0, supx=1, infy=1, supy=2`)
        *   z: [2, 3] x [0, 0.5] (`infx=2, supx=3, infy=0, supy=0.5`).
            *   y NW z? `supx(y)=1 <= infx(z)=2` (Yes). `supy(z)=0.5 <= infy(y)=1` (Yes). y NW z works.
        *   x: [-1, -0.5] x [1.5, 2.5] (`infx=-1, supx=-0.5, infy=1.5, supy=2.5`).
            *   x E y? `supx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=-1` (No).
    *   Let's restart the example construction with the correct horizontal ordering for x E y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
    *   y: [0, 1] x [1, 2] (`infx=0, supx=1, infy=1, supy=2`)
    *   x: [2, 3] x [1.5, 2.5] (`infx=2, supx=3, infy=1.5, supy=2.5`).
        *   x E y? `supx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (Yes). `infy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.5` (Yes). `supy(x)=2.5 <= supy(y)=2` (No). Let's adjust supy(x).
    *   y: [0, 1] x [1, 2] (`infx=0, supx=1, infy=1, supy=2`)
    *   x: [2, 3] x [1.5, 1.8] (`infx=2, supx=3, infy=1.5, supy=1.8`).
        *   x E y? `supx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (Yes). `infy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.5` (Yes). `supy(x)=1.8 <= supy(y)=2` (Yes). x E y works.
    *   Now find z such that y NW z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`.
    *   y: [0, 1] x [1, 2]. Need `infx(z) >= supx(y)=1` and `infy(y)=1 >= supy(z)`.
    *   Let z: [1.5, 2.5] x [0, 0.5] (`infx=1.5, supx=2.5, infy=0, supy=0.5`).
        *   y NW z? `supx(y)=1 <= infx(z)=1.5` (Yes). `supy(z)=0.5 <= infy(y)=1` (Yes). y NW z works.
    *   Check x NW z for x:[2, 3] x [1.5, 1.8] and z:[1.5, 2.5] x [0, 0.5].
    *   x NW z? `supx(x)=3 <= infx(z)=1.5` (No). This configuration does not give NW.

    *   Let's try another NW construction:
    *   x NW z: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    *   Let x: [0, 1] x [3, 4]. `supx(x)=1`, `infy(x)=3`.
    *   Let z: [2, 3] x [0, 1]. `infx(z)=2`, `supy(z)=1`.
        *   x NW z? `supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2` (Yes). `supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=3` (Yes). x NW z works.
    *   Now find y such that x E y and y NW z.
    *   x E y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)=0`, `infy(y) <= infy(x)=3`, `supy(x)=4 <= supy(y)`.
    *   y NW z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)=2`, `supy(z)=1 <= infy(y)`.
    *   From x E y: `supx(y) <= 0`. Let `supx(y)=0`. Then `infx(y)<0`. Let y: [-1, 0] x [3.5, 4.5].
        *   x E y? `supx(y)=0 <= infx(x)=0` (Yes). `infy(y)=3.5 <= infy(x)=3` (No). Let infy(y) be lower.
    *   Let y: [-1, 0] x [2.5, 4.5].
        *   x E y? `supx(y)=0 <= infx(x)=0` (Yes). `infy(y)=2.5 <= infy(x)=3` (Yes). `supy(x)=4 <= supy(y)=4.5` (Yes). x E y works.
    *   y NW z? y: [-1, 0] x [2.5, 4.5], z: [2, 3] x [0, 1].
        *   `supx(y)=0 <= infx(z)=2` (Yes). `supy(z)=1 <= infy(y)=2.5` (Yes). y NW z works.
    *   This construction satisfies x E y and y NW z, and results in x NW z. So NW is possible.

*   x N z: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    *   `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is always true.
    *   We need `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    *   Let z: [0, 3] x [0, 1] (`infx=0, supx=3, infy=0, supy=1`).
    *   Let x: [0.5, 2.5] x [2, 3] (`infx=0.5, supx=2.5, infy=2, supy=3`).
        *   x N z? `supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=2` (Yes). `infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=0.5` (Yes). `supx(x)=2.5 <= supx(z)=3` (Yes). x N z works.
    *   Now find y such that x E y and y NW z.
    *   x E y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)=0.5`, `infy(y) <= infy(x)=2`, `supy(x)=3 <= supy(y)`.
    *   y NW z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)=0`, `supy(z)=1 <= infy(y)`.
    *   From `supx(y) <= 0.5` and `supx(y) <= 0`, we need `supx(y) <= 0`. Let `supx(y)=0`. infx(y)<0.
    *   From `infy(y) <= 2` and `infy(y) >= 1`.
    *   From `supy(y) >= 3`.
    *   Let y: [-1, 0] x [1, 4]. (`infx=-1, supx=0, infy=1, supy=4`).
        *   x E y? `supx(y)=0 <= infx(x)=0.5` (Yes). `infy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=2` (Yes). `supy(x)=3 <= supy(y)=4` (Yes). x E y works.
        *   y NW z? `supx(y)=0 <= infx(z)=0` (Yes). `supy(z)=1 <= infy(y)=1` (Yes). y NW z works.
    *   This construction satisfies x E y and y NW z, and results in x N z. So N is possible.

*   x NE z: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    *   `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is always true.
    *   We need `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
    *   Let x: [3, 4] x [2, 3] (`infx=3, supx=4, infy=2, supy=3`).
    *   Let z: [0, 1] x [0, 1] (`infx=0, supx=1, infy=0, supy=1`).
        *   x NE z? `supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=3` (Yes). `supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=2` (Yes). x NE z works.
    *   Now find y such that x E y and y NW z.
    *   x E y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)=3`, `infy(y) <= infy(x)=2`, `supy(x)=3 <= supy(y)`.
    *   y NW z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)=1`, `supy(z)=1 <= infy(y)`.
    *   From `supx(y) <= 3` and `supx(y) <= 1`, we need `supx(y) <= 1`. Let `supx(y)=1`. infx(y)<1.
    *   From `infy(y) <= 2` and `infy(y) >= 1`.
    *   From `supy(y) >= 3`.
    *   Let y: [0, 1] x [1, 3.5]. (`infx=0, supx=1, infy=1, supy=3.5`).
        *   x E y? `supx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=3` (Yes). `infy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=2` (Yes). `supy(x)=3 <= supy(y)=3.5` (Yes). x E y works.
        *   y NW z? `supx(y)=1 <= infx(z)=1` (Yes). `supy(z)=1 <= infy(y)=1` (Yes). y NW z works.
    *   This construction satisfies x E y and y NW z, and results in x NE z. So NE is possible.

Based on the derivation that `supy(z) <= infy(x)` must hold, and the demonstration that N, NW, and NE are possible, these are the only possible relations.

The possible relations between region x and region z are N, NW, NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, NW}$.
