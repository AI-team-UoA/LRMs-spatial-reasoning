PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region r.

Given:
1. Region x is NW of region y (x NW y):
   supx(x) <= infx(y)  (H1)
   supy(y) <= infy(x)  (V1)

2. Region y is W of region z (y W z):
   supx(y) <= infx(z)  (H2)
   infy(z) <= infy(y)  (V2)
   supy(y) <= supy(z)  (V3)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z (x ? z). The possible relations are B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE, based on the relative positions of their bounding boxes.

Let's combine the horizontal constraints (H1) and (H2):
supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
We know that for any non-degenerate region (which regions in REG are), infx(y) <= supx(y).
So, supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).
This gives us: supx(x) <= infx(z). (H_xz)
This inequality implies that the bounding box of x is entirely to the left of or horizontally touching the bounding box of z.

Now let's combine the vertical constraints (V1), (V2), and (V3):
supy(y) <= infy(x)  (V1)
infy(z) <= infy(y)  (V2)
supy(y) <= supy(z)  (V3)

From (V2) and (V1): infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) <= infy(x). (V_xz1)
The lower bound of z is below or at the same level as the lower bound of x.

From (V3) and (V1): supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
These do not directly give a strict relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or supy(z) and infy(x).

Let's examine the possible vertical relationships between x and z, given infy(z) <= infy(x).

Case A: x is above z.
This happens if supy(z) <= infy(x).
Let's check if this is possible given the constraints.
We need supy(y) <= infy(x) (V1) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (V3).
If we choose infy(x) high enough relative to supy(z), it is possible.
Example bounds: infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 5. infy(x) = 10, supy(x) = 12.
We need to find y such that supy(y) <= infy(x) (supy(y) <= 10) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (0 <= infy(y)) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (supy(y) <= 5).
Let infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4.
Check conditions: supy(y)=4 <= infy(x)=10 (T). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=2 (T). supy(y)=4 <= supy(z)=5 (T).
This vertical arrangement is possible. With horizontal constraints supx(x) <= infx(z), this corresponds to the relation x NW z (supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)).
Thus, NW is a possible relation.

Case B: x vertically overlaps with z.
This happens if infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) > infy(x) (since Case A is supy(z) <= infy(x)) and supy(x) >= infy(z).
We already know infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), so supy(x) >= infy(z) is always true.
We need to check if infy(x) <= supy(z) is possible while supy(z) > infy(x).
Let's try to construct bounds where infy(x) <= supy(z).
Example bounds: infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 10. infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 7. (infy(z)<=infy(x) holds: 0<=5. infy(x)<=supy(z) holds: 5<=7. supy(z)>infy(x) holds: 7>5).
We need to find y such that supy(y) <= infy(x) (supy(y) <= 5) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (0 <= infy(y)) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (supy(y) <= 7).
Let infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 3.
Check conditions: supy(y)=3 <= infy(x)=5 (T). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=2 (T). supy(y)=3 <= supy(z)=7 (T).
This vertical arrangement is possible.

Now consider the full conditions for relations based on bounding boxes, combined with our finding supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x).

The relations R where supx(x) <= infx(z) is a necessary condition are W, NW, SW, B, N, S.
Let's check each of these against the constraints.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  supx(x) <= infx(z) is satisfied (H_xz).
  infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied (V_xz1).
  Is supy(x) <= supy(z) possible? Yes, as shown in the second vertical example above (supy(x)=10, supy(z)=7 fails, but we need supy(x)<=supy(z)). Let's redo the example.
  Example bounds: infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 10. infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 12. (infy(z)<=infy(x) holds: 0<=5. supy(x)<=supy(z) holds: 10<=12).
  Need to find y such that supy(y) <= infy(x)=5, infy(z)=0 <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)=12.
  Let infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 4.
  Check conditions: supy(y)=4 <= infy(x)=5 (T). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=2 (T). supy(y)=4 <= supy(z)=12 (T).
  This vertical arrangement is possible for W. Combining with horizontal supx(x) <= infx(z), x W z is possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  supx(x) <= infx(z) is satisfied (H_xz).
  supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible, as shown in the first vertical example.
  Thus, NW is a possible relation.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  supx(x) <= infx(z) is satisfied (H_xz).
  Is supy(x) <= infy(z) possible?
  We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). For regions in REG, supy(x) > infy(x).
  So, supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(y) >= infy(z). This means supy(x) > infy(z).
  Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible for regions in REG. SW is not a possible relation.

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  supx(x) <= infx(z) implies infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). So infx(x) <= infx(z).
  infx(z) <= infx(x) is required for B. This implies infx(x) = infx(z) and supx(x) = infx(z) and supx(y) = infx(z) etc., leading to degenerate cases (vertical line segments or points), which are not in REG. Thus, infx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG. B is not a possible relation.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  infx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible, as shown for B. N is not a possible relation.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible, as shown for SW.
  infx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible, as shown for B. S is not a possible relation.

The relations R where supx(x) <= infx(z) is NOT a necessary condition are E, NE, SE. These require supx(z) <= infx(x) or overlap.
We know infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). For regions in REG, infx < supx.
This implies infx(x) <= supx(z), and equality only holds in degenerate cases.
supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG.
Thus, E, NE, and SE are not possible relations.

The only possible relations are W and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, NW}$.
