PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let BB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, given by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)].
The relations are defined based on the relative positions of these bounding boxes.
The given information is:
1. Region x is NW of region y: BB(x) is NW of BB(y).
   supx(x) <= infx(y)
   supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. Region y is N of region z: BB(y) is N of BB(z).
   supy(z) <= infy(y)
   infx(z) <= infx(y)
   supx(y) <= supx(z)

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are 2-dimensional areas. Therefore, for any region a, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's analyze the y-coordinates of x relative to z:
From (1): supy(y) <= infy(x)
From (2): supy(z) <= infy(y)
Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
Since y is a 2D region, infy(y) < supy(y).
So, supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(z) < infy(x).

Also, since x and z are 2D regions:
infy(z) < supy(z) and infy(x) < supy(x).
Combining with supy(z) < infy(x): infy(z) < supy(z) < infy(x) < supy(x).
This implies infy(z) < infy(x) and supy(z) < supy(x).

The y-conditions for the standard 9 relations x R z are:
S: supy(x) <= infy(z) (False, since infy(z) < supy(x))
SW: supy(x) <= infy(z) (False)
SE: supy(x) <= infy(z) (False)
N: supy(z) <= infy(x) (True, since supy(z) < infy(x))
NW: supy(z) <= infy(x) (True)
NE: supy(z) <= infy(x) (True)
W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (True and False. So W is False)
E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (True and False. So E is False)
B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (True and False. So B is False)

Thus, based on the y-coordinates, only N, NW, and NE relations are possible between x and z.

Now let's analyze the x-coordinates of x relative to z:
From (1): supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (2): infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
Since y is a 2D region, infx(y) < supx(y).
So, supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) < supx(z). The right edge of x is strictly to the left of the right edge of z.

Also, since x and z are 2D regions:
infx(x) < supx(x) and infx(z) < supx(z).

Let's check the x-conditions for N, NW, NE relations between x and z:
N: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z)
   We know supx(x) <= supx(z) is true (actually <).
   Is infx(z) <= infx(x) possible?
   We have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y). Also infx(x) < supx(x).
   Consider a scenario: Let infx(y) = 10.
   Let infx(z) = 5, infx(x) = 6, supx(x) = 8.
   infx(z) <= infx(y)? 5 <= 10. Yes.
   infx(x) < supx(x)? 6 < 8. Yes.
   supx(x) <= infx(y)? 8 <= 10. Yes.
   Need to check if this implies infx(z) <= infx(x). 5 <= 6. Yes.
   This scenario is consistent with the initial conditions on x and y relative to infx(y).
   We also need supx(y) <= supx(z). Let supx(y) = 12, supx(z) = 15.
   infx(y) < supx(y)? 10 < 12. Yes.
   supx(y) <= supx(z)? 12 <= 15. Yes.
   This scenario shows infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible while satisfying all original constraints.
   Therefore, N is a possible relation between x and z.

NW: supx(x) <= infx(z)
    Is supx(x) <= infx(z) possible?
    We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
    Consider a scenario: Let infx(y) = 10.
    Let supx(x) = 5, infx(z) = 6.
    supx(x) <= infx(y)? 5 <= 10. Yes.
    infx(z) <= infx(y)? 6 <= 10. Yes.
    Need to check if this implies supx(x) <= infx(z). 5 <= 6. Yes.
    This scenario shows supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible.
    Therefore, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

NE: supx(z) <= infx(x)
    Is supx(z) <= infx(x) possible?
    We know infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
    This implies infx(x) < supx(z).
    Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible.
    So, NE is not a possible relation between x and z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
