PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by `B(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies that for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

We are given two relations:
1. Region x is SE of region y: `x SE y`.
   According to the definition, this means:
   `supx(y) <= infx(x)` (the right edge of y's box is to the left of or touches the left edge of x's box)
   `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (the bottom edge of x's box is below or touches the bottom edge of y's box)

2. Region y is SW of region z: `y SW z`.
   According to the definition, this means:
   `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (the right edge of y's box is to the left of or touches the left edge of z's box)
   `supy(y) <= infy(z)` (the bottom edge of y's box is below or touches the bottom edge of z's box)

We want to find the possible relations R between region x and region z (`x R z`) from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's combine the given inequalities to derive constraints on x and z.
From the vertical constraints:
`supy(x) <= infy(y)` (from x SE y)
`infy(y) < supy(y)` (property of regions in REG)
`supy(y) <= infy(z)` (from y SW z)
Combining these, we get `supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z)`.
This implies `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. (Let's call this inequality V)
This means the bottom edge of x's bounding box is below or touches the bottom edge of z's bounding box.

Now let's examine the possible relations `x R z` and check if they are consistent with inequality V: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). (Requires z's top edge below or touching x's bottom edge, opposite of V)
- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). (Requires z's top edge below or touching x's bottom edge, opposite of V)
- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). (Requires z's bottom edge below or touching x's bottom edge AND x's top edge below or touching z's top edge. Inequality V is consistent with supy(x) <= supy(z), but `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)` together imply `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x)`, which means `supy(x) <= infy(x)`. This contradicts `infy(x) < supy(x)`. So E is inconsistent with V).
- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). (Consistent with V)
- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). (Consistent with V)
- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). (Consistent with V)
- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). (Similar to E, leads to supy(x) <= infy(x). Inconsistent with V).
- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). (Requires z's top edge below or touching x's bottom edge, opposite of V)
- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). (Similar to E and W, leads to supy(x) <= infy(x). Inconsistent with V).

Inequality V, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, means that the bounding box of x is entirely below or vertically aligned with the bottom edge of the bounding box of z. This vertical relationship is only possible with S, SW, or SE among the 9 defined relations. The other relations (N, NE, NW, E, W, B) require different vertical relationships (above, overlapping, or contained vertically), which contradict `supy(x) <= infy(z)` given that regions have positive height.

So, the possible relations for x R z are limited to {S, SW, SE}. Now we need to check if each of these is actually possible by constructing examples of regions x, y, z in REG that satisfy the initial conditions (x SE y and y SW z) and the target relation (x R z for R in {S, SW, SE}).

Let's check the horizontal constraints from the given conditions:
`supx(y) <= infx(x)`
`supx(y) <= infx(z)`
This means `supx(y)` is less than or equal to both `infx(x)` and `infx(z)`. Since `infx(y) < supx(y)`, `infx(y)` is also less than both `infx(x)` and `infx(z)`. The entire x-projection of y is to the left of or touches the left edges of the x-projections of x and z. This puts constraints on y's horizontal position relative to x and z, but doesn't directly force a specific horizontal relationship between x and z.

Let's test if S, SW, and SE are achievable:
- Case 1: x S z.
  Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (verified), and `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
  Example construction:
  Let z be a disk with box [0, 5] x [0, 1]. `infx(z)=0`, `supx(z)=5`, `infy(z)=0`, `supy(z)=1`.
  Let x be a disk with box [1, 4] x [-3, -2]. `infx(x)=1`, `supx(x)=4`, `infy(x)=-3`, `supy(x)=-2`.
  Check x S z: `supy(x)=-2 <= infy(z)=0` (True). `infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=1` (True). `supx(x)=4 <= supx(z)=5` (True). x S z holds.
  Now find a y such that x SE y and y SW z.
  x SE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)=1`, `supy(x)=-2 <= infy(y)`.
  y SW z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)=0`, `supy(y) <= infy(z)=0`.
  We need `supx(y) <= 0`, `supy(y) <= 0`, and `-2 <= infy(y)`.
  Let y be a disk with box [-1, 0] x [-1.5, -0.5]. `infx(y)=-1`, `supx(y)=0`, `infy(y)=-1.5`, `supy(y)=-0.5`. This is a valid box for a region in REG.
  Check x SE y: `supx(y)=0 <= infx(x)=1` (True). `supy(x)=-2 <= infy(y)=-1.5` (True). x SE y holds.
  Check y SW z: `supx(y)=0 <= infx(z)=0` (True). `supy(y)=-0.5 <= infy(z)=0` (True). y SW z holds.
  Since we found a valid configuration, S is a possible relation between x and z.

- Case 2: x SW z.
  Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (verified), and `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
  Example construction:
  Let z be a disk with box [5, 6] x [0, 1]. `infx(z)=5`, `supx(z)=6`, `infy(z)=0`, `supy(z)=1`.
  Let x be a disk with box [0, 1] x [-3, -2]. `infx(x)=0`, `supx(x)=1`, `infy(x)=-3`, `supy(x)=-2`.
  Check x SW z: `supy(x)=-2 <= infy(z)=0` (True). `supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=5` (True). x SW z holds.
  Now find a y such that x SE y and y SW z.
  x SE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)=0`, `supy(x)=-2 <= infy(y)`.
  y SW z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)=5`, `supy(y) <= infy(z)=0`.
  We need `supx(y) <= 0`, `supy(y) <= 0`, and `-2 <= infy(y)`.
  Let y be a disk with box [-1, 0] x [-1.5, -0.5]. `infx(y)=-1`, `supx(y)=0`, `infy(y)=-1.5`, `supy(y)=-0.5`.
  Check x SE y: `supx(y)=0 <= infx(x)=0` (True). `supy(x)=-2 <= infy(y)=-1.5` (True). x SE y holds.
  Check y SW z: `supx(y)=0 <= infx(z)=5` (True). `supy(y)=-0.5 <= infy(z)=0` (True). y SW z holds.
  Since we found a valid configuration, SW is a possible relation between x and z.

- Case 3: x SE z.
  Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (verified), and `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
  Example construction:
  Let z be a disk with box [0, 1] x [0, 1]. `infx(z)=0`, `supx(z)=1`, `infy(z)=0`, `supy(z)=1`.
  Let x be a disk with box [2, 3] x [-3, -2]. `infx(x)=2`, `supx(x)=3`, `infy(x)=-3`, `supy(x)=-2`.
  Check x SE z: `supy(x)=-2 <= infy(z)=0` (True). `supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (True). x SE z holds.
  Now find a y such that x SE y and y SW z.
  x SE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)=2`, `supy(x)=-2 <= infy(y)`.
  y SW z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)=1`, `supy(y) <= infy(z)=0`.
  We need `supx(y) <= 1`, `supy(y) <= 0`, and `-2 <= infy(y)`.
  Let y be a disk with box [0, 1] x [-1.5, -0.5]. `infx(y)=0`, `supx(y)=1`, `infy(y)=-1.5`, `supy(y)=-0.5`.
  Check x SE y: `supx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (True). `supy(x)=-2 <= infy(y)=-1.5` (True). x SE y holds.
  Check y SW z: `supx(y)=1 <= infx(z)=1` (True). `supy(y)=-0.5 <= infy(z)=0` (True). y SW z holds.
  Since we found a valid configuration, SE is a possible relation between x and z.

We have shown that S, SW, and SE are possible relations between x and z, and that the other 6 relations are not possible due to the derived vertical constraint `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and the definitions of the relations for regions in REG (positive width/height).

The possible relations between region x and region z are S, SW, and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW, SE}$.
