PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by `[infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
Since regions are in REG, they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes have non-zero width and height. Thus, for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

The definition of `a SW b` is:
`supx(a) <= infx(b)` AND `supy(a) <= infy(b)`.

Given:
1. `x SW y`: `supx(x) <= infx(y)` AND `supy(x) <= infy(y)`.
2. `y SW z`: `supx(y) <= infx(z)` AND `supy(y) <= infy(z)`.

Also, since y is in REG, `infx(y) < supx(y)` and `infy(y) < supy(y)`.

Combining the inequalities for the x-axis:
`supx(x) <= infx(y)`
`infx(y) < supx(y)` (from y is in REG)
`supx(y) <= infx(z)`

From this chain, we can conclude `supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z)`. This directly implies `supx(x) < infx(z)`.

Combining the inequalities for the y-axis:
`supy(x) <= infy(y)`
`infy(y) < supy(y)` (from y is in REG)
`supy(y) <= infy(z)`

From this chain, we can conclude `supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z)`. This directly implies `supy(x) < infy(z)`.

So, for regions x and z, we must have `supx(x) < infx(z)` and `supy(x) < infy(z)`.
Let's check which of the possible cardinal relations between x and z are consistent with these two strict inequalities and the fact that x and z are in REG (so `infx(x) < supx(x)`, `infy(x) < supy(x)`, `infx(z) < supx(z)`, `infy(z) < supy(z)`).

1.  `x B z`: Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requirement `infx(z) <= infx(x)` contradicts our derived `supx(x) < infx(z)` combined with `infx(x) < supx(x)`. (Because `supx(x) < infx(z) <= infx(x)` implies `supx(x) < infx(x)`). B is impossible.

2.  `x S z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    Requirement `infx(z) <= infx(x)` contradicts our derived `supx(x) < infx(z)` combined with `infx(x) < supx(x)`. S is impossible.

3.  `x SW z`: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    Our derived `supx(x) < infx(z)` and `supy(x) < infy(z)` satisfy these conditions. SW is possible.

4.  `x W z`: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requirement `infy(z) <= infy(x)` contradicts our derived `supy(x) < infy(z)` combined with `infy(x) < supy(x)`. (Because `supy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(x)` implies `supy(x) < infy(x)`). W is impossible.

5.  `x NW z`: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    Requirement `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. We derived `supy(x) < infy(z)` and we know `infy(z) < supy(z)` (since z is in REG). Thus, `supy(x) < infy(z) < supy(z)`. If `supy(z) <= infy(x)` holds, then `supy(x) < infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x)`, which implies `supy(x) < infy(x)`. This contradicts `infy(x) < supy(x)` for regions in REG. NW is impossible.

6.  `x N z`: Requires `supy(z) <= infy(a)` and `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    Requirement `infx(z) <= infx(x)` contradicts our derived `supx(x) < infx(z)` combined with `infx(x) < supx(x)`. N is impossible.

7.  `x NE z`: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(a)` and `supy(z) <= infy(a)`.
    Requirement `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. We derived `supx(x) < infx(z)` and we know `infx(z) < supx(z)` (since z is in REG). Thus, `supx(x) < infx(z) < supx(z)`. If `supx(z) <= infx(x)` holds, then `supx(x) < infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x)`, which implies `supx(x) < infx(x)`. This contradicts `infx(x) < supx(x)` for regions in REG. NE is impossible.

8.  `x E z`: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(a)` and `infy(b) <= infy(a)` and `supy(a) <= supy(b)`.
    Requirement `supx(z) <= infx(x)` contradicts our analysis for NE. E is impossible.

9.  `x SE z`: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(a)` and `supy(a) <= infy(b)`.
    Requirement `supx(z) <= infx(x)` contradicts our analysis for NE. SE is impossible.

Based on the definitions and the properties of regions in REG, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.
