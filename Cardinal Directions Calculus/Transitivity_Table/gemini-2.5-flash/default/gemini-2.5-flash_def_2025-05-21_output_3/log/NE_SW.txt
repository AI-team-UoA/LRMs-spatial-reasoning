PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region 'a' be denoted by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)].
The given relations are:
1.  x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2.  y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let c_x = supx(y) and c_y = supy(y). Note that c_x and c_y are finite values since y is in REG and thus bounded. Also, since regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, their bounding boxes have positive width and height, so infx(y) < supx(y) and infy(y) < supy(y).

The conditions can be rewritten as:
1.  infx(x) >= c_x and infy(x) >= c_y
2.  infx(z) >= c_x and infy(z) >= c_y

These conditions tell us that the bottom-left corners of the bounding boxes of x and z, (infx(x), infy(x)) and (infx(z), infy(z)), must lie in the region [c_x, +infinity) x [c_y, +infinity).

We need to find which of the 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations could possibly hold between x and z. A relation is possible if we can find regions x, y, and z in REG that satisfy the given relations (x NE y and y SW z) and the relation in question. Regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk are in REG. The bounding box of a disk centered at (cx, cy) with radius r is [cx-r, cx+r] x [cy-r, cy+r]. By choosing appropriate centers and radii, we can construct regions with desired bounding boxes (as long as width and height are positive).

Let's test each of the 9 relations by attempting to construct a scenario where it holds:

Let y be a disk centered at (0,0) with radius 0.5. Its bounding box is [-0.5, 0.5] x [-0.5, 0.5].
supx(y) = 0.5, supy(y) = 0.5.
The conditions become: infx(x) >= 0.5, infy(x) >= 0.5, infx(z) >= 0.5, infy(z) >= 0.5.

1.  **x NE z**: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
    Let x be a disk centered at (3,3) with radius 0.5. BB(x) = [2.5, 3.5] x [2.5, 3.5]. infx(x)=2.5, supx(x)=3.5, infy(x)=2.5, supy(x)=3.5.
    x NE y: 2.5 >= 0.5 (T), 2.5 >= 0.5 (T). Holds.
    Let z be a disk centered at (2,2) with radius 0.5. BB(z) = [1.5, 2.5] x [1.5, 2.5]. infx(z)=1.5, supx(z)=2.5, infy(z)=1.5, supy(z)=2.5.
    y SW z: 0.5 <= 1.5 (T), 0.5 <= 1.5 (T). Holds.
    Check x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) (2.5 <= 2.5 T), supy(z) <= infy(x) (2.5 <= 2.5 T). Holds.
    So, NE is possible.

2.  **x SW z**: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
    Let x be a disk centered at (2,2) with radius 0.5. BB(x) = [1.5, 2.5] x [1.5, 2.5]. supx(x)=2.5, supy(x)=2.5.
    x NE y: 1.5 >= 0.5 (T), 1.5 >= 0.5 (T). Holds.
    Let z be a disk centered at (3,3) with radius 0.5. BB(z) = [2.5, 3.5] x [2.5, 3.5]. infx(z)=2.5, infy(z)=2.5.
    y SW z: 0.5 <= 2.5 (T), 0.5 <= 2.5 (T). Holds.
    Check x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (2.5 <= 2.5 T), supy(x) <= infy(z) (2.5 <= 2.5 T). Holds.
    So, SW is possible.

By symmetry (swapping x and z roles, and swapping NE and SW relations), if NE is possible, SW is possible, and vice versa.

We can similarly construct examples for all other 7 relations:

3.  **x B z**: BB(x) contained in BB(z).
    BB(y)=[-0.5, 0.5]x[-0.5, 0.5]. BB(x)=[1.5, 2.5]x[1.5, 2.5]. x NE y holds.
    BB(z)=[1, 3]x[1, 3]. y SW z: 0.5 <= 1 (T), 0.5 <= 1 (T). Holds.
    x B z: infx(z)<=infx(x) (1<=1.5 T), supx(x)<=supx(z) (2.5<=3 T), infy(z)<=infy(x) (1<=1.5 T), supy(x)<=supy(z) (2.5<=3 T). Holds.
    So, B is possible.

4.  **x N z**: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    BB(y)=[-0.5, 0.5]x[-0.5, 0.5]. BB(x)=[1.5, 2.5]x[2.5, 3.5]. x NE y holds.
    BB(z)=[1, 3]x[1.5, 2.5]. y SW z: 0.5 <= 1 (T), 0.5 <= 1.5 (T). Holds.
    x N z: supy(z)<=infy(x) (2.5<=2.5 T), infx(z)<=infx(x) (1<=1.5 T), supx(x)<=supx(z) (2.5<=3 T). Holds.
    So, N is possible.

5.  **x S z**: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    BB(y)=[-0.5, 0.5]x[-0.5, 0.5]. BB(x)=[1.5, 2.5]x[1.5, 2.5]. x NE y holds.
    BB(z)=[1, 3]x[2.5, 3.5]. y SW z: 0.5 <= 1 (T), 0.5 <= 2.5 (T). Holds.
    x S z: supy(x)<=infy(z) (2.5<=2.5 T), infx(z)<=infx(x) (1<=1.5 T), supx(x)<=supx(z) (2.5<=3 T). Holds.
    So, S is possible.

6.  **x E z**: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    BB(y)=[-0.5, 0.5]x[-0.5, 0.5]. BB(x)=[2.5, 3.5]x[1.5, 2.5]. x NE y holds.
    BB(z)=[1.5, 2.5]x[1, 3]. y SW z: 0.5 <= 1.5 (T), 0.5 <= 1 (T). Holds.
    x E z: supx(z)<=infx(x) (2.5<=2.5 T), infy(z)<=infy(x) (1<=1.5 T), supy(x)<=supy(z) (2.5<=3 T). Holds.
    So, E is possible.

7.  **x W z**: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    BB(y)=[-0.5, 0.5]x[-0.5, 0.5]. BB(x)=[1.5, 2.5]x[1.5, 2.5]. x NE y holds.
    BB(z)=[2.5, 3.5]x[1, 3]. y SW z: 0.5 <= 2.5 (T), 0.5 <= 1 (T). Holds.
    x W z: supx(x)<=infx(z) (2.5<=2.5 T), infy(z)<=infy(x) (1<=1.5 T), supy(x)<=supy(z) (2.5<=3 T). Holds.
    So, W is possible.

8.  **x NW z**: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    BB(y)=[-0.5, 0.5]x[-0.5, 0.5]. BB(x)=[1.5, 2.5]x[2.5, 3.5]. x NE y holds.
    BB(z)=[2.5, 3.5]x[1.5, 2.5]. y SW z: 0.5 <= 2.5 (T), 0.5 <= 1.5 (T). Holds.
    x NW z: supx(x)<=infx(z) (2.5<=2.5 T), supy(z)<=infy(x) (2.5<=2.5 T). Holds.
    So, NW is possible.

9.  **x SE z**: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    BB(y)=[-0.5, 0.5]x[-0.5, 0.5]. BB(x)=[2.5, 3.5]x[1.5, 2.5]. x NE y holds.
    BB(z)=[1.5, 2.5]x[2.5, 3.5]. y SW z: 0.5 <= 1.5 (T), 0.5 <= 2.5 (T). Holds.
    x SE z: supx(z)<=infx(x) (2.5<=2.5 T), supy(x)<=infy(z) (2.5<=2.5 T). Holds.
    So, SE is possible.

Since we have constructed scenarios where each of the 9 relations is possible, all of them could be the possible relations between region x and region z.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}$.
