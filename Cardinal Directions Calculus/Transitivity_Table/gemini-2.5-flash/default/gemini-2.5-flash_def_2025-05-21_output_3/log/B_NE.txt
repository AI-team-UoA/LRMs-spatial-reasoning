PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let's denote the bounding box of a region `a` by `[infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
The given relations are:
1.  `x B y`: infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y).
2.  `y NE z`: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(z) <= infy(y).

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are non-degenerate, having positive width and height. Thus, for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

Let's combine the inequalities from the given relations:
From (1) and (2) for the x-axis:
supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x)
This implies `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. (Condition H1)

From (1) and (2) for the y-axis:
supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x)
This implies `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. (Condition V1)

These two conditions, `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, are necessary consequences of x B y and y NE z.

Now, let's examine the definitions of the possible relations between region x and region z (where `a` is x and `b` is z) and see which ones are consistent with these necessary conditions and the properties of REG regions.

-   **x NE z**: Defined by `supx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    These are exactly the two necessary conditions we derived. Thus, x NE z is always a possible relation.

Now let's check if any other relation R from {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, E, SE} could be possible between x and z. For x R z to be possible, the defining conditions of R must be satisfiable along with the necessary conditions H1 and V1 and the original conditions.

-   **x B z**: Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    From H1 (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`) and the requirement `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, we get `supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x)`. This implies `supx(x) <= infx(x)`. For a non-degenerate region in REG, `infx(x) < supx(x)`. This is a contradiction. Thus, x B z is not possible.

-   **x S z**: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    The requirement `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, combined with H1, implies zero width as shown for B. Not possible.

-   **x SW z**: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    The requirement `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, combined with H1 (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`), means the interval `[infx(x), supx(x)]` must be to the left of or touching `infx(z)`, while the interval `[infx(z), supx(z)]` must be to the left of or touching `infx(x)`. For non-degenerate regions, this is only possible if the regions overlap or touch in a way that requires zero width. Specifically, `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supx(z) <= infx(x)` requires `supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z)` which implies `supx(z) <= infx(z)`, a contradiction. Not possible.

-   **x W z**: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    The requirement `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is not possible as shown for SW. Not possible.

-   **x NW z**: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    The requirement `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is not possible as shown for SW. V1 is satisfied, but horizontal fails. Not possible.

-   **x N z**: Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    V1 (`supy(z) <= infy(x)`) is satisfied. The requirement `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, combined with H1, implies zero width as shown for B. Not possible.

-   **x E z**: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    H1 (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`) is satisfied. The requirement `supy(x) <= supy(z)`, combined with V1 (`supy(z) <= infy(x)`), implies `supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x)`, which means `supy(x) <= infy(x)`. For a non-degenerate region, `infy(x) < supy(x)`. This is a contradiction. Not possible.

-   **x SE z**: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    H1 (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`) is satisfied. The requirement `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, combined with V1 (`supy(z) <= infy(x)`), means `supy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    Consider the vertical intervals `[infy(z), supy(z)]` and `[infy(x), supy(x)]`.
    `supy(z) <= infy(x)` means x's lower bound is above or at z's upper bound.
    `supy(x) <= infy(z)` means x's upper bound is below or at z's lower bound.
    This implies `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)`.
    This requires `supy(x) = infy(x) = supy(z) = infy(z)`, meaning both x and z have zero height. This contradicts that regions are in REG. Not possible.

Based on the definitions and the properties of regions in REG (positive width and height), only the NE relation is possible between x and z.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
