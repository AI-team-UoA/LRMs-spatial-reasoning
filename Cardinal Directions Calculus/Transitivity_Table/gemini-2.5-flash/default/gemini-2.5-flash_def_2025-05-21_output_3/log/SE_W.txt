PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), and supy(a) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region a. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies that for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

We are given two relations:
1. x SE y:
   infx(x) >= supx(y)
   infy(y) >= supy(x)

2. y W z:
   infx(y) >= supx(z)
   infy(y) >= infy(z)
   supy(z) >= supy(y)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's analyze the relative positions of their bounding boxes based on the given information.

Horizontal relationship between x and z:
From (1), infx(x) >= supx(y).
From (2), infx(y) >= supx(z).
Since y is a region in REG, infx(y) < supx(y).
Combining these inequalities:
infx(x) >= supx(y) > infx(y) >= supx(z).
This implies infx(x) > supx(z).
The left boundary of x's bounding box is strictly to the East of the right boundary of z's bounding box.

Let's check which cardinal relations between x and z are consistent with infx(x) > supx(z).
The definition of the relations between a and b are given based on the bounding boxes of a and b.
- a B b: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b). infx(x) > supx(z) is inconsistent with infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). B is impossible.
- a S b: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b). Horizontal conditions infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are inconsistent with infx(x) > supx(z) and infx(x) < supx(x). S is impossible.
- a SW b: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b). supx(x) <= infx(z). This requires x to be to the West of z. Our finding infx(x) > supx(z) means x is to the East of z. SW is impossible.
- a W b: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b). Requires x to be to the West of z. W is impossible.
- a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a). Requires x to be to the West of z. NW is impossible.
- a N b: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b). Horizontal conditions infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are inconsistent with infx(x) > supx(z). N is impossible.
- a NE b: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a). supx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with our finding infx(x) > supx(z). NE is possible based on horizontal.
- a E b: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b). supx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with our finding infx(x) > supx(z). E is possible based on horizontal.
- a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b). supx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with our finding infx(x) > supx(z). SE is possible based on horizontal.

So, only NE, E, and SE are potentially possible. Now let's consider the vertical relationship between x and z for these possibilities.

Vertical relationship between x and z:
From (1), infy(y) >= supy(x).
From (2), infy(y) >= infy(z) and supy(z) >= supy(y).
Since y is a region in REG, infy(y) < supy(y).
Combining these inequalities:
supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z).
This implies supy(x) < supy(z). The top boundary of x's bounding box is strictly below the top boundary of z's bounding box.

Let's check the vertical conditions for NE, E, SE:
- x NE z: supy(z) <= infy(x).
- x E z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- x SE z: supy(x) <= infy(z).

Check if NE is possible (supy(z) <= infy(x)):
From y W z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z).
If supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(y) <= infy(x).
From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
So, if NE holds, we must have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
Let infy(x) = a, supy(x) = b. For REG, a < b.
Let infy(y) = c, supy(y) = d. For REG, c < d.
The conditions become d <= a and b <= c.
Combining these with the REG constraints: b <= c < d <= a.
This implies b <= a. However, for a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x), so a < b.
The conditions b <= c < d <= a contradict a < b.
This means the conditions supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) cannot simultaneously hold for regions in REG.
Since assuming NE holds leads to this contradiction (specifically, supy(y) <= infy(x) must hold if NE holds, and supy(x) <= infy(y) must hold from x SE y), NE is impossible.

Check if E is possible (infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)):
We have already shown supy(x) < supy(z), which satisfies supy(x) <= supy(z).
We need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
We know infy(z) <= infy(y).
Consider the example:
y bounding box: [infx(y), supx(y)] x [infy(y), supy(y)] = [0, 1] x [0, 1]
x SE y: infx(x) >= 1, supy(x) <= 0. For supy(x) <= 0 with infy(x) < supy(x), this implies supy(x) <= 0 and infy(x) < 0. E.g., x bounding box: [2, 3] x [-2, -1]. infx=2, supx=3, infy=-2, supy=-1. infx(x)=2 >= supx(y)=1. supy(x)=-1 <= infy(y)=0. x SE y holds.
y W z: infx(y) >= supx(z), infy(y) >= infy(z), supy(z) >= supy(y). 0 >= supx(z), 0 >= infy(z), supy(z) >= 1. E.g., z bounding box: [-2, -1] x [-2, 2]. infx=-2, supx=-1, infy=-2, supy=2. infx(y)=0 >= supx(z)=-1. infy(y)=0 >= infy(z)=-2. supy(z)=2 >= supy(y)=1. y W z holds.

Compare x and z:
x: [2, 3] x [-2, -1]. infx=2, supx=3, infy=-2, supy=-1.
z: [-2, -1] x [-2, 2]. infx=-2, supx=-1, infy=-2, supy=2.
Horizontal: supx(z)=-1 <= infx(x)=2. Holds (strictly).
Vertical: infy(z)=-2 <= infy(x)=-2. Holds.
supy(x)=-1 <= supy(z)=2. Holds.
E holds in this example.

Check if SE is possible (supy(x) <= infy(z)):
We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
Can supy(x) <= infy(z)? Yes, if infy(y) is sufficiently high compared to both.
Consider the example:
y bounding box: [0, 1] x [5, 10]
x SE y: infx(x) >= 1, supy(x) <= 5. E.g., x bounding box: [2, 3] x [3, 4]. infx=2, supx=3, infy=3, supy=4. infx(x)=2 >= supx(y)=1. supy(x)=4 <= infy(y)=5. x SE y holds.
y W z: infx(y) >= supx(z), infy(y) >= infy(z), supy(z) >= supy(y). 0 >= supx(z), 5 >= infy(z), supy(z) >= 10. E.g., z bounding box: [-2, -1] x [4, 12]. infx=-2, supx=-1, infy=4, supy=12. infx(y)=0 >= supx(z)=-1. infy(y)=5 >= infy(z)=4. supy(z)=12 >= supy(y)=10. y W z holds.

Compare x and z:
x: [2, 3] x [3, 4]. infx=2, supx=3, infy=3, supy=4.
z: [-2, -1] x [4, 12]. infx=-2, supx=-1, infy=4, supy=12.
Horizontal: supx(z)=-1 <= infx(x)=2. Holds (strictly).
Vertical: supy(x)=4 <= infy(z)=4. Holds.
SE holds in this example.

Based on the analysis, only E and SE are possible relations between x and z.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, SE}$.
