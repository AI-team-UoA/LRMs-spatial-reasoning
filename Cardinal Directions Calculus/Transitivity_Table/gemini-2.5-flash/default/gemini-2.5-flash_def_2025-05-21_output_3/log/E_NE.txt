PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the regions be x, y, and z, all belonging to the set REG (regions homeomorphic to the closed unit disk). This implies that for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

The given relations are:
1. x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on the definitions of the single-tile cardinal directions applied to their minimum bounding boxes. Let's derive the constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x relative to z.

From (1) x E y:
(1a) supx(y) <= infx(x)
(1b) infy(y) <= infy(x)
(1c) supy(x) <= supy(y)

From (2) y NE z:
(2a) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(2b) supy(z) <= infy(y)

Consider the x-coordinates of x and z:
From (2a), we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
From the property of non-degenerate regions, infx(y) < supx(y). So, supx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y).
From (1a), we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From the property of non-degenerate regions, infx(x) < supx(x). So, supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x).
Combining these inequalities: supx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x).
This directly implies supx(z) <= infx(x).

Consider the y-coordinates of x and z:
From (2b), we have supy(z) <= infy(y).
From (1b), we have infy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining these inequalities: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
This directly implies supy(z) <= infy(x).

From the property of non-degenerate regions, infy(z) < supy(z).
We also have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining these: infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies infy(z) <= infy(x).

We have derived the following necessary conditions for x relative to z:
A) supx(z) <= infx(x)
B) supy(z) <= infy(x)
C) infy(z) <= infy(x)

Now let's check which single-tile cardinal direction relations x R z satisfy these necessary conditions, considering the definitions and the property that regions are non-degenerate (inf < sup).

The definition of x NE z is: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
Conditions A) and B) are exactly these conditions. Thus, x NE z is always true given the premises.

Let's check if any other relation is possible.
- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x) (B). We need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x) (A). If supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= infx(x). Since regions are non-degenerate, infx(x) < supx(x). This is a contradiction. Thus, x N z is not possible for non-degenerate regions.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x) (A) and infy(z) <= infy(x) (C). We need supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We know supy(z) <= infy(y) (2b) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (1c). Also infy(y) < supy(y).
  If supy(x) <= supy(z), then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y). This implies supy(x) < supy(y), which is consistent with (1c) (allowing equality).
  However, from supy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (B), we get supy(x) <= infy(x). Since regions are non-degenerate, infy(x) < supy(x). This is a contradiction. Thus, x E z is not possible for non-degenerate regions.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x) (A). We need supy(x) <= supy(z). This leads to a contradiction as shown for x E z. Thus, x SE z is not possible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x) (B). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(z), then supy(x) <= supy(z). This leads to a contradiction as shown for E. Thus, x S z is not possible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), which leads to a contradiction as shown for S. Thus, x SW z is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Requires supy(x) <= supy(z), which leads to a contradiction as shown for E. Thus, x W z is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x) (B). Requires supx(x) <= infx(z).
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x) (A). If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x), and intervals are non-degenerate, this is impossible as shown for N. Thus, x NW z is not possible.

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Both lead to contradictions as shown above. Thus, x B z is not possible.

Based on the definitions of the single-tile relations and the property that regions are non-degenerate (inf < sup), the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
