PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. We are given:
1. x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(y)

From the conditions on the y-axis:
infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)  (Vertical projection of y is contained in vertical projection of x)
infy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(y)  (Vertical projection of y is contained in vertical projection of z)

Combining these:
infy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(z)
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(x)

Since regions are homeomorphic to a disk, their projections are non-degenerate intervals, so infy < supy.
From infy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we cannot deduce a relation between infy(x) and infy(z).
From supy(y) <= supy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we cannot deduce a relation between supy(x) and supy(z).

However, we can deduce vertical overlap between x and z:
infy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z) => infy(x) < supy(z)
infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(x) => infy(z) < supy(x)
Since infy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x), the vertical projections of x and z must overlap.

This vertical overlap rules out any relation that requires vertical separation:
- S (South): requires supy(a) <= infy(b). For x S z, supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts infy(z) < supy(x).
- N (North): requires supy(b) <= infy(a). For x N z, supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(z).
- SW, NW, SE, NE are combinations that include vertical separation, so they are also impossible.

The only remaining possible relations are W, E, and B, which involve horizontal separation or overlap and specific vertical relationships.

Let's check the vertical conditions for W, E, and B relations between x and z:
- x W z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). (Vertical projection of z is contained in vertical projection of x)
- x E z: infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x). (Vertical projection of x is contained in vertical projection of z)
- x B z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). (Same as W vertical condition)

Let's see if these vertical conditions are possible given the premise:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (Vertical for W and B): Possible. Example: x=[-1,0]x[0,4], z=[-3,-2]x[1,3], y=[1,2]x[1.5,2.5].
  x W y: supx(x)=0<=infx(y)=1. [1.5,2.5] in [0,4]. Holds.
  y E z: supx(z)=-2<=infx(y)=1. [1.5,2.5] in [1,3]. Holds.
  Vertical between x and z: infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=0 (No). supy(x)=4 <= supy(z)=3 (No). My earlier derivation/interpretation of vertical containment was flawed.

Let's restart the vertical part using the correct definition:
x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (Vertical projection of y is contained in vertical projection of x)
y E z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (Vertical projection of y is contained in vertical projection of z)

So, [infy(y), supy(y)] is contained in [infy(x), supy(x)] AND [infy(y), supy(y)] is contained in [infy(z), supy(z)].

Let's test the vertical condition for x W z: [infy(z), supy(z)] is contained in [infy(x), supy(x)].
infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x).
Is this possible given infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y), infy(y) <= infy(z), supy(z) <= supy(y)?
Yes. Let infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
infy(x) <= 0, supy(x) >= 1. Let [infy(x), supy(x)] = [-1, 2].
infy(z) <= 0, supy(z) >= 1. Let [infy(z), supy(z)] = [0, 1.5].
Check if [infy(z), supy(z)] in [infy(x), supy(x)]: [0, 1.5] in [-1, 2]. Yes. This vertical condition is possible.

Let's test the vertical condition for x E z: [infy(x), supy(x)] is contained in [infy(z), supy(z)].
infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
Using the same example: infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
[infy(x), supy(x)] = [0, 1.5]. [infy(z), supy(z)] = [-1, 2].
Check if [infy(x), supy(x)] in [infy(z), supy(z)]: [0, 1.5] in [-1, 2]. Yes. This vertical condition is possible.

Let's test the vertical condition for x B z: [infy(z), supy(z)] contains [infy(x), supy(x)].
infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
This is the same condition as for x E z vertical. Possible.

From horizontal conditions: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y).
This means both x and z end to the left of or at the start of y on the x-axis. This allows various horizontal relations between x and z:
- x is West of z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (possible).
- z is West of x: supx(z) <= infx(x) (possible).
- x and z overlap horizontally (possible).
- z horizontally contains x (possible).

Since vertical overlap is guaranteed, and we showed that the required vertical containment for W, E, and B are all possible given the premise, and the required horizontal conditions for W, E, and B are possible given the premise, we can construct examples for W, E, and B.

Example for W: x=[-2,-1]x[0,2], z=[-0.5,0]x[0.5,1.5], y=[1,2]x[0.8,1.2].
x W y: supx(x)=-1<=1, [0.8,1.2] in [0,2]. Holds.
y E z: supx(z)=0<=1, [0.8,1.2] in [0.5,1.5]. Holds.
x W z: supx(x)=-1<=infx(z)=-0.5. Yes. [infy(z), supy(z)]=[0.5,1.5] in [infy(x), supy(x)]=[0,2]. Yes. W holds.

Example for E: x=[-0.5,0]x[-1,2], z=[-2,-1]x[-2,3], y=[1,2]x[0,1].
x W y: supx(x)=0<=1, [0,1] in [-1,2]. Holds.
y E z: supx(z)=-1<=1, [0,1] in [-2,3]. Holds.
x E z: supx(z)=-1<=infx(x)=-0.5. Yes. [infy(x), supy(x)]=[-1,2] in [infy(z), supy(z)]=[-2,3]. Yes. E holds.

Example for B: x=[-0.5,-0.1]x[-0.5,1.5], z=[-0.6,-0.05]x[-1,2], y=[0,1]x[0,1].
x W y: supx(x)=-0.1<=0. [0,1] in [-0.5,1.5]. Holds.
y E z: supx(z)=-0.05<=0. [0,1] in [-1,2]. Holds.
x B z: infx(z)=-0.6<=infx(x)=-0.5. Yes. supx(x)=-0.1<=supx(z)=-0.05. Yes. [infy(z), supy(z)]=[-1,2] contains [infy(x), supy(x)]=[-0.5,1.5]. Yes. B holds.

All W, E, B are possible relations between x and z.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, E, B}$.
