PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `r` be denoted by `BB(r) = [infx(r), supx(r)] x [infy(r), supy(r)]`.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, implying they have non-zero area. This means for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

We are given two relations:
1.  `x S y`:
    *   `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
    *   `infx(y) <= infx(x)`
    *   `supx(x) <= supx(y)`
    This means `BB(x)` is below or touching the bottom of `BB(y)`, and its horizontal extent is contained within or aligns with the horizontal extent of `BB(y)`.

2.  `y SW z`:
    *   `supx(y) <= infx(z)`
    *   `supy(y) <= infy(z)`
    This means `BB(y)` is to the South-West or touching the South-West boundaries of `BB(z)`.

We want to find the possible relations between `x` and `z`. Let's combine the inequalities to find the relationship between `BB(x)` and `BB(z)`.

Consider the x-coordinates:
From `x S y`: `infx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(y)`.
From `y SW z`: `supx(y) <= infx(z)`.

Combining these:
`supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)`. This implies `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
This condition means the right edge of `BB(x)` is to the left of or touching the left edge of `BB(z)`.

Now consider `infx(x)` relative to `infx(z)`.
We have `infx(y) <= infx(x)`.
We also know `infx(y) <= supx(y)` (since regions have area).
From `y SW z`, `supx(y) <= infx(z)`.
Combining these: `infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)`. This implies `infx(y) <= infx(z)`.
We have `infx(x) >= infx(y)` and `infx(y) <= infx(z)`. This doesn't directly give a strict inequality or equality between `infx(x)` and `infx(z)`.

Let's use the full chain: `infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)`.
Since regions have area, `infx(y) < supx(y)`.
So, `infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) < infx(z)` (unless `supx(y) = infx(z)`).
If `supx(y) < infx(z)`, then `supx(x) < infx(z)`, and `infx(x) <= supx(x) < infx(z)`, so `infx(x) < infx(z)`.
If `supx(y) = infx(z)`, then `infx(y) < supx(y) = infx(z)`. We have `infx(y) <= infx(x)`.
Can `infx(x) = infx(z)`? If `infx(x) = infx(z)`, then `infx(y) <= infx(z)`.
The chain becomes `infx(y) <= infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) = infx(z)`.
This implies `infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) = infx(z)`.
So `supx(x) = supx(y) = infx(z)`.
The x-interval for x is `[infx(x), supx(x)]`. If `infx(x) = infx(z)` and `supx(x) = infx(z)`, then `infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z)`. This means the x-interval is a single point, which is not possible for regions in REG.
Therefore, `infx(x)` cannot be equal to `infx(z)`. So `infx(x) < infx(z)`.

So, for the x-coordinates: `infx(x) < infx(z)` and `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.

Consider the y-coordinates:
From `x S y`: `supy(x) <= infy(y)`.
From `y SW z`: `supy(y) <= infy(z)`.

Combining these:
`supy(x) <= infy(y)`.
We also know `infy(y) <= supy(y)`.
So, `supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y)`.
Then `supy(x) <= supy(y)`.
And `supy(y) <= infy(z)`.
So, `supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)`. This implies `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
This condition means the top edge of `BB(x)` is below or touching the bottom edge of `BB(z)`.

Now consider `infy(x)` relative to `infy(z)`.
We have `infy(x) <= supy(x)`.
We derived `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
So, `infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z)`. This implies `infy(x) <= infy(z)`.

Let's use the full chain: `infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)`.
Since regions have area, `infy(z) < supy(z)`.
So, `infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) < supy(z)`.
This implies `infy(x) < supy(z)`.

Can `infy(x) = infy(z)`? If `infy(x) = infy(z)`, then from the chain `infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)`, we get `infy(z) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)`.
This implies `supy(x) = infy(y) = supy(y) = infy(z)`.
Then `infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z)`. This means the y-interval for x is a single point, not possible for regions in REG.
Therefore, `infy(x)` cannot be equal to `infy(z)`. So `infy(x) < infy(z)`.

So, for the y-coordinates: `infy(x) < infy(z)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.

In summary, for any regions x, y, z in REG satisfying the given relations, the bounding boxes must satisfy:
*   `infx(x) < infx(z)`
*   `supx(x) <= infx(z)`
*   `infy(x) < infy(z)`
*   `supy(x) <= infy(z)`

Now let's check which of the possible relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) are satisfied by these conditions. The definitions use `<=`.

*   `a B b`: `infx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supx(a) <= supx(b)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`.
    x B z: `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (False, since `infx(x) < infx(z)`), `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (True, since `supx(x) <= infx(z) < supx(z)`), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (False, since `infy(x) < infy(z)`), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (True, since `supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z)`). Not possible.

*   `a S b`: `supy(a) <= infy(b)`, `infx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supx(a) <= supx(b)`.
    x S z: `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (True), `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (False), `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (True). Not possible.

*   `a SW b`: `supx(a) <= infx(b)` AND `supy(a) <= infy(b)`.
    x SW z: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (True) AND `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (True). Possible.

*   `a W b`: `supx(a) <= infx(b)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`.
    x W z: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (True), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (False), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (True). Not possible.

*   `a NW b`: `supx(a) <= infx(b)` AND `supy(b) <= infy(a)`.
    x NW z: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (True), `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (False, since `infy(x) < infy(z) <= supy(z)`). Not possible.

*   `a N b`: `supy(b) <= infy(a)`, `infx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supx(a) <= supx(b)`.
    x N z: `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (False), `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (False), `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (True). Not possible.

*   `a NE b`: `supx(b) <= infx(a)` AND `supy(b) <= infy(a)`.
    x NE z: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (False, since `infx(x) < infx(z) <= supx(z)`), `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (False). Not possible.

*   `a E b`: `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`.
    x E z: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (False), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (False), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (True). Not possible.

*   `a SE b`: `supx(b) <= infx(a)` AND `supy(a) <= infy(b)`.
    x SE z: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (False), `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (True). Not possible.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box constraints derived from the given relations and the properties of regions in REG, only the SW relation is possible between region x and region z.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW}$.
