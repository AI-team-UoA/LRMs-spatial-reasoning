PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let BB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a. The relations are defined based on the bounding boxes.
Given:
1. x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y) AND infy(y) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y) AND supx(y) <= supx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z)

We need to find the possible relations R from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} such that x R z can be true. This means BB(x) R BB(z) can be true.

Let's combine the y-constraints from the given relations:
From (1): infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
From (2): infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
Combining these inequalities, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)  => infy(z) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)  => supy(x) <= supy(z)

These two inequalities (infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)) are necessary conditions for any possible relation x R z. Let's check which of the 9 single-tile relations' y-conditions are compatible:

The y-conditions for x R z are:
- S, SW, SE: supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(x) <= supy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). Since regions are 2D, infy(y) < supy(y). If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y). So supy(x) <= infy(y). Combined with infy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(x) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) for a 2D region. Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible. S, SW, SE are not possible.
- N, NW, NE: supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(z) >= supy(y) and infy(x) >= infy(y). If supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). So supy(y) <= infy(x). Combined with supy(x) <= supy(y), we get supy(x) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x). Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible. N, NW, NE are not possible.
- W, E, B: infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). These are exactly the two inequalities we derived from the premises. So these relations are possibly true based on y-constraints.

Now let's check the x-constraints for the remaining possible relations {W, E, B}:
The x-constraints from the given relations are:
From (1): supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (2): infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

- E: supx(z) <= infx(x). We know supx(y) <= supx(z). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(y) <= infx(x). We also know supx(x) <= infx(y). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y). This implies supx(y) < supx(x) <= infx(y), which means supx(y) <= infx(y). This contradicts infx(y) < supx(y) for a 2D region. Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. E is not possible.

- W: supx(x) <= infx(z). We know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). Is it possible for supx(x) <= infx(z) to hold? Yes, if infx(z) is large enough, or if infx(z) = infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y).
Example: BB(x)=[0,1]x[0,1], BB(y)=[2,3]x[0,1], BB(z)=[2,3]x[0,1].
x W y: supx(x)=1 <= infx(y)=2, infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1. (True)
y B z: infx(z)=2 <= infx(y)=2, supx(y)=3 <= supx(z)=3, infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=1. (True)
Check x W z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2, infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=1. (True)
Thus, W is a possible relation between x and z.

- B: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). We know infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(x) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z). Is it possible for both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) to hold?
Example: BB(x)=[5,6]x[0,1], BB(y)=[7,8]x[0,1], BB(z)=[0,10]x[-1,2].
x W y: supx(x)=6 <= infx(y)=7, infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1. (True)
y B z: infx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=7, supx(y)=8 <= supx(z)=10, infy(z)=-1 <= infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=2. (True)
Check x B z: infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=5, supx(x)=6 <= supx(z)=10, infy(z)=-1 <= infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=2. (True)
Thus, B is a possible relation between x and z.

All relations except W and B were ruled out. We have found examples showing that W and B are possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z are W and B.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, B}$.
