PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are:
1.  x SW y
2.  y NE z

We use the definitions based on bounding boxes:
Let BB(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)].

x SW y means:
supx(x) <= infx(y)  (x's bounding box is to the west of y's)
supy(x) <= infy(y)  (x's bounding box is to the south of y's)

y NE z means:
supx(z) <= infx(y)  (z's bounding box is to the west of y's)
supy(z) <= infy(y)  (z's bounding box is to the south of y's)

Let $c_x = \text{infx}(y)$ and $c_y = \text{infy}(y)$. The conditions become:
supx(x) <= $c_x$
supy(x) <= $c_y$
supx(z) <= $c_x$
supy(z) <= $c_y$

These inequalities tell us that the point ($c_x$, $c_y$), which is the bottom-left corner of y's bounding box, is located to the north-east of the top-right corner of x's bounding box (supx(x), supy(x)) and also to the north-east of the top-right corner of z's bounding box (supx(z), supy(z)).

We want to find the possible relations x R z. Let's examine each of the 9 possible relations and see if we can construct regions x, y, z satisfying the initial conditions and the specific relation between x and z.

To satisfy the initial conditions for any chosen bounding boxes for x and z, we need to find a y such that infx(y) >= supx(x), infy(y) >= supy(x), infx(y) >= supx(z), and infy(y) >= supy(z). We can always choose infx(y) = max(supx(x), supx(z)) + $\delta_x$ and infy(y) = max(supy(x), supy(z)) + $\delta_y$ for some $\delta_x, \delta_y > 0$, and then define supx(y) and supy(y) such that y is a valid region (e.g., a small disk or rectangle located at (infx(y), infy(y))). This shows that for *any* configuration of bounding boxes for x and z, we can find a region y satisfying the premises, as long as supx, supy are finite (which they are for regions homeomorphic to a disk).

Therefore, any spatial relationship between the bounding boxes of x and z that can be described by one of the 9 cardinal relations is possible. We just need to demonstrate that configurations corresponding to each relation are possible.

Let's demonstrate examples using only bounding boxes (assuming regions exist with these bounding boxes):

1.  **S**: x is South of z. Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) and horizontal overlap.
    x=[1,2]x[0,1], z=[0,3]x[2,3]. supy(x)=1, infy(z)=2 (1<=2 T). Overlap-H: infx(z)=0<=infx(x)=1 (T), supx(x)=2<=supx(z)=3 (T). x S z holds.
    Choose y such that infx(y) >= max(supx(x), supx(z))=3, infy(y) >= max(supy(x), supy(z))=3. Let y=[4,5]x[4,5].
    x SW y: supx(x)=2<=4 (T), supy(x)=1<=4 (T). OK.
    y NE z: supx(z)=3<=4 (T), supy(z)=3<=4 (T). OK.
    S is possible.

    B is possible.

Since we found examples for all 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations, all of them are possible relations between region x and region z.

S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE, B.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}$.
