PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given conditions are:
1. Region x is E of region y:
   - `supx(y) <= infx(x)`
   - `infy(y) <= infy(x)`
   - `supy(x) <= supy(y)`

2. Region y is W of region z:
   - `supx(y) <= infx(z)`
   - `infy(z) <= infy(y)`
   - `supy(y) <= supy(z)`

We want to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. These relations are defined based on the bounding boxes of the regions.

Let's combine the y-coordinate conditions:
From condition 1, we have `infy(y) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(y)`.
From condition 2, we have `infy(z) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.

Combining these inequalities:
`infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)` implies `infy(z) <= infy(x)`.
`supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)` implies `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.

So, we have derived that the y-projection of region x is contained within or equal to the y-projection of region z: `[infy(z), supy(z)]` contains `[infy(x), supy(x)]`.

Now let's examine the definition of each possible single-tile relation between x and z (where 'a' is x and 'b' is z), focusing on the y-conditions:
- `x B z`: `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. This matches our derived conditions.
- `x S z`: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. This contradicts `infy(z) <= infy(x)` unless `infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z)`. Since regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk, they have non-zero area, meaning `infy(a) < supy(a)` for any region a. Thus, this relation is not possible.
- `x SW z`: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Not possible for the same reason as S.
- `x W z`: `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. This matches our derived conditions.
- `x NW z`: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This contradicts `supy(x) <= supy(z)` unless `supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(x)`. Not possible for non-point regions.
- `x N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Not possible for the same reason as NW.
- `x NE z`: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Not possible for the same reason as NW.
- `x E z`: `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. This matches our derived conditions.
- `x SE z`: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Not possible for the same reason as S.

Based on the y-conditions derived from the initial premises, only the relations B, W, and E are potentially possible between x and z.

Now we need to check if each of B, W, and E is actually possible by constructing example regions that satisfy the initial conditions (x E y and y W z) and the candidate relation (x R z).

Let's use bounding boxes for simplicity, as the definitions only depend on them. Let the bounding box of region `a` be `[infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.

Example for x W z:
Let `y` have bounding box `[0, 10] x [0, 10]`.
For x E y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` (10 <= infx(x)), `infy(y) <= infy(x)` (0 <= infy(x)), `supy(x) <= supy(y)` (supy(x) <= 10).
Let `x` have bounding box `[15, 20] x [2, 8]`. (10 <= 15, 0 <= 2, 8 <= 10) - x E y holds.
For y W z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (10 <= infx(z)), `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (infy(z) <= 0), `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (10 <= supy(z)).
Let `z` have bounding box `[25, 30] x [-5, 15]`. (10 <= 25, -5 <= 0, 10 <= 15) - y W z holds.
Now check x W z: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (20 <= 25 - True), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (-5 <= 2 - True), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (8 <= 15 - True).
So, x W z is possible.

Example for x E z:
Let `y` have bounding box `[0, 10] x [0, 10]`.
Let `x` have bounding box `[15, 20] x [2, 8]`. x E y holds.
For y W z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (10 <= infx(z)), `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (infy(z) <= 0), `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (10 <= supy(z)).
Let `z` have bounding box `[12, 14] x [-5, 15]`. (10 <= 12, -5 <= 0, 10 <= 15) - y W z holds.
Now check x E z: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (14 <= 15 - True), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (-5 <= 2 - True), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (8 <= 15 - True).
So, x E z is possible.

Example for x B z:
Let `y` have bounding box `[0, 10] x [0, 10]`.
Let `x` have bounding box `[15, 20] x [2, 8]`. x E y holds.
For y W z: `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (10 <= infx(z)), `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (infy(z) <= 0), `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (10 <= supy(z)).
Let `z` have bounding box `[14, 22] x [-5, 15]`. (10 <= 14, -5 <= 0, 10 <= 15) - y W z holds.
Now check x B z: `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (14 <= 15 - True), `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (20 <= 22 - True), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (-5 <= 2 - True), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (8 <= 15 - True).
So, x B z is possible.

Since we have shown by example that B, W, and E are possible relations between x and z given the initial conditions, and we have ruled out all other single-tile relations based on the derived y-conditions, the possible relations are B, W, and E.

W, E, B
