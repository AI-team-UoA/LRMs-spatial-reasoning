PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let BB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, which is the rectangle [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)].
The relations are defined in terms of these bounding boxes.
Region x is W of region y means:
1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
2) infy(y) <= infy(x)
3) supy(x) <= supy(y)

Region y is NW of region z means:
4) supx(y) <= infx(z)
5) supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relation(s) between region x and region z. Let's analyze the bounds of x and z.

From (1) and (4), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, their bounding boxes have non-zero width, i.e., infx(y) < supx(y).
Combining these inequalities, we get supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z).
This implies supx(x) < infx(z). If infx(y) = supx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(z). Since this case is excluded for regions homeomorphic to a disk, we have supx(x) < infx(z).
This means the bounding box of x is strictly to the west of the bounding box of z.

From (5) and (2), we have supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(z) <= infy(x). The top edge of BB(z) is below or touching the bottom edge of BB(x).

The relation x R z is defined as:
x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

The two inequalities we derived are supx(x) < infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
Since supx(x) < infx(z) implies supx(x) <= infx(z), both conditions for x NW z are met.
Thus, x NW z is always a possible relation, and in fact, a necessary consequence.

Now let's check if any other relation is possible. We will use the necessary conditions we derived:
A) supx(x) <= infx(z) (which is strictly supx(x) < infx(z) for non-degenerate regions)
B) supy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's check the definition of each relation for x R z:
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x) (OK by B), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Requires infx(z) <= infx(x). But from A, supx(x) < infx(z). For a region, infx(x) < supx(x).
  So we would need infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) < infx(z), which is a contradiction. N is not possible.
- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x) (OK by B).
  Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). From A, supx(x) < infx(z) <= supx(z). We would need supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) < infx(z) <= supx(z), contradiction. NE is not possible.
- E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Not possible as shown for NE. E is not possible.
- SE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Not possible as shown for NE. SE is not possible.
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Requires infx(z) <= infx(x). Not possible as shown for N. S is not possible.
- SW: supx(x) <= infx(z) (OK by A), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). From B, supy(z) <= infy(x). Also infy(z) <= supy(z) and infy(x) <= supy(x).
  So infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
  Thus infy(z) <= supy(x). For supy(x) <= infy(z) to hold, we need supy(x) = infy(z), which implies infy(z) = supy(z) = infy(y) = infy(x) = supy(x). This means the y-projections of x, y, z are all single points. Not possible for regions in REG. SW is not possible.
- W: supx(x) <= infx(z) (OK by A), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  infy(z) <= infy(x) is true because infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
  Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). From B, supy(z) <= infy(x). From definition of BB, infy(x) <= supy(x).
  So supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). For supy(x) <= supy(z) to hold, we need supy(x) = infy(x) = supy(z). This means the y-projection of x is a single point. Not possible for regions in REG. W is not possible.
- B: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Requires infx(z) <= infx(x). Not possible as shown for N. B is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the properties of regions homeomorphic to a disk (having non-degenerate bounding boxes), only NW is possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{NW}$.
