PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of the projection of a region r on the x and y axes, respectively. The relations are defined by the relative positions of these bounds.

Given:
1. Region x is SE of region y (x SE y):
   supx(y) <= infx(x)  (Equation 1)
   supy(x) <= infy(y)  (Equation 2)

2. Region y is NE of region z (y NE z):
   supx(z) <= infx(y)  (Equation 3)
   supy(z) <= infy(y)  (Equation 4)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. We need to determine the possible relationships between the bounds of x and z that are implied by the given conditions.

Let's analyze the horizontal relationships between x and z:
From Equation 3, supx(z) <= infx(y).
From Equation 1, supx(y) <= infx(x).
For any region, the infimum is less than or equal to the supremum, so infx(y) <= supx(y).
Combining these inequalities: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
This implies supx(z) <= infx(x).

This derived condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), means the right edge of the bounding box of z is to the left of or touches the left edge of the bounding box of x. Let's examine the horizontal conditions required by each possible cardinal direction relation for 'a R b' where a=x and b=z:
- a B b: infx(b) <= infx(a) AND supx(a) <= supx(b). (infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z))
- a S b: infx(b) <= infx(a) AND supx(a) <= supx(b). (infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z))
- a SW b: supx(a) <= infx(b). (supx(x) <= infx(z))
- a W b: supx(a) <= infx(b). (supx(x) <= infx(z))
- a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b). (supx(x) <= infx(z))
- a N b: infx(b) <= infx(a) AND supx(a) <= supx(b). (infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z))
- a NE b: supx(b) <= infx(a). (supx(z) <= infx(x))
- a E b: supx(b) <= infx(a). (supx(z) <= infx(x))
- a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a). (supx(z) <= infx(x))

The necessary condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is only consistent with the horizontal conditions for E, NE, and SE. It contradicts the horizontal conditions for SW, W, NW (which require supx(x) <= infx(z) unless both are points at the same coordinate). It also contradicts the horizontal conditions for B, S, N (which require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), unless bounding boxes are points), because if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x), this implies infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The interval [infx(x), supx(x)] must be contained within [infx(z), supx(z)], but also supx(z) must be less than or equal to infx(x). This is only possible if the intervals are points and they are the same point, which cannot happen for regions homeomorphic to a disk. Therefore, B, S, W, NW, N, SW are not possible relations between x and z.

Now, let's analyze the vertical relationships between x and z, keeping in mind the conditions supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). Let k = infy(y). We have supy(x) <= k and supy(z) <= k. This means the top boundaries of both x and z are below or at the level of the bottom boundary of y. This doesn't impose a strict ordering between the vertical positions of x and z.

Possible vertical relationships between the bounding boxes of x and z are:
1. x is below z (or touching z's bottom): supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Is this consistent with supy(x) <= k and supy(z) <= k for some k = infy(y)? Yes. For example, let supy(x)=1, infy(z)=2, supy(z)=3. We need k >= supy(x) = 1 and k >= supy(z) = 3. Let k=4. This requires infy(y)=4. If we can find a y with infy(y)=4 and the horizontal conditions satisfied, then this vertical configuration is possible.
   If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x), this is the definition of x SE z. We can construct regions x, y, z satisfying x SE y, y NE z, and x SE z.

2. z is below x (or touching x's bottom): supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Is this consistent with supy(x) <= k and supy(z) <= k? Yes. For example, let supy(z)=1, infy(x)=2, supy(x)=3. We need k >= supy(z) = 1 and k >= supy(x) = 3. Let k=4. This requires infy(y)=4.
   If supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x), this is the definition of x NE z. We can construct regions x, y, z satisfying x SE y, y NE z, and x NE z.

3. Vertical overlap: infy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(x).
   Is this consistent with supy(x) <= k and supy(z) <= k? Yes. For example, let infy(x)=2, supy(x)=4, infy(z)=3, supy(z)=5. (Overlap: 2<=5 and 3<=4). We need k >= supy(x) = 4 and k >= supy(z) = 5. Let k=6. This requires infy(y)=6.
   If there is vertical overlap and supx(z) <= infx(x), which relation holds? The E relation requires a specific type of vertical overlap: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (z's vertical range contains or touches x's).
   We can construct regions x, y, z such that x E z, x SE y, and y NE z are all true simultaneously based on their bounding boxes.

Since any of the three main vertical relationships (x below z, z below x, vertical overlap) are possible given the constraints on y, and the horizontal constraint derived (supx(z) <= infx(x)) is consistent with E, NE, and SE, all three relations E, NE, and SE are possible relations between x and z.

The possible relations are E, NE, and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}$.
