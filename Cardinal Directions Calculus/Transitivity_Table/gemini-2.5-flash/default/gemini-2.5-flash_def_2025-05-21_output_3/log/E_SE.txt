PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x be E of y, and y be SE of z. Let the bounding box of a region r be defined by `[infx(r), supx(r)] x [infy(r), supy(r)]`.

The given relations translate to the following inequalities:

1.  **x is E of y:**
    *   `supx(y) <= infx(x)`
    *   `infy(y) <= infy(x)`
    *   `supy(x) <= supy(y)`

2.  **y is SE of z:**
    *   `supx(z) <= infx(y)`
    *   `supy(y) <= infy(z)`

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on these inequalities. Let's derive some combined inequalities relating x and z.

From (1) and (2):
*   Horizontal: `supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`
    This implies `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. This means the eastern boundary of z is to the west of or touching the western boundary of x. Horizontally, x is to the East of z (or touching).

*   Vertical: `supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)`
    This implies `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. This means the northern boundary of x is to the south of or touching the southern boundary of z. Vertically, x is to the South of z (or touching).

These two derived conditions (`supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`) match the definition of the **SE** relation (a SE b iff `supx(b) <= infx(a)` and `supy(a) <= infy(b)`). Therefore, x SE z is always a possible relation given the premises.

Now let's check if other relations are possible by seeing if their defining conditions can be met under the given constraints.

The possible relations between x and z (a=x, b=z) are defined by:
*   N: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`
*   NE: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`
*   SE: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (Already confirmed as always possible)
*   S: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`
*   E: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`
*   NW: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`
*   W: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`
*   SW: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`
*   B: `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`

We know `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. This contradicts the first condition of W, NW, SW (`supx(x) <= infx(z)`) unless the horizontal bounds are equal (e.g., they are aligned vertical lines or points), which is generally incompatible with non-degenerate regions homeomorphic to a disk. It also contradicts the horizontal alignment conditions of N, S, B (`infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)`) unless the horizontal bounds are equal. Thus, N, S, W, NW, SW, B are generally not possible for non-degenerate regions and configurations.

We are left with E, SE, NE. We already confirmed SE is always possible.

Let's check E(x, z):
Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (True), `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
From the original conditions:
`supy(x) <= supy(y)` (from x E y)
`supy(y) <= infy(z)` (from y SE z)
`infy(z) <= supy(z)` (always true)
Combining these: `supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z)`. This implies `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. So the third condition for E is always met.
The only remaining condition for E is `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is not guaranteed by the original inequalities (`infy(y) <= infy(x)` and `supy(y) <= infy(z)` and `infy(y) <= supy(y)` imply `infy(y) <= infy(x)` and `infy(y) <= infy(z)`).
However, we can construct an example where it is possible:
Let z have bounding box [0,1]x[1,2]. `infy(z)=1`.
Let y have bounding box [2,3]x[0,1]. `supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2` (Y). `supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1` (Y). y SE z holds. `infy(y)=0`.
Let x have bounding box [4,5]x[1,1]. `supx(y)=3 <= infx(x)=4` (Y). `infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=1` (Y). `supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1` (Y). x E y holds. `infy(x)=1`.
Check x E z: x=[4,5]x[1,1], z=[0,1]x[1,2]. `supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=4` (Y). `infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1` (Y). `supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=2` (Y). E is possible.

Let's check NE(x, z):
Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (True), `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
We need `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is not guaranteed by the original inequalities.
However, we can construct an example where it is possible:
Let z have bounding box [0,1]x[1,1]. `supy(z)=1`.
Let y have bounding box [2,3]x[1,1]. `supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2` (Y). `supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1` (Y). y SE z holds. `infy(y)=1, supy(y)=1`.
Let x have bounding box [4,5]x[1,1]. `supx(y)=3 <= infx(x)=4` (Y). `infy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1` (Y). `supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1` (Y). x E y holds. `infy(x)=1`.
Check x NE z: x=[4,5]x[1,1], z=[0,1]x[1,1]. `supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=4` (Y). `supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1` (Y). NE is possible.

The relations E, SE, and NE are the possible relations between region x and region z. The examples using rectangles demonstrate that these relations are possible for bounding boxes, and regions homeomorphic to a disk can be constructed to fit these bounding boxes (e.g., slightly rounded rectangles).

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}$.
