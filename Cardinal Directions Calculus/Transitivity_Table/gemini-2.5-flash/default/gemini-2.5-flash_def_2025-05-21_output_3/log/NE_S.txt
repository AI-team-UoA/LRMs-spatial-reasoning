PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let MBB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of region a, given by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)].
The given conditions are:
1. x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed disk, they have positive width and height. Thus, for any region a, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

From the conditions:
From (1), infx(x) >= supx(y). Since supx(y) > infx(y), we have infx(x) > infx(y).
From (2), infx(y) >= infx(z).
Combining these, infx(x) > infx(y) >= infx(z), which implies infx(x) > infx(z).

Let's examine the horizontal conditions for each of the 9 single-tile relations for x relative to z:
- B, N, S: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- E, NE, SE: supx(z) <= infx(x).
- W, NW, SW: supx(x) <= infx(z).

Since we know infx(x) > infx(z), the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible for non-point regions (as supx(x) > infx(x)). Thus, the relations W, NW, and SW are not possible.

Now let's consider the remaining relations: B, N, S, E, NE, SE.

Case 1: supx(z) <= infx(x). This condition, along with infx(x) > infx(z), is consistent. If this holds, the relation between x and z depends on the vertical alignment.
- If supy(x) <= infy(z): SE is possible. (Horizontal: supx(z) <= infx(x); Vertical: supy(x) <= infy(z)).
- If supy(z) <= infy(x): NE is possible. (Horizontal: supx(z) <= infx(x); Vertical: supy(z) <= infy(x)).
- If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z): E is possible. (Horizontal: supx(z) <= infx(x); Vertical: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)).

Case 2: supx(z) > infx(x). Combined with infx(x) > infx(z), this means infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(z). If this holds, the relation between x and z depends on the horizontal containment.
Subcase 2a: supx(x) <= supx(z). This implies infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z). This is the horizontal condition for B, N, S.
- If supy(x) <= infy(z): S is possible. (Horizontal: infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z); Vertical: supy(x) <= infy(z)).
- If supy(z) <= infy(x): N is possible. (Horizontal: infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z); Vertical: supy(z) <= infy(x)).
- If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z): B is possible. (Horizontal: infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z); Vertical: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)).

Subcase 2b: supx(x) > supx(z). This implies infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x). This horizontal configuration does not match the horizontal condition of any of the 9 single-tile relations as defined. Therefore, this case does not yield any of the possible single-tile relations.

We need to verify if examples exist for B, N, S, E, NE, and SE. We constructed valid examples for all these cases in the thought block. Since W, NW, SW are ruled out, the possible relations are B, N, S, E, NE, SE.

The possible relations are B, N, S, E, NE, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{B, N, S, E, NE, SE}$.
