PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let BB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by the interval [infx(a), supx(a)] on the x-axis and [infy(a), supy(a)] on the y-axis.
Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, their projections onto the x and y axes are non-degenerate closed intervals. Thus, for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

We are given:
1. x B y: x is B of y.
According to the definition of B:
infx(y) <= infx(x)
supx(x) <= supx(y)
infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. y S z: y is S of z.
According to the definition of S:
supy(y) <= infy(z)
infx(z) <= infx(y)
supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on the definitions of the 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations. These relations are defined based on the relative positions of the bounding boxes of the two regions. Let's derive the constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z.

From the given conditions, we can combine the inequalities:
- For the x-coordinates:
  From x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x)
  From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y)
  Combining these: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) => infx(z) <= infx(x)

  From x B y: supx(x) <= supx(y)
  From y S z: supx(y) <= supx(z)
  Combining these: supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) => supx(x) <= supx(z)

- For the y-coordinates:
  From x B y: supy(x) <= supy(y)
  From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
  Combining these: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z)

So, for regions x and z satisfying the conditions, their bounding boxes must satisfy:
(A) supy(x) <= infy(z)
(B) infx(z) <= infx(x)
(C) supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now let's check which of the 9 possible relations between x and z are consistent with these three derived conditions and the REG constraint (inf < sup for both x and z).

1.  S (x S z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    These are exactly conditions (A), (B), and (C). Thus, S is a possible relation between x and z.

2.  B (x B z): Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We have the first two conditions ((B) and (C)). We also have supy(x) <= infy(z) (A). For B to hold, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Combining supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), we get supy(x) <= infy(x).
    However, since x is a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x).
    The condition supy(x) <= infy(x) contradicts infy(x) < supy(x). Therefore, B is not possible.

3.  N (x N z): Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We have the last two conditions ((B) and (C)). We also have supy(x) <= infy(z) (A).
    For N to hold, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
    From the REG constraint, we know infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z).
    Combining these, we have infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z). This implies infy(x) < supy(z).
    The required condition for N, supy(z) <= infy(x), contradicts infy(x) < supy(z). Therefore, N is not possible.

4.  W (x W z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From our derived conditions, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) (B) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (C).
    For W to hold, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
    Combining this with (B), we get supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x).
    However, since x is a region in REG, infx(x) < supx(x).
    The condition supx(x) <= infx(x) contradicts infx(x) < supx(x). Therefore, W is not possible.

5.  E (x E z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From our derived conditions, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) (B) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (C).
    For E to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x).
    Combining this with (B) and (C), we get infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) AND supx(z) <= infx(x).
    This implies infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
    This requires infx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z). This would mean the x-projections of both x and z are single points, which contradicts the REG constraint (infx < supx). Therefore, E is not possible.

6.  SW (x SW z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We have supy(x) <= infy(z) (A).
    For SW to hold, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). As shown for W, this contradicts the REG constraint on infx(x) and supx(x). Therefore, SW is not possible.

7.  NW (x NW z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), which is impossible as shown for W. Therefore, NW is not possible.

8.  SE (x SE z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We have supy(x) <= infy(z) (A).
    For SE to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown for E, this contradicts the REG constraint on infx and supx unless the x-projections are points. Therefore, SE is not possible.

9.  NE (x NE z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), which is impossible as shown for E. Therefore, NE is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the constraints imposed by regions being homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, the only possible relation between region x and region z is S.

The final answer is $\boxed{S}$.
