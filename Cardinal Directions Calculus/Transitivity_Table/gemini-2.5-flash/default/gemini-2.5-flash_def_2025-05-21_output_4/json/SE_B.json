Both `supy(x)` and `infy(z)` are less than or equal to `infy(y)`. Their relative position is not fixed by these inequalities alone. It is possible that `infy(z) <= supy(x)` (meaning `x` is vertically below or overlapping the bottom of `z`) or `supy(x) < infy(z)` (meaning `x` is entirely below the bottom of `z`). Since `infy(x) < supy(x)`, it is possible that `infy(x) < infy(z)`.\n\nConsider `supx(x)` relative to `supx(z)`:\nWe have `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supx(y) <= supx(z)`.
