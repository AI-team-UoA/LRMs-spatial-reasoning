For r1: N, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: W, NW
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The given relations are:
1) x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) AND infx(y) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(y)
2) y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) AND infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on their minimum bounding boxes. Let's analyze the inequalities for x and z.

From (2), supx(z) <= infx(y).
From (1), infx(y) <= infx(x).
Combining these, we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which implies **supx(z) <= infx(x)**.
This inequality means the right edge of z's bounding box is at or to the left of the left edge of x's bounding box. This restricts the possible horizontal relations.
Relations requiring supx(x) <= infx(z) (W, NW, SW) are impossible.
Relations requiring horizontal overlap in a way that infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) (N, S, B) are also impossible. This is because combining supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is only possible if the x-projection is a single point, not allowed for regions in REG.

So, the only possible horizontal relations are those where x is to the east of z, or vertically aligned with the east boundary of z. These are E, NE, SE.

Now let's consider the vertical relations between x and z.
From (2), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
From (1), supy(y) <= infy(x).

Combining infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we get: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies **infy(z) <= infy(x)**.
This inequality means the bottom edge of z's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of x's bounding box. This rules out SE, which requires supy(x) <= infy(z) (combining with infy(z) <= infy(x) implies supy(x) <= infy(x), impossible for valid regions).

The remaining possible relations (from the horizontal analysis) are E and NE. Let's check if their vertical conditions are consistent with our derived inequalities.

For E (x E z): supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have already derived supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x).
The remaining condition is supy(x) <= supy(z). Is this possible?
Consider the example:
z = [0, 1] x [0, 3]
y E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y). supy(y) <= supy(z)=3.
Let y = [1, 2] x [1, 2]. infx=1, supx=2, infy=1, supy=2.
1 <= 1 (ok), 0 <= 1 (ok), 2 <= 3 (ok). y E z holds.
x N y: supy(y)=2 <= infy(x). infx(y)=1 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y)=2.
Let infy(x)=2, supy(x)=3. Let infx(x)=1, supx(x)=2.
x = [1, 2] x [2, 3].
Now check x E z: x=[1,2]x[2,3], z=[0,1]x[0,3].
supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=1 (ok).
infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=2 (ok).
supy(x)=3 <= supy(z)=3 (ok).
All conditions for E are met. So E is a possible relation.

For NE (x NE z): supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
We have already derived supx(z) <= infx(x).
The remaining condition is supy(z) <= infy(x). Is this possible?
Consider the example:
z = [0, 1] x [0, 1]
y E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y). supy(y) <= supy(z)=1.
Let y = [1, 2] x [0.5, 1]. infx=1, supx=2, infy=0.5, supy=1.
1 <= 1 (ok), 0 <= 0.5 (ok), 1 <= 1 (ok). y E z holds.
x N y: supy(y)=1 <= infy(x). infx(y)=1 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y)=2.
Let infy(x)=1, supy(x)=2. Let infx(x)=1, supx(x)=2.
x = [1, 2] x [1, 2].
Now check x NE z: x=[1,2]x[1,2], z=[0,1]x[0,1].
supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=1 (ok).
supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1 (ok).
All conditions for NE are met. So NE is a possible relation.

We have ruled out B, S, SW, W, NW, N, SE and shown that E and NE are possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z are E and NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, NE}$.
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: N, S, B
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: The given information is:
1) x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2) y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's denote infx(a) as ix(a), supx(a) as sx(a), infy(a) as iy(a), and supy(a) as sy(a).

From (1):
sy(y) <= iy(x)  (i)
ix(y) <= ix(x)  (ii)
sx(x) <= sx(y)  (iii)

From (2):
sx(y) <= ix(z)  (iv)
sy(y) <= iy(z)  (v)

Combining (iii) and (iv), we get:
sx(x) <= sx(y) <= ix(z)
This implies:
sx(x) <= ix(z)  (vi)

This inequality tells us that the right edge of the bounding box of x is to the left of or touching the left edge of the bounding box of z. This is a crucial constraint on the horizontal relationship between x and z.

Let's examine the definitions of the possible relations between x and z based on their bounding boxes:

x B z: ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z)
x S z: sy(x) <= iy(z), ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z)
x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(x) <= iy(z)
x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z)
x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(z) <= iy(x)
x N z: sy(z) <= iy(x), ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z)
x NE z: sx(z) <= ix(x), sy(z) <= iy(x)
x E z: sx(z) <= ix(x), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z)
x SE z: sx(z) <= ix(x), sy(x) <= iy(z)

Now let's check which of these are compatible with the derived constraint (vi) sx(x) <= ix(z). Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, meaning their bounding boxes have non-zero width (ix < sx) and height (iy < sy).

- **B**: Requires ix(z) <= ix(x) and sx(x) <= sx(z). Combined with sx(x) <= ix(z), we get sx(x) <= ix(z) <= ix(x). Since ix(x) < sx(x) for a valid region, this implies ix(x) = sx(x) = ix(z), which is impossible for a non-degenerate region. So B is not possible.
- **S**: Requires ix(z) <= ix(x) and sx(x) <= sx(z). Similar to B, this implies ix(x) = sx(x) = ix(z), impossible. So S is not possible.
- **N**: Requires ix(z) <= ix(x) and sx(x) <= sx(z). Similar to B, this implies ix(x) = sx(x) = ix(z), impossible. So N is not possible.
- **E**: Requires sx(z) <= ix(x). Combined with sx(x) <= ix(z), we get sx(x) <= ix(z) and sx(z) <= ix(x). For non-degenerate regions, ix(x) < sx(x) and ix(z) < sx(z). If sx(x) < ix(z) and sx(z) < ix(x), this implies the interval [ix(x), sx(x)] is to the left of [ix(z), sx(z)], and [ix(z), sx(z)] is to the left of [ix(x), sx(x)], a contradiction. Equality is possible only if sx(x) = ix(z) and sx(z) = ix(x). This means the intervals are identical, [a, b] = [c, d] where b=c and d=a. This implies a=b=c=d, impossible for non-degenerate regions. So E is not possible.
- **NE**: Requires sx(z) <= ix(x). Similar to E, this contradicts sx(x) <= ix(z). So NE is not possible.
- **SE**: Requires sx(z) <= ix(x). Similar to E, this contradicts sx(x) <= ix(z). So SE is not possible.

This leaves SW, W, and NW as the only possible relations, as their definitions include or are consistent with the constraint sx(x) <= ix(z). Let's confirm if each of these is actually possible by constructing an example.

Recall the constraints from the premises:
sy(y) <= iy(x)  (i)
ix(y) <= ix(x)  (ii)
sx(x) <= sx(y)  (iii)
sx(y) <= ix(z)  (iv)
sy(y) <= iy(z)  (v)
Derived: sx(x) <= ix(z) (vi)

We can use disk-like regions (e.g., disks themselves) for construction, as they belong to REG. Let y be the unit disk centered at (0,0), so ix(y)=-1, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=-1, sy(y)=1.

(i) 1 <= iy(x)
(ii) -1 <= ix(x)
(iii) sx(x) <= 1
(iv) 1 <= ix(z)
(v) 1 <= iy(z)
(vi) sx(x) <= ix(z)

- **SW (x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(x) <= iy(z))**:
  We need to check if sy(x) <= iy(z) is possible along with the initial conditions.
  Choose x as a disk centered at (0, 1.5) with radius 0.5. Bbox [-0.5, 0.5]x[1, 2].
  ix(x)=-0.5, sx(x)=0.5, iy(x)=1, sy(x)=2.
  (i) 1 <= 1 (T), (ii) -1 <= -0.5 (T), (iii) 0.5 <= 1 (T). x N y holds.
  Choose z as a disk centered at (2.5, 2.5) with radius 0.5. Bbox [2, 3]x[2, 3].
  ix(z)=2, sx(z)=3, iy(z)=2, sy(z)=3.
  (iv) 1 <= 2 (T), (v) 1 <= 2 (T). y SW z holds.
  Check x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) (0.5 <= 2, T), sy(x) <= iy(z) (2 <= 2, T). SW is possible.

- **W (x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z))**:
  We need to check if iy(z) <= iy(x) and sy(x) <= sy(z) are possible.
  Choose x as a disk centered at (0, 2) with radius 1. Bbox [-1, 1]x[1, 3].
  ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=1, iy(x)=1, sy(x)=3.
  (i) 1 <= 1 (T), (ii) -1 <= -1 (T), (iii) 1 <= 1 (T). x N y holds.
  Choose z as a disk centered at (3, 2) with radius 1. Bbox [2, 4]x[1, 3].
  ix(z)=2, sx(z)=4, iy(z)=1, sy(z)=3.
  (iv) 1 <= 2 (T), (v) 1 <= 1 (T). y SW z holds.
  Check x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z) (1 <= 2, T), iy(z) <= iy(x) (1 <= 1, T), sy(x) <= sy(z) (3 <= 3, T). W is possible.

- **NW (x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(z) <= iy(x))**:
  We need to check if sy(z) <= iy(x) is possible.
  Choose x as a disk centered at (0, 2) with radius 1. Bbox [-1, 1]x[1, 3].
  ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=1, iy(x)=1, sy(x)=3.
  (i) 1 <= 1 (T), (ii) -1 <= -1 (T), (iii) 1 <= 1 (T). x N y holds.
  Choose z as a disk centered at (3, 0) with radius 1. Bbox [2, 4]x[-1, 1].
  ix(z)=2, sx(z)=4, iy(z)=-1, sy(z)=1.
  (iv) 1 <= 2 (T), (v) 1 <= -1 (F). y SW z does NOT hold for this z.

Let's retry NW construction with y SW z holding (1 <= ix(z), 1 <= iy(z)) and sy(z) <= iy(x).
y=[-1,1]x[-1,1].
x N y: iy(x) >= 1, ix(x) >= -1, sx(x) <= 1.
y SW z: ix(z) >= 1, iy(z) >= 1.
Need x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(z) <= iy(x).
Let x be a disk centered at (0, 3), radius 1. Bbox [-1, 1]x[2, 4]. iy(x)=2, sy(x)=4.
(i) 1 <= 2 (T), (ii) -1 <= -1 (T), (iii) 1 <= 1 (T). x N y holds.
Let z be a disk centered at (3, 2), radius 1. Bbox [2, 4]x[1, 3]. ix(z)=2, iy(z)=1, sy(z)=3.
(iv) 1 <= 2 (T), (v) 1 <= 1 (T). y SW z holds.
Check x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) (1 <= 2, T), sy(z) <= iy(x) (3 <= 2, F). Failed.

Let's try to make sy(z) <= iy(x).
x N y: iy(x) >= sy(y).
y SW z: iy(z) >= sy(y).
Need sy(z) <= iy(x).
Choose sy(y) = 0 (e.g., y is the interval [-1,1] on the x-axis, but y must be in REG, so y is a thin ellipse). Let y's bbox be [-1,1]x[-0.1, 0.1]. sy(y)=0.1.
x N y: iy(x) >= 0.1, ix(x) >= -1, sx(x) <= 1.
y SW z: ix(z) >= 1, iy(z) >= 0.1.
Need sx(x) <= ix(z) (already derived) and sy(z) <= iy(x).

Let y be disk at (0,0), [-1,1]x[-1,1]. sy(y)=1.
x N y: iy(x) >= 1, ix(x) >= -1, sx(x) <= 1.
y SW z: ix(z) >= 1, iy(z) >= 1.
Need sy(z) <= iy(x).
Let iy(x) = 3. For disk x, if sx(x)-ix(x)=2, sy(x)-iy(x)=2, so sy(x)=5. x: [-1,1]x[3,5].
Let iy(z) = 1. For disk z, if sx(z)-ix(z)=2, sy(z)-iy(z)=2, so sy(z)=3. ix(z)=2, sx(z)=4. z: [2,4]x[1,3].
x N y: 1 <= 3 (T), -1 <= -1 (T), 1 <= 1 (T). Holds.
y SW z: 1 <= 2 (T), 1 <= 1 (T). Holds.
x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) (1 <= 2, T), sy(z) <= iy(x) (3 <= 3, T). Holds. NW is possible.

The possible relations are SW, W, NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW, W, NW}$.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: The given relations are:
1. Region x is N of region y (x N y).
2. Region y is SE of region z (y SE z).

Let [infx(a), supx(a)] be the x-projection and [infy(a), supy(a)] be the y-projection of region a.
The regions are in REG, which means they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies that their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

From the definition of the relations:
x N y means:
(N1) supy(y) <= infy(x)
(N2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
(N3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

y SE z means:
(SE1) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(SE2) supy(y) <= infy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on their bounding boxes.

Combine (N2) and (SE1):
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x).
Since x is in REG, infx(x) < supx(x).
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x).
This gives us infx(x) > supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z).

The condition infx(x) > supx(z) implies that the left edge of x's bounding box is strictly to the right of the right edge of z's bounding box. This means the bounding box of x is entirely to the East of the bounding box of z (except possibly touching).
Let's check the cardinal direction definitions based on this.
- x W z requires supx(x) <= infx(z). This is not possible since infx(z) < supx(z) < infx(x) <= supx(x).
- x NW z requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Not possible.
- x SW z requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Not possible.
- x B z requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). supx(x) <= supx(z) is not possible since supx(x) > supx(z).
- x N z requires supx(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). supx(x) <= supx(z) is not possible.
- x S z requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). supx(x) <= supx(z) is not possible.

The only possible relations left from the list {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} are NE, E, and SE, all of which require supx(z) <= infx(x) (or supx(z) < infx(x), which we found).

Let's check if E, NE, and SE are indeed possible by constructing examples of bounding boxes that satisfy the given conditions:

Possibility E (x E z): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
Let B(z) = [0, 2] x [0, 2].
y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => 2 <= infx(y). supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(y) <= 0.
Let B(y) = [3, 4] x [-2, -1]. (2 <= 3, -1 <= 0; y SE z holds)
x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) => -1 <= infy(x). infx(y) <= infx(x) => 3 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y) => supx(x) <= 4.
For x E z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
infy(z)=0, supy(z)=2. We need 0 <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= 2.
We also need infy(x) >= -1. So we need 0 <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= 2.
Let B(x) = [3.5, 3.8] x [0.5, 1.5]. (3 <= 3.5, 3.8 <= 4, -1 <= 0.5; x N y holds)
Check x E z: B(x) = [3.5, 3.8] x [0.5, 1.5], B(z) = [0, 2] x [0, 2].
supx(z)=2, infx(x)=3.5 (2 <= 3.5; OK)
infy(z)=0, infy(x)=0.5 (0 <= 0.5; OK)
supy(x)=1.5, supy(z)=2 (1.5 <= 2; OK)
E is possible.

Possibility NE (x NE z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
Let B(z) = [0, 10] x [0, 10]. supy(z)=10.
y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => 10 <= infx(y). supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(y) <= 0.
Let B(y) = [11, 12] x [-2, -1]. (10 <= 11, -1 <= 0; y SE z holds)
x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) => -1 <= infy(x). infx(y) <= infx(x) => 11 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y) => supx(x) <= 12.
For x NE z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). supy(z)=10. We need 10 <= infy(x).
We also need infy(x) >= -1. So we need 10 <= infy(x).
Let B(x) = [11.5, 11.8] x [10, 11]. (11 <= 11.5, 11.8 <= 12, -1 <= 10; x N y holds)
Check x NE z: B(x) = [11.5, 11.8] x [10, 11], B(z) = [0, 10] x [0, 10].
supx(z)=10, infx(x)=11.5 (10 <= 11.5; OK)
supy(z)=10, infy(x)=10 (10 <= 10; OK)
NE is possible.

Possibility SE (x SE z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
Let B(z) = [0, 2] x [0, 2]. infy(z)=0.
y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => 2 <= infx(y). supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(y) <= 0.
Let B(y) = [3, 4] x [-2, -1]. (2 <= 3, -1 <= 0; y SE z holds)
x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) => -1 <= infy(x). infx(y) <= infx(x) => 3 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y) => supx(x) <= 4.
For x SE z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). infy(z)=0. We need supy(x) <= 0.
We also need infy(x) >= -1. So we need -1 <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= 0.
Let B(x) = [3.5, 3.8] x [-0.8, -0.5]. (3 <= 3.5, 3.8 <= 4, -1 <= -0.8; x N y holds)
Check x SE z: B(x) = [3.5, 3.8] x [-0.8, -0.5], B(z) = [0, 2] x [0, 2].
supx(z)=2, infx(x)=3.5 (2 <= 3.5; OK)
supy(x)=-0.5, infy(z)=0 (-0.5 <= 0; OK)
SE is possible.

Since we have shown that E, NE, and SE are possible, and all other relations have been ruled out based on the non-degenerate property of bounding boxes for regions in REG, the possible relations between region x and region z are E, NE, and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, NE, SE}$.
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: N, B
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: N, NW
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: W, E, B
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be represented by `[infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
The definitions of the given single-tile cardinal relations in terms of bounding boxes are:
a B b: infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a S b: supy(a) <= infy(b) and infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a SW b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
a W b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a N b: supy(b) <= infy(a) and infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a E b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

We are given:
1) x W y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2) y S z:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z)

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, implying their bounding boxes are non-degenerate (infx < supx and infy < supy).

Let's derive the constraints on the bounding box of x relative to the bounding box of z.

Vertical relation between x and z:
From (1): supy(x) <= supy(y)
From (2): supy(y) <= infy(z)
Combining these, we get supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z) is always true. This means the top of the bounding box of x is below or at the bottom of the bounding box of z.

Let's check which single-tile relations between x and z are consistent with supy(x) <= infy(z):
- S (x S z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Consistent.
- SW (x SW z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Consistent.
- SE (x SE z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Consistent.
- W (x W z): infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires infy(z) <= infy(x).
- E (x E z): infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires infy(z) <= infy(x).
- B (x B z): infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires infy(z) <= infy(x).
- N (x N z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Requires z is below x vertically.
- NW (x NW z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Requires z is below x vertically.
- NE (x NE z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Requires z is below x vertically.

Check relations requiring z below x vertically (supy(z) <= infy(x)):
We have supy(x) <= infy(z) (always true).
We also have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z).
If supy(z) <= infy(x), then we have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(x) <= infy(x). For a non-degenerate bounding box of x, infy(x) < supy(x).
Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
Relations N, NE, NW are impossible.

Check relations requiring infy(z) <= infy(x) (W, E, B):
If infy(z) <= infy(x) holds, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z) (always true), we get supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(x) <= infy(x). Again, for a non-degenerate bounding box of x, infy(x) < supy(x).
Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible for non-degenerate regions given the initial conditions.
Relations W, E, B are impossible.

The only remaining possible relations based on the vertical constraint are S, SW, SE.

Horizontal relation between x and z:
From (1): supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (2): infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's check which single-tile relations between x and z are consistent with these horizontal constraints:
- W, SW, NW (x R z): supx(x) <= infx(z). Requires the right of x is left of or at the left of z.
- E, NE, SE (x R z): supx(z) <= infx(x). Requires the right of z is left of or at the left of x.
- N, S, B (x R z): infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Requires x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection.

Check relations requiring supx(z) <= infx(x) (E, NE, SE):
We know supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
Thus, supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). For a non-degenerate bounding box of x, infx(x) < supx(x).
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
Relations E, NE, SE are impossible.

This leaves only S and SW from the earlier vertical analysis. Let's check their horizontal conditions:

- S (x S z): infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we don't get a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z).
  From supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), we get supx(x) <= supx(z) (always true).
  We need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
  We have infx(z) <= infx(y). Also, infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y).
  Can infx(z) <= infx(x)? Yes. Example: infx(y)=10. infx(z)=5. supx(x)=8, infx(x)=7. (5<=7 is possible, and constraints 5<=10, 7<=8<=10 are met).
  So, the horizontal condition for S (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) is possible.
  The vertical condition for S (supy(x) <= infy(z)) is always true.
  Therefore, S is a possible relation.

- SW (x SW z): supx(x) <= infx(z).
  From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
  Can supx(x) <= infx(z)? Yes. Example: infx(y)=10. supx(x)=8. infx(z)=9. (8<=10, 9<=10, 8<=9 are met).
  So, the horizontal condition for SW (supx(x) <= infx(z)) is possible.
  The vertical condition for SW (supy(x) <= infy(z)) is always true.
  Therefore, SW is a possible relation.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box inequalities, assuming non-degenerate bounding boxes for regions homeomorphic to a disk, the only possible relations are S and SW. Relations requiring vertical overlap with z (W, E, B) or z being above x (N, NW, NE) or z being west of x (E, SE, NE) are impossible.

The possible relations are S and SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW}$.
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: Let the bounding box of a region $r$ be denoted by $BB(r) = [infx(r), supx(r)] \times [infy(r), supy(r)]$.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which means they are closed, bounded, connected, and have no holes. For such regions, $infx(r) < supx(r)$ and $infy(r) < supy(r)$.

The given conditions are:
1.  Region x is W of region y (x W y).
    By definition:
    $supx(x) \leq infx(y) \quad (1)$
    $infy(y) \leq infy(x) \quad (2)$
    $supy(x) \leq supy(y) \quad (3)$

2.  Region y is SW of region z (y SW z).
    By definition:
    $supx(y) \leq infx(z) \quad (4)$
    $supy(y) \leq infy(z) \quad (5)$

We want to find the possible relation(s) between region x and region z. Let's analyze the relationships between the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

From (1) and (4), and knowing that $infx(y) \leq supx(y)$ for any region y:
$supx(x) \leq infx(y) \leq supx(y) \leq infx(z)$
This chain of inequalities implies:
$supx(x) \leq infx(z) \quad (A)$

From (3) and (5):
$supy(x) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(z)$
This chain of inequalities implies:
$supy(x) \leq infy(z) \quad (B)$

Now let's check which of the possible single-tile cardinal relations between x and z are consistent with inequalities (A) and (B), keeping in mind that for any region $r \in REG$, $infx(r) < supx(r)$ and $infy(r) < supy(r)$.

The conditions for each relation between x and z are:
-   x B z: $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$, $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$, $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$.
    Requires $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. From (A), $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$. If $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$, then $supx(x) \leq infx(x)$, which contradicts $infx(x) < supx(x)$. Thus, x B z is not possible.

-   x S z: $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$, $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$.
    Requires $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. As shown for B, this contradicts (A). Thus, x S z is not possible.

-   x SW z: $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$, $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$.
    These are exactly inequalities (A) and (B), which are necessary consequences of the given conditions. Thus, x SW z is a possible relation.

-   x W z: $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$, $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$, $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$.
    Requires $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$. From (B), $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$. If $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$, then $supy(x) \leq infy(x)$, which contradicts $infy(x) < supy(x)$. Thus, x W z is not possible.

-   x NW z: $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$, $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$.
    Requires $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. From (B), $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$. Also, $infy(z) \leq supy(z)$. So, $supy(x) \leq infy(z) \leq supy(z)$. If $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$, then $supy(x) \leq infy(z) \leq supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. This implies $supy(x) \leq infy(x)$, which contradicts $infy(x) < supy(x)$. Thus, x NW z is not possible.

-   x N z: $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$, $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$.
    Requires $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. As shown for NW, this contradicts (B). Thus, x N z is not possible.

-   x NE z: $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$.
    Requires $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. As shown for NW, this contradicts (B).
    Also requires $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$. From (A), $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$. Also, $infx(z) \leq supx(z)$. So, $supx(x) \leq infx(z) \leq supx(z)$. If $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, then $supx(x) \leq infx(z) \leq supx(z) \leq infx(x)$. This implies $supx(x) \leq infx(x)$, which contradicts $infx(x) < supx(x)$.
    Thus, x NE z is not possible.

-   x E z: $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$, $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$.
    Requires $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$. As shown for NE, this contradicts (A). Thus, x E z is not possible.

-   x SE z: $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$.
    Requires $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$. As shown for NE, this contradicts (A). Thus, x SE z is not possible.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box inequalities, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW}$.
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: SW
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: NW, N, NE
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: The given relations are:
1.  x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
2.  y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's analyze the relations between the bounds of x and z.

From the y-conditions in x W y and y B z:
infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
Combining these, we get: infy(z) <= infy(x)

supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)
Combining these, we get: supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, for any region x satisfying x W y and any region z satisfying y B z, the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now let's look at the definitions of the cardinal direction relations for x and z:
-   R is S, SW, SE if supy(x) <= infy(z). We derived infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) implies infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). For regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, the infimum and supremum of a projection must be different (infy < supy). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible for non-degenerate regions. So S, SW, SE are not possible relations between x and z.
-   R is N, NW, NE if supy(z) <= infy(x). We derived infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) implies infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(y) = supy(z). This implies zero y-extent for x, y, and z, which is not allowed. So N, NW, NE are not possible relations between x and z.

Based on the y-conditions, the only possible relations between x and z are those whose y-conditions are infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). These relations are B, W, and E.

Now let's examine the x-conditions for these remaining relations:

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We have:
    supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
    infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
    supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
    Can we find regions x, y, z in REG such that infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), x W y and y B z?
    Let x = [5, 6] x [5, 6]
    Let y = [10, 11] x [4, 7]
    Let z = [4, 12] x [3, 8]
    Check x W y: supx(x)=6 <= infx(y)=10 (T), infy(y)=4 <= infy(x)=5 (T), supy(x)=6 <= supy(y)=7 (T). Holds.
    Check y B z: infx(z)=4 <= infx(y)=10 (T), supx(y)=11 <= supx(z)=12 (T), infy(z)=3 <= infy(y)=4 (T), supy(y)=7 <= supy(z)=8 (T). Holds.
    Check x B z: infx(z)=4 <= infx(x)=5 (T), supx(x)=6 <= supx(z)=12 (T), infy(z)=3 <= infy(x)=5 (T), supy(x)=6 <= supy(z)=8 (T). Holds.
    Since we found an example where x B z is true, B is a possible relation.

-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z).
    Can we find regions x, y, z in REG such that supx(x) <= infx(z), x W y and y B z?
    Let x = [0, 1] x [5, 6]
    Let y = [10, 11] x [5, 6]
    Let z = [5, 12] x [4, 7]
    Check x W y: supx(x)=1 <= infx(y)=10 (T), infy(y)=5 <= infy(x)=5 (T), supy(x)=6 <= supy(y)=6 (T). Holds.
    Check y B z: infx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=10 (T), supx(y)=11 <= supx(z)=12 (T), infy(z)=4 <= infy(y)=5 (T), supy(y)=6 <= supy(z)=7 (T). Holds.
    Check x W z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=5 (T), infy(z)=4 <= infy(x)=5 (T), supy(x)=6 <= supy(z)=7 (T). Holds.
    Since we found an example where x W z is true, W is a possible relation.

-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x).
    We have supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z) and supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y).
    Also infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y).
    If supx(z) <= infx(x) were possible, then supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). So supx(y) <= infx(x).
    We also have supx(x) <= infx(y).
    This implies supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(y).
    However, from y B z, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). This means infx(y) < supx(y) (as y has positive x-extent).
    So we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y).
    This implies supx(x) < supx(y) <= infx(x).
    So supx(x) < infx(x). This means x has zero or negative x-extent, which is impossible for a region in REG.
    Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible, and x E z is not a possible relation.

The possible relations are B and W.

B, W
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. We are given the following relations based on their minimum bounding boxes (BB):

1.  x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
2.  y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the relationships between the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

From (1) and (2), we can combine inequalities:

Horizontal relations:
*   infx(x) >= supx(y) (from 1)
*   supx(y) <= supx(z) (from 2)
    These two inequalities together (infx(x) >= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)) do not provide a necessary relation between infx(x) and supx(z). infx(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than supx(z).
*   infx(y) >= infx(z) (from 2)
*   From infx(x) >= supx(y) and supx(y) >= infx(y) (since supx >= infx for regions with area), and infx(y) >= infx(z), we get infx(x) >= infx(y) >= infx(z). Thus, **infx(x) >= infx(z)**. (The left edge of BB(x) is at or to the right of the left edge of BB(z)).
*   There is no direct necessary relation derived for supx(x) relative to infx(z) or supx(z).

Vertical relations:
*   infy(x) >= infy(y) (from 1)
*   infy(y) >= supy(z) (from 2)
    Combining these, we get **infy(x) >= supy(z)**. (The bottom edge of BB(x) is at or above the top edge of BB(z)).
*   supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 1)
*   From infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(y) > infy(y) (for regions with area), we get supy(y) > supy(z).
*   Combining supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) > supy(z), we get supy(x) < supy(y). supy(x) can be less than, equal to, or greater than supy(z).

Now let's check which cardinal relations between x and z are possible based on these necessary conditions (infx(x) >= infx(z) and infy(x) >= supy(z)) and the definitions:

A relation 'a R b' is possible if there exist regions x, y, z in REG satisfying the premises (x E y, y N z) and the conditions for 'x R z'.

1.  x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived infy(x) >= supy(z). Since regions in REG have area, supy(z) > infy(z) and supy(x) > infy(x).
    If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This gives supy(x) < supy(x), a contradiction. Thus, **supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible**.
    Therefore, S is impossible.

2.  x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We derived infx(x) >= infx(z). For regions with area, supx(x) > infx(x). So supx(x) > infx(z). Thus, **supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible**.
    We also showed supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, SW is impossible.

3.  x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, W is impossible.

4.  x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(a).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, NW is impossible.

5.  x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(a) <= infy(b).
    We derived supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, SE is impossible.

6.  x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We derived infy(x) >= supy(z), and supy(z) > infy(z), so infy(x) > infy(z), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x) is true.
    supy(x) <= supy(z) is impossible (as shown for S).
    Therefore, E is impossible.

7.  x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    infx(z) <= infx(x) is true.
    infy(z) <= infy(x) is true.
    supy(x) <= supy(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, B is impossible.

The only remaining possible relations are N and NE. Let's check if they are indeed possible by construction.

8.  x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is true.
    infx(z) <= infx(x) is true.
    We need to check if supx(x) <= supx(z) is possible.
    Example: BB(z) = [0, 4] x [-1, 0], BB(y) = [1, 3] x [1, 2], BB(x) = [3, 4] x [1, 2].
    y N z: supy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=1 (T), infx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=1 (T), supx(y)=3 <= supx(z)=4 (T). Yes.
    x E y: infx(x)=3 >= supx(y)=3 (T), infy(x)=1 >= infy(y)=1 (T), supy(x)=2 <= supy(y)=2 (T). Yes.
    Check x N z: supy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=1 (T), infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=3 (T), supx(x)=4 <= supx(z)=4 (T). Yes.
    Therefore, N is possible.

9.  x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is true.
    We need to check if supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
    Example: BB(z) = [0, 1] x [-2, -1], BB(y) = [0, 1] x [0, 1], BB(x) = [1.5, 2.5] x [0, 1].
    y N z: supy(z)=-1 <= infy(y)=0 (T), infx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supx(y)=1 <= supx(z)=1 (T). Yes.
    x E y: infx(x)=1.5 >= supx(y)=1 (T), infy(x)=0 >= infy(y)=0 (T), supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (T). Yes.
    Check x NE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=1.5 (T), supy(z)=-1 <= infy(x)=0 (T). Yes.
    Therefore, NE is possible.

The possible relations are N and NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE}$.
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: W, E, B
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Let the minimum bounding box of a region $a$ be represented by the interval $[infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$.

The given conditions are:
1.  $x$ E $y$: $supx(y) \le infx(x)$, $infy(y) \le infy(x)$, and $supy(x) \le supy(y)$.
2.  $y$ S $z$: $supy(y) \le infy(z)$, $infx(z) \le infx(y)$, and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.

We are considering regions in REG, which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This implies that for any region $a \in$ REG, its minimum bounding box is non-degenerate, meaning $infx(a) < supx(a)$ and $infy(a) < supy(a)$.

Let's derive relationships between the bounding boxes of $x$ and $z$.

From condition 1 (x E y):
(1a) $supx(y) \le infx(x)$
(1b) $infy(y) \le infy(x)$
(1c) $supy(x) \le supy(y)$

From condition 2 (y S z):
(2a) $supy(y) \le infy(z)$
(2b) $infx(z) \le infx(y)$
(2c) $supx(y) \le supx(z)$

Vertical relationship between x and z:
From (1c) and (2a): $supy(x) \le supy(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(z)$.
Combining these, we get $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
This inequality means that the maximum y-coordinate of region x is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of region z. This corresponds to x being vertically "South" of z (or their upper/lower boundaries aligning). This relation ($supy(a) \le infy(b)$) is a component of the S, SW, and SE relations.

Horizontal relationship between x and z:
From (2b): $infx(z) \le infx(y)$. Since regions are non-degenerate, $infx(y) < supx(y)$.
So, $infx(z) \le infx(y) < supx(y)$.
From (1a): $supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
Combining $infx(z) < supx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le infx(x)$, we get $infx(z) < infx(x)$.
This means the minimum x-coordinate of z is strictly less than the minimum x-coordinate of x. Region x's left edge is always to the right of region z's left edge. This rules out x being West or North-West of z (where $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is required, which contradicts $infx(z) < infx(x) \le supx(x)$ for non-degenerate x). It also rules out z containing x or aligning on the left (required for B).

Now let's examine which of the 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations (R) are possible for x R z, given $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ and $infx(z) < infx(x)$.

1.  B ($z$ B $x$): $infx(x) \le infx(z)$, $supx(z) \le supx(x)$, $infy(x) \le infy(z)$, $supy(z) \le supy(x)$.
    Requires $infx(x) \le infx(z)$. Contradicts $infx(z) < infx(x)$. Impossible.

2.  S ($x$ S $z$): $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ holds (derived).
    $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ holds (derived, $infx(z) < infx(x)$).
    $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ must be possible.
    Consider MBB(y) = [0,1]x[0,1], MBB(z) = [-1,2]x[2,3]. (y S z: 1<=2, -1<=0, 1<=2. OK).
    Consider MBB(x) = [1.1,1.8]x[0.5,0.8]. (x E y: 1<=1.1, 0<=0.5, 0.8<=1. OK).
    x vs z: MBB(x)=[1.1,1.8]x[0.5,0.8], MBB(z)=[-1,2]x[2,3].
    $supy(x)=0.8 \le infy(z)=2$ (OK). $infx(z)=-1 \le infx(x)=1.1$ (OK). $supx(x)=1.8 \le supx(z)=2$ (OK).
    S is possible.

3.  SW ($x$ SW $z$): $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, $supx(x) \le infx(z)$.
    $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ holds.
    $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ must be possible.
    We know $infx(z) < infx(x)$. Also $infx(x) \le supx(x)$. So $infx(z) < infx(x) \le supx(x)$, which means $infx(z) < supx(x)$.
    This contradicts $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. Impossible.

4.  W ($x$ W $z$): $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. Impossible (from SW analysis).

5.  NW ($x$ NW $z$): $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. Impossible.

6.  N ($x$ N $z$): $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    $infy(y) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(z)$. Since $infy(y) < supy(y)$, we have $infy(y) \le infy(x)$ and $infy(y) < infy(z)$.
    Also, $supy(x) \le supy(y) \le infy(z)$. For non-degenerate regions, $infy(z) < supy(z)$.
    So, $supy(x) \le infy(z) < supy(z)$.
    And $infy(x) \le supy(x)$ (for non-degenerate x).
    So $infy(x) \le supy(x) \le infy(z) < supy(z)$. This implies $infy(x) < supy(z)$.
    Requires $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. Contradicts $infy(x) < supy(z)$. Impossible.

7.  NE ($x$ NE $z$): $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    Requires $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. Impossible (from N analysis).

8.  E ($x$ E $z$): $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Requires $infy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    We derived $infy(x) \le supy(y) \le infy(z)$. For $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ to hold, we need $infy(x) = infy(z) = supy(y) = infy(y)$. This would imply $infy(y) = supy(y)$, which is only possible for degenerate regions (lines or points), not regions homeomorphic to a closed disk. Impossible.

9.  SE ($x$ SE $z$): $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
    $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ holds.
    $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ must be possible.
    Consider MBB(y) = [0,1]x[0,1], MBB(z) = [0,1]x[2,3]. (y S z: 1<=2, 0<=0, 1<=1. OK).
    Consider MBB(x) = [2,3]x[0,1]. (x E y: 1<=2, 0<=0, 1<=1. OK).
    x vs z: MBB(x)=[2,3]x[0,1], MBB(z)=[0,1]x[2,3].
    $supy(x)=1 \le infy(z)=2$ (OK). $supx(z)=1 \le infx(x)=2$ (OK).
    SE is possible.

Based on the analysis, the only possible single-tile relations between region x and region z from the given set are S and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SE}$.
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: S, SW, SE
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box for a region r. Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they are 2D areas, which implies that for any region r in REG, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

We are given two relations:
1.  x E y
2.  y NE z

Let's write these relations using the provided definitions:
1.  x E y if and only if:
    (E1) supx(y) <= infx(x)
    (E2) infy(y) <= infy(x)
    (E3) supy(x) <= supy(y)

2.  y NE z if and only if:
    (NE1) supx(z) <= infx(y)
    (NE2) supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's combine the inequalities to find the constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z.

Combine (NE1) and (E1):
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

Since y is a 2D region (in REG), infx(y) < supx(y).
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x).
This implies supx(z) < infx(x).
This strict inequality tells us that the bounding box of z is strictly to the west of the bounding box of x.

Now combine the vertical inequalities.
From (NE2): supy(z) <= infy(y)
From (E2): infy(y) <= infy(x)
Combining these two, we get: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(z) <= infy(x).
This inequality tells us that the top of the bounding box of z is at or below the bottom of the bounding box of x. In other words, x is located vertically above or at the same level as the top of z.

From the given relations, we have derived two necessary conditions for the bounding boxes of x and z:
(D1) supx(z) < infx(x)
(D2) supy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's examine which of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are compatible with these two conditions.
The possible relations are {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

(D1) supx(z) < infx(x) means that the right edge of z's bounding box is strictly to the left of the left edge of x's bounding box.
This rules out any relation where x is to the west of z (W, NW, SW), where the bounding boxes overlap horizontally (B), or where z is to the east of x (which implies x is to the west of z).
It also rules out N, which requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). If supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) < infx(x), then supx(x) < infx(x), which is impossible for a 2D region. So N is ruled out.

Relations ruled out by (D1): {B, W, NW, SW, N}.
Remaining possible relations: {S, SE, E, NE}.

(D2) supy(z) <= infy(x) means that the top edge of z's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of x's bounding box.
This rules out any relation where x is to the south of z (S, SW, SE).
It also rules out B, which requires vertical containment, meaning supy(x) <= supy(z). supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) combined implies supy(x) <= infy(x), which is impossible for a 2D region. So B is ruled out.

Relations ruled out by (D2): {S, SW, SE, B}.
Remaining possible relations: {N, NW, W, E, NE}.

Combining the exclusions from (D1) and (D2):
Relations ruled out by (D1) or (D2): {B, W, NW, SW, N, S, SE}.
Possible relations remaining: {E, NE}.

Let's check if E is possible.
x E z if and only if:
(EZ1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(EZ2) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(EZ3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

(EZ1) is satisfied by our derived (D1) supx(z) < infx(x).
Let's consider (EZ3): supy(x) <= supy(z).
From the original relations, we have (E3) supy(x) <= supy(y) and (NE2) supy(z) <= infy(y).
If x E z holds, then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(y). So, supy(x) <= infy(y).
From (E2), we have infy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(x) <= infy(x).
Since x is a 2D region (in REG), infy(x) < supy(x).
The condition supy(x) <= infy(x) contradicts infy(x) < supy(x).
Therefore, x E z is not possible.

Let's check if NE is possible.
x NE z if and only if:
(NEz1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(NEz2) supy(z) <= infy(x)

Our derived conditions are (D1) supx(z) < infx(x) and (D2) supy(z) <= infy(x).
(D1) implies (NEz1) since supx(z) < infx(x) means supx(z) is indeed less than or equal to infx(x).
(D2) is exactly (NEz2).
Thus, the derived conditions are precisely the definition of x NE z.
We already provided an example in the thought process showing that regions x, y, z can exist satisfying the initial conditions and x NE z.

Since E is not possible and NE is possible, and all other relations have been ruled out by the derived conditions (D1) and (D2) or the contradiction shown for E, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: B, E
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Let the bounding box of a region $r$ be denoted by $B(r) = [\infx(r), \supx(r)] \times [\infy(r), \supy(r)]$.

The given conditions are:
1) $x$ S $y$:
   $\supy(x) \le \infy(y)$
   $\infx(y) \le \infx(x)$
   $\supx(x) \le \supx(y)$

2) $y$ N $z$: (Using the definition provided for 'a N b')
   $\supy(z) \le \infy(y)$
   $\infx(z) \le \infx(y)$
   $\supx(y) \le \supx(z)$

We want to find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$ from the given list {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}. These relations are defined based on the bounding boxes of $x$ and $z$.

Let's combine the inequalities for the x-coordinates:
From (1) $\infx(y) \le \infx(x)$
From (2) $\infx(z) \le \infx(y)$
Combining these, we get $\infx(z) \le \infx(y) \le \infx(x)$, which simplifies to $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$. (Eq 3.1)

From (1) $\supx(x) \le \supx(y)$
From (2) $\supx(y) \le \supx(z)$
Combining these, we get $\supx(x) \le \supx(y) \le \supx(z)$, which simplifies to $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$. (Eq 3.2)

Equations (3.1) and (3.2) show that the x-projection of region $x$ is contained within or equal to the x-projection of region $z$. That is, $[\infx(x), \supx(x)] \subseteq [\infx(z), \supx(z)]$.

Now let's consider the y-coordinates:
From (1) $\supy(x) \le \infy(y)$
From (2) $\supy(z) \le \infy(y)$

These inequalities tell us that the upper bounds of the y-projections of both $x$ and $z$ are less than or equal to the lower bound of the y-projection of $y$. This constrains $x$ and $z$ vertically relative to $y$, but does not directly constrain $x$ and $z$ relative to each other in the vertical dimension.

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, implying they are 2-dimensional shapes with area. Their bounding boxes must have non-zero width ($\supx > \infx$) and non-zero height ($\supy > \infy$).

Let's examine the conditions for each possible relation between $x$ and $z$ from the list, keeping in mind the derived horizontal containment $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$ and $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$:

- x W z: $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$.
  From $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$ and $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, we get $\supx(x) \le \infx(z) \le \infx(x)$. Since $\supx(x) \ge \infx(x)$ for any region, this implies $\supx(x) = \infx(x) = \infx(z)$. For regions in REG, $\supx > \infx$. Thus, this condition is impossible for non-degenerate regions. W is not possible.

- x E z: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$.
  From $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$ and $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, we get $\supx(x) \le \supx(z) \le \infx(x)$. Since $\supx(x) \ge \infx(x)$, this implies $\supx(x) = \infx(x) = \supx(z)$. This is impossible for non-degenerate regions. E is not possible.

- x SW z: $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$.
  $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$ is impossible for non-degenerate regions, as shown for W. SW is not possible.

- x NW z: $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
  $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$ is impossible for non-degenerate regions, as shown for W. NW is not possible.

- x SE z: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$.
  $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$ is impossible for non-degenerate regions, as shown for E. SE is not possible.

- x NE z: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
  $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$ is impossible for non-degenerate regions, as shown for E. NE is not possible.

Based on the horizontal containment derived from the definitions of S and N, relations W, E, SW, NW, SE, NE are impossible for regions homeomorphic to a disk.

The remaining possible relations are B, S, and N. Let's check if each of these is possible by constructing example regions.

- x B z: $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$, $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$.
  The first two horizontal conditions are already derived. We need to see if the vertical conditions $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$ and $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$ can hold.
  Let $y$ be the region with $B(y) = [0,1] \times [0,1]$. So $\infy(y)=0$.
  x S y: $\supy(x) \le 0$, $\infx(y) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(y)$.
     Let $B(x) = [0.1, 0.9] \times [-0.5, -0.1]$. $\supy(x)=-0.1 \le 0$ (T). $\infx(y)=0 \le \infx(x)=0.1$ (T). $\supx(x)=0.9 \le \supx(y)=1$ (T). x S y holds.
  y N z: $\supy(z) \le \infy(y)$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(y)$, $\supx(y) \le \supx(z)$.
     Let $B(z) = [-0.5, 1.5] \times [-1, -0.2]$. $\supy(z)=-0.2 \le 0$ (T). $\infx(z)=-0.5 \le \infx(y)=0$ (T). $\supx(y)=1 \le \supx(z)=1.5$ (T). y N z holds.
  Now compare $B(x) = [0.1, 0.9] \times [-0.5, -0.1]$ and $B(z) = [-0.5, 1.5] \times [-1, -0.2]$.
  $\infx(z)=-0.5 \le \infx(x)=0.1$ (T). $\supx(x)=0.9 \le \supx(z)=1.5$ (T).
  $\infy(z)=-1 \le \infy(x)=-0.5$ (T). $\supy(x)=-0.1 \le \supy(z)=-0.2$ (F).
  This example did not result in B. Let's try again.

  Let $y$ be the region with $B(y) = [0,1] \times [0,1]$. $\infy(y)=0$.
  x S y: $\supy(x) \le 0$, $\infx(y) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(y)$.
     Let $B(x) = [0.1, 0.9] \times [-0.5, -0.1]$. $\supy(x)=-0.1 \le 0$ (T). $\infx(x)=0.1$, $\supx(x)=0.9$. $0 \le 0.1$ (T), $0.9 \le 1$ (T). x S y holds.
  y N z: $\supy(z) \le \infy(y)$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(y)$, $\supx(y) \le \supx(z)$.
     Let $B(z) = [-0.5, 1.5] \times [-0.8, 0]$. $\supy(z)=0 \le 0$ (T). $\infx(z)=-0.5 \le 0$ (T). $\supx(y)=1 \le \supx(z)=1.5$ (T). y N z holds.
  Now compare $B(x) = [0.1, 0.9] \times [-0.5, -0.1]$ and $B(z) = [-0.5, 1.5] \times [-0.8, 0]$.
  $\infx(z)=-0.5 \le \infx(x)=0.1$ (T). $\supx(x)=0.9 \le \supx(z)=1.5$ (T).
  $\infy(z)=-0.8 \le \infy(x)=-0.5$ (T). $\supy(x)=-0.1 \le \supy(z)=0$ (T).
  All conditions for x B z hold. B is possible.

- x S z: $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$.
  The horizontal conditions are derived. We need $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$.
  Let $y$ be the region with $B(y) = [0,1] \times [0,1]$. $\infy(y)=0$.
  x S y: $\supy(x) \le 0$, $\infx(y) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(y)$.
     Let $B(x) = [0.1, 0.9] \times [-2, -1]$. $\supy(x)=-1 \le 0$ (T). $\infx(x)=0.1, \supx(x)=0.9$. $0 \le 0.1$ (T), $0.9 \le 1$ (T). x S y holds.
  y N z: $\supy(z) \le \infy(y)$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(y)$, $\supx(y) \le \supx(z)$.
     Let $B(z) = [-0.5, 1.5] \times [-0.5, -0.2]$. $\supy(z)=-0.2 \le 0$ (T). $\infx(z)=-0.5 \le 0$ (T). $\supx(y)=1 \le \supx(z)=1.5$ (T). y N z holds.
  Now compare $B(x) = [0.1, 0.9] \times [-2, -1]$ and $B(z) = [-0.5, 1.5] \times [-0.5, -0.2]$.
  $\infx(z)=-0.5 \le \infx(x)=0.1$ (T). $\supx(x)=0.9 \le \supx(z)=1.5$ (T).
  $\supy(x)=-1 \le \infy(z)=-0.5$ (T).
  All conditions for x S z hold. S is possible.

- x N z: $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$.
  The horizontal conditions are derived. We need $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
  Let $y$ be the region with $B(y) = [0,1] \times [5,6]$. $\infy(y)=5$.
  x S y: $\supy(x) \le 5$, $\infx(y) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(y)$.
     Let $B(x) = [0.1, 0.9] \times [0, 4]$. $\supy(x)=4 \le 5$ (T). $\infx(x)=0.1, \supx(x)=0.9$. $0 \le 0.1$ (T), $0.9 \le 1$ (T). x S y holds.
  y N z: $\supy(z) \le 5$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(y)$, $\supx(y) \le \supx(z)$.
     Let $B(z) = [-0.5, 1.5] \times [-10, -6]$. $\supy(z)=-6 \le 5$ (T). $\infx(z)=-0.5 \le 0$ (T). $\supx(y)=1 \le \supx(z)=1.5$ (T). y N z holds.
  Now compare $B(x) = [0.1, 0.9] \times [0, 4]$ and $B(z) = [-0.5, 1.5] \times [-10, -6]$.
  $\infx(z)=-0.5 \le \infx(x)=0.1$ (T). $\supx(x)=0.9 \le \supx(z)=1.5$ (T).
  $\supy(z)=-6 \le \infy(x)=0$ (T).
  All conditions for x N z hold. N is possible.

We have shown that B, S, and N are possible relations between x and z, and that the other relations (W, E, SW, NW, SE, NE) are impossible for non-degenerate regions according to the given definitions.

The possible relations are N, S, B.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, S, B}$.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: SW, W
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: E, SE
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by `bbox(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies that for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

We are given that region x is S of region y, and region y is S of region z.
According to the definition of the S relation:
1) x S y: `supy(x) <= infy(y)`, `infx(y) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(y)`.
2) y S z: `supy(y) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, and `supx(y) <= supx(z)`.

Let's deduce the relationship between the bounding boxes of x and z.

From the y-coordinates:
We have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (from 1)) and `supy(y) <= infy(z)` (from 2)).
Since y is a region in REG, `infy(y) < supy(y)`.
Combining these inequalities: `supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z)`.
This implies `supy(x) < infy(z)`.
This inequality means that the top edge of x's bounding box is strictly below the bottom edge of z's bounding box. This is the y-condition for relations S, SW, and SE, and contradicts the y-condition for N, NE, NW, W, E, and B.
Specifically:
- N, NW, NE require the region to be above or overlapping vertically, which contradicts `supy(x) < infy(z)`.
- W, E require vertical overlap, which contradicts `supy(x) < infy(z)`.
- B requires vertical containment (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`). If x B z, then `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. Combining with `supy(x) < infy(z)`, we get `supy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(x)`. This implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`. However, for a region in REG, `infy(x) < supy(x)`. This is a contradiction. Thus, x B z is impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z must have `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (in fact, we showed `supy(x) < infy(z)` holds). The remaining possibilities are S, SW, SE.

Now let's consider the x-coordinates:
From 1): `infx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(y)`.
From 2): `infx(z) <= infx(y)` and `supx(y) <= supx(z)`.

Combining these inequalities:
`infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)` => `infx(z) <= infx(x)`
`supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)` => `supx(x) <= supx(z)`

Also, since x is a region in REG, `infx(x) < supx(x)`.
Combining the x-inequalities: `infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`.

Now let's check the remaining possible relations (S, SW, SE) for x relative to z:

- x S z: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
We have shown that `supy(x) < infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(z)` always hold when x S y and y S z for regions in REG.
Thus, x S z is always a possible relation.

- x SW z: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
We know `supy(x) < infy(z)` holds.
We need to check if `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is possible.
From our derived chain of inequalities for x-coordinates: `infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x)`.
This implies `infx(z) < supx(x)`.
This contradicts the condition `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
Thus, x SW z is impossible for regions in REG.

- x SE z: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
We know `supy(x) < infy(z)` holds.
We need to check if `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is possible.
From our derived chain of inequalities for x-coordinates: `infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`.
This implies `infx(x) < supx(z)`.
This contradicts the condition `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
Thus, x SE z is impossible for regions in REG.

Based on the definitions and the properties of regions in REG (inf < sup), the only possible relation between region x and region z is S.

The final answer is $\boxed{S}$.
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: NW, W, SW
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: NE, E, SE
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: The given information is:
1.  x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2.  y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

The regions x, y, z belong to REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies their minimum bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's analyze the constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z.
From the x-axis constraints:
infx(z) <= infx(y) (from 2)
infx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1)
Combining these gives: infx(z) <= infx(x)

supx(x) <= supx(y) (from 1)
supx(y) <= supx(z) (from 2)
Combining these gives: supx(x) <= supx(z)

So, the x-projection of x, [infx(x), supx(x)], is contained within or equal to the x-projection of z, [infx(z), supx(z)].

From the y-axis constraints:
supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 1)
infy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2)
supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 2)

From supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) < supy(y) (non-degenerate box for y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we get supy(x) < supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now let's consider the possible single-tile relations between x and z based on their definitions:

1.  x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). These match the x-conditions for S.
    The y-condition is supy(x) <= infy(z). From the given relations, supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
    It is possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) to hold. For example, let infy(y) = 5. supy(x) can be 3 (3 <= 5) and infy(z) can be 4 (4 <= 5). Then supy(x) < infy(z). This case makes S impossible.
    However, it is also possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) to hold. For example, let infy(y) = 5. supy(x) can be 3 (3 <= 5) and infy(z) can be 3 (3 <= 5). Then supy(x) = infy(z). Or supy(x)=2, infy(z)=3 is not S. supy(x)=3, infy(z)=3 is S. supy(x)=3, infy(z)=2 is not S.
    Let's pick values that satisfy supy(x) <= infy(z): Let infy(y)=10. Choose supy(x)=5 and infy(z)=6. (5 <= 10 and 6 <= 10). Here supy(x) < infy(z), so S holds. Thus, S is a possible relation.

2.  x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). These match the x-conditions for B.
    We derived supy(x) <= supy(z). This matches one y-condition for B.
    The remaining y-condition is infy(z) <= infy(x). From the given relations, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
    It is possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) to hold. For example, let infy(y) = 10. Choose infy(x) = 8 (since infy(x) <= supy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y), infy(x) must be <= 10) and infy(z) = 7 (7 <= 10). Then infy(z) < infy(x). This is possible.
    Since all conditions for B are possible to satisfy simultaneously with the given relations, B is a possible relation.

3.  x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    The y-condition is supy(z) <= infy(x). From the given relations, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z). This implies infy(x) < supy(z). Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible. N is not possible.

4.  x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). With non-degenerate boxes, infx(x) < supx(x) and infx(z) < supx(z). The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) combined with infx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x). Thus, W is not possible.

5.  x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) combined with infx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z). This requires infx(x) = supx(z). Also infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). If infx(x) = supx(z), then infx(z) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z). With non-degenerate boxes, supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), contradicting supx(x) <= supx(z). Thus, E is not possible.

6.  x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible as shown for W. Thus, SW is not possible.

7.  x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Neither condition is possible as shown for W and N respectively. Thus, NW is not possible.

8.  x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible as shown for E. Thus, SE is not possible.

9.  x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Neither condition is possible as shown for E and N respectively. Thus, NE is not possible.

Based on the analysis of the bounding boxes, the only possible relations between region x and region z from the given list are S and B.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, B}$.
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: N, NW
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: N, NE, E, NW, W, B
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Let $MBB(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$ denote the minimum bounding box of a region $a$.

Given:
1. x NW y: $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
2. y S z: $supy(y) \le infy(z)$, $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on their bounding boxes. Let's analyze the horizontal and vertical relationships between x and z.

Horizontal relationship between x and z:
From x NW y, we have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
From y S z, we have $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.

Consider the relative position of $infx(y)$ on the x-axis. It is greater than or equal to $supx(x)$ and greater than or equal to $infx(z)$.
Consider the relative position of $supx(y)$ on the x-axis. It is less than or equal to $supx(z)$.
From $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(y) < supx(y)$, we have $supx(x) < supx(y)$.
Since $supx(y) \le supx(z)$, we have $supx(x) < supx(z)$. This means the right boundary of $MBB(x)$ is always strictly to the left of the right boundary of $MBB(z)$.

Let's check if x can be to the East of z (E, NE, SE relations). This requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$.
From $supx(y) \le supx(z)$ and the assumption $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, we get $supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
From x NW y, we have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
We have $supx(y) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
Also, for any non-point region, $infx < supx$. So $infx(x) < supx(x)$ and $infx(y) < supx(y)$.
Combining inequalities: $infx(y) < supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
And $infx(x) < supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
So $infx(y) < infx(x)$ and $infx(x) < infx(y)$. This is a contradiction.
Therefore, the assumption $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ is false.
x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z.

The remaining horizontal possibilities for x relative to z are West ($supx(x) \le infx(z)$) or overlap ($infx(z) < supx(x)$ and $infx(x) < supx(z)$).
We showed $supx(x) < supx(z)$ and $infx(x) < supx(z)$ (from $infx(x) < supx(x)$ and $supx(x) < supx(z)$). So overlap requires $infx(z) < supx(x)$.

Vertical relationship between x and z:
From x NW y, we have $supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
From y S z, we have $supy(y) \le infy(z)$.
Both $infy(x)$ and $infy(z)$ are greater than or equal to $supy(y)$.

Let's consider the three basic vertical relations between x and z:
A) x is South of z: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. This is possible. Example construction in thought process.
B) x is North of z: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. This is possible. Example construction in thought process.
C) x and z overlap vertically: $infy(z) < supy(x)$ and $infy(x) < supy(z)$.
   Can this happen? We know $supy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(z) < supy(z)$.
   Example construction in thought process showed this is possible.
   If A and B both held, $supy(x) \le infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$, a contradiction.
   If A and C both held, $supy(x) \le infy(z) < supy(x)$, a contradiction.
   If B and C both held, $supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(z)$, a contradiction.
So exactly one of the vertical scenarios (South, North, or vertical overlap) must hold.

Combining horizontal and vertical possibilities:
Case 1: x is horizontally West of z ($supx(x) \le infx(z)$).
   - If x is vertically South of z ($supy(x) \le infy(z)$), then x SW z. This is possible.
   - If x is vertically North of z ($supy(z) \le infy(x)$), then x NW z. This is possible.
   - If x and z overlap vertically ($infy(z) < supy(x)$ and $infy(x) < supy(z)$) AND $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ AND $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ (vertical containment for W definition), then x W z. This is possible.

Case 2: x and z overlap horizontally ($infx(z) < supx(x)$ and $infx(x) < supx(z)$).
   - If x is vertically South of z ($supy(x) \le infy(z)$) AND $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (horizontal containment for S definition), then x S z. This is possible.
   - If x is vertically North of z ($supy(z) \le infy(x)$) AND $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (horizontal containment for N definition), then x N z. This is possible.
   - If x and z overlap vertically ($infy(z) < supy(x)$ and $infy(x) < supy(z)$) AND $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ AND $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ (vertical containment for B definition) AND $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (horizontal containment for B definition), then x B z. This is possible.

Case 3: x is horizontally East of z ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$). This is impossible.

The possible relations between x and z are those from Case 1 and Case 2 where we showed possibility: SW, NW, W, S, N, B.
The impossible relations are E, NE, SE.

The possible relations are S, SW, W, NW, N, B.
Listing them in the requested format from the example output: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.
The possible ones are N, S, NW, W, SW, B.

N, S, NW, W, SW, B

The final answer is $\boxed{N, S, NW, W, SW, B}$.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: The given relations are:
1. x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) AND supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) AND supy(y) <= infy(z)

Regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies that for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

From condition 1 (x NW y):
supx(x) <= infx(y)  (x is to the west of y or touching)
infy(x) >= supy(y)  (x is to the north of y or touching)

From condition 2 (y SW z):
supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the west of z or touching)
supy(y) <= infy(z)  (y is to the south of z or touching)

Let's combine the inequalities in the x-dimension to relate x and z:
supx(x) <= infx(y)
infx(y) < supx(y) (because y is in REG)
supx(y) <= infx(z)

Combining these, we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z)
This chain of inequalities implies supx(x) < infx(z).
So, the right edge of the bounding box of x is strictly to the left of the left edge of the bounding box of z.

Now let's examine the possible single-tile relations between x and z based on their bounding boxes, keeping in mind that supx(x) < infx(z).

The single-tile cardinal relations are defined as follows (a R b):
- B: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- S: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- SW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
- W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- NW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- N: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- NE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- SE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)

We have derived supx(x) < infx(z). Let's see which relations x R z are consistent with this:
- B: requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Since infx(x) <= supx(x) < infx(z) <= supx(z), we have infx(x) < infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). B is not possible.
- S: requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). As shown for B, infx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. S is not possible.
- SW: requires supx(x) <= infx(z). This is consistent with supx(x) < infx(z). SW is possible if the y-conditions can be met (supy(x) <= infy(z)).
- W: requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The first part is consistent with supx(x) < infx(z). W is possible if the y-conditions can be met.
- NW: requires supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). The first part is consistent with supx(x) < infx(z). NW is possible if the y-conditions can be met (supy(z) <= infy(x)).
- N: requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). As shown for B, infx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. N is not possible.
- NE: requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) <= supx(x) < infx(z) <= supx(z), we have supx(z) > infx(z) > supx(x) >= infx(x), so supx(z) > infx(x). NE is not possible.
- E: requires supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown for NE, E is not possible.
- SE: requires supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown for NE, SE is not possible.

So, the only possible relations are SW, W, and NW. We need to check if the y-conditions for each of these are compatible with the given information.

From the y-conditions:
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(z) >= supy(y)

These tell us that both infy(x) and infy(z) are greater than or equal to supy(y). This leaves flexibility in the relative positions of the y-intervals [infy(x), supy(x)] and [infy(z), supy(z)].

- NW (x NW z): requires supy(z) <= infy(x). We have infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). It is possible to choose bounding boxes such that supy(z) <= infy(x). For example, let supy(y)=5, infy(x)=10, supy(x)=12, infy(z)=6, supy(z)=8. Here 10 >= 5, 5 <= 6, and 8 <= 10. NW is possible.
- W (x W z): requires infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). We have infy(x) >= supy(y) and infy(z) >= supy(y). It is possible to choose bounding boxes such that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). For example, let supy(y)=5, infy(x)=10, supy(x)=12, infy(z)=8, supy(z)=15. Here 10 >= 5, 8 >= 5, 8 <= 10, and 12 <= 15. W is possible.
- SW (x SW z): requires supy(x) <= infy(z). We have infy(x) >= supy(y) and infy(z) >= supy(y). It is possible to choose bounding boxes such that supy(x) <= infy(z). For example, let supy(y)=5, infy(x)=10, supy(x)=12, infy(z)=15, supy(z)=18. Here 10 >= 5, 15 >= 5, and 12 <= 15. SW is possible.

Since W, NW, and SW are all possible depending on the specific y-coordinates of the bounding boxes, and all other relations are impossible due to the strict x-dimension constraint (supx(x) < infx(z)), the possible relations are W, NW, SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, NW, SW}$.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region r.
The given relations are defined as follows:
a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

We are given:
1) x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2) y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's analyze the consequences for the relationship between x and z.
From (1) and (2):
supx(x) <= infx(y)
supx(z) <= infx(y)
These inequalities tell us that the maximum x-coordinate of x and the maximum x-coordinate of z are both less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of y. Both bounding boxes of x and z are located to the west of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of y.

From (1) and (2):
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(z) >= supy(y)
These inequalities tell us that the minimum y-coordinate of x and the minimum y-coordinate of z are both greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of y. Both bounding boxes of x and and z are located to the north of or aligned with the top edge of the bounding box of y.

Combining these, the bounding boxes of both x and z are located in the region { (u, v) | u <= infx(y) and v >= supy(y) }, which is the North-West region relative to the point (infx(y), supy(y)).

Let's test if each of the 9 possible relations between x and z can occur given the constraints. We need to find example bounding boxes for x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions and the tested relation. Regions homeomorphic to a disk exist for any simple rectangular bounding box, and the definitions of the relations are based only on bounding boxes.

Let the bounding box of y be [0, 1] x [0, 1]. So infx(y)=0, supx(y)=1, infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
The conditions become:
supx(x) <= 0 and infy(x) >= 1
supx(z) <= 0 and infy(z) >= 1

Let's check each possible relation x R z:

1.  x B z (Bounding box of x is contained in bounding box of z): infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
    Example: x=[-0.5, -0.1]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-0.6, 0]x[1, 1.6]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-0.1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1 (T).
    x B z: infx(z)=-0.6 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), supx(x)=-0.1 <= supx(z)=0 (T), infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T), supy(x)=1.5 <= supy(z)=1.6 (T). Possible.

2.  x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z). (x is below z, and x is horizontally contained in z)
    Example: x=[-0.5, -0.1]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-0.6, 0]x[1.6, 2]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-0.1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T).
    x S z: supy(x)=1.5 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T), infx(z)=-0.6 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), supx(x)=-0.1 <= supx(z)=0 (T). Possible.

3.  x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). (x is to the west and south of z)
    Example: x=[-2, -1]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-0.5, 0]x[1.6, 2]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T).
    x SW z: supx(x)=-1 <= infx(z)=-0.5 (T), supy(x)=1.5 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T). Possible.

4.  x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z). (x is to the west of z, and x is vertically contained in z)
    Example: x=[-2, -1]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-0.5, 0]x[1, 1.6]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1 (T).
    x W z: supx(x)=-1 <= infx(z)=-0.5 (T), infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T), supy(x)=1.5 <= supy(z)=1.6 (T). Possible.

5.  x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). (x is to the west and north of z)
    Example: x=[-2, -1]x[1.6, 2], z=[-0.5, 0]x[1.1, 1.5]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.1 (T).
    x NW z: supx(x)=-1 <= infx(z)=-0.5 (T), supy(z)=1.5 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T). Possible.

6.  x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z). (x is above z, and x is horizontally contained in z)
    Example: x=[-0.5, -0.1]x[1.6, 2], z=[-0.6, 0]x[1.1, 1.5]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-0.1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.1 (T).
    x N z: supy(z)=1.5 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T), infx(z)=-0.6 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), supx(x)=-0.1 <= supx(z)=0 (T). Possible.

7.  x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). (x is to the east and north of z)
    Example: x=[-0.5, 0]x[1.6, 2], z=[-2, -1]x[1.1, 1.5]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=0 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=-1 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.1 (T).
    x NE z: supx(z)=-1 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), supy(z)=1.5 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T). Possible.

8.  x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z). (x is to the east of z, and x is vertically contained in z)
    Example: x=[-0.5, 0]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-2, -1]x[1, 1.6]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=0 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=-1 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1 (T).
    x E z: supx(z)=-1 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T), supy(x)=1.5 <= supy(z)=1.6 (T). Possible.

9.  x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). (x is to the east and south of z)
    Example: x=[-0.5, 0]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-2, -1]x[1.6, 2]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=0 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=-1 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T).
    x SE z: supx(z)=-1 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), supy(x)=1.5 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T). Possible.

All 9 relations are possible.

N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: The problem asks for the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y (x NW y) and region y is NE of region z (y NE z) for some region y in REG. The relations are defined based on the infimum and supremum of the projections of the regions on the x and y axes. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, implying they are "fat" (not line segments or points), so for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's write down the definitions of the given relations in terms of bounding box coordinates:
x NW y means:
1) supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the West of or touching y horizontally)
2) supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the North of or touching y vertically)

y NE z means:
3) supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the East of or touching z horizontally)
4) supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the North of or touching z vertically)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the vertical and horizontal relationships separately.

Vertical relationship between x and z:
From (2), supy(y) <= infy(x).
From (4), supy(z) <= infy(y).
Also, for any region in REG, the infimum of the y-projection is less than or equal to the supremum: infy(y) <= supy(y).
Combining these inequalities: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
This directly gives us supy(z) <= infy(x). This is the condition for x being North of z (or touching).
Let's check other vertical relations.
Can x be South of z? (x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z)). For any region x, infy(x) < supy(x) (since x is in REG). For any region z, infy(z) <= supy(z). We have supy(z) <= infy(x). Thus infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). So infy(z) < supy(x) (strictly). This means supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible. Thus, x cannot be S of z. This rules out S, SW, SE.

Let's check the vertical parts of other relations.
N: supy(z) <= infy(x). This is always true, as shown above.
E and W require infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) OR infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x) (depending on which region's bounding box contains the other vertically, or if they overlap vertically in a specific way for E/W).
B requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) OR infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x).

Let's check the infy relation:
From (4), supy(z) <= infy(y). This implies infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y). So infy(z) <= infy(y).
From (2), supy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we don't get a direct relation between infy(z) and infy(x) based on these alone.
However, we derived supy(z) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). We also know infy(z) <= supy(z). So infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This chain shows infy(z) <= infy(x) is always true. (Bottom of x is above or at the same level as bottom of z).

Let's check the supy relation:
From supy(z) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), we get supy(z) <= supy(x).
Can supy(x) <= supy(z) be true? Only if supy(x) = supy(z). This requires supy(z) = supy(y) = infy(x) = supy(x). Since regions are in REG, infy(x) < supy(x). Thus infy(x) = supy(x) is impossible. Therefore, supy(x) cannot be equal to supy(z), and since supy(z) <= supy(x), we must have supy(x) > supy(z). (Top of x is strictly above top of z).

Vertical constraints summarized:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x N z vertically - always true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (bottom of x is above or level with bottom of z - always true)
- supy(x) > supy(z) (top of x is strictly above top of z - always true for regions in REG)

Now let's check which relations are possible given these vertical constraints:
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x) (OK), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). This requires vertical N and horizontal containment (z's bounding box horizontally inside x's bounding box). The horizontal part is possible (as shown below). So N is possible.
- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x) (Horizontal E or overlap left part), supy(z) <= infy(x) (OK). Possible.
- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z) (Horizontal W or overlap right part), supy(z) <= infy(x) (OK). Possible.
- S, SW, SE: Require supy(x) <= infy(z). Not possible (supy(x) > supy(z) >= infy(z)).
- E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) (OK), supy(x) <= supy(z). Not possible (supy(x) > supy(z)).
- W: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) (OK), supy(x) <= supy(z). Not possible (supy(x) > supy(z)).
- B: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) (OK), supy(x) <= supy(z). Not possible (supy(x) > supy(z)).

Horizontal relationship between x and z:
From (1), supx(x) <= infx(y).
From (3), supx(z) <= infx(y).
Let infx(y) = C. Then supx(x) <= C and supx(z) <= C.
This implies that both x and z are located to the West of or aligned with the vertical line x=C. This allows for x to be to the West of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), or to the East of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), or for their bounding boxes to overlap horizontally (infx(z) < supx(x) and infx(x) < supx(z)). All these horizontal scenarios are possible depending on the choice of x, z, and y bounding boxes consistent with supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y).

Combining the vertical constraints (always resulting in vertical N) with the possible horizontal relationships:
- If x is horizontally West of or aligned with the East of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), and x is vertically North of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), the relation is NW.
- If x is horizontally East of or aligned with the West of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), and x is vertically North of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), the relation is NE.
- If x and z overlap horizontally such that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and x is vertically North of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), the relation is N.

Since horizontal W, E, and overlap (specifically horizontal z B x for N) are all possible given the horizontal constraints, and the vertical relation is always N, the possible combined relations are NW, NE, and N.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, NW}$.
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: B, N, NW, W
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: N NE SE S E NW W SW B
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: SW, W
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: The given relations are:
1.  `x SW y`
2.  `y E z`

The definitions based on bounding boxes are:
-   `infx(a)`: greatest lower bound of a on x-axis
-   `supx(a)`: least upper bound of a on x-axis
-   `infy(a)`: greatest lower bound of a on y-axis
-   `supy(a)`: least upper bound of a on y-axis

-   `a SW b` if `supx(a) <= infx(b)` and `supy(a) <= infy(b)`.
-   `a E b` if `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)` and `supy(a) <= supy(b)`.

Applying these to the given relations:
From `x SW y`:
(1) `supx(x) <= infx(y)`
(2) `supy(x) <= infy(y)`

From `y E z`:
(3) `supx(z) <= infx(y)`
(4) `infy(z) <= infy(y)`
(5) `supy(y) <= supy(z)`

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`. Thus, `infy(y) < supy(y)`.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the possible relative positions of their bounding boxes based on the combined constraints.

Consider the y-coordinates:
From (2), `supy(x) <= infy(y)`. This means region x is entirely below or aligned with the bottom edge of region y.
From (4), `infy(z) <= infy(y)`. This means the bottom edge of region z is below or aligned with the bottom edge of region y.
From (5), `supy(y) <= supy(z)`. This means region y is entirely below or aligned with the top edge of region z.

Let's consider the vertical relationship between x and z.
Case 1: x is North of z (`supy(z) <= infy(x)`).
If this holds, combining with (5) gives `supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This implies `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
From (2), we have `supy(x) <= infy(y)`.
So, we must simultaneously satisfy `supy(x) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
Since `infy(y) < supy(y)` for a region in REG, these two conditions imply `supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
This sequence requires `supy(x) < infy(x)`.
However, for any valid region in REG, `infy(x) < supy(x)`.
The condition `supy(x) < infy(x)` contradicts `infy(x) < supy(x)`.
Therefore, the relation `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is impossible under the given constraints. This rules out N, NW, and NE relations between x and z.

Case 2: x is South of z (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`).
Can we satisfy this? From (2), `supy(x) <= infy(y)`. From (4), `infy(z) <= infy(y)`. From (5), `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
We need `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
Let's check for compatibility with the initial constraints. We need to find `infy(x), supy(x), infy(y), supy(y), infy(z), supy(z)` values such that:
`infy(x) < supy(x)`, `infy(y) < supy(y)`, `infy(z) < supy(z)` (REG property)
`supy(x) <= infy(y)` (2)
`infy(z) <= infy(y)` (4)
`supy(y) <= supy(z)` (5)
`supy(x) <= infy(z)` (x S z condition)
Let `infy(y) = 10`, `supy(y) = 12`.
From (2), `supy(x) <= 10`. Let `supy(x) = 8`. (Requires `infy(x) <= 8`, let `infy(x) = 7`).
From (4), `infy(z) <= 10`. Let `infy(z) = 9`.
From (5), `12 <= supy(z)`. Let `supy(z) = 15`. (Requires `infy(z) <= 15`, 9 <= 15).
Check `supy(x) <= infy(z)`: `8 <= 9`. Yes.
All conditions are satisfied for this example. So, x S z is possible.

Case 3: x and z overlap or align vertically, not strictly North or South.
The definition of B, W, E, S, N relations include conditions on vertical or horizontal containment/alignment.
For B, W, E relations, the y-condition is `infy(b) <= infy(a)` and `supy(a) <= supy(b)`. (a contains b vertically). For x R z, this is `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
Let's check if this is compatible with the initial constraints.
From (2), `supy(x) <= infy(y)`.
From (4), `infy(z) <= infy(y)`.
From (5), `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
We need `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
Let `infy(y) = 10`, `supy(y) = 12`.
From (2), `supy(x) <= 10`. Let `supy(x) = 8`. (Requires `infy(x) <= 8`). Let `infy(x) = 6`.
From (4), `infy(z) <= 10`. Let `infy(z) = 5`.
From (5), `12 <= supy(z)`. Let `supy(z) = 15`.
Check `infy(z) <= infy(x)`: `5 <= 6`. Yes.
Check `supy(x) <= supy(z)`: `8 <= 15`. Yes.
All conditions are satisfied for this example. So, vertical containment (z contains x) is possible.

So, the possible vertical relationships between x and z are:
-   x is South of z (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`)
-   z contains x vertically (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)`)

Now consider the x-coordinates:
From (1), `supx(x) <= infx(y)`.
From (3), `supx(z) <= infx(y)`.
Let `infx(y) = 10`. `supx(x) <= 10` and `supx(z) <= 10`.
Both region x and region z are entirely to the west of or aligned with the left edge of region y.
This places no restriction on the horizontal relationship between x and z themselves. Any horizontal relationship between x and z is possible as long as both are west of `infx(y)`.
-   x is West of z (`supx(x) <= infx(z)`). Possible. Example: `infx(y)=10`. `supx(x)=5`, `infx(z)=7`. (5 <= 7, 7 <= 10).
-   x is East of z (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`). Possible. Example: `infx(y)=10`. `supx(z)=5`, `infx(x)=7`. (5 <= 7, 7 <= 10).
-   x and z overlap or contain each other horizontally (`infx(z) <= supx(x)` AND `infx(x) <= supx(z)`). Possible. Example: `infx(y)=10`. `infx(z)=4, supx(z)=9, infx(x)=5, supx(x)=8`. (8 <= 10, 9 <= 10, 4 <= 8, 5 <= 9).

Now we combine the possible vertical relationships with the possible horizontal relationships using the definitions of the 9 tiles:

Combining "x is South of z" (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`) with horizontal possibilities:
-   `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (x W z): `supy(x) <= infy(z)` AND `supx(x) <= infx(z)` -> SW. Possible.
-   `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (x E z): `supy(x) <= infy(z)` AND `supx(z) <= infx(x)` -> SE. Possible.
-   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (z contains x horizontally): `supy(x) <= infy(z)` AND `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)` -> S. Possible.

Combining "z contains x vertically" (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)`) with horizontal possibilities:
-   `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (x W z): `infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)` AND `supx(x) <= infx(z)` -> W. Possible.
-   `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (x E z): `infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)` AND `supx(z) <= infx(x)` -> E. Possible.
-   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (z contains x horizontally): `infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)` AND `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)` -> B. Possible.

The relations N, NW, and NE require the vertical relationship `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, which we found to be impossible given the initial constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are B, S, SW, W, E, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{B, S, SW, W, E, SE}$.
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by its infimum and supremum on the x and y axes, denoted as `[infx(a), supx(a)]` and `[infy(a), supy(a)]`.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies that for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

We are given the relations:
1. Region x is SW of region y:
   supx(x) <= infx(y)
   supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. Region y is S of region z:
   supy(y) <= infy(z)
   infx(z) <= infx(y)
   supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z based on these conditions. Let's combine the given inequalities:

From supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), and knowing that infy(y) <= supy(y) for any region y, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
This implies supy(x) <= infy(z).

Now let's check which cardinal direction relations R(x, z) are possible given the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) and the property that regions in REG have `inf < sup`.

The cardinal direction relations are defined as follows (R(a, b)):
B: infx(b) <= infx(a) & supx(a) <= supx(b) & infy(b) <= infy(a) & supy(a) <= supy(b) (Overlap in both axes)
S: supy(a) <= infy(b) & infx(b) <= infx(a) & supx(a) <= supx(b) (a is below b, with horizontal overlap)
SW: supx(a) <= infx(b) & supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is to the south-west of b)
W: supx(a) <= infx(b) & infy(b) <= infy(a) & supy(a) <= supy(b) (a is to the west of b, with vertical overlap)
NW: supx(a) <= infx(b) & supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the north-west of b)
N: supy(b) <= infy(a) & infx(b) <= infx(a) & supx(a) <= supx(b) (a is above b, with horizontal overlap)
NE: supx(b) <= infx(a) & supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the north-east of b)
E: supx(b) <= infx(a) & infy(b) <= infy(a) & supy(a) <= supy(b) (a is to the east of b, with vertical overlap)
SE: supx(b) <= infx(a) & supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is to the south-east of b)

The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) means the upper bound of x's y-projection is less than or equal to the lower bound of z's y-projection.
This excludes relations where x is above z or vertically overlaps with z's bounding box in a way that requires infy(x) <= supy(z).
Specifically, it excludes:
- B: Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) for a region in REG. Impossible.
- W: Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Same as B. Impossible.
- E: Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Same as B. Impossible.
- NW: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), which implies supy(x) < supy(x), a contradiction. Impossible.
- N: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x). Same as NW. Impossible.
- NE: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x). Same as NW. Impossible.

So, the only possible relations for R(x, z) are S, SW, and SE, as these are the relations whose definitions include or are consistent with supy(x) <= infy(z). Let's check each of these:

For S(x, z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) is always true.
From the given conditions, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). Since infx(y) <= supx(y), we get supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). This means supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
So, S(x, z) is possible if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
We have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y). Since infx(x) < supx(x), we have infx(x) < infx(y). Both infx(z) and infx(x) are less than infx(y). It is possible for infx(z) to be less than or equal to infx(x). Example: infx(z)=-3, infx(x)=-2, infx(y)=-1. This satisfies infx(z)<infx(x)<infx(y). Thus, S is a possible relation.

For SW(x, z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) AND supx(x) <= infx(z).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) is always true.
So, SW(x, z) is possible if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible.
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). Both supx(x) and infx(z) are less than or equal to infx(y). It is possible for supx(x) to be less than or equal to infx(z). Example: supx(x)=-1, infx(z)=-0.5, infx(y)=0. This satisfies supx(x) < infx(z) <= infx(y). Thus, SW is a possible relation.

For SE(x, z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) AND supx(z) <= infx(x).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) is always true.
So, SE(x, z) is possible if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
We know from the S case analysis that supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true for regions in REG under these conditions.
If supx(z) <= infx(x) is true, then we have supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
However, for any region x in REG, infx(x) < supx(x).
So, supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x).
This leads to supx(x) < supx(x), which is a contradiction.
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG. Thus, SE is not a possible relation.

Based on the analysis, the only possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S and SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW}$.
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: W, NW, SW
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Let MBR(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, their minimum bounding boxes have non-zero width and height, meaning infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

The given conditions are:
1) x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2) y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From condition 1, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
Since y is in REG, infy(y) < supy(y).
So, supy(x) < supy(y).

From condition 2, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

Combining these inequalities:
supy(x) < supy(y) <= infy(z)

This implies supy(x) < infy(z).
This strict inequality means that the minimum bounding box of region x is strictly below the minimum bounding box of region z on the y-axis.

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z and see which ones are consistent with supy(x) < infy(z). Let x R z be a relation. The definitions for R involve conditions on infx(x), supx(x), infy(x), supy(x) and infx(z), supx(z), infy(z), supy(z).

The y-axis conditions for each relation x R z are:
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z) (consistent with supy(x) < infy(z))
- SW: supy(x) <= infy(z) (consistent with supy(x) < infy(z))
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- SE: supy(x) <= infy(z) (consistent with supy(x) < infy(z))

The relations S, SW, and SE are directly consistent with supy(x) < infy(z), as their definition includes supy(x) <= infy(z). Let's verify if examples exist for these:

- x S z: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) in addition to supy(x) <= infy(z).
Example: MBR(x) = [0,1]x[0,1], MBR(y) = [2,3]x[2,3], MBR(z) = [0,1]x[4,5].
x SW y: supx(x)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=2 (ok).
y SE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok), supy(y)=3 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
x S z: supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=4 (ok), infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=0 (ok), supx(x)=1 <= supx(z)=1 (ok).
So, S is a possible relation.

- x SW z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) in addition to supy(x) <= infy(z).
Example: MBR(x) = [0,1]x[0,1], MBR(y) = [3,4]x[2,3], MBR(z) = [2,2.5]x[4,5].
x SW y: supx(x)=1 <= infx(y)=3 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=2 (ok).
y SE z: supx(z)=2.5 <= infx(y)=3 (ok), supy(y)=3 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
x SW z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
So, SW is a possible relation.

- x SE z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) in addition to supy(x) <= infy(z).
Example: MBR(x) = [2,3]x[0,1], MBR(y) = [4,5]x[2,3], MBR(z) = [0,1]x[4,5].
x SW y: supx(x)=3 <= infx(y)=4 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=2 (ok).
y SE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=4 (ok), supy(y)=3 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
x SE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
So, SE is a possible relation.

Now let's consider the other relations.

- B, W, E require infy(z) <= infy(x).
We have supy(x) < infy(z). If infy(z) <= infy(x) also holds, then supy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible for the MBRs of x and z.
However, we also have the constraints imposed by the existence of region y:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
For B, W, or E to hold, we need infy(z) <= infy(x). Combining with supy(y) <= infy(z), we need supy(y) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
Also, from x SW y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
So we need supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Example: MBR(x)=[0,1]x[2,3] (iy=2, sy=3), MBR(z)=[2,3]x[1,2] (iy=1, sy=2). infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=2 (ok).
Need y such that x SW y (sx(x)=1 <= ix(y), sy(x)=3 <= iy(y)) and y SE z (sx(z)=3 <= ix(y), sy(y) <= iy(z)=1).
Need ix(y) >= 1, iy(y) >= 3, ix(y) >= 3, sy(y) <= 1.
Combining: ix(y) >= 3, iy(y) >= 3, sy(y) <= 1.
Since for any region in REG, infy(y) < supy(y), the condition iy(y) >= 3 and sy(y) <= 1 is impossible.
Therefore, B, W, and E are not possible.

- N, NW, NE require supy(z) <= infy(x).
We have supy(x) < infy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x) also holds, then supy(x) < infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible for the MBRs of x and z.
However, we also have the constraints from y: supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) > infy(y), and supy(x) <= infy(y).
For N, NW, or NE to hold, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
Example: MBR(x)=[0,1]x[5,6] (iy=5, sy=6), MBR(z)=[2,3]x[0,1] (iy=0, sy=1). supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=5 (ok).
Need y such that x SW y (sx(x)=1 <= ix(y), sy(x)=6 <= iy(y)) and y SE z (sx(z)=3 <= ix(y), sy(y) <= iy(z)=0).
Need ix(y) >= 1, iy(y) >= 6, ix(y) >= 3, sy(y) <= 0.
Combining: ix(y) >= 3, iy(y) >= 6, sy(y) <= 0.
Since for any region in REG, infy(y) < supy(y), the condition iy(y) >= 6 and sy(y) <= 0 is impossible.
Therefore, N, NW, and NE are not possible.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relations between region x and region z are S, SW, and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW, SE}$.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: The given information defines the single-tile cardinal direction relations based on the minimum bounding boxes (MBB) of regions. Let MBB(a) be represented by the interval [infx(a), supx(a)] along the x-axis and [infy(a), supy(a)] along the y-axis.

The given relations are:
1.  `x SW y`: supx(x) <= infx(y) AND supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  `y NE z`: supx(z) <= infx(y) AND supy(z) <= infy(y)

We are looking for the possible relations between region x and region z (x R z). A relation R is possible if there exist regions x, y, and z from REG satisfying the conditions x SW y and y NE z, and the definition of x R z.

From the given conditions:
(1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(2) supy(x) <= infy(y)
(3) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(4) supy(z) <= infy(y)

These inequalities imply that the MBBs of x and z must lie entirely to the "South-West" of the point (infx(y), infy(y)). Specifically, the maximum x-coordinates of x and z must be less than or equal to infx(y), and the maximum y-coordinates of x and z must be less than or equal to infy(y).

Let's check if each of the 9 possible relations between x and z can be satisfied. To do this, we need to find example MBBs for x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions (1-4) and the conditions for the target relation x R z. If we can find such an example, the relation R is possible. Since regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk exist for any valid rectangular MBB (e.g., filled rectangles), we can use MBB coordinates to construct examples.

Let's set infx(y) and infy(y) to sufficiently large values to accommodate the other MBBs. Let infx(y) = 5 and infy(y) = 5.
Then the conditions (1-4) become:
supx(x) <= 5
supy(x) <= 5
supx(z) <= 5
supy(z) <= 5
Also, we need infx(y) <= supx(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y). Let y be a filled rectangle [5, 6] x [5, 6]. This MBB satisfies infx(y)=5, supx(y)=6, infy(y)=5, supy(y)=6. This choice is valid.

Now, we need to find MBBs for x and z such that supx(x)<=5, supy(x)<=5, supx(z)<=5, supy(z)<=5, and the target relation x R z holds.

1.  **x B z**: MBB(z) contains MBB(x).
    Conditions: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [2,3]x[2,3], MBB(z) = [1,4]x[1,4].
    supx(x)=3<=5, supy(x)=3<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x B z is possible.

2.  **x S z**: x is South of z, horizontal overlap.
    Conditions: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [2,3]x[1,2], MBB(z) = [1,4]x[3,4].
    supx(x)=3<=5, supy(x)=2<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x S z is possible.

3.  **x SW z**: x is South-West of z.
    Conditions: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [0,1]x[0,1], MBB(z) = [2,3]x[2,3].
    supx(x)=1<=5, supy(x)=1<=5, supx(z)=3<=5, supy(z)=3<=5. All satisfied. x SW z is possible.

4.  **x W z**: x is West of z, vertical overlap.
    Conditions: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [1,2]x[2,3], MBB(z) = [3,4]x[1,4].
    supx(x)=2<=5, supy(x)=3<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x W z is possible.

5.  **x NW z**: x is North-West of z.
    Conditions: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Example: MBB(x) = [1,2]x[3,4], MBB(z) = [3,4]x[1,2].
    supx(x)=2<=5, supy(x)=4<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=2<=5. All satisfied. x NW z is possible.

6.  **x N z**: x is North of z, horizontal overlap.
    Conditions: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [2,3]x[3,4], MBB(z) = [1,4]x[1,2].
    supx(x)=3<=5, supy(x)=4<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=2<=5. All satisfied. x N z is possible.

7.  **x NE z**: x is North-East of z.
    Conditions: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Example: MBB(x) = [3,4]x[3,4], MBB(z) = [1,2]x[1,2].
    supx(x)=4<=5, supy(x)=4<=5, supx(z)=2<=5, supy(z)=2<=5. All satisfied. x NE z is possible.

8.  **x E z**: x is East of z, vertical overlap.
    Conditions: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [3,4]x[2,3], MBB(z) = [1,2]x[1,4].
    supx(x)=4<=5, supy(x)=3<=5, supx(z)=2<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x E z is possible.

9.  **x SE z**: x is South-East of z.
    Conditions: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [3,4]x[1,2], MBB(z) = [1,2]x[3,4].
    supx(x)=4<=5, supy(x)=2<=5, supx(z)=2<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x SE z is possible.

In all cases, we were able to construct valid MBBs for x, z, and y such that x SW y, y NE z, and the target relation x R z holds. The conditions on REG (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk) are satisfied by filled rectangles, which were used for the MBB examples.

Thus, all 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z.

For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: SE, S, SW, E, B, W
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: E, SE
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: Let the bounding box of a region $r$ be denoted by $[infx(r), supx(r)] \times [infy(r), supy(r)]$.
We are given:
1. Region x is SE of region y:
   - $supx(y) \le infx(x)$
   - $supy(x) \le infy(y)$

2. Region y is S of region z:
   - $supy(y) \le infy(z)$
   - $infx(z) \le infx(y)$
   - $supx(y) \le supx(z)$

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}. These relations are defined based on the bounding boxes of the regions.

Let's combine the given inequalities to derive constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x and z.
From $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(z)$, we get $supy(x) \le infy(y) \le supy(y) \le infy(z)$.
Since $infy(y) \le supy(y)$ for any region with extent in y, we have $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
This inequality, $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, means that the upper boundary of x's bounding box is below or touching the lower boundary of z's bounding box. This is a key condition for x being South (S), South West (SW), or South East (SE) of z, or for x's bounding box being contained within z's bounding box (B), where the y-intervals might overlap or touch.

Let's consider the x-coordinates. We have $supx(y) \le infx(x)$ and $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
From $supx(y) \le infx(x)$ and $infx(y) \le supx(y)$, we have $infx(y) \le supx(y) \le infx(x)$, so $infx(y) \le infx(x)$.
From $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(y) \le infx(x)$, we get $infx(z) \le infx(y) \le infx(x)$, so $infx(z) \le infx(x)$.
This inequality, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, means that the left boundary of x's bounding box is to the East of or touching the left boundary of z's bounding box.

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies they have non-zero extent in both x and y directions. Thus, for any region r in REG, $infx(r) < supx(r)$ and $infy(r) < supy(r)$.
This means $infy(y) < supy(y)$, so $supy(x) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(z)$, which implies $supy(x) < infy(z)$. The y-interval of x is strictly below the y-interval of z.
Similarly, $infx(y) < supx(y)$, so $infx(z) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le infx(x)$, which implies $infx(z) < infx(x)$. The left x-boundary of x is strictly to the East of the left x-boundary of z.

So we have two strict constraints:
1. $supy(x) < infy(z)$ (x is strictly South of z in the y-projection)
2. $infx(z) < infx(x)$ (x starts strictly East of z's start in the x-projection)

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible relations between x and z:
-   N: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. This contradicts $supy(x) < infy(z)$ because $infy(x) < supy(x)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$. If $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, then $infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$, which contradicts $supy(x) < infy(z)$. N is impossible.
-   NW: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. Impossible due to y-condition.
-   W: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$. Impossible due to x-condition ($infx(z) < infx(x)$ implies $supx(x) > infx(z)$ since $infx(x) < supx(x)$).
-   SW: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. Impossible due to x-condition.
-   E: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$. The y-condition $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ requires the y-interval of x to overlap or be contained in the y-interval of z. This contradicts $supy(x) < infy(z)$. E is impossible.
-   NE: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. Impossible due to y-condition.
-   B: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$. The y-conditions $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ require the y-interval of x to overlap or be contained in the y-interval of z. This contradicts $supy(x) < infy(z)$. B is impossible.

This leaves S and SE as potential possibilities, which are consistent with the y-constraint $supy(x) < infy(z)$. Let's check their x-constraints.

-   S: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (holds), $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ (holds), $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    Is it possible that $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ holds given the initial premises?
    We have $supx(y) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
    We need to construct regions x, y, z in REG such that x SE y, y S z, and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    Let z = [0, 10] x [20, 30]. $infx(z)=0, supx(z)=10, infy(z)=20, supy(z)=30$.
    Let y = [2, 8] x [15, 18]. $infx(y)=2, supx(y)=8, infy(y)=15, supy(y)=18$.
    Check y S z: $supy(y)=18 \le infy(z)=20$ (True). $infx(z)=0 \le infx(y)=2$ (True). $supx(y)=8 \le supx(z)=10$ (True). y S z holds.
    Let x = [9, 10] x [10, 12]. $infx(x)=9, supx(x)=10, infy(x)=10, supy(x)=12$.
    Check x SE y: $supx(y)=8 \le infx(x)=9$ (True). $supy(x)=12 \le infy(y)=15$ (True). x SE y holds.
    Now check x S z: $supy(x)=12 \le infy(z)=20$ (True). $infx(z)=0 \le infx(x)=9$ (True). $supx(x)=10 \le supx(z)=10$ (True). x S z holds.
    Since we found a configuration where x S z is true, S is a possible relation.

-   SE: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (holds).
    Is it possible that $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ holds given the initial premises?
    We have $supx(y) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
    We need to construct regions x, y, z in REG such that x SE y, y S z, and $supx(z) \le infx(x)$.
    Let z = [0, 5] x [20, 30]. $supx(z)=5, infy(z)=20$.
    Let y = [1, 4] x [15, 18]. $supx(y)=4, infy(y)=15, supy(y)=18$.
    Check y S z: $supy(y)=18 \le infy(z)=20$ (True). $infx(z)=0 \le infx(y)=1$ (True). $supx(y)=4 \le supx(z)=5$ (True). y S z holds.
    Let x = [6, 8] x [10, 12]. $infx(x)=6, supy(x)=12$.
    Check x SE y: $supx(y)=4 \le infx(x)=6$ (True). $supy(x)=12 \le infy(y)=15$ (True). x SE y holds.
    Now check x SE z: $supx(z)=5 \le infx(x)=6$ (True). $supy(x)=12 \le infy(z)=20$ (True). x SE z holds.
    Since we found a configuration where x SE z is true, SE is a possible relation.

We have shown that S and SE are possible relations, and all other single-tile relations are impossible based on the derived strict inequalities ($supy(x) < infy(z)$ and $infx(z) < infx(x)$) which hold for any regions in REG satisfying the premise.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SE}$.

For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: The given conditions are:
1.  x SE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
2.  y B z: `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, `supx(y) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(y)`, `supy(y) <= supy(z)`

Regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, implying they are 2-dimensional and thus `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)` for any region a.

Let's analyze the relationships between the bounding box coordinates of x and z:

For x-coordinates:
-   From `y B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(y)`
-   From properties of bounding box: `infx(y) < supx(y)`
-   From `x SE y`: `supx(y) <= infx(x)`
-   From properties of bounding box: `infx(x) < supx(x)`
Combining these: `infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x)`.
This implies `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `infx(z) < supx(x)`.

For y-coordinates:
-   From `x SE y`: `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
-   From properties of bounding box: `infy(x) < supy(x)`
-   From `y B z`: `infy(z) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`
-   From properties of bounding box: `infy(y) < supy(y)`
Combining parts:
`infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
This implies `supy(x) <= supy(z)` and `infy(x) < supy(z)`.

Also, consider `infy(x)` relative to `infy(z)`:
We have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` and `infy(z) <= infy(y)`. Both `supy(x)` and `infy(z)` are less than or equal to `infy(y)`. Their relative position is not fixed by these inequalities alone. It is possible that `infy(z) <= supy(x)` (meaning `x` is vertically below or overlapping the bottom of `z`) or `supy(x) < infy(z)` (meaning `x` is entirely below the bottom of `z`). Since `infy(x) < supy(x)`, it is possible that `infy(x) < infy(z)`.

Consider `supx(x)` relative to `supx(z)`:
We have `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supx(y) <= supx(z)`. Both `infx(x)` and `supx(z)` are greater than or equal to `supx(y)`. Their relative position is not fixed. It is possible that `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (meaning `x` is horizontally contained within or overlapping the right side of `z`) or `supx(z) < supx(x)` (meaning `x` extends to the right of `z`).

Summary of derived inequalities:
-   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Guaranteed)
-   `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Guaranteed)
-   `infx(z) < supx(x)` (Guaranteed for 2D regions)
-   `infy(x) < supy(z)` (Guaranteed for 2D regions)

Let's check the definition of each possible relation `x R z`:
-   B: `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    -   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Yes)
    -   `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Yes)
    -   Requires `supx(x) <= supx(z)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. These are not guaranteed, but can be true in some configurations. (Example constructed in thought process). B is Possible.

-   S: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    -   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Yes)
    -   Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. These are not guaranteed, but can be true. (Example constructed in thought process). S is Possible.

-   SW: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    -   Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. This contradicts `infx(z) < supx(x)` for 2D regions. SW is Not possible.

-   W: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    -   Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. Not possible. W is Not possible.

-   NW: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    -   Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. Not possible. NW is Not possible.

-   N: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    -   Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This contradicts `infy(x) < supy(z)` for 2D regions. N is Not possible.

-   NE: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    -   Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Not possible. NE is Not possible.

-   E: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    -   `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Yes)
    -   Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. These are not guaranteed, but can be true. (Example constructed in thought process). E is Possible.

-   SE: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    -   Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. These are not guaranteed, but can be true. (Example constructed in thought process). SE is Possible.

The possible relations are B, S, E, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{B, S, E, SE}$.
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Let the minimum bounding box of a region $r$ be denoted by $[infx(r), supx(r)] \times [infy(r), supy(r)]$.

We are given:
1. Region x is NE of region y:
   $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$
   $supy(y) \leq infy(x)$

2. Region y is N of region z:
   $supy(z) \leq infy(y)$
   $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$
   $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z from the given set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's combine the inequalities:
From (1) and (3): $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$ and $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$.
From (2) and (4): $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$.
Combining the x-inequalities: $infx(z) \leq infx(y) \leq supx(y) \leq infx(x)$.
This implies $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. (Let's call this A)

From (1) and (2): $supy(y) \leq infy(x)$ and $supy(z) \leq infy(y)$.
Combining the y-inequalities: $supy(z) \leq infy(y) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(x)$.
This implies $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. (Let's call this B)

Since the regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, they are closed, connected, and have a non-zero extent in both x and y directions. This means for any region $r$, $infx(r) < supx(r)$ and $infy(r) < supy(r)$.
From $supy(z) \leq infy(y) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(x)$, and knowing $infy(y) < supy(y)$ and $infy(x) < supy(x)$, we have $supy(z) < infy(x)$ unless $infy(y) = supy(y)$ or $supy(y) = infy(x)$. Since y and x are non-degenerate, $infy(y) < supy(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(x)$ implies $infy(y) < infy(x)$. Similarly, $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ and $infy(y) < supy(y)$ implies $supy(z) < supy(y)$.
Thus, $supy(z) \leq infy(y) < supy(y) \leq infy(x) < supy(x)$.
This gives us the strict inequality $supy(z) < infy(x)$ and $supy(Z) < supy(X)$.

Now let's check the possible relations between x and z based on their definitions:

-   **S(x, z):** $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$. This contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **SW(x, z):** $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ and $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$. This contradicts $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$ (unless $infx(z) = supx(x)$ which combined with $infx(z) \le infx(x) < supx(x)$ is impossible for non-degenerate regions) and $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **SE(x, z):** $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$. This contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **W(x, z):** $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$, $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$. This contradicts $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$ and $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **NW(x, z):** $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. This contradicts $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. Impossible.
-   **E(x, z):** $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$. The condition $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$ contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **B(x, z):** $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$, $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$. The condition $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$ contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.

Based on the strict inequality $supy(z) < infy(x)$, which implies X is always above Z vertically or touching at the bottom boundary of X and top boundary of Z, only N, NE, E, W, NW are potentially possible. We have already ruled out E, W, NW based on the derived inequalities.

Let's check N and NE again.

-   **N(x, z):** $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$, $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$.
    We know $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$ (B) and $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$ (A) are always true. We need to check if $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$ is possible.
    We know $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$ and $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$. It is possible to have a configuration where $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$.
    Example: Z=[0,10]x[0,5], Y=[4,6]x[6,7], X=[6,10]x[8,9].
    Y N Z: supy(Z)=5 <= infy(Y)=6 (T), infx(Z)=0 <= infx(Y)=4 (T), supx(Y)=6 <= supx(Z)=10 (T). Holds.
    X NE Y: supx(Y)=6 <= infx(X)=6 (T), supy(Y)=7 <= infy(X)=8 (T). Holds.
    X N Z: supy(Z)=5 <= infy(X)=8 (T), infx(Z)=0 <= infx(X)=6 (T), supx(X)=10 <= supx(Z)=10 (T). Holds.
    So N is a possible relation.

-   **NE(x, z):** $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$.
    We know $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$ (B) is always true. We need to check if $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$ is possible.
    We know $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$ and $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$. It is possible to have a configuration where $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$.
    Example: Z=[0,7]x[0,4], Y=[5,6]x[5,6], X=[7,8]x[7,8].
    Y N Z: supy(Z)=4 <= infy(Y)=5 (T), infx(Z)=0 <= infx(Y)=5 (T), supx(Y)=6 <= supx(Z)=7 (T). Holds.
    X NE Y: supx(Y)=6 <= infx(X)=7 (T), supy(Y)=6 <= infy(X)=7 (T). Holds.
    X NE Z: supx(Z)=7 <= infx(X)=7 (T), supy(Z)=4 <= infy(X)=7 (T). Holds.
    So NE is a possible relation.

All other relations were ruled out based on the derived inequalities and the properties of regions in REG.

The possible relations between region x and region z are N and NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE}$.

For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: N, NE, E, B
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region a.
The definitions of the given relations for regions a and b are:
-   a B b: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
-   a E b: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
-   a NE b: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
-   a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)
-   a S b: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
-   a SW b: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
-   a W b: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
-   a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
-   a N b: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)

We are given that region x is B of region y (x B y) and region y is E of region z (y E z). The regions x, y, and z belong to REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies that their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., infx < supx and infy < supy for each region in REG.

From x B y:
1.  infx(y) <= infx(x)
2.  supx(x) <= supx(y)
3.  infy(y) <= infy(x)
4.  supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y E z:
5.  supx(z) <= infx(y)
6.  infy(z) <= infy(y)
7.  supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now let's combine these inequalities to find the relationships between the bounding boxes of x and z.

For the x-bounds:
From (5) supx(z) <= infx(y) and from (1) infx(y) <= infx(x).
Combining these, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(x)

For the y-bounds:
From (6) infy(z) <= infy(y) and from (3) infy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining these, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(x)

From (4) supy(x) <= supy(y) and from (7) supy(y) <= supy(z).
Combining these, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, for regions x and z satisfying the premises, their bounding boxes must satisfy:
(D1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(D2) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(D3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now let's check which of the possible relations R(x, z) are compatible with these derived conditions (D1), (D2), (D3), keeping in mind that x and z are in REG, which implies infx(x) < supx(x), infy(x) < supy(x), infx(z) < supx(z), and infy(z) < supy(z).

-   E(x, z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    These are exactly the derived conditions (D1), (D2), (D3). Since these conditions are necessary consequences of the premises, E is a possible relation. We can construct examples of regions in REG satisfying x B y and y E z (e.g., concentric disks appropriately scaled and translated), and for these examples, E(x, z) holds.

-   NE(x, z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
    (D1) is satisfied. We need supy(z) <= infy(x).
    From (D2) infy(z) <= infy(x) and from (D3) supy(x) <= supy(z).
    If supy(z) <= infy(x), then combining with (D3), supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Since infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region, this chain of inequalities implies infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z).
    For a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x), which contradicts infy(x) = supy(x).
    Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible for regions in REG under the given premises. NE is not possible.

-   SE(x, z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    (D1) is satisfied. We need supy(x) <= infy(z).
    From (D2) infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x).
    If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
    This implies infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z).
    For a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x), which contradicts infy(x) = supy(x).
    Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible for regions in REG under the given premises. SE is not possible.

-   N(x, z): Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We know supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible for REG (shown for NE). N is not possible.

-   S(x, z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We know supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible for REG (shown for SE). S is not possible.

-   W(x, z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    (D2) and (D3) are satisfied. We need supx(x) <= infx(z).
    From (D1) supx(z) <= infx(x). We know infx(x) <= supx(x).
    If supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
    This implies infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z).
    For regions in REG, infx < supx, so this would require x and z to be points, which are not homeomorphic to a disk.
    Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for regions in REG. W is not possible.

-   NW(x, z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for REG (shown for W), and supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible for REG (shown for NE). NW is not possible.

-   SW(x, z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for REG (shown for W), and supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible for REG (shown for SE). SW is not possible.

-   B(x, z): Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    (D2) and (D3) are satisfied. We need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    From (D1) supx(z) <= infx(x).
    If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
    This implies supx(x) <= infx(x).
    For a region in REG, infx(x) < supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(x).
    Therefore, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) is not possible for regions in REG under the given premises. B is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the constraint that regions are in REG (non-degenerate bounding boxes), the only possible relation between region x and region z is E.

E

The final answer is $\boxed{E}$.
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: The given conditions are:
1. Region x is B of region y (x B y)
2. Region y is NW of region z (y NW z)
Regions x, y, and z belong to REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This implies that each region is a 2D shape and its projections onto the x and y axes are closed intervals with positive length. That is, for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's write the definitions using inequalities:
x B y:
infx(y) <= infx(x)  (1a)
supx(x) <= supx(y)  (1b)
infy(y) <= infy(x)  (1c)
supy(x) <= supy(y)  (1d)

y NW z:
supx(y) <= infx(z)  (2a)
supy(z) <= infy(y)  (2b)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's combine the inequalities derived from the given conditions.
From (1b) and (2a), we have supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z). Transitivity gives:
supx(x) <= infx(z)  (A)

From (1c) and (2b), we have supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x). Transitivity gives:
supy(z) <= infy(x)  (B)

Now let's examine the definitions of all possible relations between x and z:

x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
From (A), supx(x) <= infx(z). If infx(z) <= infx(x) also holds (as required by S), then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). However, for a region homeomorphic to a disk, infx(x) < supx(x). Thus, S is impossible.

x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is guaranteed by (A).
The second condition is supy(x) <= infy(z). From the B and NW definitions, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y). This chain implies supy(z) <= supy(x). For SW to hold, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). Combining this with supy(z) <= supy(x) gives supy(z) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This requires supy(z) <= infy(z). However, for a region homeomorphic to a disk, infy(z) < supy(z). Thus, SW is impossible.

x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is guaranteed by (A).
From the chain supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y), we know supy(z) <= infy(x) (B) and supy(z) <= supy(x).
For W to hold, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
If supy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x), then supy(x) = supy(z).
Then supy(z) <= infy(x) (B) becomes supy(x) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) = infy(x), which means the y-projection of x is a point. This is impossible for a region homeomorphic to a disk. Thus, W is impossible.

x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
These are exactly the two inequalities (A) and (B) that we derived from the given conditions. Both conditions for NW are necessarily true. Therefore, x NW z is always possible.

x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
The first condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), is guaranteed by (B).
The condition infx(z) <= infx(x), combined with supx(x) <= infx(z) from (A), implies supx(x) <= infx(x). This is impossible for a 2D region. Thus, N is impossible.

x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
The second condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), is guaranteed by (B).
The first condition is supx(z) <= infx(x). From the B and NW definitions, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This chain implies infx(x) <= infx(z).
For NE to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). So we need supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infx(x) <= infx(z). This requires supx(z) <= infx(z). However, for a region homeomorphic to a disk, infx(z) < supx(z). Thus, NE is impossible.

x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
Similar to N, this requires supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= infx(z), which is impossible for 2D regions unless their x-projections are points and overlap. Thus, E is impossible.

x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (impossible, see NE) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (impossible, see SW). Thus, SE is impossible.

x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
infx(z) <= infx(x) combined with supx(x) <= infx(z) (A) implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is impossible for a 2D region. Thus, B is impossible.

Based on the analysis of the necessary conditions derived from the premise and the properties of regions homeomorphic to a disk (inf < sup), only the NW relation is possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{NW}$.
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Let $infx(a)$, $supx(a)$, $infy(a)$, $supy(a)$ denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of region $a$. Let $MBB(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$.
For any region $a \in REG$, we must have $infx(a) < supx(a)$ and $infy(a) < supy(a)$ since regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk, implying they have non-zero extent in both x and y dimensions.

The given relations are:
1.  Region x is B of region y (x B y):
    $infx(y) \le infx(x)$
    $supx(x) \le supx(y)$
    $infy(y) \le infy(x)$
    $supy(x) \le supy(y)$

2.  Region y is SE of region z (y SE z):
    $supx(z) \le infx(y)$
    $supy(y) \le infy(z)$

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's derive the constraints on the bounding box of x and z by combining the given conditions.

From (x B y) and (y SE z):
-   For the x-coordinates:
    $supx(z) \le infx(y)$ (from y SE z)
    $infx(y) \le infx(x)$ (from x B y)
    Combining these, we get $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. (Constraint 1)

-   For the y-coordinates:
    $supy(x) \le supy(y)$ (from x B y)
    $supy(y) \le infy(z)$ (from y SE z)
    Combining these, we get $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. (Constraint 2)

So, for any regions x, y, z in REG satisfying the given relations, their bounding boxes must satisfy $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.

Now let's check which of the possible single-tile relations between x and z are defined by these constraints. The definitions of the single-tile relations are given in terms of the bounding box coordinates.

Let's list the conditions for x R z for each R in {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}:
-   x B z: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Constraint 1 ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) and $infx(x) < supx(x)$ implies $supx(z) < supx(x)$. This contradicts the condition $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. So x cannot be B of z.

-   x S z: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    Constraint 2 ($supy(x) \le infy(z)$) is met.
    Constraint 1 ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) and $infx(z) \le supx(z)$ implies $infx(z) \le supx(z) \le infx(x)$. So $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ is met.
    Constraint 1 ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) and $infx(x) < supx(x)$ implies $supx(z) < supx(x)$. This contradicts the condition $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. So x cannot be S of z.

-   x SW z: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
    Constraint 2 ($supy(x) \le infy(z)$) is met.
    Constraint 1 ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) and $infx(z) \le supx(z)$ and $infx(x) < supx(x)$ implies $infx(z) \le supx(z) \le infx(x) < supx(x)$. So $infx(z) < supx(x)$. This contradicts the condition $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. So x cannot be SW of z.

-   x W z: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is not possible (shown for SW). So x cannot be W of z.

-   x NW z: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is not possible (shown for SW). So x cannot be NW of z.

-   x N z: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ is not possible (shown for S). So x cannot be N of z.

-   x NE z: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    Constraint 1 ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) is met.
    Constraint 2 ($supy(x) \le infy(z)$) and $infy(x) < supy(x)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$ implies $infy(x) < supy(x) \le infy(z) < supy(z)$. So $infy(x) < supy(z)$. This contradicts the condition $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. So x cannot be NE of z.

-   x E z: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Constraint 1 ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) is met.
    Constraint 2 ($supy(x) \le infy(z)$) and $infy(x) < supy(x)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$ implies $infy(x) < supy(x) \le infy(z) < supy(z)$. So $infy(x) < infy(z)$ and $supy(x) < supy(z)$.
    The condition $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ for E is contradicted by $infy(x) < infy(z)$. So x cannot be E of z.

-   x SE z: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
    Constraint 1 ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) is met.
    Constraint 2 ($supy(x) \le infy(z)$) is met.
    These are exactly the two constraints derived from the premise.
    Thus, the relation x SE z must always hold whenever x B y and y SE z for regions in REG.

Since the definitions of the single-tile relations are "if and only if", and we have shown that only the conditions for SE are consistently met by the derived constraints (while conditions for all other relations lead to contradictions due to the $inf < sup$ property of REG regions), only SE is a possible relation between x and z.

The final answer is $\boxed{SE}$.
