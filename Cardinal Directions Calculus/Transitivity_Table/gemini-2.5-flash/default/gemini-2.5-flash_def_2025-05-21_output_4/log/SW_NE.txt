PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given information defines the single-tile cardinal direction relations based on the minimum bounding boxes (MBB) of regions. Let MBB(a) be represented by the interval [infx(a), supx(a)] along the x-axis and [infy(a), supy(a)] along the y-axis.

The given relations are:
1.  `x SW y`: supx(x) <= infx(y) AND supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  `y NE z`: supx(z) <= infx(y) AND supy(z) <= infy(y)

We are looking for the possible relations between region x and region z (x R z). A relation R is possible if there exist regions x, y, and z from REG satisfying the conditions x SW y and y NE z, and the definition of x R z.

From the given conditions:
(1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(2) supy(x) <= infy(y)
(3) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(4) supy(z) <= infy(y)

These inequalities imply that the MBBs of x and z must lie entirely to the "South-West" of the point (infx(y), infy(y)). Specifically, the maximum x-coordinates of x and z must be less than or equal to infx(y), and the maximum y-coordinates of x and z must be less than or equal to infy(y).

Let's check if each of the 9 possible relations between x and z can be satisfied. To do this, we need to find example MBBs for x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions (1-4) and the conditions for the target relation x R z. If we can find such an example, the relation R is possible. Since regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk exist for any valid rectangular MBB (e.g., filled rectangles), we can use MBB coordinates to construct examples.

Let's set infx(y) and infy(y) to sufficiently large values to accommodate the other MBBs. Let infx(y) = 5 and infy(y) = 5.
Then the conditions (1-4) become:
supx(x) <= 5
supy(x) <= 5
supx(z) <= 5
supy(z) <= 5
Also, we need infx(y) <= supx(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y). Let y be a filled rectangle [5, 6] x [5, 6]. This MBB satisfies infx(y)=5, supx(y)=6, infy(y)=5, supy(y)=6. This choice is valid.

Now, we need to find MBBs for x and z such that supx(x)<=5, supy(x)<=5, supx(z)<=5, supy(z)<=5, and the target relation x R z holds.

1.  **x B z**: MBB(z) contains MBB(x).
    Conditions: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [2,3]x[2,3], MBB(z) = [1,4]x[1,4].
    supx(x)=3<=5, supy(x)=3<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x B z is possible.

2.  **x S z**: x is South of z, horizontal overlap.
    Conditions: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [2,3]x[1,2], MBB(z) = [1,4]x[3,4].
    supx(x)=3<=5, supy(x)=2<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x S z is possible.

3.  **x SW z**: x is South-West of z.
    Conditions: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [0,1]x[0,1], MBB(z) = [2,3]x[2,3].
    supx(x)=1<=5, supy(x)=1<=5, supx(z)=3<=5, supy(z)=3<=5. All satisfied. x SW z is possible.

4.  **x W z**: x is West of z, vertical overlap.
    Conditions: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [1,2]x[2,3], MBB(z) = [3,4]x[1,4].
    supx(x)=2<=5, supy(x)=3<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x W z is possible.

5.  **x NW z**: x is North-West of z.
    Conditions: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Example: MBB(x) = [1,2]x[3,4], MBB(z) = [3,4]x[1,2].
    supx(x)=2<=5, supy(x)=4<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=2<=5. All satisfied. x NW z is possible.

6.  **x N z**: x is North of z, horizontal overlap.
    Conditions: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [2,3]x[3,4], MBB(z) = [1,4]x[1,2].
    supx(x)=3<=5, supy(x)=4<=5, supx(z)=4<=5, supy(z)=2<=5. All satisfied. x N z is possible.

7.  **x NE z**: x is North-East of z.
    Conditions: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Example: MBB(x) = [3,4]x[3,4], MBB(z) = [1,2]x[1,2].
    supx(x)=4<=5, supy(x)=4<=5, supx(z)=2<=5, supy(z)=2<=5. All satisfied. x NE z is possible.

8.  **x E z**: x is East of z, vertical overlap.
    Conditions: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [3,4]x[2,3], MBB(z) = [1,2]x[1,4].
    supx(x)=4<=5, supy(x)=3<=5, supx(z)=2<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x E z is possible.

9.  **x SE z**: x is South-East of z.
    Conditions: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Example: MBB(x) = [3,4]x[1,2], MBB(z) = [1,2]x[3,4].
    supx(x)=4<=5, supy(x)=2<=5, supx(z)=2<=5, supy(z)=4<=5. All satisfied. x SE z is possible.

In all cases, we were able to construct valid MBBs for x, z, and y such that x SW y, y NE z, and the target relation x R z holds. The conditions on REG (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk) are satisfied by filled rectangles, which were used for the MBB examples.

Thus, all 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z.
