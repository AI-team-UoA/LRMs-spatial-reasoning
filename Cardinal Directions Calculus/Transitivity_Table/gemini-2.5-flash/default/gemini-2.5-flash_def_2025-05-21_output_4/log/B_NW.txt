PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given conditions are:
1. Region x is B of region y (x B y)
2. Region y is NW of region z (y NW z)
Regions x, y, and z belong to REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This implies that each region is a 2D shape and its projections onto the x and y axes are closed intervals with positive length. That is, for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's write the definitions using inequalities:
x B y:
infx(y) <= infx(x)  (1a)
supx(x) <= supx(y)  (1b)
infy(y) <= infy(x)  (1c)
supy(x) <= supy(y)  (1d)

y NW z:
supx(y) <= infx(z)  (2a)
supy(z) <= infy(y)  (2b)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's combine the inequalities derived from the given conditions.
From (1b) and (2a), we have supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z). Transitivity gives:
supx(x) <= infx(z)  (A)

From (1c) and (2b), we have supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x). Transitivity gives:
supy(z) <= infy(x)  (B)

Now let's examine the definitions of all possible relations between x and z:

x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
From (A), supx(x) <= infx(z). If infx(z) <= infx(x) also holds (as required by S), then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). However, for a region homeomorphic to a disk, infx(x) < supx(x). Thus, S is impossible.

x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is guaranteed by (A).
The second condition is supy(x) <= infy(z). From the B and NW definitions, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y). This chain implies supy(z) <= supy(x). For SW to hold, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). Combining this with supy(z) <= supy(x) gives supy(z) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This requires supy(z) <= infy(z). However, for a region homeomorphic to a disk, infy(z) < supy(z). Thus, SW is impossible.

x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is guaranteed by (A).
From the chain supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y), we know supy(z) <= infy(x) (B) and supy(z) <= supy(x).
For W to hold, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
If supy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x), then supy(x) = supy(z).
Then supy(z) <= infy(x) (B) becomes supy(x) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) = infy(x), which means the y-projection of x is a point. This is impossible for a region homeomorphic to a disk. Thus, W is impossible.

x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
These are exactly the two inequalities (A) and (B) that we derived from the given conditions. Both conditions for NW are necessarily true. Therefore, x NW z is always possible.

x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
The first condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), is guaranteed by (B).
The condition infx(z) <= infx(x), combined with supx(x) <= infx(z) from (A), implies supx(x) <= infx(x). This is impossible for a 2D region. Thus, N is impossible.

x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
The second condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), is guaranteed by (B).
The first condition is supx(z) <= infx(x). From the B and NW definitions, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This chain implies infx(x) <= infx(z).
For NE to hold, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). So we need supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infx(x) <= infx(z). This requires supx(z) <= infx(z). However, for a region homeomorphic to a disk, infx(z) < supx(z). Thus, NE is impossible.

x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
Similar to N, this requires supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= infx(z), which is impossible for 2D regions unless their x-projections are points and overlap. Thus, E is impossible.

x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (impossible, see NE) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (impossible, see SW). Thus, SE is impossible.

x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
infx(z) <= infx(x) combined with supx(x) <= infx(z) (A) implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is impossible for a 2D region. Thus, B is impossible.

Based on the analysis of the necessary conditions derived from the premise and the properties of regions homeomorphic to a disk (inf < sup), only the NW relation is possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{NW}$.
