PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region r.
The given relations are defined as follows:
a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

We are given:
1) x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2) y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's analyze the consequences for the relationship between x and z.
From (1) and (2):
supx(x) <= infx(y)
supx(z) <= infx(y)
These inequalities tell us that the maximum x-coordinate of x and the maximum x-coordinate of z are both less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of y. Both bounding boxes of x and z are located to the west of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of y.

From (1) and (2):
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(z) >= supy(y)
These inequalities tell us that the minimum y-coordinate of x and the minimum y-coordinate of z are both greater than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of y. Both bounding boxes of x and and z are located to the north of or aligned with the top edge of the bounding box of y.

Combining these, the bounding boxes of both x and z are located in the region { (u, v) | u <= infx(y) and v >= supy(y) }, which is the North-West region relative to the point (infx(y), supy(y)).

Let's test if each of the 9 possible relations between x and z can occur given the constraints. We need to find example bounding boxes for x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions and the tested relation. Regions homeomorphic to a disk exist for any simple rectangular bounding box, and the definitions of the relations are based only on bounding boxes.

Let the bounding box of y be [0, 1] x [0, 1]. So infx(y)=0, supx(y)=1, infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
The conditions become:
supx(x) <= 0 and infy(x) >= 1
supx(z) <= 0 and infy(z) >= 1

Let's check each possible relation x R z:

1.  x B z (Bounding box of x is contained in bounding box of z): infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
    Example: x=[-0.5, -0.1]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-0.6, 0]x[1, 1.6]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-0.1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1 (T).
    x B z: infx(z)=-0.6 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), supx(x)=-0.1 <= supx(z)=0 (T), infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T), supy(x)=1.5 <= supy(z)=1.6 (T). Possible.

2.  x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z). (x is below z, and x is horizontally contained in z)
    Example: x=[-0.5, -0.1]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-0.6, 0]x[1.6, 2]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-0.1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T).
    x S z: supy(x)=1.5 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T), infx(z)=-0.6 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), supx(x)=-0.1 <= supx(z)=0 (T). Possible.

3.  x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). (x is to the west and south of z)
    Example: x=[-2, -1]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-0.5, 0]x[1.6, 2]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T).
    x SW z: supx(x)=-1 <= infx(z)=-0.5 (T), supy(x)=1.5 <= infy(z)=1.6 (T). Possible.

4.  x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z). (x is to the west of z, and x is vertically contained in z)
    Example: x=[-2, -1]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-0.5, 0]x[1, 1.6]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1 (T).
    x W z: supx(x)=-1 <= infx(z)=-0.5 (T), infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T), supy(x)=1.5 <= supy(z)=1.6 (T). Possible.

5.  x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). (x is to the west and north of z)
    Example: x=[-2, -1]x[1.6, 2], z=[-0.5, 0]x[1.1, 1.5]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.1 (T).
    x NW z: supx(x)=-1 <= infx(z)=-0.5 (T), supy(z)=1.5 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T). Possible.

6.  x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z). (x is above z, and x is horizontally contained in z)
    Example: x=[-0.5, -0.1]x[1.6, 2], z=[-0.6, 0]x[1.1, 1.5]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=-0.1 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=1.1 (T).
    x N z: supy(z)=1.5 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T), infx(z)=-0.6 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), supx(x)=-0.1 <= supx(z)=0 (T). Possible.

7.  x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). (x is to the east and north of z)
    Example: x=[-0.5, 0]x[1.6, 2], z=[-2, -1]x[1.1, 1.5]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].

    x NE z: supx(z)=-1 <= infx(x)=-0.5 (T), supy(z)=1.5 <= infy(x)=1.6 (T). Possible.

8.  x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z). (x is to the east of z, and x is vertically contained in z)
    Example: x=[-0.5, 0]x[1.1, 1.5], z=[-2, -1]x[1, 1.6]. y=[0,1]x[0,1].
    x NW y: supx(x)=0 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(x)=1.1 (T).
