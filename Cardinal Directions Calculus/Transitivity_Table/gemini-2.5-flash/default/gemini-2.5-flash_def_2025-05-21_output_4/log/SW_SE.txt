PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let MBR(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, their minimum bounding boxes have non-zero width and height, meaning infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

The given conditions are:
1) x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2) y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From condition 1, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
Since y is in REG, infy(y) < supy(y).
So, supy(x) < supy(y).

From condition 2, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

Combining these inequalities:
supy(x) < supy(y) <= infy(z)

This implies supy(x) < infy(z).
This strict inequality means that the minimum bounding box of region x is strictly below the minimum bounding box of region z on the y-axis.

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z and see which ones are consistent with supy(x) < infy(z). Let x R z be a relation. The definitions for R involve conditions on infx(x), supx(x), infy(x), supy(x) and infx(z), supx(z), infy(z), supy(z).

The y-axis conditions for each relation x R z are:
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z) (consistent with supy(x) < infy(z))
- SW: supy(x) <= infy(z) (consistent with supy(x) < infy(z))
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- SE: supy(x) <= infy(z) (consistent with supy(x) < infy(z))

The relations S, SW, and SE are directly consistent with supy(x) < infy(z), as their definition includes supy(x) <= infy(z). Let's verify if examples exist for these:

- x S z: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) in addition to supy(x) <= infy(z).
Example: MBR(x) = [0,1]x[0,1], MBR(y) = [2,3]x[2,3], MBR(z) = [0,1]x[4,5].
x SW y: supx(x)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=2 (ok).
y SE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok), supy(y)=3 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
x S z: supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=4 (ok), infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=0 (ok), supx(x)=1 <= supx(z)=1 (ok).
So, S is a possible relation.

- x SW z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) in addition to supy(x) <= infy(z).
Example: MBR(x) = [0,1]x[0,1], MBR(y) = [3,4]x[2,3], MBR(z) = [2,2.5]x[4,5].
x SW y: supx(x)=1 <= infx(y)=3 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=2 (ok).
y SE z: supx(z)=2.5 <= infx(y)=3 (ok), supy(y)=3 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
x SW z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
So, SW is a possible relation.

- x SE z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) in addition to supy(x) <= infy(z).
Example: MBR(x) = [2,3]x[0,1], MBR(y) = [4,5]x[2,3], MBR(z) = [0,1]x[4,5].
x SW y: supx(x)=3 <= infx(y)=4 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=2 (ok).
y SE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=4 (ok), supy(y)=3 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
x SE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2 (ok), supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=4 (ok).
So, SE is a possible relation.

Now let's consider the other relations.

- B, W, E require infy(z) <= infy(x).
We have supy(x) < infy(z). If infy(z) <= infy(x) also holds, then supy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible for the MBRs of x and z.
However, we also have the constraints imposed by the existence of region y:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
For B, W, or E to hold, we need infy(z) <= infy(x). Combining with supy(y) <= infy(z), we need supy(y) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
Also, from x SW y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
So we need supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Example: MBR(x)=[0,1]x[2,3] (iy=2, sy=3), MBR(z)=[2,3]x[1,2] (iy=1, sy=2). infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=2 (ok).
Need y such that x SW y (sx(x)=1 <= ix(y), sy(x)=3 <= iy(y)) and y SE z (sx(z)=3 <= ix(y), sy(y) <= iy(z)=1).
Need ix(y) >= 1, iy(y) >= 3, ix(y) >= 3, sy(y) <= 1.
Combining: ix(y) >= 3, iy(y) >= 3, sy(y) <= 1.
Since for any region in REG, infy(y) < supy(y), the condition iy(y) >= 3 and sy(y) <= 1 is impossible.
Therefore, B, W, and E are not possible.

- N, NW, NE require supy(z) <= infy(x).
We have supy(x) < infy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x) also holds, then supy(x) < infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible for the MBRs of x and z.
However, we also have the constraints from y: supy(y) <= infy(z) and supy(y) > infy(y), and supy(x) <= infy(y).
For N, NW, or NE to hold, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
Example: MBR(x)=[0,1]x[5,6] (iy=5, sy=6), MBR(z)=[2,3]x[0,1] (iy=0, sy=1). supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=5 (ok).
Need y such that x SW y (sx(x)=1 <= ix(y), sy(x)=6 <= iy(y)) and y SE z (sx(z)=3 <= ix(y), sy(y) <= iy(z)=0).
Need ix(y) >= 1, iy(y) >= 6, ix(y) >= 3, sy(y) <= 0.
Combining: ix(y) >= 3, iy(y) >= 6, sy(y) <= 0.
Since for any region in REG, infy(y) < supy(y), the condition iy(y) >= 6 and sy(y) <= 0 is impossible.
Therefore, N, NW, and NE are not possible.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relations between region x and region z are S, SW, and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW, SE}$.
