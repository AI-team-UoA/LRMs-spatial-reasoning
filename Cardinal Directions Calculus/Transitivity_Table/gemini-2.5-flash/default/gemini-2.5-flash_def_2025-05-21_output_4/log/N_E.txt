PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The given relations are:
1) x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) AND infx(y) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(y)
2) y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) AND infy(z) <= infy(y) AND supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on their minimum bounding boxes. Let's analyze the inequalities for x and z.

From (2), supx(z) <= infx(y).
From (1), infx(y) <= infx(x).
Combining these, we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which implies **supx(z) <= infx(x)**.
This inequality means the right edge of z's bounding box is at or to the left of the left edge of x's bounding box. This restricts the possible horizontal relations.
Relations requiring supx(x) <= infx(z) (W, NW, SW) are impossible.
Relations requiring horizontal overlap in a way that infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) (N, S, B) are also impossible. This is because combining supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is only possible if the x-projection is a single point, not allowed for regions in REG.

So, the only possible horizontal relations are those where x is to the east of z, or vertically aligned with the east boundary of z. These are E, NE, SE.

Now let's consider the vertical relations between x and z.
From (2), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
From (1), supy(y) <= infy(x).

Combining infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we get: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies **infy(z) <= infy(x)**.
This inequality means the bottom edge of z's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of x's bounding box. This rules out SE, which requires supy(x) <= infy(z) (combining with infy(z) <= infy(x) implies supy(x) <= infy(x), impossible for valid regions).

The remaining possible relations (from the horizontal analysis) are E and NE. Let's check if their vertical conditions are consistent with our derived inequalities.

For E (x E z): supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have already derived supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x).
The remaining condition is supy(x) <= supy(z). Is this possible?
Consider the example:
z = [0, 1] x [0, 3]
y E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y). supy(y) <= supy(z)=3.
Let y = [1, 2] x [1, 2]. infx=1, supx=2, infy=1, supy=2.
1 <= 1 (ok), 0 <= 1 (ok), 2 <= 3 (ok). y E z holds.
x N y: supy(y)=2 <= infy(x). infx(y)=1 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y)=2.
Let infy(x)=2, supy(x)=3. Let infx(x)=1, supx(x)=2.
x = [1, 2] x [2, 3].
Now check x E z: x=[1,2]x[2,3], z=[0,1]x[0,3].
supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=1 (ok).
infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=2 (ok).
supy(x)=3 <= supy(z)=3 (ok).
All conditions for E are met. So E is a possible relation.

For NE (x NE z): supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
We have already derived supx(z) <= infx(x).
The remaining condition is supy(z) <= infy(x). Is this possible?
Consider the example:
z = [0, 1] x [0, 1]
y E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y). supy(y) <= supy(z)=1.
Let y = [1, 2] x [0.5, 1]. infx=1, supx=2, infy=0.5, supy=1.
1 <= 1 (ok), 0 <= 0.5 (ok), 1 <= 1 (ok). y E z holds.
x N y: supy(y)=1 <= infy(x). infx(y)=1 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y)=2.
Let infy(x)=1, supy(x)=2. Let infx(x)=1, supx(x)=2.
x = [1, 2] x [1, 2].
Now check x NE z: x=[1,2]x[1,2], z=[0,1]x[0,1].
supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=1 (ok).
supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1 (ok).
All conditions for NE are met. So NE is a possible relation.

We have ruled out B, S, SW, W, NW, N, SE and shown that E and NE are possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z are E and NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, NE}$.
