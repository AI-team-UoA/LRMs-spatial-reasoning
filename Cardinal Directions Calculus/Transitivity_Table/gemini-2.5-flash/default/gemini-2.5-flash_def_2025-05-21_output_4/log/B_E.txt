PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region a.
The definitions of the given relations for regions a and b are:
-   a B b: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
-   a E b: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
-   a NE b: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
-   a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)
-   a S b: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
-   a SW b: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
-   a W b: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
-   a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
-   a N b: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)

We are given that region x is B of region y (x B y) and region y is E of region z (y E z). The regions x, y, and z belong to REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies that their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., infx < supx and infy < supy for each region in REG.

From x B y:
1.  infx(y) <= infx(x)
2.  supx(x) <= supx(y)
3.  infy(y) <= infy(x)
4.  supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y E z:
5.  supx(z) <= infx(y)
6.  infy(z) <= infy(y)
7.  supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now let's combine these inequalities to find the relationships between the bounding boxes of x and z.

For the x-bounds:
From (5) supx(z) <= infx(y) and from (1) infx(y) <= infx(x).
Combining these, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(x)

For the y-bounds:
From (6) infy(z) <= infy(y) and from (3) infy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining these, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(x)

From (4) supy(x) <= supy(y) and from (7) supy(y) <= supy(z).
Combining these, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, for regions x and z satisfying the premises, their bounding boxes must satisfy:
(D1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(D2) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(D3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now let's check which of the possible relations R(x, z) are compatible with these derived conditions (D1), (D2), (D3), keeping in mind that x and z are in REG, which implies infx(x) < supx(x), infy(x) < supy(x), infx(z) < supx(z), and infy(z) < supy(z).

-   E(x, z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    These are exactly the derived conditions (D1), (D2), (D3). Since these conditions are necessary consequences of the premises, E is a possible relation. We can construct examples of regions in REG satisfying x B y and y E z (e.g., concentric disks appropriately scaled and translated), and for these examples, E(x, z) holds.

-   NE(x, z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
    (D1) is satisfied. We need supy(z) <= infy(x).
    From (D2) infy(z) <= infy(x) and from (D3) supy(x) <= supy(z).
    If supy(z) <= infy(x), then combining with (D3), supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Since infy(x) <= supy(x) for any region, this chain of inequalities implies infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z).
    For a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x), which contradicts infy(x) = supy(x).
    Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible for regions in REG under the given premises. NE is not possible.

-   SE(x, z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    (D1) is satisfied. We need supy(x) <= infy(z).
    From (D2) infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x).
    If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
    This implies infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z).
    For a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x), which contradicts infy(x) = supy(x).
    Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible for regions in REG under the given premises. SE is not possible.

-   N(x, z): Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We know supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible for REG (shown for NE). N is not possible.

-   S(x, z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We know supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible for REG (shown for SE). S is not possible.

-   W(x, z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    (D2) and (D3) are satisfied. We need supx(x) <= infx(z).
    From (D1) supx(z) <= infx(x). We know infx(x) <= supx(x).
    If supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
    This implies infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z).
    For regions in REG, infx < supx, so this would require x and z to be points, which are not homeomorphic to a disk.
    Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for regions in REG. W is not possible.

-   NW(x, z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for REG (shown for W), and supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible for REG (shown for NE). NW is not possible.

-   SW(x, z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for REG (shown for W), and supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible for REG (shown for SE). SW is not possible.

-   B(x, z): Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    (D2) and (D3) are satisfied. We need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    From (D1) supx(z) <= infx(x).
    If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
    This implies supx(x) <= infx(x).
    For a region in REG, infx(x) < supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(x).
    Therefore, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) is not possible for regions in REG under the given premises. B is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the constraint that regions are in REG (non-degenerate bounding boxes), the only possible relation between region x and region z is E.

E

The final answer is $\boxed{E}$.
