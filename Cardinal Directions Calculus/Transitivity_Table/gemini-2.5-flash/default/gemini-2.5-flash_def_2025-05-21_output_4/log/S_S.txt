PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by `bbox(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies that for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

We are given that region x is S of region y, and region y is S of region z.
According to the definition of the S relation:
1) x S y: `supy(x) <= infy(y)`, `infx(y) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(y)`.
2) y S z: `supy(y) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, and `supx(y) <= supx(z)`.

Let's deduce the relationship between the bounding boxes of x and z.

From the y-coordinates:
We have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (from 1)) and `supy(y) <= infy(z)` (from 2)).
Since y is a region in REG, `infy(y) < supy(y)`.
Combining these inequalities: `supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z)`.
This implies `supy(x) < infy(z)`.
This inequality means that the top edge of x's bounding box is strictly below the bottom edge of z's bounding box. This is the y-condition for relations S, SW, and SE, and contradicts the y-condition for N, NE, NW, W, E, and B.
Specifically:
- N, NW, NE require the region to be above or overlapping vertically, which contradicts `supy(x) < infy(z)`.
- W, E require vertical overlap, which contradicts `supy(x) < infy(z)`.
- B requires vertical containment (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`). If x B z, then `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. Combining with `supy(x) < infy(z)`, we get `supy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(x)`. This implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`. However, for a region in REG, `infy(x) < supy(x)`. This is a contradiction. Thus, x B z is impossible.

So, the possible relations between x and z must have `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (in fact, we showed `supy(x) < infy(z)` holds). The remaining possibilities are S, SW, SE.

Now let's consider the x-coordinates:
From 1): `infx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(y)`.
From 2): `infx(z) <= infx(y)` and `supx(y) <= supx(z)`.

Combining these inequalities:
`infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)` => `infx(z) <= infx(x)`
`supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)` => `supx(x) <= supx(z)`

Also, since x is a region in REG, `infx(x) < supx(x)`.
Combining the x-inequalities: `infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`.

Now let's check the remaining possible relations (S, SW, SE) for x relative to z:

- x S z: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
We have shown that `supy(x) < infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(z)` always hold when x S y and y S z for regions in REG.
Thus, x S z is always a possible relation.

- x SW z: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
We know `supy(x) < infy(z)` holds.
We need to check if `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is possible.
From our derived chain of inequalities for x-coordinates: `infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x)`.
This implies `infx(z) < supx(x)`.
This contradicts the condition `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
Thus, x SW z is impossible for regions in REG.

- x SE z: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
We know `supy(x) < infy(z)` holds.
We need to check if `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is possible.
From our derived chain of inequalities for x-coordinates: `infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`.
This implies `infx(x) < supx(z)`.
This contradicts the condition `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
Thus, x SE z is impossible for regions in REG.

Based on the definitions and the properties of regions in REG (inf < sup), the only possible relation between region x and region z is S.

The final answer is $\boxed{S}$.
