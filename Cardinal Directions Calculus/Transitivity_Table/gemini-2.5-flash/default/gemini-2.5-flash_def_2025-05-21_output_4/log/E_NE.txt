PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box for a region r. Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they are 2D areas, which implies that for any region r in REG, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

We are given two relations:
1.  x E y
2.  y NE z

Let's write these relations using the provided definitions:
1.  x E y if and only if:
    (E1) supx(y) <= infx(x)
    (E2) infy(y) <= infy(x)
    (E3) supy(x) <= supy(y)

2.  y NE z if and only if:
    (NE1) supx(z) <= infx(y)
    (NE2) supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's combine the inequalities to find the constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z.

Combine (NE1) and (E1):
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)

Since y is a 2D region (in REG), infx(y) < supx(y).
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x).
This implies supx(z) < infx(x).
This strict inequality tells us that the bounding box of z is strictly to the west of the bounding box of x.

Now combine the vertical inequalities.
From (NE2): supy(z) <= infy(y)
From (E2): infy(y) <= infy(x)
Combining these two, we get: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(z) <= infy(x).
This inequality tells us that the top of the bounding box of z is at or below the bottom of the bounding box of x. In other words, x is located vertically above or at the same level as the top of z.

From the given relations, we have derived two necessary conditions for the bounding boxes of x and z:
(D1) supx(z) < infx(x)
(D2) supy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's examine which of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are compatible with these two conditions.
The possible relations are {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

(D1) supx(z) < infx(x) means that the right edge of z's bounding box is strictly to the left of the left edge of x's bounding box.
This rules out any relation where x is to the west of z (W, NW, SW), where the bounding boxes overlap horizontally (B), or where z is to the east of x (which implies x is to the west of z).
It also rules out N, which requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). If supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) < infx(x), then supx(x) < infx(x), which is impossible for a 2D region. So N is ruled out.

Relations ruled out by (D1): {B, W, NW, SW, N}.
Remaining possible relations: {S, SE, E, NE}.

(D2) supy(z) <= infy(x) means that the top edge of z's bounding box is at or below the bottom edge of x's bounding box.
This rules out any relation where x is to the south of z (S, SW, SE).
It also rules out B, which requires vertical containment, meaning supy(x) <= supy(z). supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) combined implies supy(x) <= infy(x), which is impossible for a 2D region. So B is ruled out.

Relations ruled out by (D2): {S, SW, SE, B}.
Remaining possible relations: {N, NW, W, E, NE}.

Combining the exclusions from (D1) and (D2):
Relations ruled out by (D1) or (D2): {B, W, NW, SW, N, S, SE}.
Possible relations remaining: {E, NE}.

Let's check if E is possible.
x E z if and only if:
(EZ1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(EZ2) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(EZ3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

(EZ1) is satisfied by our derived (D1) supx(z) < infx(x).
Let's consider (EZ3): supy(x) <= supy(z).
From the original relations, we have (E3) supy(x) <= supy(y) and (NE2) supy(z) <= infy(y).
If x E z holds, then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(y). So, supy(x) <= infy(y).
From (E2), we have infy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(x) <= infy(x).
Since x is a 2D region (in REG), infy(x) < supy(x).
The condition supy(x) <= infy(x) contradicts infy(x) < supy(x).
Therefore, x E z is not possible.

Let's check if NE is possible.
x NE z if and only if:
(NEz1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(NEz2) supy(z) <= infy(x)

Our derived conditions are (D1) supx(z) < infx(x) and (D2) supy(z) <= infy(x).
(D1) implies (NEz1) since supx(z) < infx(x) means supx(z) is indeed less than or equal to infx(x).
(D2) is exactly (NEz2).
Thus, the derived conditions are precisely the definition of x NE z.
We already provided an example in the thought process showing that regions x, y, z can exist satisfying the initial conditions and x NE z.

Since E is not possible and NE is possible, and all other relations have been ruled out by the derived conditions (D1) and (D2) or the contradiction shown for E, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
