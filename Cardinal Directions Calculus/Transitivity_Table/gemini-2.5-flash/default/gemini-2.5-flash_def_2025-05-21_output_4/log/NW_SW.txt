PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are:
1. x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) AND supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) AND supy(y) <= infy(z)

Regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies that for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

From condition 1 (x NW y):
supx(x) <= infx(y)  (x is to the west of y or touching)
infy(x) >= supy(y)  (x is to the north of y or touching)

From condition 2 (y SW z):
supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the west of z or touching)
supy(y) <= infy(z)  (y is to the south of z or touching)

Let's combine the inequalities in the x-dimension to relate x and z:
supx(x) <= infx(y)
infx(y) < supx(y) (because y is in REG)
supx(y) <= infx(z)

Combining these, we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z)
This chain of inequalities implies supx(x) < infx(z).
So, the right edge of the bounding box of x is strictly to the left of the left edge of the bounding box of z.

Now let's examine the possible single-tile relations between x and z based on their bounding boxes, keeping in mind that supx(x) < infx(z).

The single-tile cardinal relations are defined as follows (a R b):
- B: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- S: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- SW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
- W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- NW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- N: supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- NE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- SE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)

We have derived supx(x) < infx(z). Let's see which relations x R z are consistent with this:
- B: requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Since infx(x) <= supx(x) < infx(z) <= supx(z), we have infx(x) < infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). B is not possible.
- S: requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). As shown for B, infx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. S is not possible.
- SW: requires supx(x) <= infx(z). This is consistent with supx(x) < infx(z). SW is possible if the y-conditions can be met (supy(x) <= infy(z)).
- W: requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The first part is consistent with supx(x) < infx(z). W is possible if the y-conditions can be met.
- NW: requires supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). The first part is consistent with supx(x) < infx(z). NW is possible if the y-conditions can be met (supy(z) <= infy(x)).
- N: requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). As shown for B, infx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. N is not possible.
- NE: requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) <= supx(x) < infx(z) <= supx(z), we have supx(z) > infx(z) > supx(x) >= infx(x), so supx(z) > infx(x). NE is not possible.
- E: requires supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown for NE, E is not possible.
- SE: requires supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown for NE, SE is not possible.

So, the only possible relations are SW, W, and NW. We need to check if the y-conditions for each of these are compatible with the given information.

From the y-conditions:
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(z) >= supy(y)

These tell us that both infy(x) and infy(z) are greater than or equal to supy(y). This leaves flexibility in the relative positions of the y-intervals [infy(x), supy(x)] and [infy(z), supy(z)].

- NW (x NW z): requires supy(z) <= infy(x). We have infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). It is possible to choose bounding boxes such that supy(z) <= infy(x). For example, let supy(y)=5, infy(x)=10, supy(x)=12, infy(z)=6, supy(z)=8. Here 10 >= 5, 5 <= 6, and 8 <= 10. NW is possible.
- W (x W z): requires infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). We have infy(x) >= supy(y) and infy(z) >= supy(y). It is possible to choose bounding boxes such that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). For example, let supy(y)=5, infy(x)=10, supy(x)=12, infy(z)=8, supy(z)=15. Here 10 >= 5, 8 >= 5, 8 <= 10, and 12 <= 15. W is possible.
- SW (x SW z): requires supy(x) <= infy(z). We have infy(x) >= supy(y) and infy(z) >= supy(y). It is possible to choose bounding boxes such that supy(x) <= infy(z). For example, let supy(y)=5, infy(x)=10, supy(x)=12, infy(z)=15, supy(z)=18. Here 10 >= 5, 15 >= 5, and 12 <= 15. SW is possible.

Since W, NW, and SW are all possible depending on the specific y-coordinates of the bounding boxes, and all other relations are impossible due to the strict x-dimension constraint (supx(x) < infx(z)), the possible relations are W, NW, SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, NW, SW}$.
