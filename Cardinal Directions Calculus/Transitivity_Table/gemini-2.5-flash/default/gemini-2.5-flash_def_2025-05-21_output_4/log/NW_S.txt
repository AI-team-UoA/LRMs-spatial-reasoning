PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let $MBB(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$ denote the minimum bounding box of a region $a$.

Given:
1. x NW y: $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
2. y S z: $supy(y) \le infy(z)$, $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on their bounding boxes. Let's analyze the horizontal and vertical relationships between x and z.

Horizontal relationship between x and z:
From x NW y, we have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
From y S z, we have $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.

Consider the relative position of $infx(y)$ on the x-axis. It is greater than or equal to $supx(x)$ and greater than or equal to $infx(z)$.
Consider the relative position of $supx(y)$ on the x-axis. It is less than or equal to $supx(z)$.
From $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(y) < supx(y)$, we have $supx(x) < supx(y)$.
Since $supx(y) \le supx(z)$, we have $supx(x) < supx(z)$. This means the right boundary of $MBB(x)$ is always strictly to the left of the right boundary of $MBB(z)$.

Let's check if x can be to the East of z (E, NE, SE relations). This requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$.
From $supx(y) \le supx(z)$ and the assumption $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, we get $supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
From x NW y, we have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
We have $supx(y) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
Also, for any non-point region, $infx < supx$. So $infx(x) < supx(x)$ and $infx(y) < supx(y)$.
Combining inequalities: $infx(y) < supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
And $infx(x) < supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
So $infx(y) < infx(x)$ and $infx(x) < infx(y)$. This is a contradiction.
Therefore, the assumption $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ is false.
x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z.

The remaining horizontal possibilities for x relative to z are West ($supx(x) \le infx(z)$) or overlap ($infx(z) < supx(x)$ and $infx(x) < supx(z)$).
We showed $supx(x) < supx(z)$ and $infx(x) < supx(z)$ (from $infx(x) < supx(x)$ and $supx(x) < supx(z)$). So overlap requires $infx(z) < supx(x)$.

Vertical relationship between x and z:
From x NW y, we have $supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
From y S z, we have $supy(y) \le infy(z)$.
Both $infy(x)$ and $infy(z)$ are greater than or equal to $supy(y)$.

Let's consider the three basic vertical relations between x and z:
A) x is South of z: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. This is possible. Example construction in thought process.
B) x is North of z: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. This is possible. Example construction in thought process.
C) x and z overlap vertically: $infy(z) < supy(x)$ and $infy(x) < supy(z)$.
   Can this happen? We know $supy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(z) < supy(z)$.
   Example construction in thought process showed this is possible.
   If A and B both held, $supy(x) \le infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$, a contradiction.
   If A and C both held, $supy(x) \le infy(z) < supy(x)$, a contradiction.
   If B and C both held, $supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(z)$, a contradiction.
So exactly one of the vertical scenarios (South, North, or vertical overlap) must hold.

Combining horizontal and vertical possibilities:
Case 1: x is horizontally West of z ($supx(x) \le infx(z)$).
   - If x is vertically South of z ($supy(x) \le infy(z)$), then x SW z. This is possible.
   - If x is vertically North of z ($supy(z) \le infy(x)$), then x NW z. This is possible.
   - If x and z overlap vertically ($infy(z) < supy(x)$ and $infy(x) < supy(z)$) AND $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ AND $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ (vertical containment for W definition), then x W z. This is possible.

Case 2: x and z overlap horizontally ($infx(z) < supx(x)$ and $infx(x) < supx(z)$).
   - If x is vertically South of z ($supy(x) \le infy(z)$) AND $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (horizontal containment for S definition), then x S z. This is possible.
   - If x is vertically North of z ($supy(z) \le infy(x)$) AND $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (horizontal containment for N definition), then x N z. This is possible.
   - If x and z overlap vertically ($infy(z) < supy(x)$ and $infy(x) < supy(z)$) AND $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ AND $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ (vertical containment for B definition) AND $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (horizontal containment for B definition), then x B z. This is possible.

Case 3: x is horizontally East of z ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$). This is impossible.

The possible relations between x and z are those from Case 1 and Case 2 where we showed possibility: SW, NW, W, S, N, B.
The impossible relations are E, NE, SE.

The possible relations are S, SW, W, NW, N, B.
Listing them in the requested format from the example output: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.
The possible ones are N, S, NW, W, SW, B.

N, S, NW, W, SW, B

The final answer is $\boxed{N, S, NW, W, SW, B}$.
