PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are:
1. Region x is N of region y (x N y).
2. Region y is SE of region z (y SE z).

Let [infx(a), supx(a)] be the x-projection and [infy(a), supy(a)] be the y-projection of region a.
The regions are in REG, which means they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies that their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

From the definition of the relations:
x N y means:
(N1) supy(y) <= infy(x)
(N2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
(N3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

y SE z means:
(SE1) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(SE2) supy(y) <= infy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on their bounding boxes.

Combine (N2) and (SE1):
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x).
Since x is in REG, infx(x) < supx(x).
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x).
This gives us infx(x) > supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z).

The condition infx(x) > supx(z) implies that the left edge of x's bounding box is strictly to the right of the right edge of z's bounding box. This means the bounding box of x is entirely to the East of the bounding box of z (except possibly touching).
Let's check the cardinal direction definitions based on this.
- x W z requires supx(x) <= infx(z). This is not possible since infx(z) < supx(z) < infx(x) <= supx(x).
- x NW z requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Not possible.
- x SW z requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Not possible.
- x B z requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). supx(x) <= supx(z) is not possible since supx(x) > supx(z).
- x N z requires supx(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). supx(x) <= supx(z) is not possible.
- x S z requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). supx(x) <= supx(z) is not possible.

The only possible relations left from the list {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} are NE, E, and SE, all of which require supx(z) <= infx(x) (or supx(z) < infx(x), which we found).

Let's check if E, NE, and SE are indeed possible by constructing examples of bounding boxes that satisfy the given conditions:

Possibility E (x E z): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
Let B(z) = [0, 2] x [0, 2].
y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => 2 <= infx(y). supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(y) <= 0.
Let B(y) = [3, 4] x [-2, -1]. (2 <= 3, -1 <= 0; y SE z holds)
x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) => -1 <= infy(x). infx(y) <= infx(x) => 3 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y) => supx(x) <= 4.
For x E z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
infy(z)=0, supy(z)=2. We need 0 <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= 2.
We also need infy(x) >= -1. So we need 0 <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= 2.
Let B(x) = [3.5, 3.8] x [0.5, 1.5]. (3 <= 3.5, 3.8 <= 4, -1 <= 0.5; x N y holds)
Check x E z: B(x) = [3.5, 3.8] x [0.5, 1.5], B(z) = [0, 2] x [0, 2].
supx(z)=2, infx(x)=3.5 (2 <= 3.5; OK)
infy(z)=0, infy(x)=0.5 (0 <= 0.5; OK)
supy(x)=1.5, supy(z)=2 (1.5 <= 2; OK)
E is possible.

Possibility NE (x NE z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
Let B(z) = [0, 10] x [0, 10]. supy(z)=10.
y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => 10 <= infx(y). supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(y) <= 0.
Let B(y) = [11, 12] x [-2, -1]. (10 <= 11, -1 <= 0; y SE z holds)
x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) => -1 <= infy(x). infx(y) <= infx(x) => 11 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y) => supx(x) <= 12.
For x NE z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). supy(z)=10. We need 10 <= infy(x).
We also need infy(x) >= -1. So we need 10 <= infy(x).
Let B(x) = [11.5, 11.8] x [10, 11]. (11 <= 11.5, 11.8 <= 12, -1 <= 10; x N y holds)
Check x NE z: B(x) = [11.5, 11.8] x [10, 11], B(z) = [0, 10] x [0, 10].
supx(z)=10, infx(x)=11.5 (10 <= 11.5; OK)
supy(z)=10, infy(x)=10 (10 <= 10; OK)
NE is possible.

Possibility SE (x SE z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
Let B(z) = [0, 2] x [0, 2]. infy(z)=0.
y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => 2 <= infx(y). supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(y) <= 0.
Let B(y) = [3, 4] x [-2, -1]. (2 <= 3, -1 <= 0; y SE z holds)
x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) => -1 <= infy(x). infx(y) <= infx(x) => 3 <= infx(x). supx(x) <= supx(y) => supx(x) <= 4.
For x SE z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). infy(z)=0. We need supy(x) <= 0.
We also need infy(x) >= -1. So we need -1 <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= 0.
Let B(x) = [3.5, 3.8] x [-0.8, -0.5]. (3 <= 3.5, 3.8 <= 4, -1 <= -0.8; x N y holds)
Check x SE z: B(x) = [3.5, 3.8] x [-0.8, -0.5], B(z) = [0, 2] x [0, 2].
supx(z)=2, infx(x)=3.5 (2 <= 3.5; OK)
supy(x)=-0.5, infy(z)=0 (-0.5 <= 0; OK)
SE is possible.

Since we have shown that E, NE, and SE are possible, and all other relations have been ruled out based on the non-degenerate property of bounding boxes for regions in REG, the possible relations between region x and region z are E, NE, and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, NE, SE}$.
