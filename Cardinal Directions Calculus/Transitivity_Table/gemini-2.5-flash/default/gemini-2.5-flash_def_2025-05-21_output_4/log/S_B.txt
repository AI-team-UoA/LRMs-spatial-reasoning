PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given information is:
1.  x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2.  y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

The regions x, y, z belong to REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies their minimum bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's analyze the constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z.
From the x-axis constraints:
infx(z) <= infx(y) (from 2)
infx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1)
Combining these gives: infx(z) <= infx(x)

supx(x) <= supx(y) (from 1)
supx(y) <= supx(z) (from 2)
Combining these gives: supx(x) <= supx(z)

So, the x-projection of x, [infx(x), supx(x)], is contained within or equal to the x-projection of z, [infx(z), supx(z)].

From the y-axis constraints:
supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 1)
infy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2)
supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 2)

From supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) < supy(y) (non-degenerate box for y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we get supy(x) < supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now let's consider the possible single-tile relations between x and z based on their definitions:

1.  x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). These match the x-conditions for S.
    The y-condition is supy(x) <= infy(z). From the given relations, supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
    It is possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) to hold. For example, let infy(y) = 5. supy(x) can be 3 (3 <= 5) and infy(z) can be 4 (4 <= 5). Then supy(x) < infy(z). This case makes S impossible.
    However, it is also possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) to hold. For example, let infy(y) = 5. supy(x) can be 3 (3 <= 5) and infy(z) can be 3 (3 <= 5). Then supy(x) = infy(z). Or supy(x)=2, infy(z)=3 is not S. supy(x)=3, infy(z)=3 is S. supy(x)=3, infy(z)=2 is not S.
    Let's pick values that satisfy supy(x) <= infy(z): Let infy(y)=10. Choose supy(x)=5 and infy(z)=6. (5 <= 10 and 6 <= 10). Here supy(x) < infy(z), so S holds. Thus, S is a possible relation.

2.  x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). These match the x-conditions for B.
    We derived supy(x) <= supy(z). This matches one y-condition for B.
    The remaining y-condition is infy(z) <= infy(x). From the given relations, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
    It is possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) to hold. For example, let infy(y) = 10. Choose infy(x) = 8 (since infy(x) <= supy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y), infy(x) must be <= 10) and infy(z) = 7 (7 <= 10). Then infy(z) < infy(x). This is possible.
    Since all conditions for B are possible to satisfy simultaneously with the given relations, B is a possible relation.

3.  x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    The y-condition is supy(z) <= infy(x). From the given relations, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z). This implies infy(x) < supy(z). Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible. N is not possible.

4.  x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). With non-degenerate boxes, infx(x) < supx(x) and infx(z) < supx(z). The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) combined with infx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x). Thus, W is not possible.

5.  x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) combined with infx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z). This requires infx(x) = supx(z). Also infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). If infx(x) = supx(z), then infx(z) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z). With non-degenerate boxes, supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), contradicting supx(x) <= supx(z). Thus, E is not possible.

6.  x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible as shown for W. Thus, SW is not possible.

7.  x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Neither condition is possible as shown for W and N respectively. Thus, NW is not possible.

8.  x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible as shown for E. Thus, SE is not possible.

9.  x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Neither condition is possible as shown for E and N respectively. Thus, NE is not possible.

Based on the analysis of the bounding boxes, the only possible relations between region x and region z from the given list are S and B.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, B}$.
