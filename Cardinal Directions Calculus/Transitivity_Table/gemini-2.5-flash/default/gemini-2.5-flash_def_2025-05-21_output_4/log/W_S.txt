PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be represented by `[infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
The definitions of the given single-tile cardinal relations in terms of bounding boxes are:
a B b: infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a S b: supy(a) <= infy(b) and infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a SW b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
a W b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a N b: supy(b) <= infy(a) and infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a E b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a SE b: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

We are given:
1) x W y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2) y S z:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z)

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, implying their bounding boxes are non-degenerate (infx < supx and infy < supy).

Let's derive the constraints on the bounding box of x relative to the bounding box of z.

Vertical relation between x and z:
From (1): supy(x) <= supy(y)
From (2): supy(y) <= infy(z)
Combining these, we get supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z) is always true. This means the top of the bounding box of x is below or at the bottom of the bounding box of z.

Let's check which single-tile relations between x and z are consistent with supy(x) <= infy(z):
- S (x S z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Consistent.
- SW (x SW z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Consistent.
- SE (x SE z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Consistent.
- W (x W z): infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires infy(z) <= infy(x).
- E (x E z): infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires infy(z) <= infy(x).
- B (x B z): infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires infy(z) <= infy(x).
- N (x N z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Requires z is below x vertically.
- NW (x NW z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Requires z is below x vertically.
- NE (x NE z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Requires z is below x vertically.

Check relations requiring z below x vertically (supy(z) <= infy(x)):
We have supy(x) <= infy(z) (always true).
We also have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z).
If supy(z) <= infy(x), then we have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(x) <= infy(x). For a non-degenerate bounding box of x, infy(x) < supy(x).
Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
Relations N, NE, NW are impossible.

Check relations requiring infy(z) <= infy(x) (W, E, B):
If infy(z) <= infy(x) holds, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z) (always true), we get supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(x) <= infy(x). Again, for a non-degenerate bounding box of x, infy(x) < supy(x).
Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible for non-degenerate regions given the initial conditions.
Relations W, E, B are impossible.

The only remaining possible relations based on the vertical constraint are S, SW, SE.

Horizontal relation between x and z:
From (1): supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (2): infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's check which single-tile relations between x and z are consistent with these horizontal constraints:
- W, SW, NW (x R z): supx(x) <= infx(z). Requires the right of x is left of or at the left of z.
- E, NE, SE (x R z): supx(z) <= infx(x). Requires the right of z is left of or at the left of x.
- N, S, B (x R z): infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Requires x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection.

Check relations requiring supx(z) <= infx(x) (E, NE, SE):
We know supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
Thus, supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). For a non-degenerate bounding box of x, infx(x) < supx(x).
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
Relations E, NE, SE are impossible.

This leaves only S and SW from the earlier vertical analysis. Let's check their horizontal conditions:

- S (x S z): infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we don't get a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z).
  From supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), we get supx(x) <= supx(z) (always true).
  We need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
  We have infx(z) <= infx(y). Also, infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y).
  Can infx(z) <= infx(x)? Yes. Example: infx(y)=10. infx(z)=5. supx(x)=8, infx(x)=7. (5<=7 is possible, and constraints 5<=10, 7<=8<=10 are met).
  So, the horizontal condition for S (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) is possible.
  The vertical condition for S (supy(x) <= infy(z)) is always true.
  Therefore, S is a possible relation.

- SW (x SW z): supx(x) <= infx(z).
  From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
  Can supx(x) <= infx(z)? Yes. Example: infx(y)=10. supx(x)=8. infx(z)=9. (8<=10, 9<=10, 8<=9 are met).
  So, the horizontal condition for SW (supx(x) <= infx(z)) is possible.
  The vertical condition for SW (supy(x) <= infy(z)) is always true.
  Therefore, SW is a possible relation.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box inequalities, assuming non-degenerate bounding boxes for regions homeomorphic to a disk, the only possible relations are S and SW. Relations requiring vertical overlap with z (W, E, B) or z being above x (N, NW, NE) or z being west of x (E, SE, NE) are impossible.

The possible relations are S and SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW}$.
