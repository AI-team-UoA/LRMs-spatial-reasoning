PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by its infimum and supremum on the x and y axes, denoted as `[infx(a), supx(a)]` and `[infy(a), supy(a)]`.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies that for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

We are given the relations:
1. Region x is SW of region y:
   supx(x) <= infx(y)
   supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. Region y is S of region z:
   supy(y) <= infy(z)
   infx(z) <= infx(y)
   supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z based on these conditions. Let's combine the given inequalities:

From supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), and knowing that infy(y) <= supy(y) for any region y, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
This implies supy(x) <= infy(z).

Now let's check which cardinal direction relations R(x, z) are possible given the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) and the property that regions in REG have `inf < sup`.

The cardinal direction relations are defined as follows (R(a, b)):
B: infx(b) <= infx(a) & supx(a) <= supx(b) & infy(b) <= infy(a) & supy(a) <= supy(b) (Overlap in both axes)
S: supy(a) <= infy(b) & infx(b) <= infx(a) & supx(a) <= supx(b) (a is below b, with horizontal overlap)
SW: supx(a) <= infx(b) & supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is to the south-west of b)
W: supx(a) <= infx(b) & infy(b) <= infy(a) & supy(a) <= supy(b) (a is to the west of b, with vertical overlap)
NW: supx(a) <= infx(b) & supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the north-west of b)
N: supy(b) <= infy(a) & infx(b) <= infx(a) & supx(a) <= supx(b) (a is above b, with horizontal overlap)
NE: supx(b) <= infx(a) & supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is to the north-east of b)
E: supx(b) <= infx(a) & infy(b) <= infy(a) & supy(a) <= supy(b) (a is to the east of b, with vertical overlap)
SE: supx(b) <= infx(a) & supy(a) <= infy(b) (a is to the south-east of b)

The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) means the upper bound of x's y-projection is less than or equal to the lower bound of z's y-projection.
This excludes relations where x is above z or vertically overlaps with z's bounding box in a way that requires infy(x) <= supy(z).
Specifically, it excludes:
- B: Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) for a region in REG. Impossible.
- W: Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Same as B. Impossible.
- E: Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Same as B. Impossible.
- NW: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), which implies supy(x) < supy(x), a contradiction. Impossible.
- N: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x). Same as NW. Impossible.
- NE: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x). Same as NW. Impossible.

So, the only possible relations for R(x, z) are S, SW, and SE, as these are the relations whose definitions include or are consistent with supy(x) <= infy(z). Let's check each of these:

For S(x, z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) is always true.
From the given conditions, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). Since infx(y) <= supx(y), we get supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). This means supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
So, S(x, z) is possible if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
We have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y). Since infx(x) < supx(x), we have infx(x) < infx(y). Both infx(z) and infx(x) are less than infx(y). It is possible for infx(z) to be less than or equal to infx(x). Example: infx(z)=-3, infx(x)=-2, infx(y)=-1. This satisfies infx(z)<infx(x)<infx(y). Thus, S is a possible relation.

For SW(x, z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) AND supx(x) <= infx(z).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) is always true.
So, SW(x, z) is possible if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible.
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). Both supx(x) and infx(z) are less than or equal to infx(y). It is possible for supx(x) to be less than or equal to infx(z). Example: supx(x)=-1, infx(z)=-0.5, infx(y)=0. This satisfies supx(x) < infx(z) <= infx(y). Thus, SW is a possible relation.

For SE(x, z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) AND supx(z) <= infx(x).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) is always true.
So, SE(x, z) is possible if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
We know from the S case analysis that supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true for regions in REG under these conditions.
If supx(z) <= infx(x) is true, then we have supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
However, for any region x in REG, infx(x) < supx(x).
So, supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x).
This leads to supx(x) < supx(x), which is a contradiction.
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG. Thus, SE is not a possible relation.

Based on the analysis, the only possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S and SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW}$.
