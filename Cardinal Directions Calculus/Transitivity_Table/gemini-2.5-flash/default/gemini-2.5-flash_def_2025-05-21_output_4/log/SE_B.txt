PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given conditions are:
1.  x SE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
2.  y B z: `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, `supx(y) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(y)`, `supy(y) <= supy(z)`

Regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, implying they are 2-dimensional and thus `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)` for any region a.

Let's analyze the relationships between the bounding box coordinates of x and z:

For x-coordinates:
-   From `y B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(y)`
-   From properties of bounding box: `infx(y) < supx(y)`
-   From `x SE y`: `supx(y) <= infx(x)`
-   From properties of bounding box: `infx(x) < supx(x)`
Combining these: `infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x)`.
This implies `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `infx(z) < supx(x)`.

For y-coordinates:
-   From `x SE y`: `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
-   From properties of bounding box: `infy(x) < supy(x)`
-   From `y B z`: `infy(z) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`
-   From properties of bounding box: `infy(y) < supy(y)`
Combining parts:
`infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
This implies `supy(x) <= supy(z)` and `infy(x) < supy(z)`.

Also, consider `infy(x)` relative to `infy(z)`:
We have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` and `infy(z) <= infy(y)`. Both `supy(x)` and `infy(z)` are less than or equal to `infy(y)`. Their relative position is not fixed by these inequalities alone. It is possible that `infy(z) <= supy(x)` (meaning `x` is vertically below or overlapping the bottom of `z`) or `supy(x) < infy(z)` (meaning `x` is entirely below the bottom of `z`). Since `infy(x) < supy(x)`, it is possible that `infy(x) < infy(z)`.

Consider `supx(x)` relative to `supx(z)`:
We have `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supx(y) <= supx(z)`. Both `infx(x)` and `supx(z)` are greater than or equal to `supx(y)`. Their relative position is not fixed. It is possible that `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (meaning `x` is horizontally contained within or overlapping the right side of `z`) or `supx(z) < supx(x)` (meaning `x` extends to the right of `z`).

Summary of derived inequalities:
-   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Guaranteed)
-   `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Guaranteed)
-   `infx(z) < supx(x)` (Guaranteed for 2D regions)
-   `infy(x) < supy(z)` (Guaranteed for 2D regions)

Let's check the definition of each possible relation `x R z`:
-   B: `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    -   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Yes)
    -   `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Yes)
    -   Requires `supx(x) <= supx(z)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. These are not guaranteed, but can be true in some configurations. (Example constructed in thought process). B is Possible.

-   S: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    -   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Yes)
    -   Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. These are not guaranteed, but can be true. (Example constructed in thought process). S is Possible.

-   SW: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    -   Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. This contradicts `infx(z) < supx(x)` for 2D regions. SW is Not possible.

-   W: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    -   Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. Not possible. W is Not possible.

-   NW: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    -   Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. Not possible. NW is Not possible.

-   N: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    -   Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This contradicts `infy(x) < supy(z)` for 2D regions. N is Not possible.

-   NE: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    -   Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Not possible. NE is Not possible.

-   E: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    -   `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Yes)
    -   Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. These are not guaranteed, but can be true. (Example constructed in thought process). E is Possible.

-   SE: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    -   Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. These are not guaranteed, but can be true. (Example constructed in thought process). SE is Possible.

The possible relations are B, S, E, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{B, S, E, SE}$.
