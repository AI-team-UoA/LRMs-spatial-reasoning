PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the minimum bounding box of a region $r$ be denoted by $[infx(r), supx(r)] \times [infy(r), supy(r)]$.

We are given:
1. Region x is NE of region y:
   $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$
   $supy(y) \leq infy(x)$

2. Region y is N of region z:
   $supy(z) \leq infy(y)$
   $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$
   $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z from the given set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's combine the inequalities:
From (1) and (3): $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$ and $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$.
From (2) and (4): $infx(z) \leq infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$.
Combining the x-inequalities: $infx(z) \leq infx(y) \leq supx(y) \leq infx(x)$.
This implies $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. (Let's call this A)

From (1) and (2): $supy(y) \leq infy(x)$ and $supy(z) \leq infy(y)$.
Combining the y-inequalities: $supy(z) \leq infy(y) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(x)$.
This implies $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. (Let's call this B)

Since the regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, they are closed, connected, and have a non-zero extent in both x and y directions. This means for any region $r$, $infx(r) < supx(r)$ and $infy(r) < supy(r)$.
From $supy(z) \leq infy(y) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(x)$, and knowing $infy(y) < supy(y)$ and $infy(x) < supy(x)$, we have $supy(z) < infy(x)$ unless $infy(y) = supy(y)$ or $supy(y) = infy(x)$. Since y and x are non-degenerate, $infy(y) < supy(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(x)$ implies $infy(y) < infy(x)$. Similarly, $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ and $infy(y) < supy(y)$ implies $supy(z) < supy(y)$.
Thus, $supy(z) \leq infy(y) < supy(y) \leq infy(x) < supy(x)$.
This gives us the strict inequality $supy(z) < infy(x)$ and $supy(Z) < supy(X)$.

Now let's check the possible relations between x and z based on their definitions:

-   **S(x, z):** $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$. This contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **SW(x, z):** $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ and $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$. This contradicts $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$ (unless $infx(z) = supx(x)$ which combined with $infx(z) \le infx(x) < supx(x)$ is impossible for non-degenerate regions) and $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **SE(x, z):** $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \leq infy(z)$. This contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **W(x, z):** $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$, $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$. This contradicts $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$ and $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **NW(x, z):** $supx(x) \leq infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$. This contradicts $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$. Impossible.
-   **E(x, z):** $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$. The condition $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$ contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   **B(x, z):** $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$, $infy(z) \leq infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$. The condition $supy(x) \leq supy(z)$ contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. Impossible.

Based on the strict inequality $supy(z) < infy(x)$, which implies X is always above Z vertically or touching at the bottom boundary of X and top boundary of Z, only N, NE, E, W, NW are potentially possible. We have already ruled out E, W, NW based on the derived inequalities.

Let's check N and NE again.

-   **N(x, z):** $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$, $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$.
    We know $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$ (B) and $infx(z) \leq infx(x)$ (A) are always true. We need to check if $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$ is possible.
    We know $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$ and $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$. It is possible to have a configuration where $supx(x) \leq supx(z)$.
    Example: Z=[0,10]x[0,5], Y=[4,6]x[6,7], X=[6,10]x[8,9].
    Y N Z: supy(Z)=5 <= infy(Y)=6 (T), infx(Z)=0 <= infx(Y)=4 (T), supx(Y)=6 <= supx(Z)=10 (T). Holds.
    X NE Y: supx(Y)=6 <= infx(X)=6 (T), supy(Y)=7 <= infy(X)=8 (T). Holds.
    X N Z: supy(Z)=5 <= infy(X)=8 (T), infx(Z)=0 <= infx(X)=6 (T), supx(X)=10 <= supx(Z)=10 (T). Holds.
    So N is a possible relation.

-   **NE(x, z):** $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$, $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$.
    We know $supy(z) \leq infy(x)$ (B) is always true. We need to check if $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$ is possible.
    We know $supx(y) \leq supx(z)$ and $supx(y) \leq infx(x)$. It is possible to have a configuration where $supx(z) \leq infx(x)$.
    Example: Z=[0,7]x[0,4], Y=[5,6]x[5,6], X=[7,8]x[7,8].
    Y N Z: supy(Z)=4 <= infy(Y)=5 (T), infx(Z)=0 <= infx(Y)=5 (T), supx(Y)=6 <= supx(Z)=7 (T). Holds.
    X NE Y: supx(Y)=6 <= infx(X)=7 (T), supy(Y)=6 <= infy(X)=7 (T). Holds.
    X NE Z: supx(Z)=7 <= infx(X)=7 (T), supy(Z)=4 <= infy(X)=7 (T). Holds.
    So NE is a possible relation.

All other relations were ruled out based on the derived inequalities and the properties of regions in REG.

The possible relations between region x and region z are N and NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE}$.
