PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are:
1.  `x SW y`
2.  `y E z`

The definitions based on bounding boxes are:
-   `infx(a)`: greatest lower bound of a on x-axis
-   `supx(a)`: least upper bound of a on x-axis
-   `infy(a)`: greatest lower bound of a on y-axis
-   `supy(a)`: least upper bound of a on y-axis

-   `a SW b` if `supx(a) <= infx(b)` and `supy(a) <= infy(b)`.
-   `a E b` if `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)` and `supy(a) <= supy(b)`.

Applying these to the given relations:
From `x SW y`:
(1) `supx(x) <= infx(y)`
(2) `supy(x) <= infy(y)`

From `y E z`:
(3) `supx(z) <= infx(y)`
(4) `infy(z) <= infy(y)`
(5) `supy(y) <= supy(z)`

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`. Thus, `infy(y) < supy(y)`.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the possible relative positions of their bounding boxes based on the combined constraints.

Consider the y-coordinates:
From (2), `supy(x) <= infy(y)`. This means region x is entirely below or aligned with the bottom edge of region y.
From (4), `infy(z) <= infy(y)`. This means the bottom edge of region z is below or aligned with the bottom edge of region y.
From (5), `supy(y) <= supy(z)`. This means region y is entirely below or aligned with the top edge of region z.

Let's consider the vertical relationship between x and z.
Case 1: x is North of z (`supy(z) <= infy(x)`).
If this holds, combining with (5) gives `supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This implies `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
From (2), we have `supy(x) <= infy(y)`.
So, we must simultaneously satisfy `supy(x) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
Since `infy(y) < supy(y)` for a region in REG, these two conditions imply `supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
This sequence requires `supy(x) < infy(x)`.
However, for any valid region in REG, `infy(x) < supy(x)`.
The condition `supy(x) < infy(x)` contradicts `infy(x) < supy(x)`.
Therefore, the relation `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is impossible under the given constraints. This rules out N, NW, and NE relations between x and z.

Case 2: x is South of z (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`).
Can we satisfy this? From (2), `supy(x) <= infy(y)`. From (4), `infy(z) <= infy(y)`. From (5), `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
We need `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
Let's check for compatibility with the initial constraints. We need to find `infy(x), supy(x), infy(y), supy(y), infy(z), supy(z)` values such that:
`infy(x) < supy(x)`, `infy(y) < supy(y)`, `infy(z) < supy(z)` (REG property)
`supy(x) <= infy(y)` (2)
`infy(z) <= infy(y)` (4)
`supy(y) <= supy(z)` (5)
`supy(x) <= infy(z)` (x S z condition)
Let `infy(y) = 10`, `supy(y) = 12`.
From (2), `supy(x) <= 10`. Let `supy(x) = 8`. (Requires `infy(x) <= 8`, let `infy(x) = 7`).
From (4), `infy(z) <= 10`. Let `infy(z) = 9`.
From (5), `12 <= supy(z)`. Let `supy(z) = 15`. (Requires `infy(z) <= 15`, 9 <= 15).
Check `supy(x) <= infy(z)`: `8 <= 9`. Yes.
All conditions are satisfied for this example. So, x S z is possible.

Case 3: x and z overlap or align vertically, not strictly North or South.
The definition of B, W, E, S, N relations include conditions on vertical or horizontal containment/alignment.
For B, W, E relations, the y-condition is `infy(b) <= infy(a)` and `supy(a) <= supy(b)`. (a contains b vertically). For x R z, this is `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
Let's check if this is compatible with the initial constraints.
From (2), `supy(x) <= infy(y)`.
From (4), `infy(z) <= infy(y)`.
From (5), `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
We need `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
Let `infy(y) = 10`, `supy(y) = 12`.
From (2), `supy(x) <= 10`. Let `supy(x) = 8`. (Requires `infy(x) <= 8`). Let `infy(x) = 6`.
From (4), `infy(z) <= 10`. Let `infy(z) = 5`.
From (5), `12 <= supy(z)`. Let `supy(z) = 15`.
Check `infy(z) <= infy(x)`: `5 <= 6`. Yes.
Check `supy(x) <= supy(z)`: `8 <= 15`. Yes.
All conditions are satisfied for this example. So, vertical containment (z contains x) is possible.

So, the possible vertical relationships between x and z are:
-   x is South of z (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`)
-   z contains x vertically (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)`)

Now consider the x-coordinates:
From (1), `supx(x) <= infx(y)`.
From (3), `supx(z) <= infx(y)`.
Let `infx(y) = 10`. `supx(x) <= 10` and `supx(z) <= 10`.
Both region x and region z are entirely to the west of or aligned with the left edge of region y.
This places no restriction on the horizontal relationship between x and z themselves. Any horizontal relationship between x and z is possible as long as both are west of `infx(y)`.
-   x is West of z (`supx(x) <= infx(z)`). Possible. Example: `infx(y)=10`. `supx(x)=5`, `infx(z)=7`. (5 <= 7, 7 <= 10).
-   x is East of z (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`). Possible. Example: `infx(y)=10`. `supx(z)=5`, `infx(x)=7`. (5 <= 7, 7 <= 10).
-   x and z overlap or contain each other horizontally (`infx(z) <= supx(x)` AND `infx(x) <= supx(z)`). Possible. Example: `infx(y)=10`. `infx(z)=4, supx(z)=9, infx(x)=5, supx(x)=8`. (8 <= 10, 9 <= 10, 4 <= 8, 5 <= 9).

Now we combine the possible vertical relationships with the possible horizontal relationships using the definitions of the 9 tiles:

Combining "x is South of z" (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`) with horizontal possibilities:
-   `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (x W z): `supy(x) <= infy(z)` AND `supx(x) <= infx(z)` -> SW. Possible.
-   `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (x E z): `supy(x) <= infy(z)` AND `supx(z) <= infx(x)` -> SE. Possible.
-   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (z contains x horizontally): `supy(x) <= infy(z)` AND `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)` -> S. Possible.

Combining "z contains x vertically" (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)`) with horizontal possibilities:
-   `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (x W z): `infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)` AND `supx(x) <= infx(z)` -> W. Possible.
-   `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (x E z): `infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)` AND `supx(z) <= infx(x)` -> E. Possible.
-   `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (z contains x horizontally): `infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)` AND `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)` -> B. Possible.

The relations N, NW, and NE require the vertical relationship `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, which we found to be impossible given the initial constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are B, S, SW, W, E, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{B, S, SW, W, E, SE}$.
