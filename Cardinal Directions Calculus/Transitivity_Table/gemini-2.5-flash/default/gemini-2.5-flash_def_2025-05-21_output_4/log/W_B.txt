PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are:
1.  x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
2.  y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's analyze the relations between the bounds of x and z.

From the y-conditions in x W y and y B z:
infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
Combining these, we get: infy(z) <= infy(x)

supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)
Combining these, we get: supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, for any region x satisfying x W y and any region z satisfying y B z, the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now let's look at the definitions of the cardinal direction relations for x and z:
-   R is S, SW, SE if supy(x) <= infy(z). We derived infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) implies infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). For regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, the infimum and supremum of a projection must be different (infy < supy). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible for non-degenerate regions. So S, SW, SE are not possible relations between x and z.
-   R is N, NW, NE if supy(z) <= infy(x). We derived infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) implies infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(y) = supy(z). This implies zero y-extent for x, y, and z, which is not allowed. So N, NW, NE are not possible relations between x and z.

Based on the y-conditions, the only possible relations between x and z are those whose y-conditions are infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). These relations are B, W, and E.

Now let's examine the x-conditions for these remaining relations:

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We have:
    supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
    infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
    supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
    Can we find regions x, y, z in REG such that infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), x W y and y B z?
    Let x = [5, 6] x [5, 6]
    Let y = [10, 11] x [4, 7]
    Let z = [4, 12] x [3, 8]
    Check x W y: supx(x)=6 <= infx(y)=10 (T), infy(y)=4 <= infy(x)=5 (T), supy(x)=6 <= supy(y)=7 (T). Holds.
    Check y B z: infx(z)=4 <= infx(y)=10 (T), supx(y)=11 <= supx(z)=12 (T), infy(z)=3 <= infy(y)=4 (T), supy(y)=7 <= supy(z)=8 (T). Holds.
    Check x B z: infx(z)=4 <= infx(x)=5 (T), supx(x)=6 <= supx(z)=12 (T), infy(z)=3 <= infy(x)=5 (T), supy(x)=6 <= supy(z)=8 (T). Holds.
    Since we found an example where x B z is true, B is a possible relation.

-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z).
    Can we find regions x, y, z in REG such that supx(x) <= infx(z), x W y and y B z?
    Let x = [0, 1] x [5, 6]
    Let y = [10, 11] x [5, 6]
    Let z = [5, 12] x [4, 7]
    Check x W y: supx(x)=1 <= infx(y)=10 (T), infy(y)=5 <= infy(x)=5 (T), supy(x)=6 <= supy(y)=6 (T). Holds.
    Check y B z: infx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=10 (T), supx(y)=11 <= supx(z)=12 (T), infy(z)=4 <= infy(y)=5 (T), supy(y)=6 <= supy(z)=7 (T). Holds.
    Check x W z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=5 (T), infy(z)=4 <= infy(x)=5 (T), supy(x)=6 <= supy(z)=7 (T). Holds.
    Since we found an example where x W z is true, W is a possible relation.

-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x).
    We have supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z) and supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y).
    Also infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y).
    If supx(z) <= infx(x) were possible, then supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). So supx(y) <= infx(x).
    We also have supx(x) <= infx(y).
    This implies supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(y).
    However, from y B z, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). This means infx(y) < supx(y) (as y has positive x-extent).
    So we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y).
    This implies supx(x) < supx(y) <= infx(x).
    So supx(x) < infx(x). This means x has zero or negative x-extent, which is impossible for a region in REG.
    Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible, and x E z is not a possible relation.

The possible relations are B and W.

B, W
