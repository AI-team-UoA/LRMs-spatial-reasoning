PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. We are given the following relations based on their minimum bounding boxes (BB):

1.  x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
2.  y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the relationships between the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

From (1) and (2), we can combine inequalities:

Horizontal relations:
*   infx(x) >= supx(y) (from 1)
*   supx(y) <= supx(z) (from 2)
    These two inequalities together (infx(x) >= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)) do not provide a necessary relation between infx(x) and supx(z). infx(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than supx(z).
*   infx(y) >= infx(z) (from 2)
*   From infx(x) >= supx(y) and supx(y) >= infx(y) (since supx >= infx for regions with area), and infx(y) >= infx(z), we get infx(x) >= infx(y) >= infx(z). Thus, **infx(x) >= infx(z)**. (The left edge of BB(x) is at or to the right of the left edge of BB(z)).
*   There is no direct necessary relation derived for supx(x) relative to infx(z) or supx(z).

Vertical relations:
*   infy(x) >= infy(y) (from 1)
*   infy(y) >= supy(z) (from 2)
    Combining these, we get **infy(x) >= supy(z)**. (The bottom edge of BB(x) is at or above the top edge of BB(z)).
*   supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 1)
*   From infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(y) > infy(y) (for regions with area), we get supy(y) > supy(z).
*   Combining supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) > supy(z), we get supy(x) < supy(y). supy(x) can be less than, equal to, or greater than supy(z).

Now let's check which cardinal relations between x and z are possible based on these necessary conditions (infx(x) >= infx(z) and infy(x) >= supy(z)) and the definitions:

A relation 'a R b' is possible if there exist regions x, y, z in REG satisfying the premises (x E y, y N z) and the conditions for 'x R z'.

1.  x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived infy(x) >= supy(z). Since regions in REG have area, supy(z) > infy(z) and supy(x) > infy(x).
    If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This gives supy(x) < supy(x), a contradiction. Thus, **supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible**.
    Therefore, S is impossible.

2.  x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We derived infx(x) >= infx(z). For regions with area, supx(x) > infx(x). So supx(x) > infx(z). Thus, **supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible**.
    We also showed supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, SW is impossible.

3.  x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, W is impossible.

4.  x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(a).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, NW is impossible.

5.  x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(a) <= infy(b).
    We derived supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, SE is impossible.

6.  x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We derived infy(x) >= supy(z), and supy(z) > infy(z), so infy(x) > infy(z), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x) is true.
    supy(x) <= supy(z) is impossible (as shown for S).
    Therefore, E is impossible.

7.  x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    infx(z) <= infx(x) is true.
    infy(z) <= infy(x) is true.
    supy(x) <= supy(z) is impossible.
    Therefore, B is impossible.

The only remaining possible relations are N and NE. Let's check if they are indeed possible by construction.

8.  x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is true.
    infx(z) <= infx(x) is true.
    We need to check if supx(x) <= supx(z) is possible.
    Example: BB(z) = [0, 4] x [-1, 0], BB(y) = [1, 3] x [1, 2], BB(x) = [3, 4] x [1, 2].
    y N z: supy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=1 (T), infx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=1 (T), supx(y)=3 <= supx(z)=4 (T). Yes.
    x E y: infx(x)=3 >= supx(y)=3 (T), infy(x)=1 >= infy(y)=1 (T), supy(x)=2 <= supy(y)=2 (T). Yes.
    Check x N z: supy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=1 (T), infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=3 (T), supx(x)=4 <= supx(z)=4 (T). Yes.
    Therefore, N is possible.

9.  x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is true.
    We need to check if supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
    Example: BB(z) = [0, 1] x [-2, -1], BB(y) = [0, 1] x [0, 1], BB(x) = [1.5, 2.5] x [0, 1].
    y N z: supy(z)=-1 <= infy(y)=0 (T), infx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=0 (T), supx(y)=1 <= supx(z)=1 (T). Yes.
    x E y: infx(x)=1.5 >= supx(y)=1 (T), infy(x)=0 >= infy(y)=0 (T), supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (T). Yes.
    Check x NE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=1.5 (T), supy(z)=-1 <= infy(x)=0 (T). Yes.
    Therefore, NE is possible.

The possible relations are N and NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE}$.
