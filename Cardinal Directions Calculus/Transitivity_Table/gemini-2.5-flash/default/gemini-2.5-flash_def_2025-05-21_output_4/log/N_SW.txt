PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given information is:
1) x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2) y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's denote infx(a) as ix(a), supx(a) as sx(a), infy(a) as iy(a), and supy(a) as sy(a).

From (1):
sy(y) <= iy(x)  (i)
ix(y) <= ix(x)  (ii)
sx(x) <= sx(y)  (iii)

From (2):
sx(y) <= ix(z)  (iv)
sy(y) <= iy(z)  (v)

Combining (iii) and (iv), we get:
sx(x) <= sx(y) <= ix(z)
This implies:
sx(x) <= ix(z)  (vi)

This inequality tells us that the right edge of the bounding box of x is to the left of or touching the left edge of the bounding box of z. This is a crucial constraint on the horizontal relationship between x and z.

Let's examine the definitions of the possible relations between x and z based on their bounding boxes:

x B z: ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z)
x S z: sy(x) <= iy(z), ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z)
x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(x) <= iy(z)
x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z)
x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(z) <= iy(x)
x N z: sy(z) <= iy(x), ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z)
x NE z: sx(z) <= ix(x), sy(z) <= iy(x)
x E z: sx(z) <= ix(x), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z)
x SE z: sx(z) <= ix(x), sy(x) <= iy(z)

Now let's check which of these are compatible with the derived constraint (vi) sx(x) <= ix(z). Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, meaning their bounding boxes have non-zero width (ix < sx) and height (iy < sy).

- **B**: Requires ix(z) <= ix(x) and sx(x) <= sx(z). Combined with sx(x) <= ix(z), we get sx(x) <= ix(z) <= ix(x). Since ix(x) < sx(x) for a valid region, this implies ix(x) = sx(x) = ix(z), which is impossible for a non-degenerate region. So B is not possible.
- **S**: Requires ix(z) <= ix(x) and sx(x) <= sx(z). Similar to B, this implies ix(x) = sx(x) = ix(z), impossible. So S is not possible.
- **N**: Requires ix(z) <= ix(x) and sx(x) <= sx(z). Similar to B, this implies ix(x) = sx(x) = ix(z), impossible. So N is not possible.
- **E**: Requires sx(z) <= ix(x). Combined with sx(x) <= ix(z), we get sx(x) <= ix(z) and sx(z) <= ix(x). For non-degenerate regions, ix(x) < sx(x) and ix(z) < sx(z). If sx(x) < ix(z) and sx(z) < ix(x), this implies the interval [ix(x), sx(x)] is to the left of [ix(z), sx(z)], and [ix(z), sx(z)] is to the left of [ix(x), sx(x)], a contradiction. Equality is possible only if sx(x) = ix(z) and sx(z) = ix(x). This means the intervals are identical, [a, b] = [c, d] where b=c and d=a. This implies a=b=c=d, impossible for non-degenerate regions. So E is not possible.
- **NE**: Requires sx(z) <= ix(x). Similar to E, this contradicts sx(x) <= ix(z). So NE is not possible.
- **SE**: Requires sx(z) <= ix(x). Similar to E, this contradicts sx(x) <= ix(z). So SE is not possible.

This leaves SW, W, and NW as the only possible relations, as their definitions include or are consistent with the constraint sx(x) <= ix(z). Let's confirm if each of these is actually possible by constructing an example.

Recall the constraints from the premises:
sy(y) <= iy(x)  (i)
ix(y) <= ix(x)  (ii)
sx(x) <= sx(y)  (iii)
sx(y) <= ix(z)  (iv)
sy(y) <= iy(z)  (v)
Derived: sx(x) <= ix(z) (vi)

We can use disk-like regions (e.g., disks themselves) for construction, as they belong to REG. Let y be the unit disk centered at (0,0), so ix(y)=-1, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=-1, sy(y)=1.

(i) 1 <= iy(x)
(ii) -1 <= ix(x)
(iii) sx(x) <= 1
(iv) 1 <= ix(z)
(v) 1 <= iy(z)
(vi) sx(x) <= ix(z)

- **SW (x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(x) <= iy(z))**:
  We need to check if sy(x) <= iy(z) is possible along with the initial conditions.
  Choose x as a disk centered at (0, 1.5) with radius 0.5. Bbox [-0.5, 0.5]x[1, 2].
  ix(x)=-0.5, sx(x)=0.5, iy(x)=1, sy(x)=2.
  (i) 1 <= 1 (T), (ii) -1 <= -0.5 (T), (iii) 0.5 <= 1 (T). x N y holds.
  Choose z as a disk centered at (2.5, 2.5) with radius 0.5. Bbox [2, 3]x[2, 3].
  ix(z)=2, sx(z)=3, iy(z)=2, sy(z)=3.
  (iv) 1 <= 2 (T), (v) 1 <= 2 (T). y SW z holds.
  Check x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) (0.5 <= 2, T), sy(x) <= iy(z) (2 <= 2, T). SW is possible.

- **W (x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z))**:
  We need to check if iy(z) <= iy(x) and sy(x) <= sy(z) are possible.
  Choose x as a disk centered at (0, 2) with radius 1. Bbox [-1, 1]x[1, 3].
  ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=1, iy(x)=1, sy(x)=3.
  (i) 1 <= 1 (T), (ii) -1 <= -1 (T), (iii) 1 <= 1 (T). x N y holds.
  Choose z as a disk centered at (3, 2) with radius 1. Bbox [2, 4]x[1, 3].
  ix(z)=2, sx(z)=4, iy(z)=1, sy(z)=3.
  (iv) 1 <= 2 (T), (v) 1 <= 1 (T). y SW z holds.
  Check x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z) (1 <= 2, T), iy(z) <= iy(x) (1 <= 1, T), sy(x) <= sy(z) (3 <= 3, T). W is possible.

- **NW (x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(z) <= iy(x))**:
  We need to check if sy(z) <= iy(x) is possible.
  Choose x as a disk centered at (0, 2) with radius 1. Bbox [-1, 1]x[1, 3].
  ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=1, iy(x)=1, sy(x)=3.
  (i) 1 <= 1 (T), (ii) -1 <= -1 (T), (iii) 1 <= 1 (T). x N y holds.
  Choose z as a disk centered at (3, 0) with radius 1. Bbox [2, 4]x[-1, 1].
  ix(z)=2, sx(z)=4, iy(z)=-1, sy(z)=1.
  (iv) 1 <= 2 (T), (v) 1 <= -1 (F). y SW z does NOT hold for this z.

Let's retry NW construction with y SW z holding (1 <= ix(z), 1 <= iy(z)) and sy(z) <= iy(x).
y=[-1,1]x[-1,1].
x N y: iy(x) >= 1, ix(x) >= -1, sx(x) <= 1.
y SW z: ix(z) >= 1, iy(z) >= 1.
Need x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z), sy(z) <= iy(x).
Let x be a disk centered at (0, 3), radius 1. Bbox [-1, 1]x[2, 4]. iy(x)=2, sy(x)=4.
(i) 1 <= 2 (T), (ii) -1 <= -1 (T), (iii) 1 <= 1 (T). x N y holds.
Let z be a disk centered at (3, 2), radius 1. Bbox [2, 4]x[1, 3]. ix(z)=2, iy(z)=1, sy(z)=3.
(iv) 1 <= 2 (T), (v) 1 <= 1 (T). y SW z holds.
Check x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) (1 <= 2, T), sy(z) <= iy(x) (3 <= 2, F). Failed.

Let's try to make sy(z) <= iy(x).
x N y: iy(x) >= sy(y).
y SW z: iy(z) >= sy(y).
Need sy(z) <= iy(x).
Choose sy(y) = 0 (e.g., y is the interval [-1,1] on the x-axis, but y must be in REG, so y is a thin ellipse). Let y's bbox be [-1,1]x[-0.1, 0.1]. sy(y)=0.1.
x N y: iy(x) >= 0.1, ix(x) >= -1, sx(x) <= 1.
y SW z: ix(z) >= 1, iy(z) >= 0.1.
Need sx(x) <= ix(z) (already derived) and sy(z) <= iy(x).

Let y be disk at (0,0), [-1,1]x[-1,1]. sy(y)=1.
x N y: iy(x) >= 1, ix(x) >= -1, sx(x) <= 1.
y SW z: ix(z) >= 1, iy(z) >= 1.
Need sy(z) <= iy(x).
Let iy(x) = 3. For disk x, if sx(x)-ix(x)=2, sy(x)-iy(x)=2, so sy(x)=5. x: [-1,1]x[3,5].
Let iy(z) = 1. For disk z, if sx(z)-ix(z)=2, sy(z)-iy(z)=2, so sy(z)=3. ix(z)=2, sx(z)=4. z: [2,4]x[1,3].
x N y: 1 <= 3 (T), -1 <= -1 (T), 1 <= 1 (T). Holds.
y SW z: 1 <= 2 (T), 1 <= 1 (T). Holds.
x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) (1 <= 2, T), sy(z) <= iy(x) (3 <= 3, T). Holds. NW is possible.

The possible relations are SW, W, NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW, W, NW}$.
