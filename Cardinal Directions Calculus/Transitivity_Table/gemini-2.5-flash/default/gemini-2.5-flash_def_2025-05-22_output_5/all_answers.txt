For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), and supy(a) denote the bounds of the projection of a region a on the x and y axes, respectively. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies that for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

The definitions of the relations are given as:
a N b <=> supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
a S b <=> supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
a W b <=> supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
a E b <=> supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b <=> supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
a NE b <=> supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
a SW b <=> supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
a SE b <=> supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)
a B b <=> infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)

We are given:
1. x N y:
   (1) supy(y) <= infy(x)
   (2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
   (3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. y N z:
   (4) supy(z) <= infy(y)
   (5) infx(z) <= infx(y)
   (6) supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations R between x and z (x R z).

Combine the y-inequalities:
From (4) and (1): supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Since infy(y) <= supy(y) for any region, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x). This is the North condition in the y-direction.
Also, using infy(z) <= supy(z) and infy(x) <= supy(x), the chain becomes infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
This implies infy(z) <= infy(x).

Combine the x-inequalities:
From (5) and (2): infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x). Thus, infx(z) <= infx(x).
From (3) and (6): supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). Thus, supx(x) <= supx(z).
The conditions infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) together mean the projection of x on the x-axis, [infx(x), supx(x)], is contained within or equal to the projection of z on the x-axis, [infx(z), supx(z)].

So, from x N y and y N z, we derive the following necessary conditions for x R z:
(A) supy(z) <= infy(x)
(B) infx(z) <= infx(x)
(C) supx(x) <= supx(z)
(D) infy(z) <= infy(x) (derived from infy(z) <= supy(z) and (A))

Let's check which relations R are possible for x R z given these conditions, remembering that for regions in REG, infx < supx and infy < supy.

1.  x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    These are exactly conditions (A), (B), and (C). All are derived from x N y and y N z.
    Thus, x N z is always true if x N y and y N z hold. N is a possible relation.

2.  x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Conditions (B) and (C) are met. We need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
    From the combined y-chain: infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
    If supy(x) <= infy(z), then infy(z) <= ... <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This implies infy(z) = supy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y) = infy(x) = supy(x). This means the y-projections of x, y, and z are all points at the same y-coordinate. This contradicts infy < supy for regions in REG. Thus, S is not possible.

3.  x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Condition (D) is met. We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From the combined x-chain: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
    If supx(x) <= infx(z), then infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). This implies infx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x). This means the x-projection of x is a point. This contradicts infx < supx for regions in REG. Thus, W is not possible.

4.  x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Condition (D) is met. We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From the combined x-chain: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
    If supx(z) <= infx(x), then infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(y) = supx(z). This means the x-projections of x, y, z are points, or x is a point and supx(y)=supx(z)=infx(x). This contradicts infx < supx for regions in REG. Thus, E is not possible.

5.  x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition (A) is met. supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for regions, as shown for W. Thus, NW is not possible.

6.  x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition (A) is met. supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible for regions, as shown for E. Thus, NE is not possible.

7.  x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Neither supx(x) <= infx(z) nor supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible for regions, as shown for W and S. Thus, SW is not possible.

8.  x SE z: supx(b) <= infx(a) (supx(z) <= infx(x)), supy(a) <= infy(b) (supy(x) <= infy(z)).
    Neither supx(z) <= infx(x) nor supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible for regions, as shown for E and S. Thus, SE is not possible.

9.  x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Conditions (B), (C), and (D) are met. We need supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From the combined y-chain: infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
    If supy(x) <= supy(z), then infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Combining with the rest of the chain: infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).
    This implies infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This requires infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y). This means the y-projections of x and y are points, and these points are equal to supy(z). This contradicts infy < supy for regions in REG. Thus, B is not possible.

Based on the definitions provided and the constraint that regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (implying non-degenerate projections), the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.

The final answer is $\boxed{N}$.
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Based on the definitions provided:
x N y means: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y).
y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these inequalities:
From supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we get supx(x) <= infx(z).
This inequality means the right edge of x's bounding box is to the left of or touching the left edge of z's bounding box. This condition is part of the definitions for W, NW, and SW. It is generally incompatible with N, NE, E, SE, S, and B for regions with non-zero extent (as supx > infx). For example, N requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= infx(x), which is only possible for a point region. Since regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk, they have extent, so supx > infx. Thus, N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are not possible relations between x and z.

From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), and knowing that infy(y) < supy(y) for a region with extent, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) < infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom edge of z's bounding box is below or touching the bottom edge of x's bounding box.

We are left with possible relations W, NW, SW:
W (x W z): supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
NW (x NW z): supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
SW (x SW z): supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).

We have proven supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) are necessary conditions.

Let's check if SW is possible:
SW requires supy(x) <= infy(z).
From the premise, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
So, supy(x) <= infy(z) implies supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y).
We also have infy(y) < supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Thus, infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(x) < infy(x), which is impossible for a region with extent (infy < supy).
Therefore, SW is not a possible relation.

Let's check if W is possible:
W requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
We know the first two are necessary. We need to check if supy(x) <= supy(z) can occur.
Consider regions with the following bounding boxes:
y = [0, 1] x [0, 1] (infx_y=0, supx_y=1, infy_y=0, supy_y=1)
x = [0, 1] x [1.1, 2] (infx_x=0, supx_x=1, infy_x=1.1, supy_x=2)
Check x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) (1 <= 1.1, True), infx(y) <= infx(x) (0 <= 0, True), supx(x) <= supx(y) (1 <= 1, True). x N y holds.
z = [2, 3] x [-0.5, 2] (infx_z=2, supx_z=3, infy_z=-0.5, supy_z=2)
Check y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z) (1 <= 2, True), infy(z) <= infy(y) (-0.5 <= 0, True), supy(y) <= supy(z) (1 <= 2, True). y W z holds.
Now check x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (1 <= 2, True), infy(z) <= infy(x) (-0.5 <= 1.1, True), supy(x) <= supy(z) (2 <= 2, True). x W z holds.
So W is a possible relation.

Let's check if NW is possible:
NW requires supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is necessary. We need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) can occur.
Consider regions with the following bounding boxes:
y = [0, 1] x [0, 1] (infx_y=0, supx_y=1, infy_y=0, supy_y=1)
x = [0, 1] x [2, 3] (infx_x=0, supx_x=1, infy_x=2, supy_x=3)
Check x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) (1 <= 2, True), infx(y) <= infx(x) (0 <= 0, True), supx(x) <= supx(y) (1 <= 1, True). x N y holds.
z = [2, 3] x [-0.5, 1.5] (infx_z=2, supx_z=3, infy_z=-0.5, supy_z=1.5)
Check y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z) (1 <= 2, True), infy(z) <= infy(y) (-0.5 <= 0, True), supy(y) <= supy(z) (1 <= 1.5, True). y W z holds.
Now check x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (1 <= 2, True), supy(z) <= infy(x) (1.5 <= 2, True). x NW z holds.
So NW is a possible relation.

It is also possible that neither W nor NW holds. This happens if supy(x) > supy(z) AND supy(z) > infy(x), while supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) hold.
Example bounding boxes: x=[0,1]x[3,5], y=[0,1]x[2,2.5], z=[2,3]x[1,4].
x N y holds, y W z holds.
For x and z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True), infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=3 (True).
W requires supy(x) <= supy(z) (5 <= 4, False).
NW requires supy(z) <= infy(x) (4 <= 3, False).
In this case, neither W nor NW holds. However, the question asks for the *possible* relations, meaning the relations that *could* hold in *some* valid configuration.

We have shown that W is possible and NW is possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, NW}$.
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The given conditions are:
1) x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2) y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's analyze the bounding box coordinates:
infx(x), supx(x), infy(x), supy(x) for region x
infx(z), supx(z), infy(z), supy(z) for region z

From (1) and (2), combining the x-coordinates:
supx(z) <= infx(y) (from 2)
infx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1)
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x).

From (1) and (2), combining the y-coordinates:
infy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2)
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1)
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). Therefore, infy(z) <= infy(x).

Also, supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 2).

For any non-degenerate region homeomorphic to a disk, we have infx < supx and infy < supy.

Let's check which single-tile relations are possible for x and z, based on the definitions and the derived inequalities:

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). For non-degenerate regions, infx(x) < supx(x), so supx(x) <= infx(x) is impossible. Thus, B is not possible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x). Thus infy(z) < supy(x). The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible. S is not possible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
We know supy(x) > infy(z). The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible. SW is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). So supx(z) < supx(x). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(z). This implies supx(z) < infx(z), which is impossible for non-degenerate regions. W is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(a) -> should be supy(b) <= infy(a), so supy(z) <= infy(x).
We know supx(x) > supx(z) >= infx(y) >= supx(z). And supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). So supx(x) > supx(z).
The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) implies supx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(z), meaning supx(z) < infx(z), which is impossible. NW is not possible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(a) -> should be supx(b) <= infx(a), so supx(z) <= infx(x). supy(a) <= infy(b) -> should be supy(x) <= infy(z).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is true. We know supy(x) > infy(z) is true. The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible. SE is not possible.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). So supx(z) < supx(x). The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is impossible for non-degenerate regions. N is not possible.

This leaves NE and E. Let's check if these are possible. We know supx(z) <= infx(x) must hold (x is to the East of or touching z's right boundary). This is the x-condition for NE and E.

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is true. Is supy(z) <= infy(x) possible?
We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). It is possible for infy(x) to be greater than or equal to supy(z).
Example: Let supy(y)=5, infy(x)=10, supy(z)=6. This satisfies supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We can construct regions satisfying this. Thus, NE is a possible relation.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is true.
We derived infy(z) <= infy(x). This part of the condition is always true for non-degenerate regions.
Is supy(x) <= supy(z) possible?
We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
Can supy(x) <= supy(z)? Yes.
Example: Let infy(z)=0, infy(y)=1, supy(y)=2, supy(z)=4. (0<=1, 2<=4).
Let infy(x)=2, supy(x)=3. (supy(y)<=infy(x) -> 2<=2, infy(x)<supy(x) -> 2<3).
In this example, supy(x)=3, supy(z)=4. supy(x) <= supy(z) (3<=4). This is possible.
We can construct regions satisfying all conditions for E. Thus, E is a possible relation.

Based on the analysis for non-degenerate regions, only NE and E are possible single-tile relations.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, E}$.
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: N, S, B
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: NW, W, SW
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: NE, SE, E
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: Based on the provided definitions and the given relations:
1.  x N y if and only if supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).
2.  y NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y).

We need to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the implications of the given relations on the bounding boxes of x and z.

From x N y:
(C1) infy(x) >= supy(y)
(C2) infx(x) >= infx(y)
(C3) supx(x) <= supx(y)
Conditions (C2) and (C3) together mean that the horizontal projection of x is contained within the horizontal projection of y: [infx(x), supx(x)] is a subset of [infx(y), supx(y)].

From y NE z:
(C4) infx(y) >= supx(z)
(C5) infy(y) >= supy(z)

Now, let's derive the relationship between the bounding box of x and the bounding box of z.

Vertical relationship:
From (C1), infy(x) >= supy(y).
Since y is a region homeomorphic to a disk, its bounding box has positive height, so supy(y) > infy(y).
From (C5), infy(y) >= supy(z).
Combining these inequalities: infy(x) >= supy(y) > infy(y) >= supy(z).
Thus, infy(x) > supy(z). This means the bottom edge of x's bounding box is strictly above the top edge of z's bounding box.
Also, since x is a region, supy(x) >= infy(x). Thus, supy(x) >= infy(x) > supy(z). So supy(x) > supy(z).
And supy(z) >= infy(z) (since z is a region). So infy(x) > supy(z) >= infy(z), which means infy(x) > infy(z).
Also supy(x) > supy(z) >= infy(z), which means supy(x) > infy(z).

Horizontal relationship:
From (C2), infx(x) >= infx(y).
From (C4), infx(y) >= supx(z).
Combining these inequalities: infx(x) >= infx(y) >= supx(z).
Thus, infx(x) >= supx(z). This means the left edge of x's bounding box is at or to the East of the right edge of z's bounding box.

Now let's check which single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z are possible based on these derived conditions: infx(x) >= supx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z).

Let's examine the definitions for x R z:
-   **S:** supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts our finding supy(x) > infy(z). Impossible.
-   **SW:** supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). sup(x) <= infy(z) contradicts supy(x) > infy(z). Impossible.
-   **W:** supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(x) > supy(z). Impossible. Also, supx(x) <= infx(z) combined with infx(x) >= supx(z) would imply horizontal extent is zero (point) for non-overlapping regions, which is not the case for regions homeomorphic to a disk. Impossible.
-   **NW:** supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible as shown for W. Impossible.
-   **N:** supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). supy(z) <= infy(x) holds (strictly). We need infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). From infx(x) >= supx(z), if supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) >= infx(x), it implies supx(x) = infx(x) = supx(z). This means the horizontal extent of x is a point, not possible for a region. So N is impossible.
-   **NE:** supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Our derivations are infx(x) >= supx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z). These satisfy the conditions for NE. Therefore, NE is possible.
-   **E:** supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(x) > supy(z). Impossible.
-   **SE:** supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts supy(x) > infy(z). Impossible.
-   **B:** infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(x) > supy(z). Impossible.

Based on the bounding box definitions provided, the constraints derived from the premises (x N y and y NE z) mean that x's bounding box is always horizontally at or to the East of z's bounding box's right edge (infx(x) >= supx(z)) and strictly vertically above z's bounding box's top edge (infy(x) > supy(z)).

These conditions exactly match or strictly imply the conditions for the NE relation (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)). No other relation's definition is consistent with these necessary conditions without implying zero extent for a dimension or a contradiction.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z, according to the given definitions, is NE.

NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: N, B
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: N, NW
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region a on the x and y axes. The definitions of the single-tile cardinal directions are given in terms of these bounds.

We are given that region x is W of region y (x W y) and region y is E of region z (y E z). Let's write down the conditions based on the definitions:

x W y if and only if:
1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
2) infy(y) <= infy(x)
3) supy(x) <= supy(y)

y E z if and only if:
4) supx(z) <= infx(y)
5) infy(z) <= infy(y)
6) supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. The possible relations are from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. Let's analyze the constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z based on the given conditions.

From inequalities (2), (3), (5), and (6) concerning the y-coordinates:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

These inequalities imply:
infy(z) <= infy(x)  (let's call this Y-cond 1)
supy(x) <= supy(z)  (let's call this Y-cond 2)

These two conditions together mean that the projection of region x on the y-axis is contained within or equal to the projection of region z on the y-axis.

Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, their bounding boxes must have non-zero width and height. Thus, for any region a, infy(a) < supy(a).
Y-cond 1: infy(z) <= infy(x)
Y-cond 2: supy(x) <= supy(z)
Combining these with infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z):
infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now let's examine the y-conditions required by each of the possible relations between x and z (replacing a with x and b with z in the definitions):
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches our derived Y-cond 1 & 2.
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), which would require supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), possible only if infy(x) = supy(x), which is not allowed for regions in REG. Thus S is impossible.
- SW: supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible, same reason as S.
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches our derived Y-cond 1 & 2.
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z), which would require supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(z), possible only if infy(x) = supy(z) and supy(x) = supy(z) and infy(x) = supy(x), not allowed. Thus NW is impossible.
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible, same reason as NW.
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible, same reason as NW.
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches our derived Y-cond 1 & 2.
- SE: supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible, same reason as S.

Based on the y-axis constraints derived from x W y and y E z, the only possible relations between x and z from the given set of nine are B, W, and E. We need to verify if all three of these are indeed possible.

Let's analyze the constraints on the x-coordinates:
1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
4) supx(z) <= infx(y)

These imply that the right boundary of x's bounding box and the right boundary of z's bounding box are both to the left of or meet the left boundary of y's bounding box. This allows for several possibilities regarding the relative positions of the x-intervals of x and z, as long as there is an infx(y) value that is greater than or equal to both supx(x) and supx(z).

Let's construct examples for W, E, and B using bounding boxes that satisfy all the conditions.

Possibility 1: x W z
Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two match our derived y-conditions.
Example: x BB [0,1]x[0,1], y BB [3,4]x[0,1], z BB [2,3]x[0,1].
Check x W y: supx(x)=1 <= infx(y)=3 (Yes). infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (Yes). x W y holds.
Check y E z: supx(z)=3 <= infx(y)=3 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=0 (Yes). supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (Yes). y E z holds.
Check x W z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (Yes). x W z holds.
So, W is a possible relation.

Possibility 2: x E z
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two match our derived y-conditions.
Example: x BB [2,3]x[0,1], y BB [5,6]x[0,1], z BB [0,1]x[0,1].
Check x W y: supx(x)=3 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (Yes). x W y holds.
Check y E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=0 (Yes). supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (Yes). y E z holds.
Check x E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (Yes). x E z holds.
So, E is a possible relation.

Possibility 3: x B z
Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two match our derived y-conditions.
Example: x BB [2,3]x[0,1], y BB [5,6]x[0,1], z BB [1,4]x[-1,2].
Check x W y: supx(x)=3 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (Yes). x W y holds.
Check y E z: supx(z)=4 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(z)=-1 <= infy(y)=0 (Yes). supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=2 (Yes). y E z holds.
Check x B z: infx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2 (Yes). supx(x)=3 <= supx(z)=4 (Yes). infy(z)=-1 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=2 (Yes). x B z holds.
So, B is a possible relation.

We have eliminated 6 of the 9 possible relations based on the y-axis constraints derived from the given relations and the properties of regions in REG. We have shown with examples that the remaining 3 relations (W, E, B) are possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}$.
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: S, SW
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Let $MBB(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$ for a region $a$.
The given relations are:
1.  $x$ W $y$: $supx(x) \le infx(y)$, $infy(y) \le infy(x)$, and $supy(x) \le supy(y)$.
2.  $y$ NW $z$: $supx(y) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.

We are looking for the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$. Let's analyze the constraints on the bounds of $x$ and $z$.

Horizontal relationship between $x$ and $z$:
From $x$ W $y$, we have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
From $y$ NW $z$, we have $supx(y) \le infx(z)$.
For any region $y$, we know $infx(y) \le supx(y)$.
Combining these inequalities, we get $supx(x) \le infx(y) \le supx(y) \le infx(z)$.
This implies $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. This means the right edge of the bounding box of $x$ is to the left of or aligns with the left edge of the bounding box of $z$.

Vertical relationship between $x$ and $z$:
From $x$ W $y$, we have $infy(y) \le infy(x)$.
From $y$ NW $z$, we have $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.
Combining these inequalities, we get $supy(z) \le infy(y) \le infy(x)$.
This implies $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. This means the top edge of the bounding box of $z$ is below or aligns with the bottom edge of the bounding box of $x$.

Now let's examine the definitions of the single-tile cardinal direction relations for $x$ with respect to $z$ (i.e., $a=x, b=z$) using the derived conditions: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.

*   $x$ N $z$: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (holds), $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ (not necessarily holds), $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (holds, because $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $infx(z) \le supx(z)$). This is possible only if $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ can be true simultaneously with the premises.
*   $x$ NE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ (not necessarily holds), $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (holds). This is possible only if $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ can be true simultaneously with the premises.
*   $x$ SE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ (not necessarily holds), $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (not necessarily holds).
*   $x$ S $z$: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (not necessarily holds), $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ (not necessarily holds), $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (holds).
*   $x$ E $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ (not necessarily holds), $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ (holds, because $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ implies $infy(z) \le supy(z) \le infy(x)$), $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ (not necessarily holds).
*   $x$ NW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (holds), $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (holds). This relation is always satisfied by the derived conditions.
*   $x$ W $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (holds), $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ (holds), $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ (not necessarily holds).
*   $x$ SW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (holds), $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (not necessarily holds).
*   $x$ B $z$: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ (not necessarily holds), $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (holds), $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ (holds), $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ (not necessarily holds).

The conditions $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ are necessary for $x$ NW $z$ and are derived directly from the premises. This means NW is always a possible relation.

To check if other relations are possible, we need to see if their required conditions can be met simultaneously with the original premises.
For example, for N to be possible, we need $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ in addition to the derived conditions.
If $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ both hold, then $infx(z) \le infx(x) \le supx(x) \le infx(z)$. For regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (which implies non-degenerate regions with $infx < supx$ and $infy < supy$), this can only happen if $infx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x)$, meaning MBB(x) is a vertical line segment at the left edge of MBB(z). This contradicts the non-degenerate assumption for regions in REG.

If we assume that regions in REG are non-degenerate (i.e., $infx < supx$ and $infy < supy$), then:
$supx(x) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le infx(z)$, which implies $supx(x) < infx(z)$. This means $x$ is strictly to the West of $z$.
$supy(z) \le infy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x) \le supy(y)$. This implies $supy(z) < supy(x)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.

If $x$ is strictly West of $z$ ($supx(x) < infx(z)$), then relations N, NE, E, SE, S, B are horizontally impossible as they require overlap or $z$ being to the left of $x$. This leaves W, SW, NW as possible horizontal relations.

We derived $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. Let's check the vertical requirements for x R z:
*   S, SW, SE: require $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. We have $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$ (non-degenerate z). So $infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(x)$. Thus $infy(z) < infy(x)$. If $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, then $supy(x) \le infy(z) < infy(x)$. This implies $supy(x) < infy(x)$, which is impossible for a non-degenerate region x. So S, SW, SE are vertically impossible.
*   W, E, B: require $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ (holds) and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$. Can $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ be true? We have $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(y)$. If $supy(x) \le supy(z)$, then $supy(x) \le supy(z) \le infy(y)$. Also $infy(y) \le infy(x)$. Thus $supy(x) \le infy(y) \le infy(x)$. This implies $supy(x) \le infy(x)$, impossible for non-degenerate x. So W, E, B are vertically impossible.

This leaves only N, NW, NE as vertically possible (based on $supy(z) \le infy(x)$) and W, SW, NW as horizontally possible (based on $supx(x) \le infx(z)$).

The intersection of {N, NW, NE} and {W, SW, NW} is {NW}.
NW requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, which are always true.

Assuming regions in REG are non-degenerate, only NW is possible. If degenerate MBBs were allowed for intermediate regions, other relations might be possible, but the definition of REG implies non-degenerate regions.

The only possible relation is NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{NW}$.
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: S, SW, SE
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: N, NE, NW
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Let MBB(r) denote the minimum bounding box of a region r.
MBB(r) = [infx(r), supx(r)] x [infy(r), supy(r)].
Since regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

We are given:
1. x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z among the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's analyze the vertical relationship between x and z:
From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
From y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
Combining these inequalities:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)  => infy(z) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)  => supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, the vertical extent of MBB(x) is contained within or touches the vertical extent of MBB(z).
infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's check which single-tile relations between x and z are consistent with this vertical constraint (letting a=x, b=z in the definitions):
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Consistent.
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) < supy(x) unless infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x), which is impossible for a region in REG. Not possible.
- SW: supy(x) <= infy(z). Not possible.
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Consistent.
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z) unless infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z), which is impossible for regions in REG. Not possible.
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x). Not possible.
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x). Not possible.
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Consistent.
- SE: supy(x) <= infy(z). Not possible.

Based on the vertical constraints, only B, W, and E are potentially possible relations between x and z.

Now let's analyze the horizontal relationship between x and z:
From x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y).
From y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
Also, we know infx(x) < supx(x), infx(y) < supx(y), infx(z) < supx(z).

Consider the condition for E (x E z): supx(z) <= infx(x).
From the given conditions:
infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
This chain of inequalities implies infx(x) < supx(z).
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG. E is not a possible relation.

Now consider the condition for W (x W z): supx(x) <= infx(z).
From the given conditions:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
Let infx(y) = 5. supx(x) <= 5 and infx(z) <= 5.
It is possible for supx(x) <= infx(z) to hold. For example, if supx(x) = 4 and infx(z) = 5 (and infx(y) >= 5).
Let's construct an example with regions in REG:
Let y be a disk with MBB [5, 8] x [5, 8].
Let x be a disk with MBB [2, 4] x [6, 7].
x W y? supx(x)=4 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(y)=5 <= infy(x)=6 (Yes). supy(x)=7 <= supy(y)=8 (Yes). x W y holds.
Let z be a disk with MBB [5, 10] x [0, 10].
y B z? infx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). supx(y)=8 <= supx(z)=10 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=5 (Yes). supy(y)=8 <= supy(z)=10 (Yes). y B z holds.
Now compare x and z:
supx(x)=4 <= infx(z)=5 (Yes).
infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=6 (Yes).
supy(x)=7 <= supy(z)=10 (Yes).
x W z holds in this example. Thus, W is a possible relation.

Finally, consider the condition for B (x B z): infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
We already know from the chain of inequalities (infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)) that supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
We need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
From the given conditions:
infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y).
Let infx(y) = 5. infx(z) <= 5 and infx(x) < supx(x) <= 5.
It is possible for infx(z) <= infx(x) to hold. For example, if infx(z) = 0 and infx(x) = 2 (and infx(y) >= 2 and infx(y) >= 0).
Let's construct an example with regions in REG:
Let y be a disk with MBB [5, 8] x [5, 8].
Let x be a disk with MBB [2, 4] x [6, 7].
x W y? supx(x)=4 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(y)=5 <= infy(x)=6 (Yes). supy(x)=7 <= supy(y)=8 (Yes). x W y holds.
Let z be a disk with MBB [0, 10] x [0, 10].
y B z? infx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). supx(y)=8 <= supx(z)=10 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=5 (Yes). supy(y)=8 <= supy(z)=10 (Yes). y B z holds.
Now compare x and z:
infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=2 (Yes).
supx(x)=4 <= supx(z)=10 (Yes).
infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=6 (Yes).
supy(x)=7 <= supy(z)=10 (Yes).
x B z holds in this example. Thus, B is a possible relation.

We have eliminated S, SW, SE, N, NW, NE, and E as impossible relations. We have shown that W and B are possible relations.

The possible relations are W and B.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, B}$.
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: N, NE
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: B, E, W
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Let the minimum bounding box of a region 'a' be defined by [infx(a), supx(a)] on the x-axis and [infy(a), supy(a)] on the y-axis. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, implying their bounding boxes have non-zero width and height (infx < supx and infy < supy).

Given:
1.  Region x is E of region y (x E y):
    supx(y) <= infx(x)
    infy(y) <= infy(x)
    supy(x) <= supy(y)

2.  Region y is S of region z (y S z):
    supy(y) <= infy(z)
    infx(z) <= infx(y)
    supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's derive combined constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

From (1c) and (2a):
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
This implies **supy(x) <= infy(z)**. This means region x is entirely below or at the same lowest vertical level as region z's bottom boundary. This inequality is consistent with the definitions of S, SW, and SE relations where 'a' is below 'b'. It is inconsistent with N, NE, NW, E, W, and B, which require some vertical overlap or 'a' being above 'b'.

From (2b) and (1a):
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
This implies **infx(z) <= infx(x)**. This means region x starts horizontally at or to the East of where region z starts.

Now let's examine the definitions of the single-tile cardinal direction relations for x R z, using the constraints supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x):

*   **x S z**: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    -   supy(x) <= infy(z): This is satisfied by our derivation.
    -   infx(z) <= infx(x): This is satisfied by our derivation.
    -   supx(x) <= supx(z): Is this always true? No. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[1.5,3]x[0,1], z=[0,2.5]x[2,3]. x E y holds, y S z holds. For x vs z: supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=2, infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=1.5, but supx(x)=3 > supx(z)=2.5. So supx(x) <= supx(z) is not always true.
    -   Is supx(x) <= supx(z) *possible*? Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[1.5,2]x[0,1], z=[-0.5,2]x[2,3]. x E y holds, y S z holds. For x vs z: supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=2, infx(z)=-0.5 <= infx(x)=1.5, supx(x)=2 <= supx(z)=2. S holds in this case.
    -   Therefore, S is a possible relation.

*   **x SW z**: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND supx(x) <= infx(z).
    -   supy(x) <= infy(z): This is satisfied.
    -   supx(x) <= infx(z): Is this possible? From infx(z) <= infx(x), if supx(x) <= infx(z) holds, then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is impossible for any region homeomorphic to a disk.
    -   Therefore, SW is not a possible relation for regions in REG.

*   **x SE z**: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND supx(z) <= infx(x).
    -   supy(x) <= infy(z): This is satisfied.
    -   supx(z) <= infx(x): Is this possible? Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[2,3]x[0,1], z=[0,1]x[2,3]. x E y holds, y S z holds. For x vs z: supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=2, supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2. SE holds in this case.
    -   Is supx(z) <= infx(x) always true? No. The example y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[1.5,3]x[0,1], z=[0,2.5]x[2,3] showed supx(z)=2.5 and infx(x)=1.5, so supx(z) > infx(x).
    -   Therefore, SE is a possible relation.

*   **Other relations (N, NE, NW, E, W, B)**:
    -   N, NE, NW require z R N/NE/NW x, meaning supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supy(x) <= infy(z). For regions in REG, infy < supy. supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z). Also infy(y) <= infy(x). From y S z, supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, infy(y) <= infy(x). supy(y) <= infy(z). infy(y) <= infy(x). It is impossible to guarantee supy(z) <= infy(x). In fact, typical configurations will have infy(x) around infy(y), and infy(z) significantly above supy(y) and thus significantly above infy(x). These relations are not possible.
    -   W requires supx(x) <= infx(z). We showed this is impossible for regions in REG. W is not possible.
    -   E requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). While supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible and supy(x) <= supy(z) is always true (supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z)), infy(z) <= infy(x) is not generally true and is inconsistent with the typical vertical separation implied by y S z and x E y. infy(z) >= supy(y) > infy(y). As infy(y) <= infy(x), infy(z) > infy(y) suggests infy(z) is likely > infy(x). E is not possible.
    -   B requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But supx(x) <= supx(z) is not always true, and infy(z) <= infy(x) is generally false. B is not possible.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relations from the given list are S and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SE}$.
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: N, NE, NW
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: SE, S, SW
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by `[infx(a), supx(a)]` and `[infy(a), supy(a)]`.
The given relations are defined based on these bounding box coordinates.

We are given:
1) Region x is E of region y (x E y):
   `supx(y) <= infx(x)`
   `infy(y) <= infy(x)`
   `supy(x) <= supy(y)`

2) Region y is SE of region z (y SE z):
   `supx(z) <= infx(y)`
   `supy(y) <= infy(z)`

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. This means we need to determine the relative positions of their bounding boxes based on the given information.

Let's analyze the constraints on the x-coordinates:
From (1): `supx(y) <= infx(x)`
From (2): `supx(z) <= infx(y)`
Also, by definition of bounding box, `infx(y) <= supx(y)`.
Combining these inequalities, we get:
`supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`
Therefore, we conclude that `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
This inequality means that the right edge of the bounding box of z is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of x.

Now let's analyze the constraints on the y-coordinates:
From (1): `infy(y) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(y)`
From (2): `supy(y) <= infy(z)`
Combining these inequalities, we get:
`supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)`
Therefore, we conclude that `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
This inequality means that the top edge of the bounding box of x is below or aligned with the bottom edge of the bounding box of z.

So, any regions x and z satisfying the given conditions (through some region y) must satisfy the two bounding box inequalities:
A) `supx(z) <= infx(x)`
B) `supy(x) <= infy(z)`

Now, let's look at the definitions of the single-tile cardinal direction relations for x and z:
- a B b: `infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)`
- a S b: `supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)`
- a SW b: `supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)`
- a W b: `supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)`
- a NW b: `supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)`
- a N b: `supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)`
- a NE b: `supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)`
- a E b: `supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)`
- a SE b: `supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)`

Substituting x for 'a' and z for 'b':
- x SE z is defined by: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
These are exactly the two inequalities (A and B) that we derived from the premises.

Since the definitions use "if and only if", the relation between x and z is SE if and only if `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. As these conditions are necessary consequences of the premises, the relation between x and z must be SE.

Let's quickly check if any other relation is possible.
For regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk), their bounding boxes have positive width and height, meaning `infx < supx` and `infy < supy`.
- Relations requiring `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (SW, W, NW): This contradicts `supx(z) <= infx(x)` for non-degenerate regions (unless x and z are points located appropriately, but REG regions are not points).
- Relations requiring `supx(x) <= supx(z)` or `infx(z) <= infx(x)` along with `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (B, S, N, E): These require some horizontal overlap or containment of bounding boxes, or z being to the left but x's right edge is contained in z's horizontal extent. `supx(z) <= infx(x)` implies z is horizontally to the left of x or touching. For any overlap or containment to occur (e.g., `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)` for B), while `supx(z) <= infx(x)` holds, requires the regions to be degenerate.
- Relations requiring `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (N, NW, NE): This contradicts `supy(x) <= infy(z)` for non-degenerate regions (unless they are points or horizontal lines). From the premises, we have the vertical ordering `infy(y) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z)`. This implies `infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z)`. If `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is also required, then `infy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is only possible if `infy(x) = supy(z)`, which implies `infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(y) = infy(z) = supy(z)`. This means x, y, and z are horizontal line segments at the same y-coordinate, which contradicts the definition of regions in REG.
- Relations requiring `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)` along with `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (E, W, B): If `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, then `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x)`, which implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`. This is only possible for a point.

Since regions in REG are not points or lines, the derived inequalities `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)` rule out all relations except SE.

The only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.

SE
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: E, B
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: N, S, B
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Let x S y means:
1) supy(x) <= infy(y)
2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

Let y W z means:
4) supx(y) <= infx(z)
5) infy(z) <= infy(y)
6) supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the implications of these inequalities on the bounding boxes of x and z.

Horizontal relation between x and z:
From (3) and (4), we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).
This implies supx(x) <= infx(z). This means the right edge of x's bounding box is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of z's bounding box.

This horizontal relationship (supx(x) <= infx(z)) is consistent with the definitions of W, SW, and NW relations.
It is *inconsistent* with the definitions of E, NE, SE (which require supx(z) <= infx(x)), and B, S, N (which require horizontal overlap: infx(z) <= supx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(z)). For regions with area, supx > infx. The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the conditions for E, NE, SE, B, S, N unless the regions collapse to points and touch, which is not allowed for regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk.

So, the possible relations are limited to W, SW, NW.

Now let's analyze the vertical relation between x and z for these potential candidates.

We know from (1), (5), and (6), along with the fact that infy(y) <= supy(y):
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
This implies supy(x) <= supy(z). This condition is part of the definitions for W and SW.

Let's examine each candidate:

1.  x W z: Defined as supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is always true.
    We know supy(x) <= supy(z) is always true.
    We need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
    From (5), infy(z) <= infy(y).
    From (1), supy(x) <= infy(y).
    From region properties, infy(x) <= supy(x).
    So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y). This implies infy(x) <= infy(y).
    We need to determine if infy(z) <= infy(x) can hold. We have infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(x) <= infy(y).
    Consider a scenario where infy(z) is significantly lower than infy(y), and infy(x) is only slightly lower than infy(y).
    Example: Let infy(y) = 0. Let infy(z) = -3 and infy(x) = -1. Then infy(z) <= infy(x) (-3 <= -1) holds.
    We need to check if such a scenario is possible given the original conditions.
    Let y be the region [0,1]x[0,1]. infx(y)=0, supx(y)=1, infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
    x S y: supy(x) <= 0, 0 <= infx(x), supx(x) <= 1. Let x be [0,1]x[-2,-1]. infy(x)=-2, supy(x)=-1. supy(x)=-1 <= 0, 0<=0, 1<=1. x S y holds.
    y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z) (1 <= infx(z)), infy(z) <= infy(y) (infy(z) <= 0), supy(y) <= supy(z) (1 <= supy(z)). Let z be [2,3]x[-3,2]. infx(z)=2, supx(z)=3, infy(z)=-3, supy(z)=2. 1<=2, -3<=0, 1<=2. y W z holds.
    Now check x W z with x=[0,1]x[-2,-1] and z=[2,3]x[-3,2]:
    supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True).
    infy(z)=-3 <= infy(x)=-2 (True).
    supy(x)=-1 <= supy(z)=2 (True).
    All conditions for x W z hold. So W is a possible relation.

2.  x SW z: Defined as supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is always true.
    We need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
    From (1), supy(x) <= infy(y).
    From (5), infy(z) <= infy(y).
    Both supy(x) and infy(z) are less than or equal to infy(y). It is possible for supy(x) to be less than or equal to infy(z).
    Example: Let infy(y) = 0. Let supy(x) = -1 and infy(z) = -0.5. Then supy(x) <= infy(z) (-1 <= -0.5) holds.
    Let y be the region [0,1]x[0,1]. infy(y)=0.
    x S y: supy(x) <= 0, ... Let x be [0,1]x[-2,-1]. supy(x)=-1. x S y holds.
    y W z: ... infy(z) <= 0, supy(y) <= supy(z). Let z be [2,3]x[-0.5, 1.5]. infy(z)=-0.5, supy(z)=1.5. infy(z)=-0.5 <= 0, supy(y)=1 <= 1.5. y W z holds.
    Now check x SW z with x=[0,1]x[-2,-1] and z=[2,3]x[-0.5, 1.5]:
    supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True).
    supy(x)=-1 <= infy(z)=-0.5 (True).
    Both conditions for x SW z hold. So SW is a possible relation.

3.  x NW z: Defined as supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is always true.
    We need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
    From (6), supy(y) <= supy(z).
    From region properties and (1), infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).
    From region properties, infy(y) <= supy(y).
    So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
    This implies infy(x) <= supy(z) is always true.
    For supy(z) <= infy(x) to hold, we must have infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(y) = supy(y) = supy(z). This requires the vertical extents of x and y to be single points aligned on the same y-coordinate, which contradicts the definition of regions in REG (homeomorphic to a disk, implying area and vertical extent > 0).
    Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible for regions in REG. NW is not a possible relation.

Based on the analysis, only W and SW are possible relations between region x and region z.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, SW}$.
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. The relations are defined based on the infimum and supremum of the projections of their minimum bounding boxes on the x and y axes.
Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), supy(r) denote the bounds for a region r.

The given conditions are:
1.  x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2.  y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's derive constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z from the given conditions.

From the x-conditions:
From (x S y), infx(y) <= infx(x).
From (y E z), supx(z) <= infx(y).
Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
So, supx(z) <= infx(x) is a necessary condition. This means the right edge of z's bounding box is to the west of or touches the left edge of x's bounding box. Horizontally, z is always to the west of x, or they touch.

Let's examine the horizontal conditions for each possible relation R between x and z (a R b, where a=x, b=z) and see which ones are consistent with supx(z) <= infx(x).

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). supx(z) <= infx(x) implies infx(z) <= infx(x). However, supx(x) <= supx(z) combined with supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). For regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed disk), the bounding box has non-zero width (infx < supx). Thus, supx(x) <= infx(x) is impossible. B is not possible.
-   x S z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). (Same x-condition as B). Not possible.
-   x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z). supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= supx(z). We need supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is impossible. SW is not possible.
-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z). (Same x-condition as SW). Not possible.
-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z). (Same x-condition as SW). Not possible.
-   x N z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). (Same x-condition as B). Not possible.
-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with our derived condition. NE is potentially possible.
-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with our derived condition. E is potentially possible.
-   x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with our derived condition. SE is potentially possible.

Based on the x-conditions, only NE, E, and SE are possible relations between x and z. Now let's examine the y-conditions for these relations, given the y-constraints from x S y and y E z.

From the y-conditions:
From (x S y), supy(x) <= infy(y).
From (y E z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
Also, by definition, infy(x) <= supy(x) and infy(z) <= supy(z) and infy(y) <= supy(y).

Combining these inequalities related to y-coordinates:
infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
Also, infy(z) <= infy(y).

So we have:
1.  infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  infy(z) <= infy(y)
3.  infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's check the y-conditions for NE, E, and SE relations between x and z (a R b, where a=x, b=z):

-   x NE z: supy(z) <= infy(x).
    From the combined inequalities, we know supy(z) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= supy(x) >= infy(x).
    So, supy(z) >= infy(x) is always true.
    Equality (supy(z) = infy(x)) would require supy(z) = supy(y) = infy(y) = supy(x) = infy(x). This implies all bounding boxes are on the same horizontal line segment, which is not possible for regions in REG.
    Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible. NE is not possible.

-   x E z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    -   infy(z) <= infy(x): Is this possible? Yes. Example: Let infy(y)=10. We need infy(z)<=10 and infy(x) <= supy(x) <= 10. Let infy(z)=9 and infy(x)=9.5. This is consistent with infy(z) <= infy(x) (9 <= 9.5) and the constraints (9<=10, 9.5<=10).
    -   supy(x) <= supy(z): Is this possible? Yes. Example: Let supy(y)=12. We need supy(x) <= infy(y)=10 and supy(y)=12 <= supy(z). Let supy(x)=9.8 and supy(z)=13. This is consistent with supy(x) <= supy(z) (9.8 <= 13) and the constraints (9.8<=10, 12<=13).
    Since both y-conditions are possible simultaneously (as shown by combining the examples: infy(y)=10, supy(y)=12, infy(z)=9, supy(z)=13, infy(x)=9.5, supy(x)=9.8), E is a possible relation.

-   x SE z: supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Is this possible? Yes. Example: Let infy(y)=10. We need supy(x) <= 10 and infy(z) <= 10. Let supy(x)=8 and infy(z)=9. Then supy(x) <= infy(z) (8 <= 9) is true, and this is consistent with the constraints (8<=10, 9<=10).
    SE is a possible relation.

We have ruled out B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE. We found that E and SE are possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, SE}$.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Let the regions be x, y, and z.
The definition of the S relation (a S b) is:
supy(a) <= infy(b)
infx(b) <= infx(a)
supx(a) <= supx(b)

Given that region x is S of region y (x S y) and region y is S of region z (y S z), we have the following inequalities for their bounding box coordinates:
1) For x S y:
   supy(x) <= infy(y)
   infx(y) <= infx(x)
   supx(x) <= supx(y)

2) For y S z:
   supy(y) <= infy(z)
   infx(z) <= infx(y)
   supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's derive the constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x and z from the given conditions:

Vertical constraint:
From (1), supy(x) <= infy(y).
From (2), supy(y) <= infy(z).
Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they are non-degenerate, meaning infy(y) <= supy(y).
Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z). This implies that the top of the bounding box of x is below or aligned with the bottom of the bounding box of z.

Horizontal constraints:
From (1), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
From (2), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
Combining the left bounds: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
Thus, infx(z) <= infx(x). This implies that the left edge of the bounding box of z is left of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of x.
Combining the right bounds: supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
Thus, supx(x) <= supx(z). This implies that the right edge of the bounding box of x is left of or aligned with the right edge of the bounding box of z.

So, from x S y and y S z, it is necessarily true that:
A) supy(x) <= infy(z)
B) infx(z) <= infx(x)
C) supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now let's examine the definitions of all possible cardinal direction relations R between x and z (a R b, where a is x and b is z) and see which ones are consistent with these necessary conditions.

The definitions are based on bounding boxes. Regions in REG are non-degenerate, meaning for any region r in REG, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

- S(x, z): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  These conditions match exactly the necessary conditions A, B, C. Since there exist regions in REG satisfying x S y and y S z (e.g., three disjoint squares stacked vertically and horizontally aligned), S is a possible relation between x and z.

- B(x, z): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Conditions B and C match. We need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible.
  We know supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). This chain implies supy(x) <= infy(z).
  If infy(z) <= infy(x) is also true, then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
  Also, x S y requires supy(x) <= infy(y). If infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x S y horizontal), then supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
  And y S z requires supy(y) <= infy(z). If infy(z) <= infy(x) (for B(x,z)), then supy(y) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
  So we need supy(x) <= infy(y), sy(y) <= iy(z), iy(z) <= iy(x).
  The chain is sy_x <= iy_y <= sy_y <= iy_z <= iy_x.
  Since regions are non-degenerate, iy_y < sy_y and iy_x < sy_x and iy_z < sy_z.
  If sy_x <= iy_y and iy_y <= iy_x, then sy_x <= iy_x. This is possible.
  However, the chain sy_x <= iy_y and iy_y <= iy_x implies that the bottom of y is below or aligned with the bottom of x, while the top of x is below or aligned with the bottom of y. These conditions together imply sy_x = iy_y = iy_x for non-degenerate regions, which would mean the vertical extent of x is a point, contradicting REG definition. Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible given x S y and y S z for regions in REG.
  B is not possible.

- W(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  infy(z) <= infy(x) was just shown to be impossible.
  W is not possible.

- E(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  infy(z) <= infy(x) was just shown to be impossible.
  E is not possible.

- NW(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  supy(z) <= infy(x) implies z is below x.
  We know supy(x) <= infy(z) implies x is below z.
  If x is below z and z is below x, their vertical extents must overlap and be points for non-degenerate regions, which is impossible.
  sy_x <= iy_y <= sy_y <= iy_z. If sy_z <= iy_x, the vertical ranges are inconsistent for non-degenerate regions.
  NW is not possible.

- N(x, z): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  supy(z) <= infy(x) was just shown to be impossible.
  N is not possible.

- NE(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  supy(z) <= infy(x) was just shown to be impossible.
  NE is not possible.

- SW(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  supy(x) <= infy(z) matches necessary condition A.
  We need to check if supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible.
  We know infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
  If supx(x) <= infx(z) is true, then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x).
  Since regions are non-degenerate, infx(x) < supx(x).
  So, infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). This leads to infx(x) < infx(x), a contradiction.
  The only way this chain can hold is if infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z), which means the horizontal extent of x is a point, contradicting REG definition.
  Thus, supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible given the necessary horizontal conditions.
  SW is not possible.

- SE(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  supy(x) <= infy(z) matches necessary condition A.
  We need to check if supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
  We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  If supx(z) <= infx(x) is true, then infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
  This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Since regions are non-degenerate, infx(x) < supx(x).
  So, infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(x), a contradiction.
  The only way this chain can hold is if infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z), which means the horizontal extent of x is a point, contradicting REG definition.
  Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible given the necessary horizontal conditions.
  SE is not possible.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relation between region x and region z is S.

The final answer is $\boxed{S}$.
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: SW, W, NW
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: Let the bounding box of a region $a$ be denoted by $[infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$. Regions homeomorphic to the closed unit disk satisfy $infx(a) < supx(a)$ and $infy(a) < supy(a)$.

We are given:
1. Region $x$ is S of region $y$ ($x$ S $y$).
According to the definition, this means:
$supy(x) \le infy(y)$ (1a)
$infx(y) \le infx(x)$ (1b)
$supx(x) \le supx(y)$ (1c)

2. Region $y$ is SW of region $z$ ($y$ SW $z$).
According to the definition, this means:
$supx(y) \le infx(z)$ (2a)
$supy(y) \le infy(z)$ (2b)

We want to find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$. Let's derive constraints on the bounding boxes of $x$ and $z$.

From (1a) and (2b), we have $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(z)$.
Since $y$ is a region homeomorphic to a disk, its projection on the y-axis is an interval $[infy(y), supy(y)]$ with $infy(y) < supy(y)$.
So, $supy(x) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(z)$.
This implies $supy(x) < infy(z)$. Let's keep the non-strict inequality derived directly from the definitions for now:
$supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (A)

From (1c) and (2a), we have $supx(x) \le supx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le infx(z)$.
So, $supx(x) \le supx(y) \le infx(z)$.
This implies $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (B)

Now we examine which of the single-tile cardinal direction relations $x$ R $z$ are possible given the constraints $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (A) and $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (B).

Let's check each possible relation for $x$ R $z$:

-   $x$ B $z$: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    From (B), we have $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. If B holds, then $supx(x) \le infx(z) \le infx(x)$. Since $infx(x) < supx(x)$ for a region with extent, this is impossible. Thus, B is not possible.

-   $x$ S $z$: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (Matches A), $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    Requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$. From (B), we have $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. If S holds, then $supx(x) \le infx(z) \le infx(x)$. This implies $supx(x) \le infx(x)$, which is impossible. Thus, S is not possible.

-   $x$ SW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (Matches B), $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (Matches A).
    Both conditions match the derived constraints. Thus, SW is a possible relation.

-   $x$ W $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (Matches B), $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Requires $infy(z) \le infy(x)$. From (A), we have $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. If W holds, then $supy(x) \le infy(z) \le infy(x)$. This implies $supy(x) \le infy(x)$, which is impossible. Thus, W is not possible.

-   $x$ NW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (Matches B), $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    Requires $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. From (A), we have $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
    If NW holds, then $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. We also know $infy(x) < supy(x)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$.
    Combining these, $supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x) \le infy(z) < supy(z)$. This gives $supy(z) < supy(z)$, a contradiction. Thus, NW is not possible.

-   $x$ N $z$: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    Requires $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (Impossible, as shown for NW) and $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ (Impossible, as shown for S). Thus, N is not possible.

-   $x$ E $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. From (B), $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. If E holds, then $supx(z) \le infx(x) < supx(x) \le infx(z) \le supx(z)$. This implies $supx(z) \le supx(z)$ but also involves impossible strict inequalities. Let's use the bounding box intervals [ix, sx] and [iz, sz]. We have $sx \le iz$. E requires $sz \le ix$. If both hold, then $sz \le ix < sx \le iz$. This implies $sz < iz$, which is impossible for a region. Thus, E is not possible.

-   $x$ SE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (Matches A).
    Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. Impossible as shown for E. Thus, SE is not possible.

-   $x$ NE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ (Impossible) and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (Impossible). Thus, NE is not possible.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box constraints derived from the given relations, only the SW relation between $x$ and $z$ is possible. The constraint that regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk implies that their bounding boxes have non-zero width and height ($infx < supx$ and $infy < supy$), which was used to rule out the contradictions.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW}$.
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: NE, E, SE
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: The given relations are:
1.  `x S y`: `supy(x) <= infy(y)`, `infx(y) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(y)`.
2.  `y B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, `supx(y) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(y)`, `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.

Regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies they are non-degenerate, so for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

Let's combine the inequalities for the x-bounds:
From `x S y`: `infx(y) <= infx(x)` (A1), `supx(x) <= supx(y)` (A2).
From `y B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(y)` (B1), `supx(y) <= supx(z)` (B2).

Combining these, we get:
`infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)`
`supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`

Now let's combine the inequalities for the y-bounds:
From `x S y`: `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (A3).
From `y B z`: `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (B3), `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (B4).

Also, for x, y, z in REG:
`infx(x) < supx(x)` (C1), `infy(x) < supy(x)` (C2)
`infx(y) < supx(y)` (C3), `infy(y) < supy(y)` (C4)
`infx(z) < supx(z)` (C5), `infy(z) < supy(z)` (C6)

We need to check which cardinal relations `x R z` are possible, where R is one of {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's analyze the x-bound conditions for each relation R between x and z:
- Relations requiring `supx(x) <= infx(z)`: SW, W, NW.
  From `infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`.
  If `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, then `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x)`.
  This implies `supx(x) <= infx(x)`.
  However, for a non-degenerate region x in REG, `infx(x) < supx(x)` (C1).
  Thus, `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is impossible.
  So, SW, W, NW are impossible relations between x and z.

- Relations requiring `supx(z) <= infx(x)`: NE, E, SE.
  If `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, then since `infx(x) < supx(x)` (C1), we have `supx(z) < supx(x)`.
  However, from `supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`, we have `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
  The combination `supx(z) < supx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)` is a contradiction.
  Thus, `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is impossible.
  So, NE, E, SE are impossible relations between x and z.

The only possible relations left are S, B, N. Let's analyze their y-bound conditions.

- `x S z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
  We have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (A3) and `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (B3).
  Can `supy(x) <= infy(z)` hold? Yes.
  Example: Let `supy(x)=1`, `infy(z)=2`, `infy(y)=3`.
  `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (1 <= 3) holds.
  `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (2 <= 3) holds.
  `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (1 <= 2) holds.
  With appropriate x-bounds (e.g., x, y, z aligned vertically with x-spans [-1,1], contained within each other), we can construct regions in REG satisfying these.
  Thus, S is a possible relation.

- `x B z`: Requires `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
  - `infy(z) <= infy(x)`:
    We have `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (B3) and `infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y)` (C2, A3).
    Can `infy(z) <= infy(x)` hold? Yes.
    Example: Let `infy(z)=1`, `infy(x)=2`, `supy(x)=3`, `infy(y)=4`.
    `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (1 <= 4) holds.
    `infy(x) < supy(x)` (2 < 3) holds.
    `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (3 <= 4) holds.
    `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (1 <= 2) holds. Possible.
  - `supy(x) <= supy(z)`:
    We have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (A3) and `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (B4) and `infy(y) < supy(y)` (C4).
    So `supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z)`. This chain implies `supy(x) < supy(y) <= supy(z)`, which certainly allows `supy(x) <= supy(z)` to hold. It is always implied that `supy(x) < supy(z)`.
  - Can `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)` hold simultaneously? Yes, as shown in the thought block example with intervals [1, 2] for x, [3, 4] for y, [0, 5] for z.
  Thus, B is a possible relation.

- `x N z`: Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
  From `y B z`, we have `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (B4). So `supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This implies `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
  From `x S y`, we have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (A3).
  For region x in REG, `infy(x) < supy(x)` (C2). So `infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y)`. This implies `infy(x) < infy(y)`.
  For region y in REG, `infy(y) < supy(y)` (C4).
  So we have the sequence of inequalities:
  `infy(y) < supy(y)`
  `supy(y) <= infy(x)` (required for N)
  `infy(x) < infy(y)` (derived from x S y and non-degeneracy)
  Combining these, we get `infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) < infy(y)`.
  This chain `infy(y) < ... < infy(y)` is a contradiction.
  Therefore, `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is impossible for regions in REG.
  Thus, N is an impossible relation.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relations between region x and region z are S and B.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, B}$.
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The given relations are:
1. x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. These relations are defined based on the bounds of the minimum bounding boxes of the regions.

Let's analyze the constraints on the bounds of x, y, and z:
(C1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(C2) supy(y) <= infy(x)
(C3) supy(z) <= infy(y)
(C4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(C5) supx(y) <= supx(z)

Also, for any region `a`, infx(a) <= supx(a) and infy(a) <= supy(a). For regions homeomorphic to a disk, the area is positive, implying infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's analyze the possible relations between x and z based on their x and y bounds, derived from the constraints C1-C5.

Y-axis relation between x and z:
From (C2) and (C3): supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Since infy(y) <= supy(y), we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(z) <= infy(x).
This means the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x. In other words, z is below or vertically aligned with the bottom edge of x's bounding box.

Let's check which y-conditions of the possible relations (from the given set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}) match supy(z) <= infy(x):
- S, SW, SE: require supy(a) <= infy(b). For (x,z), this is supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) unless the regions have zero height, which is not allowed. So, S, SW, SE are not possible.
- N, NW, NE: require supy(b) <= infy(a). For (x,z), this is supy(z) <= infy(x). This matches our finding and is always true given the initial relations. So, N, NW, NE are potentially possible.
- W, E, B: require infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). For (x,z), this is infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  If this condition holds, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We also know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
  Combining supy(x) <= supy(z) with supy(z) <= infy(x) gives supy(x) <= infy(x).
  This implies that the y-projection of x, [infy(x), supy(x)], must have supy(x) <= infy(x). For a region homeomorphic to a disk, infy(x) < supy(x). This is a contradiction.
  Therefore, the y-condition `infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)` is not possible. This rules out W, E, B.

Based on the y-axis analysis, the only possible relations between x and z are N, NW, or NE. These are the relations whose definition includes the y-condition supy(z) <= infy(x).

Now let's check the x-conditions for these remaining relations (N, NW, NE) based on constraints C1-C5.
We know:
(C1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(C4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(C5) supx(y) <= supx(z)

From infx(y) <= supx(y), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.

Check the x-conditions for N, NW, NE:
- N: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We know supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true. So, the x-condition for N is infx(z) <= infx(x).
  Is it possible to construct regions satisfying the initial relations such that infx(z) <= infx(x)?
  Let x = [3.5, 4] x [5, 6], y = [4.5, 5] x [2, 3], z = [3, 7] x [0, 1].
  infx(x)=3.5, supx(x)=4, infy(x)=5, supy(x)=6.
  infx(y)=4.5, supx(y)=5, infy(y)=2, supy(y)=3.
  infx(z)=3, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=0, supy(z)=1.
  Check x NW y: supx(x)<=infx(y) (4<=4.5) YES. supy(y)<=infy(x) (3<=5) YES. (x NW y holds).
  Check y N z: supy(z)<=infy(y) (1<=2) YES. infx(z)<=infx(y) (3<=4.5) YES. supx(y)<=supx(z) (5<=7) YES. (y N z holds).
  Check x N z x-condition: infx(z)<=infx(x) (3<=3.5) YES. supx(x)<=supx(z) (4<=7) YES.
  Since the x-condition for N is possible and the y-condition for N (supy(z) <= infy(x)) is always true, the relation x N z is possible.

- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z).
  Is it possible to construct regions satisfying the initial relations such that supx(x) <= infx(z)?
  Let x = [0, 1] x [3, 4], y = [2, 3] x [1.5, 2], z = [1.5, 4] x [0, 1].
  infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=3, supy(x)=4.
  infx(y)=2, supx(y)=3, infy(y)=1.5, supy(y)=2.
  infx(z)=1.5, supx(z)=4, infy(z)=0, supy(z)=1.
  Check x NW y: supx(x)<=infx(y) (1<=2) YES. supy(y)<=infy(x) (2<=3) YES. (x NW y holds).
  Check y N z: supy(z)<=infy(y) (1<=1.5) YES. infx(z)<=infx(y) (1.5<=2) YES. supx(y)<=supx(z) (3<=4) YES. (y N z holds).
  Check x NW z x-condition: supx(x)<=infx(z) (1<=1.5) YES.
  Since the x-condition for NW is possible and the y-condition for NW (supy(z) <= infy(x)) is always true, the relation x NW z is possible.

- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x).
  We know supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
  This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). For a region homeomorphic to a disk, infx(x) < supx(x). This is a contradiction.
  Therefore, the x-condition for NE is not possible. This rules out NE.

The only possible relations between x and z are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: W, NW
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: The given constraints are:
1. Region x is NW of region y (x NW y): supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. Region y is E of region z (y E z): supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z. Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds of region a.

From the constraints, we have the following inequalities:
(1a) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(1b) supy(y) <= infy(x)
(2a) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(2b) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(2c) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining (1b) and (2c), we get:
supy(y) <= infy(x)  and supy(y) <= supy(z)
This means infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(z) >= supy(y).

Combining (1a) and (2a), we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)
This means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y).

Since x and z are regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, they are non-degenerate, meaning infx < supx and infy < supy for any region.

Let's examine the y-coordinate relations between x and z for each possible cardinal direction relation.
The y-conditions for the relations are:
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z)
- SW: supy(x) <= infy(z)
- SE: supy(x) <= infy(z)
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertical overlap/containment)
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertical overlap/containment)
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertical containment)

Let's check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
From (1b), infy(x) >= supy(y). Since x is non-degenerate, supy(x) > infy(x).
Thus, supy(x) > infy(x) >= supy(y), which implies supy(x) > supy(y).
From (2b), infy(z) <= infy(y). Since y is non-degenerate, infy(y) <= supy(y).
Thus, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y).
So we have supy(x) > supy(y) and infy(z) <= supy(y).
If supy(x) <= infy(z) were true, then we would have supy(y) < supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(y).
This implies supy(y) < supy(y), which is a contradiction.
Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
This rules out S, SW, and SE.

Let's check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible.
infy(z) <= infy(x): From (2b), infy(z) <= infy(y). From (1b), infy(x) >= supy(y). Since y is non-degenerate, infy(y) <= supy(y). So infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) is always true.
supy(x) <= supy(z): We know supy(x) > infy(x) >= supy(y), so supy(x) > supy(y). We also know supy(z) >= supy(y) from (2c). It is possible to have supy(y) < supy(x) <= supy(z). For example, let supy(y)=5, supy(x)=8, supy(z)=10. This is consistent (8 > 5, 10 >= 5, 8 <= 10). We need to check if infy(x) and infy(z) can also satisfy the conditions. If supy(x)=8, infy(x) could be 7 (7 >= supy(y)=5). If supy(z)=10, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y)=5. Let infy(z)=4 (4 <= infy(y)). We need infy(z) <= infy(x), i.e., 4 <= 7, which is true.
So, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible.
This means E, W, and B might be possible depending on the x-conditions.

The x-conditions for the remaining relations (N, NE, NW, E, W, B) are:
- N: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (horizontal overlap/containment)
- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z)
- E: supx(z) <= infx(x) (and vertical overlap/containment, already checked as possible)
- W: supx(x) <= infx(z) (and vertical overlap/containment, already checked as possible)
- B: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (horizontal containment, and vertical containment, already checked as possible)

From (1a), supx(x) <= infx(y). From (2a), supx(z) <= infx(y).
There is no direct constraint on infx(x) or infx(z).

Let's check the horizontal relations:
- x is left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)): Possible. We have supx(x) <= infx(y). We can choose infx(z) such that infx(z) >= infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(y) <= infx(z). Or we can choose infx(z) < infx(y). Example: infx(y)=10, supx(x)=8. Let infx(z)=9. 8 <= 9. This is possible.
- x is right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)): Possible. We have supx(z) <= infx(y). No constraint on infx(x). We can choose infx(x) to be greater than supx(z). Example: supx(z)=5. Let infx(x)=6. 5 <= 6. This is possible.
- x overlaps z horizontally (infx(z) <= supx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(z)): Possible. infx(z) <= supx(x) is possible (e.g., infx(y)=10, supx(x)=8, supx(z)=5, infx(z)=0; 0 <= 8). infx(x) <= supx(z) is possible (e.g., infx(y)=10, supx(x)=8, supx(z)=15, infx(z)=0, infx(x)=1; 1 <= 15). Can both hold? Yes. Example: z=(0,0)-(10,10). y=(11,0)-(13,10). x NW y implies supx(x)<=11, infy(x)>=10. Pick x=(5,11)-(7,12). infx(x)=5, supx(x)=7, infy(x)=11, supy(x)=12. z=(0,0)-(10,10). infx(z)=0, supx(z)=10. infx(z)<=supx(x) (0<=7), infx(x)<=supx(z) (5<=10). Yes, possible.

Based on the possibility of horizontal and vertical relations:
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x) (possible) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (possible horizontal overlap). N is possible.
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x) (possible) AND supx(z) <= infx(x) (possible horizontal right). NE is possible.
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x) (possible) AND supx(x) <= infx(z) (possible horizontal left). NW is possible.
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (possible vertical overlap) AND supx(z) <= infx(x) (possible horizontal right). E is possible.
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (possible vertical overlap) AND supx(x) <= infx(z) (possible horizontal left). W is possible.
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (possible vertical containment) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (possible horizontal containment). B is possible.

We have constructed examples in the thought block showing that N, NE, NW, W, E, and B are all possible.
S, SW, SE are impossible due to the y-constraints.

Possible relations: N, NE, NW, W, E, B.

The order required is N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.
Possible relations in this order: N, NE, E, NW, W, B.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, E, NW, W, B}$.
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: N, S, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: NW, W, SW
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region r on the x and y axes, respectively. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, implying their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

We are given the relations:
1.  x NW y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2.  y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the relative positions of their bounding boxes.

From relation 1 (x NW y):
(1a) supx(y) <= infx(x) (The right edge of y is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of x)
(1b) supy(y) <= infy(x) (The top edge of y is below or aligned with the bottom edge of x)

From relation 2 (y NE z):
(2a) supx(z) <= infx(y) (The right edge of z is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of y)
(2b) supy(z) <= infy(y) (The top edge of z is below or aligned with the bottom edge of y)

Let's combine these inequalities to find relations between x and z.
Regarding x-coordinates:
From (2a), supx(z) <= infx(y). Since infx(y) <= supx(y) (because regions are non-degenerate), we have supx(z) <= supx(y).
From (1a), supx(y) <= infx(x).
Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which simplifies to:
supx(z) <= infx(x) (A)

Regarding y-coordinates:
From (2b), supy(z) <= infy(y). Since infy(y) <= supy(y) (because regions are non-degenerate), we have supy(z) <= supy(y).
From (1b), supy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which simplifies to:
supy(z) <= infy(x) (B)

Now we examine which cardinal relations between x and z are compatible with derived inequalities (A) and (B), keeping in mind that infx < supx and infy < supy for x and z.

Let's check the definitions of the possible relations for x R z:
x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If S holds, supx(x) <= supx(z). Combining with (A), supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies supx(x) <= infx(x). This contradicts non-degeneracy. S is not possible.

x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If SW holds, supx(x) <= infx(z). Combining with (A), supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x). For non-degenerate regions, this implies their x-intervals are disjoint or touch, with x left of z and z left of x, which is impossible. SW is not possible.

x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If W holds, supx(x) <= infx(z). Similar to SW, this is impossible for non-degenerate regions. W is not possible.

x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). (B) supy(z) <= infy(x) holds. (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If NW holds, supx(x) <= infx(z). Similar to SW, this is impossible for non-degenerate regions when combined with (A). NW is not possible.

x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). (B) supy(z) <= infy(x) holds. (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If N holds, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Combining supx(x) <= supx(z) with (A) supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x), contradicting non-degeneracy. N is not possible.

x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). These are precisely inequalities (A) and (B) derived from the premises. Thus, x NE z is a possible relation.

x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x) holds. (B) supy(z) <= infy(x). If E holds, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Combining supy(x) <= supy(z) with (B) supy(z) <= infy(x) implies supy(x) <= infy(x), contradicting non-degeneracy. E is not possible.

x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x) holds. (B) supy(z) <= infy(x). If SE holds, supy(x) <= infy(z). Combining supy(x) <= infy(z) with (B) supy(z) <= infy(x) implies supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(x) <= infy(x), contradicting non-degeneracy. SE is not possible.

x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If B holds, supx(x) <= supx(z). Combining with (A) implies supx(x) <= infx(x), contradicting non-degeneracy. B is not possible.

Based on the bounding box definitions and the assumption that regions in REG are non-degenerate, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

NE
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: B, N, NW, W
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: N, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: W, SW
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: S, SW, SE, W, E, B
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: S, SW
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: SW W NW
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. The relations are defined based on the infimum and supremum of their projections onto the x and y axes (their minimum bounding boxes).

We are given:
1.  x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's combine the given inequalities:
From (1), we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
From (2), we have supy(y) <= infy(z).
Since infy(y) <= supy(y) for any region in REG, we can combine these inequalities:
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
This gives us supy(x) <= infy(z). This means the supremum of the y-projection of x is less than or equal to the infimum of the y-projection of z. In terms of bounding boxes, the bounding box of x is entirely below or aligned with the bottom edge of the bounding box of z.

Now let's look at the x-coordinates. From (1) and (2):
supx(x) <= infx(y)
supx(z) <= infx(y)
This tells us that the supremum of the x-projection of x and the supremum of the x-projection of z are both less than or equal to the infimum of the x-projection of y.

Let's check which of the 9 single-tile relations between x and z are possible given these constraints.
The definitions of the relations are:
a B b: infx(b)<=infx(a), supx(a)<=supx(b), infy(b)<=infy(a), supy(a)<=supy(b)
a S b: supy(a)<=infy(b), infx(b)<=infx(a), supx(a)<=supx(b)
a SW b: supx(a)<=infx(b), supy(a)<=infy(b)
a W b: supx(a)<=infx(b), infy(b)<=infy(a), supy(a)<=supy(b)
a NW b: supx(a)<=infx(b), supy(b)<=infy(a)
a N b: supy(b)<=infy(a), infx(b)<=infx(a), supx(a)<=supx(b)
a NE b: supx(b)<=infx(a), supy(b)<=infy(a)
a E b: supx(b)<=infx(a), infy(b)<=infy(a), supy(a)<=supy(b)
a SE b: supx(b)<=infx(a), supy(a)<=infy(b)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z). Let a=x and b=z.
- Relations N, NW, NE require supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) for regions in REG (as infy(x) <= supy(x) and infy(z) <= supy(z)), unless x and z have zero extent in y or meet at a point, which is not the case for regions homeomorphic to a disk (infy < supy).
- Relations W, E, B require infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), this implies infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which forces infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z). This is impossible for regions in REG (infy < supy).

Thus, the only possible single-tile relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE, as these are the only ones whose definitions are consistent with supy(x) <= infy(z) for regions in REG.

Now we need to check if each of S, SW, and SE is actually possible given the full set of constraints (supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y), supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z)).

1.  Is x SW z possible? x SW z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We already know supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Is supx(x) <= infx(z) possible given supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)?
    Yes. Let y's bounding box be [0,1]x[0,1]. infx(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 0, supy(x) <= 0. Let x be region [-3,-2]x[-3,-2]. supx(x)=-2, supy(x)=-2. OK.
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 0, supy(y) <= infy(z). 1 <= infy(z). Let z be region [-1,0]x[2,3]. supx(z)=0, infy(z)=2. OK.
    Now check x vs z: x=[-3,-2]x[-3,-2], z=[-1,0]x[2,3].
    supx(x)=-2, infx(z)=-1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (-2 <= -1).
    supy(x)=-2, infy(z)=2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (-2 <= 2).
    Both conditions for x SW z are met. So SW is possible.

2.  Is x SE z possible? x SE z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We already know supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Is supx(z) <= infx(x) possible given supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)?
    Yes. Let y be [0,1]x[0,1].
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 0, supy(x) <= 0. Let x be region [-1,0]x[-1,0]. supx(x)=0, supy(x)=0. OK.
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 0, supy(y) <= infy(z). 1 <= infy(z). Let z be region [-2,-1]x[2,3]. supx(z)=-1, infy(z)=2. OK.
    Now check x vs z: x=[-1,0]x[-1,0], z=[-2,-1]x[2,3].
    supx(z)=-1, infx(x)=-1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (-1 <= -1).
    supy(x)=0, infy(z)=2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (0 <= 2).
    Both conditions for x SE z are met. So SE is possible.

3.  Is x S z possible? x S z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We already know supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Is infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) possible given supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)?
    Yes. Let y be [0,1]x[0,1].
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 0, supy(x) <= 0. Let x be region [-1.5,-0.5]x[-1.5,-0.5]. supx(x)=-0.5, supy(x)=-0.5. OK.
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 0, supy(y) <= infy(z). 1 <= infy(z). Let z be region [-2,-0.1]x[2,3]. supx(z)=-0.1, infy(z)=2. OK.
    Now check x vs z: x=[-1.5,-0.5]x[-1.5,-0.5], z=[-2,-0.1]x[2,3].
    supy(x)=-1.5, infy(z)=2. supy(x) <= infy(z).
    infx(z)=-2, infx(x)=-1.5. infx(z) <= infx(x) (-2 <= -1.5).
    supx(x)=-0.5, supx(z)=-0.1. supx(x) <= supx(z) (-0.5 <= -0.1).
    All conditions for x S z are met. So S is possible.

We have shown that S, SW, and SE are the only single-tile relations possible between x and z, based on the provided definitions and the constraints derived from the premise. We have also provided examples demonstrating that each of these three relations can indeed occur.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW, SE}$.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: SW S B
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, B
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: SE S E W SW B
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: Let the bounding box of region 'a' be denoted by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. The definitions of the relations are given in terms of these bounds. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies they have positive width and height, so infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

We are given:
1.  x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's combine the inequalities:
From (1):
(A) supx(y) <= infx(x)
(B) supy(x) <= infy(y)

From (2):
(C) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(D) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(E) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Consider the x-coordinates:
From (C) and (A): supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
Since infx(y) <= supx(y) (as y is a region with positive width), we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is a necessary condition.

Let's check which relations between x and z require supx(z) <= infx(x):
B: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (Could hold)
S: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z) (Could hold)
SW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z) (Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), this gives supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then infx(x) > supx(z) >= infx(z) >= supx(x). This is a contradiction as supx(x) > infx(x). SW is impossible.)
W: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible by the same argument as SW. W is impossible.)
NW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x) (Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible by the same argument as SW. NW is impossible.)
N: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z) (Could hold)
NE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x) (Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Possible)
E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Possible)
SE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z) (Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Possible)

So, W, NW, SW are impossible. The remaining candidates are B, S, N, NE, E, SE.

Consider B, S, N: These relations require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for the x-coordinates (or part of it).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x). If also supx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is only possible for a region with zero width (a vertical line), but regions in REG have positive width. Thus, supx(x) > infx(x) must hold.
Therefore, B, S, and N are impossible.

The remaining candidates are NE, E, SE. All of these require supx(z) <= infx(x), which we know is always true.

Now consider the y-coordinates using (B), (D), (E):
(B) supy(x) <= infy(y)
(D) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(E) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Check NE (x NE z): Requires supy(z) <= infy(x).
Assume supy(z) <= infy(x).
From (E), supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(y) <= infy(x).
From (B), supy(x) <= infy(y).
So we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
Since x and y have positive height, infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(y) < supy(y).
If infy(x) < infy(y), then supy(y) <= infy(x) < infy(y), which means supy(y) < infy(y), a contradiction.
If infy(y) < infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(y) < infy(x), which means supy(x) < infy(x), a contradiction.
If infy(x) = infy(y), then supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(x). This implies supy(y) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(x). Since supy > infy for regions with positive height, this is a contradiction.
Therefore, the assumption supy(z) <= infy(x) must be false.
This means NE is impossible.

The remaining candidates are E and SE.

Check SE (x SE z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z).
We know supy(x) <= infy(y) from (B) and infy(z) <= infy(y) from (D).
Is it possible to have supy(x) <= infy(z)? Yes, if infy(y) is chosen appropriately.
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[0,1]. Then infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= infx(x). supy(x) <= infy(y) => supy(x) <= 0.
Let x = [2,3]x[-2,-1]. Then infx(x)=2, supx(x)=3, infy(x)=-2, supy(x)=-1. Conditions met (1<=2, -1<=0).
y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => supx(z) <= 0. infy(z) <= infy(y) => infy(z) <= 0. supy(y) <= supy(z) => 1 <= supy(z).
Let z = [-3,-1]x[-1,2]. Then infx(z)=-3, supx(z)=-1, infy(z)=-1, supy(z)=2. Conditions met (-1<=0, -1<=0, 1<=2).
Now check x SE z for x=[2,3]x[-2,-1] and z=[-3,-1]x[-1,2]:
supx(z) <= infx(x) => -1 <= 2 (True).
supy(x) <= infy(z) => -1 <= -1 (True).
Since both conditions for SE are met, SE is a possible relation.

Check E (x E z): Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is always true.
Is it possible to have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)?
From (B) supy(x) <= infy(y), (D) infy(z) <= infy(y), (E) supy(y) <= supy(z).
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[1,2]. Then infy(y)=1, supy(y)=2.
x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= infx(x). supy(x) <= infy(y) => supy(x) <= 1.
Let x = [2,3]x[0,1]. Then infx(x)=2, supx(x)=3, infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1. Conditions met (1<=2, 1<=1).
y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => supx(z) <= 0. infy(z) <= infy(y) => infy(z) <= 1. supy(y) <= supy(z) => 2 <= supy(z).
Let z = [-2,-1]x[-1,3]. Then infx(z)=-2, supx(z)=-1, infy(z)=-1, supy(z)=3. Conditions met (-1<=0, -1<=1, 2<=3).
Now check x E z for x=[2,3]x[0,1] and z=[-2,-1]x[-1,3]:
supx(z) <= infx(x) => -1 <= 2 (True).
infy(z) <= infy(x) => -1 <= 0 (True).
supy(x) <= supy(z) => 1 <= 3 (True).
Since all three conditions for E are met, E is a possible relation.

The possible relations are E and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, SE}$.
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: S, SE
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: NE, SE, E
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: S, SW, SE
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: Let the regions be denoted by their minimum bounding boxes. For a region $a$, let its bounding box be $[infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$. Since regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, their bounding boxes must have positive width and height, i.e., $infx(a) < supx(a)$ and $infy(a) < supy(a)$ for any region $a$ in REG.

The given relations are:
1.  $x$ SE $y$: $supx(y) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(y)$.
2.  $y$ SE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(z)$.

We want to find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$. Let's combine the inequalities from the given relations.

From the x-coordinates:
$supx(z) \le infx(y)$ (from $y$ SE $z$)
$infx(y) < supx(y)$ (since $y$ is a region in REG)
$supx(y) \le infx(x)$ (from $x$ SE $y$)

Combining these, we get $supx(z) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
This implies $supx(z) < infx(x)$. (If we use non-strict inequalities throughout the combination $supx(z) \le infx(y) \le supx(y) \le infx(x)$, we get $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. Equality $supx(z) = infx(x)$ is possible if $infx(y) = supx(y)$ and $supx(y) = infx(x)$, but $infx(y) < supx(y)$ for a region in REG. So $supx(z) < infx(x)$ must hold if there is non-zero width between the regions. The strict inequality $supx(z) < infx(x)$ holds unless $y$ is a vertical line segment which is not allowed. Using non-strict inequalities from the definition: $supx(z) \le infx(y) \le supx(y) \le infx(x)$. Since $infx(y) < supx(y)$, at least one of the $\le$ must effectively be $<$, unless $supx(z)=infx(y)$ and $supx(y)=infx(x)$ and $infx(y)=supx(y)$, which is impossible. Let's stick to the conclusion from $supx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le infx(x)$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$).

From the y-coordinates:
$supy(x) \le infy(y)$ (from $x$ SE $y$)
$infy(y) < supy(y)$ (since $y$ is a region in REG)
$supy(y) \le infy(z)$ (from $y$ SE $z$)

Combining these, we get $supy(x) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(z)$.
This implies $supy(x) < infy(z)$. (Similar reasoning as above, using non-strict inequalities from the definition leads to $supy(x) \le infy(z)$).

So, any possible relation between $x$ and $z$ must satisfy the conditions:
$supx(z) \le infx(x)$ (A)
$supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (B)

Let's check which of the single-tile cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ are possible given these two conditions. The definition of a relation $a\ R\ b$ is given based on the bounding box coordinates. We are checking for $x\ R\ z$.

-   $x$ B $z$: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Condition (A) $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ contradicts $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ for regions with positive width ($infx(x) < supx(x)$ and $infx(z) < supx(z)$). For $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ to both hold, we'd need $supx(x) \le supx(z) \le infx(x)$. Since $infx(x) \le supx(x)$ must hold, this forces $infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z)$. This means $x$'s bounding box has zero width, which is not allowed for regions in REG. Thus, B is not possible.

-   $x$ S $z$: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    Condition (B) $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ matches the first part. However, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ is required, which contradicts (A) $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ for regions in REG (as shown for B). Thus, S is not possible.

-   $x$ SW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
    Condition (B) $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ matches the second part. However, $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is required. Our derived condition is $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. For $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ to hold, we'd need $supx(x) \le infx(z) \le supx(z) \le infx(x)$. Since $infx(z) \le supx(z)$ must hold, this implies overlap or touching. If $infx(z) < supx(z)$ and $infx(x) < supx(x)$, these conditions $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ generally conflict. Specifically, if $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, then $z$'s right edge is left of or touching $x$'s left edge. If $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, then $x$'s right edge is left of or touching $z$'s left edge. These can only both be true if the regions' x-intervals are on top of each other, with zero width, or if one is a point. Since regions have positive width, SW is not possible.

-   $x$ W $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, which contradicts (A) $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ for regions in REG. Thus, W is not possible.

-   $x$ NW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, which contradicts (A) $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ for regions in REG. Thus, NW is not possible.

-   $x$ N $z$: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    Requires $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, which contradicts (A) $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ for regions in REG. Thus, N is not possible.

-   $x$ NE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    Condition (A) $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ matches the first part. Requires $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. We derived $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. So, we need to check if $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ can both hold for regions with positive height ($infy < supy$). If both hold, $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. Since $infy(x) \le supy(x)$ and $infy(z) \le supy(z)$ must hold, we get $infy(x) \le supy(x) \le infy(z) \le supy(z) \le infy(x)$. This implies $infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z)$, meaning both x and z's bounding boxes have zero height at the same y-coordinate, which is not allowed for regions in REG. Thus, NE is not possible.

-   $x$ E $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Condition (A) $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ matches the first part. Requires $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$. We derived $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. So, we need to check if $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ and $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ can both hold. If both hold, $supy(x) \le infy(z) \le infy(x)$. Since $infy(x) \le supy(x)$ must hold, this implies $supy(x) = infy(z) = infy(x)$. This means $x$'s bounding box has zero height, which is not allowed for regions in REG. Thus, E is not possible.

-   $x$ SE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
    These are exactly the conditions we derived from the premises ($x$ SE $y$ and $y$ SE $z$). Since we derived these conditions from the definitions using non-strict inequalities and the properties of regions in REG (positive width/height), they are necessary. We have also shown by example (e.g., $z=[0,1]\times[0,1]$, $y=[2,3]\times[-2,-1]$, $x=[4,5]\times[-4,-3]$) that these conditions can be met by regions satisfying $x$ SE $y$ and $y$ SE $z$, and in that case, $x$ SE $z$ holds.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box inequalities and the constraint that regions in REG have positive width and height bounding boxes, only the SE relation is possible between x and z.

The final answer is $\boxed{SE}$.
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: NE, E, SE
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: B S SE
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: N, NE
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: N, NE, E, W, NW, B
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: NE, E
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, B
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: N, NE, NW
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by the intervals [infx(a), supx(a)] on the x-axis and [infy(a), supy(a)] on the y-axis.

The given conditions are:
1. Region x is NE of region y:
   supx(y) <= infx(x)  (1a)
   supy(y) <= infy(x)  (1b)

2. Region y is SW of region z:
   supx(z) <= infx(y)  (2a)
   supy(z) <= infy(y)  (2b)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's combine the inequalities from (1) and (2):

From (1a) and (2a):
infx(x) >= supx(y)
infx(y) >= supx(z)
Since infx(y) <= supx(y) for any non-degenerate region, we have:
infx(x) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= supx(z)
This chain of inequalities implies:
infx(x) >= supx(z)
Which can be written as:
supx(z) <= infx(x)  (3a)

From (1b) and (2b):
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(y) >= supy(z)
Since infy(y) <= supy(y) for any non-degenerate region, we have:
infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= supy(z)
This chain of inequalities implies:
infy(x) >= supy(z)
Which can be written as:
supy(z) <= infy(x)  (3b)

The regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are non-degenerate regions with positive area. For such regions, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Now let's check which of the possible cardinal relations between x and z are consistent with the derived inequalities (3a) and (3b).

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
  These are exactly the inequalities (3a) and (3b) we derived. So, NE is a possible relation.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  The first inequality supy(z) <= infy(x) is true (3b).
  The second and third inequalities, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), mean that the x-projection of x is contained within or equal to the x-projection of z, i.e., [infx(x), supx(x)] is contained in [infx(z), supx(z)].
  However, from the chain derived for the x-axis, infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
  This implies supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
  For supx(x) <= supx(z) to also be true, given supx(z) <= supx(x), we must have supx(x) = supx(z).
  This forces infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(y) = supx(y). This means the x-projections of x and y are points, located at supx(z). This contradicts the assumption that regions are non-degenerate. Thus, N is not possible for non-degenerate regions.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  The first inequality supx(z) <= infx(x) is true (3a).
  The second inequality infy(z) <= infy(x) is true from the chain derived for the y-axis: infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
  The third inequality supy(x) <= supy(z) means that the y-projection of x is contained within or equal to the y-projection of z, i.e., [infy(x), supy(x)] is contained in [infy(z), supy(z)].
  However, from the chain derived for the y-axis, supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
  For supy(x) <= supy(z) to also be true, we must have supy(x) = supy(z).
  This forces infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y). This means the y-projections of x and y are points, located at supy(z). This contradicts non-degeneracy. Thus, E is not possible.

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  This requires both the x-projection and y-projection of x to be contained within the respective projections of z. As shown for N and E, this is only possible in degenerate cases. Thus, B is not possible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
  The first inequality supx(z) <= infx(x) is true (3a).
  The second inequality supy(x) <= infy(z).
  From the y-axis chain, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
  Also, for a non-degenerate region z, infy(z) <= supy(z).
  So we have supy(x) >= infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= supy(z) >= infy(z).
  For supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true, given supy(x) >= infy(z), we must have supy(x) = infy(z).
  This requires all intermediate values in the chain to be equal: supy(x) = infy(x) = supy(y) = infy(y) = supy(z) = infy(z). This means all y-projections are the same point. This contradicts non-degeneracy. Thus, SE is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
  The second inequality supy(z) <= infy(x) is true (3b).
  The first inequality supx(x) <= infx(z).
  From the x-axis chain, infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
  For supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, given supx(x) >= infx(z), we must have supx(x) = infx(z).
  This requires all intermediate values in the chain to be equal: supx(x) = infx(x) = supx(y) = infx(y) = supx(z) = infx(z). This means all x-projections are the same point. This contradicts non-degeneracy. Thus, NW is not possible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
  Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), which is impossible for non-degenerate regions as shown for SE. Thus, S is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), which is impossible for non-degenerate regions as shown for NW. Thus, W is not possible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both conditions were shown to be impossible for non-degenerate regions. Thus, SW is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the constraint that the regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (i.e., non-degenerate), the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

NE

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: NE, SE, E
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: N, NE, E, B
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: N, NW, W, SW
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Let MBB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their minimum bounding boxes have positive width and height, i.e., infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any a in REG.

We are given two relations:
1) x B y
According to the definition, x B y if and only if:
infx(y) <= infx(x)  (1)
supx(x) <= supx(y)  (2)
infy(y) <= infy(x)  (3)
supy(x) <= supy(y)  (4)
This means the MBB of x is contained within the MBB of y.

2) y SW z
According to the definition, y SW z if and only if:
supx(y) <= infx(z)  (5)
supy(y) <= infy(z)  (6)
This means the MBB of y is to the southwest of or touching the MBB of z.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the given set of single-tile cardinal directions. Let's combine the inequalities to relate the bounding box of x to the bounding box of z.

From (2) and (5):
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
So, supx(x) <= infx(z)  (A)

From (4) and (6):
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
So, supy(x) <= infy(z)  (B)

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible relations between x and z based on the relative positions of their MBBs.

The relation x SW z is defined as:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
Our derived inequalities (A) and (B) match this definition exactly. Therefore, x SW z is always true if x B y and y SW z.

Now we check if any other relation from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B} could also be true.
Let's consider the relations based on horizontal and vertical alignments:

Horizontal relation derived: supx(x) <= infx(z). This means the right edge of x's MBB is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of z's MBB.
This condition is satisfied by relations W, NW, SW.
Relations N, S, B require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (horizontal overlap or containment).
Relations E, NE, SE require supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is to the west of or touching the left edge of x's MBB).

Vertical relation derived: supy(x) <= infy(z). This means the top edge of x's MBB is below or aligned with the bottom edge of z's MBB.
This condition is satisfied by relations S, SE, SW.
Relations N, NE, NW require supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is to the south of or touching the bottom edge of x's MBB).
Relations E, W, B require infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertical overlap or containment).

Combining the constraints:
Possible horizontal relations are W, NW, SW.
Possible vertical relations are S, SE, SW.

The only relation consistent with both sets of possibilities is SW. Let's formally rule out the others using the fact that regions in REG have MBBs with positive width and height.

Consider x S z: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) (holds), AND infx(z) <= infx(x), AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have supx(x) <= infx(z) from (A).
If x S z also holds, we must have supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Since regions in REG have positive width, supx(x) > infx(x). This is a contradiction. So x S z is not possible.

Consider x W z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) (holds), AND infy(z) <= infy(x), AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have supy(x) <= infy(z) from (B).
If x W z also holds, we must have supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x). Since regions in REG have positive height, supy(x) > infy(x). This is a contradiction. So x W z is not possible.

Consider x B z: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
Requires infx(z) <= infx(x). Combined with supx(x) <= infx(z), this leads to supx(x) <= infx(x), a contradiction.
Requires infy(z) <= infy(x). Combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), this leads to supy(x) <= infy(x), a contradiction.
So x B z is not possible.

Consider x N z: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
Requires infx(z) <= infx(x). Combined with supx(x) <= infx(z), this leads to supx(x) <= infx(x), a contradiction.
So x N z is not possible.

Consider x E z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). We know supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), implying supx(x) <= infx(x), a contradiction.
So x E z is not possible.

Consider x NW z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) (holds), AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
We have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). So supy(x) <= supy(z).
If x NW z also holds, supy(z) <= infy(x). Then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), implying supy(x) <= infy(x), a contradiction.
So x NW z is not possible.

Consider x NE z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown for E, this leads to a contradiction.
So x NE z is not possible.

Consider x SE z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), AND supy(x) <= infy(z) (holds).
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown for E, this leads to a contradiction.
So x SE z is not possible.

Since the conditions x B y and y SW z imply supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), the definition of x SW z is always satisfied. We have also shown that assuming any other relation holds would lead to a contradiction with the properties of regions in REG.
Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW}$.
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: Let the bounding box of a region $a$ be denoted by $BB(a) = [\infx(a), \supx(a)] \times [\infy(a), \supy(a)]$.
The regions belong to REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This implies that for any region $a$ in REG, its projections on the x and y axes are closed intervals of non-zero length. Thus, for any $a \in REG$, we have $\infx(a) < \supx(a)$ and $\infy(a) < \supy(a)$.

We are given two premises:
1.  $x$ B $y$:
    $\infx(y) \le \infx(x)$
    $\supx(x) \le \supx(y)$
    $\infy(y) \le \infy(x)$
    $\supy(x) \le \supy(y)$
    This means the bounding box of $x$ is contained within the bounding box of $y$.

2.  $y$ NE $z$:
    $\supx(z) \le \infx(y)$
    $\supy(z) \le \infy(y)$
    This means the bounding box of $y$ is North-East of or touching the bounding box of $z$.

Let's combine these inequalities to find relationships between $x$ and $z$:
From $y$ NE $z$ and $x$ B $y$:
$\supx(z) \le \infx(y) \le \infx(x) \implies \supx(z) \le \infx(x)$ (Derived condition 1)
$\supy(z) \le \infy(y) \le \infy(x) \implies \supy(z) \le \infy(x)$ (Derived condition 2)

We also know that for any region $a \in \{x, y, z\}$, $\infx(a) < \supx(a)$ and $\infy(a) < \supy(a)$.

Now, let's check each possible cardinal direction relation between $x$ and $z$ based on their definitions and the derived conditions:

1.  $x$ B $z$: $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$, $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$.
    From Derived condition 1: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$.
    Combining with the B condition $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$: $\supx(x) \le \supx(z) \le \infx(x)$.
    Since $x \in REG$, $\infx(x) < \supx(x)$.
    So, $\supx(x) \le \infx(x)$ and $\infx(x) < \supx(x)$ is a contradiction.
    B is not possible.

2.  $x$ S $z$: $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$.
    From Derived condition 2: $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
    Since $x \in REG$, $\infy(x) < \supy(x)$, so $\infy(x) \le \supy(x) - \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon > 0$.
    So, $\supy(z) \le \infy(x) < \supy(x)$. Thus $\supy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    Since $z \in REG$, $\infy(z) < supy(z)$.
    Combining: $\infy(z) < \supy(z) < \supy(x)$. Thus $\infy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    The S relation requires $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$. This contradicts $\infy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    S is not possible. (We could also use the horizontal contradiction from B for the $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$ part).

3.  $x$ SW $z$: $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$.
    From Derived condition 1: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$.
    Since $x \in REG$, $\infx(x) < \supx(x)$, so $\infx(x) \le \supx(x) - \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon > 0$.
    So, $\supx(z) \le \infx(x) < \supx(x)$. Thus $\supx(z) < \supx(x)$.
    Since $z \in REG$, $\infx(z) < supx(z)$.
    Combining: $\infx(z) < \supx(z) < \supx(x)$. Thus $\infx(z) < \supx(x)$.
    The SW relation requires $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$. This contradicts $\infx(z) < \supx(x)$.
    SW is not possible. (The vertical condition $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$ also leads to a contradiction as in S).

4.  $x$ W $z$: $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$.
    Horizontal contradiction $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$ as in SW.
    W is not possible.

5.  $x$ NW $z$: $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
    Horizontal contradiction $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$ as in SW.
    NW is not possible. (The vertical condition $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$ is Derived condition 2, which is true).

6.  $x$ N $z$: $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$.
    Vertical condition $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$ is Derived condition 2, which is true.
    Horizontal contradiction $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$ as in B.
    N is not possible.

7.  $x$ NE $z$: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
    These are exactly Derived conditions 1 and 2. These conditions are always true given the premises.
    NE is a possible relation. We can construct examples where x is strictly inside y's bounding box and y is strictly NE of z's bounding box, in which case the inequalities become strict, and NE is still satisfied.

8.  $x$ E $z$: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, infy(z) $\le$ infy(x), supy(x) $\le$ supy(z).
    Horizontal condition $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$ is Derived condition 1, which is true.
    From Derived condition 2: $\supy(z) \le \infy(y) \le \infy(x)$. Since $z \in REG$, $\infy(z) < supy(z)$.
    Combining: $\infy(z) < \supy(z) \le \infy(x)$. Thus $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$ is true.
    Need $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$.
    From Derived condition 2: $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
    Since $x \in REG$, $\infy(x) < supy(x)$.
    Combining: $\supy(z) \le \infy(x) < \supy(x)$. Thus $\supy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    The E relation requires $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$. This contradicts $\supy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    E is not possible.

9.  $x$ SE $z$: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$.
    Horizontal condition $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$ is Derived condition 1, which is true.
    Vertical contradiction $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$ as in S and SW.
    SE is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the constraint that regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (implying non-degenerate projections), the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
