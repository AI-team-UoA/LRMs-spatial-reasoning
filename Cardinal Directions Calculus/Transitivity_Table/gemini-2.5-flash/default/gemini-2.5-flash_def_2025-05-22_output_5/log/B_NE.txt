PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region $a$ be denoted by $BB(a) = [\infx(a), \supx(a)] \times [\infy(a), \supy(a)]$.
The regions belong to REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This implies that for any region $a$ in REG, its projections on the x and y axes are closed intervals of non-zero length. Thus, for any $a \in REG$, we have $\infx(a) < \supx(a)$ and $\infy(a) < \supy(a)$.

We are given two premises:
1.  $x$ B $y$:
    $\infx(y) \le \infx(x)$
    $\supx(x) \le \supx(y)$
    $\infy(y) \le \infy(x)$
    $\supy(x) \le \supy(y)$
    This means the bounding box of $x$ is contained within the bounding box of $y$.

2.  $y$ NE $z$:
    $\supx(z) \le \infx(y)$
    $\supy(z) \le \infy(y)$
    This means the bounding box of $y$ is North-East of or touching the bounding box of $z$.

Let's combine these inequalities to find relationships between $x$ and $z$:
From $y$ NE $z$ and $x$ B $y$:
$\supx(z) \le \infx(y) \le \infx(x) \implies \supx(z) \le \infx(x)$ (Derived condition 1)
$\supy(z) \le \infy(y) \le \infy(x) \implies \supy(z) \le \infy(x)$ (Derived condition 2)

We also know that for any region $a \in \{x, y, z\}$, $\infx(a) < \supx(a)$ and $\infy(a) < \supy(a)$.

Now, let's check each possible cardinal direction relation between $x$ and $z$ based on their definitions and the derived conditions:

1.  $x$ B $z$: $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$, $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$.
    From Derived condition 1: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$.
    Combining with the B condition $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$: $\supx(x) \le \supx(z) \le \infx(x)$.
    Since $x \in REG$, $\infx(x) < \supx(x)$.
    So, $\supx(x) \le \infx(x)$ and $\infx(x) < \supx(x)$ is a contradiction.
    B is not possible.

2.  $x$ S $z$: $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$.
    From Derived condition 2: $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
    Since $x \in REG$, $\infy(x) < \supy(x)$, so $\infy(x) \le \supy(x) - \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon > 0$.
    So, $\supy(z) \le \infy(x) < \supy(x)$. Thus $\supy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    Since $z \in REG$, $\infy(z) < supy(z)$.
    Combining: $\infy(z) < \supy(z) < \supy(x)$. Thus $\infy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    The S relation requires $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$. This contradicts $\infy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    S is not possible. (We could also use the horizontal contradiction from B for the $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$ part).

3.  $x$ SW $z$: $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$.
    From Derived condition 1: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$.
    Since $x \in REG$, $\infx(x) < \supx(x)$, so $\infx(x) \le \supx(x) - \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon > 0$.
    So, $\supx(z) \le \infx(x) < \supx(x)$. Thus $\supx(z) < \supx(x)$.
    Since $z \in REG$, $\infx(z) < supx(z)$.
    Combining: $\infx(z) < \supx(z) < \supx(x)$. Thus $\infx(z) < \supx(x)$.
    The SW relation requires $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$. This contradicts $\infx(z) < \supx(x)$.
    SW is not possible. (The vertical condition $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$ also leads to a contradiction as in S).

4.  $x$ W $z$: $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$.
    Horizontal contradiction $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$ as in SW.
    W is not possible.

5.  $x$ NW $z$: $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$, $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
    Horizontal contradiction $\supx(x) \le \infx(z)$ as in SW.
    NW is not possible. (The vertical condition $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$ is Derived condition 2, which is true).

6.  $x$ N $z$: $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$, $\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$.
    Vertical condition $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$ is Derived condition 2, which is true.
    Horizontal contradiction $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$ as in B.
    N is not possible.

7.  $x$ NE $z$: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
    These are exactly Derived conditions 1 and 2. These conditions are always true given the premises.
    NE is a possible relation. We can construct examples where x is strictly inside y's bounding box and y is strictly NE of z's bounding box, in which case the inequalities become strict, and NE is still satisfied.

8.  $x$ E $z$: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, infy(z) $\le$ infy(x), supy(x) $\le$ supy(z).
    Horizontal condition $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$ is Derived condition 1, which is true.
    From Derived condition 2: $\supy(z) \le \infy(y) \le \infy(x)$. Since $z \in REG$, $\infy(z) < supy(z)$.
    Combining: $\infy(z) < \supy(z) \le \infy(x)$. Thus $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$ is true.
    Need $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$.
    From Derived condition 2: $\supy(z) \le \infy(x)$.
    Since $x \in REG$, $\infy(x) < supy(x)$.
    Combining: $\supy(z) \le \infy(x) < \supy(x)$. Thus $\supy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    The E relation requires $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$. This contradicts $\supy(z) < \supy(x)$.
    E is not possible.

9.  $x$ SE $z$: $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$, $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$.
    Horizontal condition $\supx(z) \le \infx(x)$ is Derived condition 1, which is true.
    Vertical contradiction $\supy(x) \le \infy(z)$ as in S and SW.
    SE is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the constraint that regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (implying non-degenerate projections), the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
