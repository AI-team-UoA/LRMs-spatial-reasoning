PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of region 'a' be denoted by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. The definitions of the relations are given in terms of these bounds. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies they have positive width and height, so infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

We are given:
1.  x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's combine the inequalities:
From (1):
(A) supx(y) <= infx(x)
(B) supy(x) <= infy(y)

From (2):
(C) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(D) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(E) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Consider the x-coordinates:
From (C) and (A): supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
Since infx(y) <= supx(y) (as y is a region with positive width), we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is a necessary condition.

Let's check which relations between x and z require supx(z) <= infx(x):
B: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (Could hold)
S: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z) (Could hold)
SW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z) (Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), this gives supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then infx(x) > supx(z) >= infx(z) >= supx(x). This is a contradiction as supx(x) > infx(x). SW is impossible.)
W: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible by the same argument as SW. W is impossible.)
NW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x) (Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible by the same argument as SW. NW is impossible.)
N: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z) (Could hold)
NE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x) (Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Possible)
E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Possible)
SE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z) (Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Possible)

So, W, NW, SW are impossible. The remaining candidates are B, S, N, NE, E, SE.

Consider B, S, N: These relations require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) for the x-coordinates (or part of it).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x). If also supx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is only possible for a region with zero width (a vertical line), but regions in REG have positive width. Thus, supx(x) > infx(x) must hold.
Therefore, B, S, and N are impossible.

The remaining candidates are NE, E, SE. All of these require supx(z) <= infx(x), which we know is always true.

Now consider the y-coordinates using (B), (D), (E):
(B) supy(x) <= infy(y)
(D) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(E) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Check NE (x NE z): Requires supy(z) <= infy(x).
Assume supy(z) <= infy(x).
From (E), supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(y) <= infy(x).
From (B), supy(x) <= infy(y).
So we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
Since x and y have positive height, infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(y) < supy(y).
If infy(x) < infy(y), then supy(y) <= infy(x) < infy(y), which means supy(y) < infy(y), a contradiction.
If infy(y) < infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(y) < infy(x), which means supy(x) < infy(x), a contradiction.
If infy(x) = infy(y), then supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(x). This implies supy(y) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(x). Since supy > infy for regions with positive height, this is a contradiction.
Therefore, the assumption supy(z) <= infy(x) must be false.
This means NE is impossible.

The remaining candidates are E and SE.

Check SE (x SE z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z).
We know supy(x) <= infy(y) from (B) and infy(z) <= infy(y) from (D).
Is it possible to have supy(x) <= infy(z)? Yes, if infy(y) is chosen appropriately.
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[0,1]. Then infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= infx(x). supy(x) <= infy(y) => supy(x) <= 0.
Let x = [2,3]x[-2,-1]. Then infx(x)=2, supx(x)=3, infy(x)=-2, supy(x)=-1. Conditions met (1<=2, -1<=0).
y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => supx(z) <= 0. infy(z) <= infy(y) => infy(z) <= 0. supy(y) <= supy(z) => 1 <= supy(z).
Let z = [-3,-1]x[-1,2]. Then infx(z)=-3, supx(z)=-1, infy(z)=-1, supy(z)=2. Conditions met (-1<=0, -1<=0, 1<=2).
Now check x SE z for x=[2,3]x[-2,-1] and z=[-3,-1]x[-1,2]:
supx(z) <= infx(x) => -1 <= 2 (True).
supy(x) <= infy(z) => -1 <= -1 (True).
Since both conditions for SE are met, SE is a possible relation.

Check E (x E z): Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is always true.
Is it possible to have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)?
From (B) supy(x) <= infy(y), (D) infy(z) <= infy(y), (E) supy(y) <= supy(z).
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[1,2]. Then infy(y)=1, supy(y)=2.
x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= infx(x). supy(x) <= infy(y) => supy(x) <= 1.
Let x = [2,3]x[0,1]. Then infx(x)=2, supx(x)=3, infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1. Conditions met (1<=2, 1<=1).
y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) => supx(z) <= 0. infy(z) <= infy(y) => infy(z) <= 1. supy(y) <= supy(z) => 2 <= supy(z).
Let z = [-2,-1]x[-1,3]. Then infx(z)=-2, supx(z)=-1, infy(z)=-1, supy(z)=3. Conditions met (-1<=0, -1<=1, 2<=3).
Now check x E z for x=[2,3]x[0,1] and z=[-2,-1]x[-1,3]:
supx(z) <= infx(x) => -1 <= 2 (True).
infy(z) <= infy(x) => -1 <= 0 (True).
supy(x) <= supy(z) => 1 <= 3 (True).
Since all three conditions for E are met, E is a possible relation.

The possible relations are E and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, SE}$.
