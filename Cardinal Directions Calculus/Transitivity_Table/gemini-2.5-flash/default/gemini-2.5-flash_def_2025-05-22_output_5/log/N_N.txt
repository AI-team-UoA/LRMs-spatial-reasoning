PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), and supy(a) denote the bounds of the projection of a region a on the x and y axes, respectively. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies that for any region a in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

The definitions of the relations are given as:
a N b <=> supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
a S b <=> supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
a W b <=> supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
a E b <=> supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b <=> supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
a NE b <=> supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
a SW b <=> supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
a SE b <=> supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)
a B b <=> infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)

We are given:
1. x N y:
   (1) supy(y) <= infy(x)
   (2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
   (3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. y N z:
   (4) supy(z) <= infy(y)
   (5) infx(z) <= infx(y)
   (6) supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations R between x and z (x R z).

Combine the y-inequalities:
From (4) and (1): supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Since infy(y) <= supy(y) for any region, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x). This is the North condition in the y-direction.
Also, using infy(z) <= supy(z) and infy(x) <= supy(x), the chain becomes infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
This implies infy(z) <= infy(x).

Combine the x-inequalities:
From (5) and (2): infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x). Thus, infx(z) <= infx(x).
From (3) and (6): supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z). Thus, supx(x) <= supx(z).
The conditions infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) together mean the projection of x on the x-axis, [infx(x), supx(x)], is contained within or equal to the projection of z on the x-axis, [infx(z), supx(z)].

So, from x N y and y N z, we derive the following necessary conditions for x R z:
(A) supy(z) <= infy(x)
(B) infx(z) <= infx(x)
(C) supx(x) <= supx(z)
(D) infy(z) <= infy(x) (derived from infy(z) <= supy(z) and (A))

Let's check which relations R are possible for x R z given these conditions, remembering that for regions in REG, infx < supx and infy < supy.

1.  x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    These are exactly conditions (A), (B), and (C). All are derived from x N y and y N z.
    Thus, x N z is always true if x N y and y N z hold. N is a possible relation.

2.  x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Conditions (B) and (C) are met. We need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
    From the combined y-chain: infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
    If supy(x) <= infy(z), then infy(z) <= ... <= supy(x) <= infy(z). This implies infy(z) = supy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y) = infy(x) = supy(x). This means the y-projections of x, y, and z are all points at the same y-coordinate. This contradicts infy < supy for regions in REG. Thus, S is not possible.

3.  x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Condition (D) is met. We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From the combined x-chain: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
    If supx(x) <= infx(z), then infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). This implies infx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x). This means the x-projection of x is a point. This contradicts infx < supx for regions in REG. Thus, W is not possible.

4.  x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Condition (D) is met. We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From the combined x-chain: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
    If supx(z) <= infx(x), then infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(y) = supx(z). This means the x-projections of x, y, z are points, or x is a point and supx(y)=supx(z)=infx(x). This contradicts infx < supx for regions in REG. Thus, E is not possible.

5.  x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition (A) is met. supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for regions, as shown for W. Thus, NW is not possible.

6.  x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition (A) is met. supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible for regions, as shown for E. Thus, NE is not possible.

7.  x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Neither supx(x) <= infx(z) nor supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible for regions, as shown for W and S. Thus, SW is not possible.

8.  x SE z: supx(b) <= infx(a) (supx(z) <= infx(x)), supy(a) <= infy(b) (supy(x) <= infy(z)).
    Neither supx(z) <= infx(x) nor supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible for regions, as shown for E and S. Thus, SE is not possible.

9.  x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Conditions (B), (C), and (D) are met. We need supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From the combined y-chain: infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
    If supy(x) <= supy(z), then infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Combining with the rest of the chain: infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).
    This implies infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This requires infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y). This means the y-projections of x and y are points, and these points are equal to supy(z). This contradicts infy < supy for regions in REG. Thus, B is not possible.

Based on the definitions provided and the constraint that regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (implying non-degenerate projections), the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.

The final answer is $\boxed{N}$.
