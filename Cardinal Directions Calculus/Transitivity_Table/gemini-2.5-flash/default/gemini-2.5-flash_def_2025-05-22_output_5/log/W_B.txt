PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let MBB(r) denote the minimum bounding box of a region r.
MBB(r) = [infx(r), supx(r)] x [infy(r), supy(r)].
Since regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

We are given:
1. x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z among the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's analyze the vertical relationship between x and z:
From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
From y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
Combining these inequalities:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)  => infy(z) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)  => supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, the vertical extent of MBB(x) is contained within or touches the vertical extent of MBB(z).
infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's check which single-tile relations between x and z are consistent with this vertical constraint (letting a=x, b=z in the definitions):
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Consistent.
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) < supy(x) unless infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x), which is impossible for a region in REG. Not possible.
- SW: supy(x) <= infy(z). Not possible.
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Consistent.
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z) unless infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z), which is impossible for regions in REG. Not possible.
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x). Not possible.
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x). Not possible.
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Consistent.
- SE: supy(x) <= infy(z). Not possible.

Based on the vertical constraints, only B, W, and E are potentially possible relations between x and z.

Now let's analyze the horizontal relationship between x and z:
From x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y).
From y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
Also, we know infx(x) < supx(x), infx(y) < supx(y), infx(z) < supx(z).

Consider the condition for E (x E z): supx(z) <= infx(x).
From the given conditions:
infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
This chain of inequalities implies infx(x) < supx(z).
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG. E is not a possible relation.

Now consider the condition for W (x W z): supx(x) <= infx(z).
From the given conditions:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
Let infx(y) = 5. supx(x) <= 5 and infx(z) <= 5.
It is possible for supx(x) <= infx(z) to hold. For example, if supx(x) = 4 and infx(z) = 5 (and infx(y) >= 5).
Let's construct an example with regions in REG:
Let y be a disk with MBB [5, 8] x [5, 8].
Let x be a disk with MBB [2, 4] x [6, 7].
x W y? supx(x)=4 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(y)=5 <= infy(x)=6 (Yes). supy(x)=7 <= supy(y)=8 (Yes). x W y holds.
Let z be a disk with MBB [5, 10] x [0, 10].
y B z? infx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). supx(y)=8 <= supx(z)=10 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=5 (Yes). supy(y)=8 <= supy(z)=10 (Yes). y B z holds.
Now compare x and z:
supx(x)=4 <= infx(z)=5 (Yes).
infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=6 (Yes).
supy(x)=7 <= supy(z)=10 (Yes).
x W z holds in this example. Thus, W is a possible relation.

Finally, consider the condition for B (x B z): infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
We already know from the chain of inequalities (infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)) that supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
We need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
From the given conditions:
infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y).
Let infx(y) = 5. infx(z) <= 5 and infx(x) < supx(x) <= 5.
It is possible for infx(z) <= infx(x) to hold. For example, if infx(z) = 0 and infx(x) = 2 (and infx(y) >= 2 and infx(y) >= 0).
Let's construct an example with regions in REG:
Let y be a disk with MBB [5, 8] x [5, 8].
Let x be a disk with MBB [2, 4] x [6, 7].
x W y? supx(x)=4 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(y)=5 <= infy(x)=6 (Yes). supy(x)=7 <= supy(y)=8 (Yes). x W y holds.
Let z be a disk with MBB [0, 10] x [0, 10].
y B z? infx(z)=0 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). supx(y)=8 <= supx(z)=10 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=5 (Yes). supy(y)=8 <= supy(z)=10 (Yes). y B z holds.
Now compare x and z:
infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=2 (Yes).
supx(x)=4 <= supx(z)=10 (Yes).
infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=6 (Yes).
supy(x)=7 <= supy(z)=10 (Yes).
x B z holds in this example. Thus, B is a possible relation.

We have eliminated S, SW, SE, N, NW, NE, and E as impossible relations. We have shown that W and B are possible relations.

The possible relations are W and B.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, B}$.
