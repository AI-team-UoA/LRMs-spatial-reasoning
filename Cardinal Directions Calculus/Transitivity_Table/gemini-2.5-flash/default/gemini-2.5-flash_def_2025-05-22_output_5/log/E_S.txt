PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the minimum bounding box of a region 'a' be defined by [infx(a), supx(a)] on the x-axis and [infy(a), supy(a)] on the y-axis. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, implying their bounding boxes have non-zero width and height (infx < supx and infy < supy).

Given:
1.  Region x is E of region y (x E y):
    supx(y) <= infx(x)
    infy(y) <= infy(x)
    supy(x) <= supy(y)

2.  Region y is S of region z (y S z):
    supy(y) <= infy(z)
    infx(z) <= infx(y)
    supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's derive combined constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

From (1c) and (2a):
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
This implies **supy(x) <= infy(z)**. This means region x is entirely below or at the same lowest vertical level as region z's bottom boundary. This inequality is consistent with the definitions of S, SW, and SE relations where 'a' is below 'b'. It is inconsistent with N, NE, NW, E, W, and B, which require some vertical overlap or 'a' being above 'b'.

From (2b) and (1a):
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
This implies **infx(z) <= infx(x)**. This means region x starts horizontally at or to the East of where region z starts.

Now let's examine the definitions of the single-tile cardinal direction relations for x R z, using the constraints supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x):

*   **x S z**: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    -   supy(x) <= infy(z): This is satisfied by our derivation.
    -   infx(z) <= infx(x): This is satisfied by our derivation.
    -   supx(x) <= supx(z): Is this always true? No. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[1.5,3]x[0,1], z=[0,2.5]x[2,3]. x E y holds, y S z holds. For x vs z: supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=2, infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=1.5, but supx(x)=3 > supx(z)=2.5. So supx(x) <= supx(z) is not always true.
    -   Is supx(x) <= supx(z) *possible*? Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[1.5,2]x[0,1], z=[-0.5,2]x[2,3]. x E y holds, y S z holds. For x vs z: supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=2, infx(z)=-0.5 <= infx(x)=1.5, supx(x)=2 <= supx(z)=2. S holds in this case.
    -   Therefore, S is a possible relation.

*   **x SW z**: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND supx(x) <= infx(z).
    -   supy(x) <= infy(z): This is satisfied.
    -   supx(x) <= infx(z): Is this possible? From infx(z) <= infx(x), if supx(x) <= infx(z) holds, then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is impossible for any region homeomorphic to a disk.
    -   Therefore, SW is not a possible relation for regions in REG.

*   **x SE z**: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND supx(z) <= infx(x).
    -   supy(x) <= infy(z): This is satisfied.
    -   supx(z) <= infx(x): Is this possible? Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[2,3]x[0,1], z=[0,1]x[2,3]. x E y holds, y S z holds. For x vs z: supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=2, supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2. SE holds in this case.
    -   Is supx(z) <= infx(x) always true? No. The example y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[1.5,3]x[0,1], z=[0,2.5]x[2,3] showed supx(z)=2.5 and infx(x)=1.5, so supx(z) > infx(x).
    -   Therefore, SE is a possible relation.

*   **Other relations (N, NE, NW, E, W, B)**:
    -   N, NE, NW require z R N/NE/NW x, meaning supy(z) <= infy(x). We have supy(x) <= infy(z). For regions in REG, infy < supy. supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z). Also infy(y) <= infy(x). From y S z, supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, infy(y) <= infy(x). supy(y) <= infy(z). infy(y) <= infy(x). It is impossible to guarantee supy(z) <= infy(x). In fact, typical configurations will have infy(x) around infy(y), and infy(z) significantly above supy(y) and thus significantly above infy(x). These relations are not possible.
    -   W requires supx(x) <= infx(z). We showed this is impossible for regions in REG. W is not possible.
    -   E requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). While supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible and supy(x) <= supy(z) is always true (supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z)), infy(z) <= infy(x) is not generally true and is inconsistent with the typical vertical separation implied by y S z and x E y. infy(z) >= supy(y) > infy(y). As infy(y) <= infy(x), infy(z) > infy(y) suggests infy(z) is likely > infy(x). E is not possible.
    -   B requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But supx(x) <= supx(z) is not always true, and infy(z) <= infy(x) is generally false. B is not possible.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relations from the given list are S and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SE}$.
