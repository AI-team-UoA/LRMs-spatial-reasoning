PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions provided:
x N y means: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y).
y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these inequalities:
From supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we get supx(x) <= infx(z).
This inequality means the right edge of x's bounding box is to the left of or touching the left edge of z's bounding box. This condition is part of the definitions for W, NW, and SW. It is generally incompatible with N, NE, E, SE, S, and B for regions with non-zero extent (as supx > infx). For example, N requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= infx(x), which is only possible for a point region. Since regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk, they have extent, so supx > infx. Thus, N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are not possible relations between x and z.

From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), and knowing that infy(y) < supy(y) for a region with extent, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) < infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom edge of z's bounding box is below or touching the bottom edge of x's bounding box.

We are left with possible relations W, NW, SW:
W (x W z): supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
NW (x NW z): supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
SW (x SW z): supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).

We have proven supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) are necessary conditions.

Let's check if SW is possible:
SW requires supy(x) <= infy(z).
From the premise, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
So, supy(x) <= infy(z) implies supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y).
We also have infy(y) < supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Thus, infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(x) < infy(x), which is impossible for a region with extent (infy < supy).
Therefore, SW is not a possible relation.

Let's check if W is possible:
W requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
We know the first two are necessary. We need to check if supy(x) <= supy(z) can occur.
Consider regions with the following bounding boxes:
y = [0, 1] x [0, 1] (infx_y=0, supx_y=1, infy_y=0, supy_y=1)
x = [0, 1] x [1.1, 2] (infx_x=0, supx_x=1, infy_x=1.1, supy_x=2)
Check x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) (1 <= 1.1, True), infx(y) <= infx(x) (0 <= 0, True), supx(x) <= supx(y) (1 <= 1, True). x N y holds.
z = [2, 3] x [-0.5, 2] (infx_z=2, supx_z=3, infy_z=-0.5, supy_z=2)
Check y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z) (1 <= 2, True), infy(z) <= infy(y) (-0.5 <= 0, True), supy(y) <= supy(z) (1 <= 2, True). y W z holds.
Now check x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (1 <= 2, True), infy(z) <= infy(x) (-0.5 <= 1.1, True), supy(x) <= supy(z) (2 <= 2, True). x W z holds.
So W is a possible relation.

Let's check if NW is possible:
NW requires supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is necessary. We need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) can occur.
Consider regions with the following bounding boxes:
y = [0, 1] x [0, 1] (infx_y=0, supx_y=1, infy_y=0, supy_y=1)
x = [0, 1] x [2, 3] (infx_x=0, supx_x=1, infy_x=2, supy_x=3)
Check x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) (1 <= 2, True), infx(y) <= infx(x) (0 <= 0, True), supx(x) <= supx(y) (1 <= 1, True). x N y holds.
z = [2, 3] x [-0.5, 1.5] (infx_z=2, supx_z=3, infy_z=-0.5, supy_z=1.5)
Check y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z) (1 <= 2, True), infy(z) <= infy(y) (-0.5 <= 0, True), supy(y) <= supy(z) (1 <= 1.5, True). y W z holds.
Now check x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (1 <= 2, True), supy(z) <= infy(x) (1.5 <= 2, True). x NW z holds.
So NW is a possible relation.

It is also possible that neither W nor NW holds. This happens if supy(x) > supy(z) AND supy(z) > infy(x), while supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) hold.
Example bounding boxes: x=[0,1]x[3,5], y=[0,1]x[2,2.5], z=[2,3]x[1,4].
x N y holds, y W z holds.
For x and z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True), infy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=3 (True).
W requires supy(x) <= supy(z) (5 <= 4, False).
NW requires supy(z) <= infy(x) (4 <= 3, False).
In this case, neither W nor NW holds. However, the question asks for the *possible* relations, meaning the relations that *could* hold in *some* valid configuration.

We have shown that W is possible and NW is possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, NW}$.
