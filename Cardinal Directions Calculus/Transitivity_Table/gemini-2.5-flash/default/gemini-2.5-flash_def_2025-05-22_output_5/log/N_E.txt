PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The given conditions are:
1) x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2) y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's analyze the bounding box coordinates:
infx(x), supx(x), infy(x), supy(x) for region x
infx(z), supx(z), infy(z), supy(z) for region z

From (1) and (2), combining the x-coordinates:
supx(z) <= infx(y) (from 2)
infx(y) <= infx(x) (from 1)
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x).

From (1) and (2), combining the y-coordinates:
infy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2)
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1)
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). Therefore, infy(z) <= infy(x).

Also, supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 2).

For any non-degenerate region homeomorphic to a disk, we have infx < supx and infy < supy.

Let's check which single-tile relations are possible for x and z, based on the definitions and the derived inequalities:

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). For non-degenerate regions, infx(x) < supx(x), so supx(x) <= infx(x) is impossible. Thus, B is not possible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x). Thus infy(z) < supy(x). The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible. S is not possible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
We know supy(x) > infy(z). The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible. SW is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). So supx(z) < supx(x). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(z). This implies supx(z) < infx(z), which is impossible for non-degenerate regions. W is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(a) -> should be supy(b) <= infy(a), so supy(z) <= infy(x).
We know supx(x) > supx(z) >= infx(y) >= supx(z). And supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). So supx(x) > supx(z).
The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) implies supx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(z), meaning supx(z) < infx(z), which is impossible. NW is not possible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(a) -> should be supx(b) <= infx(a), so supx(z) <= infx(x). supy(a) <= infy(b) -> should be supy(x) <= infy(z).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is true. We know supy(x) > infy(z) is true. The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible. SE is not possible.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). So supx(z) < supx(x). The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is impossible for non-degenerate regions. N is not possible.

This leaves NE and E. Let's check if these are possible. We know supx(z) <= infx(x) must hold (x is to the East of or touching z's right boundary). This is the x-condition for NE and E.

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is true. Is supy(z) <= infy(x) possible?
We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). It is possible for infy(x) to be greater than or equal to supy(z).
Example: Let supy(y)=5, infy(x)=10, supy(z)=6. This satisfies supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We can construct regions satisfying this. Thus, NE is a possible relation.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is true.
We derived infy(z) <= infy(x). This part of the condition is always true for non-degenerate regions.
Is supy(x) <= supy(z) possible?
We have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
Can supy(x) <= supy(z)? Yes.
Example: Let infy(z)=0, infy(y)=1, supy(y)=2, supy(z)=4. (0<=1, 2<=4).
Let infy(x)=2, supy(x)=3. (supy(y)<=infy(x) -> 2<=2, infy(x)<supy(x) -> 2<3).
In this example, supy(x)=3, supy(z)=4. supy(x) <= supy(z) (3<=4). This is possible.
We can construct regions satisfying all conditions for E. Thus, E is a possible relation.

Based on the analysis for non-degenerate regions, only NE and E are possible single-tile relations.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, E}$.
