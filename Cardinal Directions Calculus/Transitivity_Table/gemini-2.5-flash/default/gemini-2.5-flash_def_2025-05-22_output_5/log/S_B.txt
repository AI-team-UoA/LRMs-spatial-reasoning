PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are:
1.  `x S y`: `supy(x) <= infy(y)`, `infx(y) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(y)`.
2.  `y B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, `supx(y) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(y)`, `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.

Regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk. This implies they are non-degenerate, so for any region `a` in REG, `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

Let's combine the inequalities for the x-bounds:
From `x S y`: `infx(y) <= infx(x)` (A1), `supx(x) <= supx(y)` (A2).
From `y B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(y)` (B1), `supx(y) <= supx(z)` (B2).

Combining these, we get:
`infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)`
`supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`

Now let's combine the inequalities for the y-bounds:
From `x S y`: `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (A3).
From `y B z`: `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (B3), `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (B4).

Also, for x, y, z in REG:
`infx(x) < supx(x)` (C1), `infy(x) < supy(x)` (C2)
`infx(y) < supx(y)` (C3), `infy(y) < supy(y)` (C4)
`infx(z) < supx(z)` (C5), `infy(z) < supy(z)` (C6)

We need to check which cardinal relations `x R z` are possible, where R is one of {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's analyze the x-bound conditions for each relation R between x and z:
- Relations requiring `supx(x) <= infx(z)`: SW, W, NW.
  From `infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`.
  If `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, then `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x)`.
  This implies `supx(x) <= infx(x)`.
  However, for a non-degenerate region x in REG, `infx(x) < supx(x)` (C1).
  Thus, `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is impossible.
  So, SW, W, NW are impossible relations between x and z.

- Relations requiring `supx(z) <= infx(x)`: NE, E, SE.
  If `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, then since `infx(x) < supx(x)` (C1), we have `supx(z) < supx(x)`.
  However, from `supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`, we have `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
  The combination `supx(z) < supx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)` is a contradiction.
  Thus, `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is impossible.
  So, NE, E, SE are impossible relations between x and z.

The only possible relations left are S, B, N. Let's analyze their y-bound conditions.

- `x S z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
  We have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (A3) and `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (B3).
  Can `supy(x) <= infy(z)` hold? Yes.
  Example: Let `supy(x)=1`, `infy(z)=2`, `infy(y)=3`.
  `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (1 <= 3) holds.
  `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (2 <= 3) holds.
  `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (1 <= 2) holds.
  With appropriate x-bounds (e.g., x, y, z aligned vertically with x-spans [-1,1], contained within each other), we can construct regions in REG satisfying these.
  Thus, S is a possible relation.

- `x B z`: Requires `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
  - `infy(z) <= infy(x)`:
    We have `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (B3) and `infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y)` (C2, A3).
    Can `infy(z) <= infy(x)` hold? Yes.
    Example: Let `infy(z)=1`, `infy(x)=2`, `supy(x)=3`, `infy(y)=4`.
    `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (1 <= 4) holds.
    `infy(x) < supy(x)` (2 < 3) holds.
    `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (3 <= 4) holds.
    `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (1 <= 2) holds. Possible.
  - `supy(x) <= supy(z)`:
    We have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (A3) and `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (B4) and `infy(y) < supy(y)` (C4).
    So `supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z)`. This chain implies `supy(x) < supy(y) <= supy(z)`, which certainly allows `supy(x) <= supy(z)` to hold. It is always implied that `supy(x) < supy(z)`.
  - Can `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)` hold simultaneously? Yes, as shown in the thought block example with intervals [1, 2] for x, [3, 4] for y, [0, 5] for z.
  Thus, B is a possible relation.

- `x N z`: Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
  From `y B z`, we have `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (B4). So `supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This implies `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
  From `x S y`, we have `supy(x) <= infy(y)` (A3).
  For region x in REG, `infy(x) < supy(x)` (C2). So `infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y)`. This implies `infy(x) < infy(y)`.
  For region y in REG, `infy(y) < supy(y)` (C4).
  So we have the sequence of inequalities:
  `infy(y) < supy(y)`
  `supy(y) <= infy(x)` (required for N)
  `infy(x) < infy(y)` (derived from x S y and non-degeneracy)
  Combining these, we get `infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) < infy(y)`.
  This chain `infy(y) < ... < infy(y)` is a contradiction.
  Therefore, `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is impossible for regions in REG.
  Thus, N is an impossible relation.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relations between region x and region z are S and B.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, B}$.
