PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by the intervals [infx(a), supx(a)] on the x-axis and [infy(a), supy(a)] on the y-axis.

The given conditions are:
1. Region x is NE of region y:
   supx(y) <= infx(x)  (1a)
   supy(y) <= infy(x)  (1b)

2. Region y is SW of region z:
   supx(z) <= infx(y)  (2a)
   supy(z) <= infy(y)  (2b)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's combine the inequalities from (1) and (2):

From (1a) and (2a):
infx(x) >= supx(y)
infx(y) >= supx(z)
Since infx(y) <= supx(y) for any non-degenerate region, we have:
infx(x) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= supx(z)
This chain of inequalities implies:
infx(x) >= supx(z)
Which can be written as:
supx(z) <= infx(x)  (3a)

From (1b) and (2b):
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(y) >= supy(z)
Since infy(y) <= supy(y) for any non-degenerate region, we have:
infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= supy(z)
This chain of inequalities implies:
infy(x) >= supy(z)
Which can be written as:
supy(z) <= infy(x)  (3b)

The regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are non-degenerate regions with positive area. For such regions, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Now let's check which of the possible cardinal relations between x and z are consistent with the derived inequalities (3a) and (3b).

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
  These are exactly the inequalities (3a) and (3b) we derived. So, NE is a possible relation.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  The first inequality supy(z) <= infy(x) is true (3b).
  The second and third inequalities, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), mean that the x-projection of x is contained within or equal to the x-projection of z, i.e., [infx(x), supx(x)] is contained in [infx(z), supx(z)].
  However, from the chain derived for the x-axis, infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
  This implies supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
  For supx(x) <= supx(z) to also be true, given supx(z) <= supx(x), we must have supx(x) = supx(z).
  This forces infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z) = infx(y) = supx(y). This means the x-projections of x and y are points, located at supx(z). This contradicts the assumption that regions are non-degenerate. Thus, N is not possible for non-degenerate regions.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  The first inequality supx(z) <= infx(x) is true (3a).
  The second inequality infy(z) <= infy(x) is true from the chain derived for the y-axis: infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
  The third inequality supy(x) <= supy(z) means that the y-projection of x is contained within or equal to the y-projection of z, i.e., [infy(x), supy(x)] is contained in [infy(z), supy(z)].
  However, from the chain derived for the y-axis, supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
  For supy(x) <= supy(z) to also be true, we must have supy(x) = supy(z).
  This forces infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y). This means the y-projections of x and y are points, located at supy(z). This contradicts non-degeneracy. Thus, E is not possible.

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  This requires both the x-projection and y-projection of x to be contained within the respective projections of z. As shown for N and E, this is only possible in degenerate cases. Thus, B is not possible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
  The first inequality supx(z) <= infx(x) is true (3a).
  The second inequality supy(x) <= infy(z).
  From the y-axis chain, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
  Also, for a non-degenerate region z, infy(z) <= supy(z).
  So we have supy(x) >= infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= supy(z) >= infy(z).
  For supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true, given supy(x) >= infy(z), we must have supy(x) = infy(z).
  This requires all intermediate values in the chain to be equal: supy(x) = infy(x) = supy(y) = infy(y) = supy(z) = infy(z). This means all y-projections are the same point. This contradicts non-degeneracy. Thus, SE is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
  The second inequality supy(z) <= infy(x) is true (3b).
  The first inequality supx(x) <= infx(z).
  From the x-axis chain, infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
  For supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, given supx(x) >= infx(z), we must have supx(x) = infx(z).
  This requires all intermediate values in the chain to be equal: supx(x) = infx(x) = supx(y) = infx(y) = supx(z) = infx(z). This means all x-projections are the same point. This contradicts non-degeneracy. Thus, NW is not possible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
  Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), which is impossible for non-degenerate regions as shown for SE. Thus, S is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), which is impossible for non-degenerate regions as shown for NW. Thus, W is not possible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both conditions were shown to be impossible for non-degenerate regions. Thus, SW is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the constraint that the regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (i.e., non-degenerate), the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

NE

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
