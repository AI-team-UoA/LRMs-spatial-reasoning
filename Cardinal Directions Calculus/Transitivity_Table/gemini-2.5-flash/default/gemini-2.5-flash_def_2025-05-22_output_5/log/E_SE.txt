PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by `[infx(a), supx(a)]` and `[infy(a), supy(a)]`.
The given relations are defined based on these bounding box coordinates.

We are given:
1) Region x is E of region y (x E y):
   `supx(y) <= infx(x)`
   `infy(y) <= infy(x)`
   `supy(x) <= supy(y)`

2) Region y is SE of region z (y SE z):
   `supx(z) <= infx(y)`
   `supy(y) <= infy(z)`

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. This means we need to determine the relative positions of their bounding boxes based on the given information.

Let's analyze the constraints on the x-coordinates:
From (1): `supx(y) <= infx(x)`
From (2): `supx(z) <= infx(y)`
Also, by definition of bounding box, `infx(y) <= supx(y)`.
Combining these inequalities, we get:
`supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`
Therefore, we conclude that `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
This inequality means that the right edge of the bounding box of z is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of x.

Now let's analyze the constraints on the y-coordinates:
From (1): `infy(y) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(y)`
From (2): `supy(y) <= infy(z)`
Combining these inequalities, we get:
`supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)`
Therefore, we conclude that `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
This inequality means that the top edge of the bounding box of x is below or aligned with the bottom edge of the bounding box of z.

So, any regions x and z satisfying the given conditions (through some region y) must satisfy the two bounding box inequalities:
A) `supx(z) <= infx(x)`
B) `supy(x) <= infy(z)`

Now, let's look at the definitions of the single-tile cardinal direction relations for x and z:
- a B b: `infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)`
- a S b: `supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)`
- a SW b: `supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)`
- a W b: `supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)`
- a NW b: `supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)`
- a N b: `supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)`
- a NE b: `supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)`
- a E b: `supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)`
- a SE b: `supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)`

Substituting x for 'a' and z for 'b':
- x SE z is defined by: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
These are exactly the two inequalities (A and B) that we derived from the premises.

Since the definitions use "if and only if", the relation between x and z is SE if and only if `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. As these conditions are necessary consequences of the premises, the relation between x and z must be SE.

Let's quickly check if any other relation is possible.
For regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk), their bounding boxes have positive width and height, meaning `infx < supx` and `infy < supy`.
- Relations requiring `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (SW, W, NW): This contradicts `supx(z) <= infx(x)` for non-degenerate regions (unless x and z are points located appropriately, but REG regions are not points).
- Relations requiring `supx(x) <= supx(z)` or `infx(z) <= infx(x)` along with `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (B, S, N, E): These require some horizontal overlap or containment of bounding boxes, or z being to the left but x's right edge is contained in z's horizontal extent. `supx(z) <= infx(x)` implies z is horizontally to the left of x or touching. For any overlap or containment to occur (e.g., `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)` for B), while `supx(z) <= infx(x)` holds, requires the regions to be degenerate.
- Relations requiring `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (N, NW, NE): This contradicts `supy(x) <= infy(z)` for non-degenerate regions (unless they are points or horizontal lines). From the premises, we have the vertical ordering `infy(y) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z)`. This implies `infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z)`. If `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is also required, then `infy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is only possible if `infy(x) = supy(z)`, which implies `infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(y) = infy(z) = supy(z)`. This means x, y, and z are horizontal line segments at the same y-coordinate, which contradicts the definition of regions in REG.
- Relations requiring `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)` along with `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (E, W, B): If `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, then `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x)`, which implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`. This is only possible for a point.

Since regions in REG are not points or lines, the derived inequalities `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)` rule out all relations except SE.

The only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
