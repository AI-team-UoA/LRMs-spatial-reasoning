PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let MBB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their minimum bounding boxes have positive width and height, i.e., infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any a in REG.

We are given two relations:
1) x B y
According to the definition, x B y if and only if:
infx(y) <= infx(x)  (1)
supx(x) <= supx(y)  (2)
infy(y) <= infy(x)  (3)
supy(x) <= supy(y)  (4)
This means the MBB of x is contained within the MBB of y.

2) y SW z
According to the definition, y SW z if and only if:
supx(y) <= infx(z)  (5)
supy(y) <= infy(z)  (6)
This means the MBB of y is to the southwest of or touching the MBB of z.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the given set of single-tile cardinal directions. Let's combine the inequalities to relate the bounding box of x to the bounding box of z.

From (2) and (5):
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
So, supx(x) <= infx(z)  (A)

From (4) and (6):
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
So, supy(x) <= infy(z)  (B)

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible relations between x and z based on the relative positions of their MBBs.

The relation x SW z is defined as:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
Our derived inequalities (A) and (B) match this definition exactly. Therefore, x SW z is always true if x B y and y SW z.

Now we check if any other relation from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B} could also be true.
Let's consider the relations based on horizontal and vertical alignments:

Horizontal relation derived: supx(x) <= infx(z). This means the right edge of x's MBB is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of z's MBB.
This condition is satisfied by relations W, NW, SW.
Relations N, S, B require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (horizontal overlap or containment).
Relations E, NE, SE require supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is to the west of or touching the left edge of x's MBB).

Vertical relation derived: supy(x) <= infy(z). This means the top edge of x's MBB is below or aligned with the bottom edge of z's MBB.
This condition is satisfied by relations S, SE, SW.
Relations N, NE, NW require supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is to the south of or touching the bottom edge of x's MBB).
Relations E, W, B require infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertical overlap or containment).

Combining the constraints:
Possible horizontal relations are W, NW, SW.
Possible vertical relations are S, SE, SW.

The only relation consistent with both sets of possibilities is SW. Let's formally rule out the others using the fact that regions in REG have MBBs with positive width and height.

Consider x S z: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) (holds), AND infx(z) <= infx(x), AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have supx(x) <= infx(z) from (A).
If x S z also holds, we must have supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Since regions in REG have positive width, supx(x) > infx(x). This is a contradiction. So x S z is not possible.

Consider x W z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) (holds), AND infy(z) <= infy(x), AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have supy(x) <= infy(z) from (B).
If x W z also holds, we must have supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x). Since regions in REG have positive height, supy(x) > infy(x). This is a contradiction. So x W z is not possible.

Consider x B z: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
Requires infx(z) <= infx(x). Combined with supx(x) <= infx(z), this leads to supx(x) <= infx(x), a contradiction.
Requires infy(z) <= infy(x). Combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), this leads to supy(x) <= infy(x), a contradiction.
So x B z is not possible.

Consider x N z: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
Requires infx(z) <= infx(x). Combined with supx(x) <= infx(z), this leads to supx(x) <= infx(x), a contradiction.
So x N z is not possible.

Consider x E z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). We know supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), implying supx(x) <= infx(x), a contradiction.
So x E z is not possible.

Consider x NW z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) (holds), AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
We have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). So supy(x) <= supy(z).
If x NW z also holds, supy(z) <= infy(x). Then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), implying supy(x) <= infy(x), a contradiction.
So x NW z is not possible.

Consider x NE z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown for E, this leads to a contradiction.
So x NE z is not possible.

Consider x SE z: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), AND supy(x) <= infy(z) (holds).
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown for E, this leads to a contradiction.
So x SE z is not possible.

Since the conditions x B y and y SW z imply supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), the definition of x SW z is always satisfied. We have also shown that assuming any other relation holds would lead to a contradiction with the properties of regions in REG.
Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW}$.
