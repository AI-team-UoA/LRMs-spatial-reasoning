PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region a on the x and y axes. The definitions of the single-tile cardinal directions are given in terms of these bounds.

We are given that region x is W of region y (x W y) and region y is E of region z (y E z). Let's write down the conditions based on the definitions:

x W y if and only if:
1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
2) infy(y) <= infy(x)
3) supy(x) <= supy(y)

y E z if and only if:
4) supx(z) <= infx(y)
5) infy(z) <= infy(y)
6) supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. The possible relations are from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. Let's analyze the constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z based on the given conditions.

From inequalities (2), (3), (5), and (6) concerning the y-coordinates:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

These inequalities imply:
infy(z) <= infy(x)  (let's call this Y-cond 1)
supy(x) <= supy(z)  (let's call this Y-cond 2)

These two conditions together mean that the projection of region x on the y-axis is contained within or equal to the projection of region z on the y-axis.

Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, their bounding boxes must have non-zero width and height. Thus, for any region a, infy(a) < supy(a).
Y-cond 1: infy(z) <= infy(x)
Y-cond 2: supy(x) <= supy(z)
Combining these with infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z):
infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now let's examine the y-conditions required by each of the possible relations between x and z (replacing a with x and b with z in the definitions):
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches our derived Y-cond 1 & 2.
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), which would require supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), possible only if infy(x) = supy(x), which is not allowed for regions in REG. Thus S is impossible.
- SW: supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible, same reason as S.
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches our derived Y-cond 1 & 2.
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z), which would require supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(z), possible only if infy(x) = supy(z) and supy(x) = supy(z) and infy(x) = supy(x), not allowed. Thus NW is impossible.
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible, same reason as NW.
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible, same reason as NW.
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches our derived Y-cond 1 & 2.
- SE: supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible, same reason as S.

Based on the y-axis constraints derived from x W y and y E z, the only possible relations between x and z from the given set of nine are B, W, and E. We need to verify if all three of these are indeed possible.

Let's analyze the constraints on the x-coordinates:
1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
4) supx(z) <= infx(y)

These imply that the right boundary of x's bounding box and the right boundary of z's bounding box are both to the left of or meet the left boundary of y's bounding box. This allows for several possibilities regarding the relative positions of the x-intervals of x and z, as long as there is an infx(y) value that is greater than or equal to both supx(x) and supx(z).

Let's construct examples for W, E, and B using bounding boxes that satisfy all the conditions.

Possibility 1: x W z
Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two match our derived y-conditions.
Example: x BB [0,1]x[0,1], y BB [3,4]x[0,1], z BB [2,3]x[0,1].
Check x W y: supx(x)=1 <= infx(y)=3 (Yes). infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (Yes). x W y holds.
Check y E z: supx(z)=3 <= infx(y)=3 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=0 (Yes). supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (Yes). y E z holds.
Check x W z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (Yes). x W z holds.
So, W is a possible relation.

Possibility 2: x E z
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two match our derived y-conditions.
Example: x BB [2,3]x[0,1], y BB [5,6]x[0,1], z BB [0,1]x[0,1].
Check x W y: supx(x)=3 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (Yes). x W y holds.
Check y E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=0 (Yes). supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (Yes). y E z holds.
Check x E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2 (Yes). infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (Yes). x E z holds.
So, E is a possible relation.

Possibility 3: x B z
Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The last two match our derived y-conditions.
Example: x BB [2,3]x[0,1], y BB [5,6]x[0,1], z BB [1,4]x[-1,2].
Check x W y: supx(x)=3 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (Yes). x W y holds.
Check y E z: supx(z)=4 <= infx(y)=5 (Yes). infy(z)=-1 <= infy(y)=0 (Yes). supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=2 (Yes). y E z holds.
Check x B z: infx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2 (Yes). supx(x)=3 <= supx(z)=4 (Yes). infy(z)=-1 <= infy(x)=0 (Yes). supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=2 (Yes). x B z holds.
So, B is a possible relation.

We have eliminated 6 of the 9 possible relations based on the y-axis constraints derived from the given relations and the properties of regions in REG. We have shown with examples that the remaining 3 relations (W, E, B) are possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}$.
