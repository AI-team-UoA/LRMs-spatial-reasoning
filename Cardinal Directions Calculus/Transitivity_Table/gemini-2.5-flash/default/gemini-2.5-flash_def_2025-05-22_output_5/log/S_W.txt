PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x S y means:
1) supy(x) <= infy(y)
2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

Let y W z means:
4) supx(y) <= infx(z)
5) infy(z) <= infy(y)
6) supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the implications of these inequalities on the bounding boxes of x and z.

Horizontal relation between x and z:
From (3) and (4), we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).
This implies supx(x) <= infx(z). This means the right edge of x's bounding box is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of z's bounding box.

This horizontal relationship (supx(x) <= infx(z)) is consistent with the definitions of W, SW, and NW relations.
It is *inconsistent* with the definitions of E, NE, SE (which require supx(z) <= infx(x)), and B, S, N (which require horizontal overlap: infx(z) <= supx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(z)). For regions with area, supx > infx. The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the conditions for E, NE, SE, B, S, N unless the regions collapse to points and touch, which is not allowed for regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk.

So, the possible relations are limited to W, SW, NW.

Now let's analyze the vertical relation between x and z for these potential candidates.

We know from (1), (5), and (6), along with the fact that infy(y) <= supy(y):
supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
This implies supy(x) <= supy(z). This condition is part of the definitions for W and SW.

Let's examine each candidate:

1.  x W z: Defined as supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is always true.
    We know supy(x) <= supy(z) is always true.
    We need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
    From (5), infy(z) <= infy(y).
    From (1), supy(x) <= infy(y).
    From region properties, infy(x) <= supy(x).
    So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y). This implies infy(x) <= infy(y).
    We need to determine if infy(z) <= infy(x) can hold. We have infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(x) <= infy(y).
    Consider a scenario where infy(z) is significantly lower than infy(y), and infy(x) is only slightly lower than infy(y).
    Example: Let infy(y) = 0. Let infy(z) = -3 and infy(x) = -1. Then infy(z) <= infy(x) (-3 <= -1) holds.
    We need to check if such a scenario is possible given the original conditions.
    Let y be the region [0,1]x[0,1]. infx(y)=0, supx(y)=1, infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
    x S y: supy(x) <= 0, 0 <= infx(x), supx(x) <= 1. Let x be [0,1]x[-2,-1]. infy(x)=-2, supy(x)=-1. supy(x)=-1 <= 0, 0<=0, 1<=1. x S y holds.
    y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z) (1 <= infx(z)), infy(z) <= infy(y) (infy(z) <= 0), supy(y) <= supy(z) (1 <= supy(z)). Let z be [2,3]x[-3,2]. infx(z)=2, supx(z)=3, infy(z)=-3, supy(z)=2. 1<=2, -3<=0, 1<=2. y W z holds.
    Now check x W z with x=[0,1]x[-2,-1] and z=[2,3]x[-3,2]:
    supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True).
    infy(z)=-3 <= infy(x)=-2 (True).
    supy(x)=-1 <= supy(z)=2 (True).
    All conditions for x W z hold. So W is a possible relation.

2.  x SW z: Defined as supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is always true.
    We need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
    From (1), supy(x) <= infy(y).
    From (5), infy(z) <= infy(y).
    Both supy(x) and infy(z) are less than or equal to infy(y). It is possible for supy(x) to be less than or equal to infy(z).
    Example: Let infy(y) = 0. Let supy(x) = -1 and infy(z) = -0.5. Then supy(x) <= infy(z) (-1 <= -0.5) holds.
    Let y be the region [0,1]x[0,1]. infy(y)=0.
    x S y: supy(x) <= 0, ... Let x be [0,1]x[-2,-1]. supy(x)=-1. x S y holds.
    y W z: ... infy(z) <= 0, supy(y) <= supy(z). Let z be [2,3]x[-0.5, 1.5]. infy(z)=-0.5, supy(z)=1.5. infy(z)=-0.5 <= 0, supy(y)=1 <= 1.5. y W z holds.
    Now check x SW z with x=[0,1]x[-2,-1] and z=[2,3]x[-0.5, 1.5]:
    supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True).
    supy(x)=-1 <= infy(z)=-0.5 (True).
    Both conditions for x SW z hold. So SW is a possible relation.

3.  x NW z: Defined as supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
    We know supx(x) <= infx(z) is always true.
    We need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
    From (6), supy(y) <= supy(z).
    From region properties and (1), infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).
    From region properties, infy(y) <= supy(y).
    So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
    This implies infy(x) <= supy(z) is always true.
    For supy(z) <= infy(x) to hold, we must have infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(y) = supy(y) = supy(z). This requires the vertical extents of x and y to be single points aligned on the same y-coordinate, which contradicts the definition of regions in REG (homeomorphic to a disk, implying area and vertical extent > 0).
    Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible for regions in REG. NW is not a possible relation.

Based on the analysis, only W and SW are possible relations between region x and region z.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, SW}$.
