PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of a region r on the x and y axes, respectively. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, implying their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

We are given the relations:
1.  x NW y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2.  y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the relative positions of their bounding boxes.

From relation 1 (x NW y):
(1a) supx(y) <= infx(x) (The right edge of y is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of x)
(1b) supy(y) <= infy(x) (The top edge of y is below or aligned with the bottom edge of x)

From relation 2 (y NE z):
(2a) supx(z) <= infx(y) (The right edge of z is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of y)
(2b) supy(z) <= infy(y) (The top edge of z is below or aligned with the bottom edge of y)

Let's combine these inequalities to find relations between x and z.
Regarding x-coordinates:
From (2a), supx(z) <= infx(y). Since infx(y) <= supx(y) (because regions are non-degenerate), we have supx(z) <= supx(y).
From (1a), supx(y) <= infx(x).
Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which simplifies to:
supx(z) <= infx(x) (A)

Regarding y-coordinates:
From (2b), supy(z) <= infy(y). Since infy(y) <= supy(y) (because regions are non-degenerate), we have supy(z) <= supy(y).
From (1b), supy(y) <= infy(x).
Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which simplifies to:
supy(z) <= infy(x) (B)

Now we examine which cardinal relations between x and z are compatible with derived inequalities (A) and (B), keeping in mind that infx < supx and infy < supy for x and z.

Let's check the definitions of the possible relations for x R z:
x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If S holds, supx(x) <= supx(z). Combining with (A), supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies supx(x) <= infx(x). This contradicts non-degeneracy. S is not possible.

x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If SW holds, supx(x) <= infx(z). Combining with (A), supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x). For non-degenerate regions, this implies their x-intervals are disjoint or touch, with x left of z and z left of x, which is impossible. SW is not possible.

x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If W holds, supx(x) <= infx(z). Similar to SW, this is impossible for non-degenerate regions. W is not possible.

x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). (B) supy(z) <= infy(x) holds. (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If NW holds, supx(x) <= infx(z). Similar to SW, this is impossible for non-degenerate regions when combined with (A). NW is not possible.

x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). (B) supy(z) <= infy(x) holds. (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If N holds, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Combining supx(x) <= supx(z) with (A) supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x), contradicting non-degeneracy. N is not possible.

x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). These are precisely inequalities (A) and (B) derived from the premises. Thus, x NE z is a possible relation.

x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x) holds. (B) supy(z) <= infy(x). If E holds, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Combining supy(x) <= supy(z) with (B) supy(z) <= infy(x) implies supy(x) <= infy(x), contradicting non-degeneracy. E is not possible.

x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x) holds. (B) supy(z) <= infy(x). If SE holds, supy(x) <= infy(z). Combining supy(x) <= infy(z) with (B) supy(z) <= infy(x) implies supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(x) <= infy(x), contradicting non-degeneracy. SE is not possible.

x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). (A) supx(z) <= infx(x). If B holds, supx(x) <= supx(z). Combining with (A) implies supx(x) <= infx(x), contradicting non-degeneracy. B is not possible.

Based on the bounding box definitions and the assumption that regions in REG are non-degenerate, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.
