PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. The relations are defined based on the infimum and supremum of the projections of their minimum bounding boxes on the x and y axes.
Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), supy(r) denote the bounds for a region r.

The given conditions are:
1.  x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2.  y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's derive constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z from the given conditions.

From the x-conditions:
From (x S y), infx(y) <= infx(x).
From (y E z), supx(z) <= infx(y).
Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
So, supx(z) <= infx(x) is a necessary condition. This means the right edge of z's bounding box is to the west of or touches the left edge of x's bounding box. Horizontally, z is always to the west of x, or they touch.

Let's examine the horizontal conditions for each possible relation R between x and z (a R b, where a=x, b=z) and see which ones are consistent with supx(z) <= infx(x).

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). supx(z) <= infx(x) implies infx(z) <= infx(x). However, supx(x) <= supx(z) combined with supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). For regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed disk), the bounding box has non-zero width (infx < supx). Thus, supx(x) <= infx(x) is impossible. B is not possible.
-   x S z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). (Same x-condition as B). Not possible.
-   x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z). supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= supx(z). We need supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is impossible. SW is not possible.
-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z). (Same x-condition as SW). Not possible.
-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z). (Same x-condition as SW). Not possible.
-   x N z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). (Same x-condition as B). Not possible.
-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with our derived condition. NE is potentially possible.
-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with our derived condition. E is potentially possible.
-   x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x). This is consistent with our derived condition. SE is potentially possible.

Based on the x-conditions, only NE, E, and SE are possible relations between x and z. Now let's examine the y-conditions for these relations, given the y-constraints from x S y and y E z.

From the y-conditions:
From (x S y), supy(x) <= infy(y).
From (y E z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
Also, by definition, infy(x) <= supy(x) and infy(z) <= supy(z) and infy(y) <= supy(y).

Combining these inequalities related to y-coordinates:
infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).
Also, infy(z) <= infy(y).

So we have:
1.  infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  infy(z) <= infy(y)
3.  infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's check the y-conditions for NE, E, and SE relations between x and z (a R b, where a=x, b=z):

-   x NE z: supy(z) <= infy(x).
    From the combined inequalities, we know supy(z) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= supy(x) >= infy(x).
    So, supy(z) >= infy(x) is always true.
    Equality (supy(z) = infy(x)) would require supy(z) = supy(y) = infy(y) = supy(x) = infy(x). This implies all bounding boxes are on the same horizontal line segment, which is not possible for regions in REG.
    Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible. NE is not possible.

-   x E z: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    -   infy(z) <= infy(x): Is this possible? Yes. Example: Let infy(y)=10. We need infy(z)<=10 and infy(x) <= supy(x) <= 10. Let infy(z)=9 and infy(x)=9.5. This is consistent with infy(z) <= infy(x) (9 <= 9.5) and the constraints (9<=10, 9.5<=10).
    -   supy(x) <= supy(z): Is this possible? Yes. Example: Let supy(y)=12. We need supy(x) <= infy(y)=10 and supy(y)=12 <= supy(z). Let supy(x)=9.8 and supy(z)=13. This is consistent with supy(x) <= supy(z) (9.8 <= 13) and the constraints (9.8<=10, 12<=13).
    Since both y-conditions are possible simultaneously (as shown by combining the examples: infy(y)=10, supy(y)=12, infy(z)=9, supy(z)=13, infy(x)=9.5, supy(x)=9.8), E is a possible relation.

-   x SE z: supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Is this possible? Yes. Example: Let infy(y)=10. We need supy(x) <= 10 and infy(z) <= 10. Let supy(x)=8 and infy(z)=9. Then supy(x) <= infy(z) (8 <= 9) is true, and this is consistent with the constraints (8<=10, 9<=10).
    SE is a possible relation.

We have ruled out B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE. We found that E and SE are possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, SE}$.
