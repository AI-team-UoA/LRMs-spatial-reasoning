PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the regions be x, y, and z.
The definition of the S relation (a S b) is:
supy(a) <= infy(b)
infx(b) <= infx(a)
supx(a) <= supx(b)

Given that region x is S of region y (x S y) and region y is S of region z (y S z), we have the following inequalities for their bounding box coordinates:
1) For x S y:
   supy(x) <= infy(y)
   infx(y) <= infx(x)
   supx(x) <= supx(y)

2) For y S z:
   supy(y) <= infy(z)
   infx(z) <= infx(y)
   supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's derive the constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x and z from the given conditions:

Vertical constraint:
From (1), supy(x) <= infy(y).
From (2), supy(y) <= infy(z).
Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they are non-degenerate, meaning infy(y) <= supy(y).
Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z). This implies that the top of the bounding box of x is below or aligned with the bottom of the bounding box of z.

Horizontal constraints:
From (1), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
From (2), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
Combining the left bounds: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
Thus, infx(z) <= infx(x). This implies that the left edge of the bounding box of z is left of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of x.
Combining the right bounds: supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
Thus, supx(x) <= supx(z). This implies that the right edge of the bounding box of x is left of or aligned with the right edge of the bounding box of z.

So, from x S y and y S z, it is necessarily true that:
A) supy(x) <= infy(z)
B) infx(z) <= infx(x)
C) supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now let's examine the definitions of all possible cardinal direction relations R between x and z (a R b, where a is x and b is z) and see which ones are consistent with these necessary conditions.

The definitions are based on bounding boxes. Regions in REG are non-degenerate, meaning for any region r in REG, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

- S(x, z): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  These conditions match exactly the necessary conditions A, B, C. Since there exist regions in REG satisfying x S y and y S z (e.g., three disjoint squares stacked vertically and horizontally aligned), S is a possible relation between x and z.

- B(x, z): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Conditions B and C match. We need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible.
  We know supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z). This chain implies supy(x) <= infy(z).
  If infy(z) <= infy(x) is also true, then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
  Also, x S y requires supy(x) <= infy(y). If infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x S y horizontal), then supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
  And y S z requires supy(y) <= infy(z). If infy(z) <= infy(x) (for B(x,z)), then supy(y) <= infy(z) <= infy(x).
  So we need supy(x) <= infy(y), sy(y) <= iy(z), iy(z) <= iy(x).
  The chain is sy_x <= iy_y <= sy_y <= iy_z <= iy_x.
  Since regions are non-degenerate, iy_y < sy_y and iy_x < sy_x and iy_z < sy_z.
  If sy_x <= iy_y and iy_y <= iy_x, then sy_x <= iy_x. This is possible.
  However, the chain sy_x <= iy_y and iy_y <= iy_x implies that the bottom of y is below or aligned with the bottom of x, while the top of x is below or aligned with the bottom of y. These conditions together imply sy_x = iy_y = iy_x for non-degenerate regions, which would mean the vertical extent of x is a point, contradicting REG definition. Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible given x S y and y S z for regions in REG.
  B is not possible.

- W(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  infy(z) <= infy(x) was just shown to be impossible.
  W is not possible.

- E(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  infy(z) <= infy(x) was just shown to be impossible.
  E is not possible.

- NW(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  supy(z) <= infy(x) implies z is below x.
  We know supy(x) <= infy(z) implies x is below z.
  If x is below z and z is below x, their vertical extents must overlap and be points for non-degenerate regions, which is impossible.
  sy_x <= iy_y <= sy_y <= iy_z. If sy_z <= iy_x, the vertical ranges are inconsistent for non-degenerate regions.
  NW is not possible.

- N(x, z): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  supy(z) <= infy(x) was just shown to be impossible.
  N is not possible.

- NE(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  supy(z) <= infy(x) was just shown to be impossible.
  NE is not possible.

- SW(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  supy(x) <= infy(z) matches necessary condition A.
  We need to check if supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible.
  We know infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
  If supx(x) <= infx(z) is true, then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x).
  Since regions are non-degenerate, infx(x) < supx(x).
  So, infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). This leads to infx(x) < infx(x), a contradiction.
  The only way this chain can hold is if infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z), which means the horizontal extent of x is a point, contradicting REG definition.
  Thus, supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible given the necessary horizontal conditions.
  SW is not possible.

- SE(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  supy(x) <= infy(z) matches necessary condition A.
  We need to check if supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
  We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  If supx(z) <= infx(x) is true, then infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
  This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Since regions are non-degenerate, infx(x) < supx(x).
  So, infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(x), a contradiction.
  The only way this chain can hold is if infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z), which means the horizontal extent of x is a point, contradicting REG definition.
  Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible given the necessary horizontal conditions.
  SE is not possible.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relation between region x and region z is S.

The final answer is $\boxed{S}$.
