PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The given relations are:
1. x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. These relations are defined based on the bounds of the minimum bounding boxes of the regions.

Let's analyze the constraints on the bounds of x, y, and z:
(C1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(C2) supy(y) <= infy(x)
(C3) supy(z) <= infy(y)
(C4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(C5) supx(y) <= supx(z)

Also, for any region `a`, infx(a) <= supx(a) and infy(a) <= supy(a). For regions homeomorphic to a disk, the area is positive, implying infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's analyze the possible relations between x and z based on their x and y bounds, derived from the constraints C1-C5.

Y-axis relation between x and z:
From (C2) and (C3): supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Since infy(y) <= supy(y), we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(z) <= infy(x).
This means the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x. In other words, z is below or vertically aligned with the bottom edge of x's bounding box.

Let's check which y-conditions of the possible relations (from the given set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}) match supy(z) <= infy(x):
- S, SW, SE: require supy(a) <= infy(b). For (x,z), this is supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) unless the regions have zero height, which is not allowed. So, S, SW, SE are not possible.
- N, NW, NE: require supy(b) <= infy(a). For (x,z), this is supy(z) <= infy(x). This matches our finding and is always true given the initial relations. So, N, NW, NE are potentially possible.
- W, E, B: require infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). For (x,z), this is infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  If this condition holds, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We also know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
  Combining supy(x) <= supy(z) with supy(z) <= infy(x) gives supy(x) <= infy(x).
  This implies that the y-projection of x, [infy(x), supy(x)], must have supy(x) <= infy(x). For a region homeomorphic to a disk, infy(x) < supy(x). This is a contradiction.
  Therefore, the y-condition `infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)` is not possible. This rules out W, E, B.

Based on the y-axis analysis, the only possible relations between x and z are N, NW, or NE. These are the relations whose definition includes the y-condition supy(z) <= infy(x).

Now let's check the x-conditions for these remaining relations (N, NW, NE) based on constraints C1-C5.
We know:
(C1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(C4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(C5) supx(y) <= supx(z)

From infx(y) <= supx(y), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.

Check the x-conditions for N, NW, NE:
- N: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We know supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true. So, the x-condition for N is infx(z) <= infx(x).
  Is it possible to construct regions satisfying the initial relations such that infx(z) <= infx(x)?
  Let x = [3.5, 4] x [5, 6], y = [4.5, 5] x [2, 3], z = [3, 7] x [0, 1].
  infx(x)=3.5, supx(x)=4, infy(x)=5, supy(x)=6.
  infx(y)=4.5, supx(y)=5, infy(y)=2, supy(y)=3.
  infx(z)=3, supx(z)=7, infy(z)=0, supy(z)=1.
  Check x NW y: supx(x)<=infx(y) (4<=4.5) YES. supy(y)<=infy(x) (3<=5) YES. (x NW y holds).
  Check y N z: supy(z)<=infy(y) (1<=2) YES. infx(z)<=infx(y) (3<=4.5) YES. supx(y)<=supx(z) (5<=7) YES. (y N z holds).
  Check x N z x-condition: infx(z)<=infx(x) (3<=3.5) YES. supx(x)<=supx(z) (4<=7) YES.
  Since the x-condition for N is possible and the y-condition for N (supy(z) <= infy(x)) is always true, the relation x N z is possible.

- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z).
  Is it possible to construct regions satisfying the initial relations such that supx(x) <= infx(z)?
  Let x = [0, 1] x [3, 4], y = [2, 3] x [1.5, 2], z = [1.5, 4] x [0, 1].
  infx(x)=0, supx(x)=1, infy(x)=3, supy(x)=4.
  infx(y)=2, supx(y)=3, infy(y)=1.5, supy(y)=2.
  infx(z)=1.5, supx(z)=4, infy(z)=0, supy(z)=1.
  Check x NW y: supx(x)<=infx(y) (1<=2) YES. supy(y)<=infy(x) (2<=3) YES. (x NW y holds).
  Check y N z: supy(z)<=infy(y) (1<=1.5) YES. infx(z)<=infx(y) (1.5<=2) YES. supx(y)<=supx(z) (3<=4) YES. (y N z holds).
  Check x NW z x-condition: supx(x)<=infx(z) (1<=1.5) YES.
  Since the x-condition for NW is possible and the y-condition for NW (supy(z) <= infy(x)) is always true, the relation x NW z is possible.

- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x).
  We know supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
  This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). For a region homeomorphic to a disk, infx(x) < supx(x). This is a contradiction.
  Therefore, the x-condition for NE is not possible. This rules out NE.

The only possible relations between x and z are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
