PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given constraints are:
1. Region x is NW of region y (x NW y): supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. Region y is E of region z (y E z): supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z. Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds of region a.

From the constraints, we have the following inequalities:
(1a) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(1b) supy(y) <= infy(x)
(2a) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(2b) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(2c) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining (1b) and (2c), we get:
supy(y) <= infy(x)  and supy(y) <= supy(z)
This means infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(z) >= supy(y).

Combining (1a) and (2a), we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)
This means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y).

Since x and z are regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, they are non-degenerate, meaning infx < supx and infy < supy for any region.

Let's examine the y-coordinate relations between x and z for each possible cardinal direction relation.
The y-conditions for the relations are:
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z)
- SW: supy(x) <= infy(z)
- SE: supy(x) <= infy(z)
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertical overlap/containment)
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertical overlap/containment)
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertical containment)

Let's check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible.
From (1b), infy(x) >= supy(y). Since x is non-degenerate, supy(x) > infy(x).
Thus, supy(x) > infy(x) >= supy(y), which implies supy(x) > supy(y).
From (2b), infy(z) <= infy(y). Since y is non-degenerate, infy(y) <= supy(y).
Thus, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y).
So we have supy(x) > supy(y) and infy(z) <= supy(y).
If supy(x) <= infy(z) were true, then we would have supy(y) < supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(y).
This implies supy(y) < supy(y), which is a contradiction.
Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
This rules out S, SW, and SE.

Let's check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible.
infy(z) <= infy(x): From (2b), infy(z) <= infy(y). From (1b), infy(x) >= supy(y). Since y is non-degenerate, infy(y) <= supy(y). So infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x) is always true.
supy(x) <= supy(z): We know supy(x) > infy(x) >= supy(y), so supy(x) > supy(y). We also know supy(z) >= supy(y) from (2c). It is possible to have supy(y) < supy(x) <= supy(z). For example, let supy(y)=5, supy(x)=8, supy(z)=10. This is consistent (8 > 5, 10 >= 5, 8 <= 10). We need to check if infy(x) and infy(z) can also satisfy the conditions. If supy(x)=8, infy(x) could be 7 (7 >= supy(y)=5). If supy(z)=10, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y)=5. Let infy(z)=4 (4 <= infy(y)). We need infy(z) <= infy(x), i.e., 4 <= 7, which is true.
So, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible.
This means E, W, and B might be possible depending on the x-conditions.

The x-conditions for the remaining relations (N, NE, NW, E, W, B) are:
- N: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (horizontal overlap/containment)
- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z)
- E: supx(z) <= infx(x) (and vertical overlap/containment, already checked as possible)
- W: supx(x) <= infx(z) (and vertical overlap/containment, already checked as possible)
- B: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (horizontal containment, and vertical containment, already checked as possible)

From (1a), supx(x) <= infx(y). From (2a), supx(z) <= infx(y).
There is no direct constraint on infx(x) or infx(z).

Let's check the horizontal relations:
- x is left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)): Possible. We have supx(x) <= infx(y). We can choose infx(z) such that infx(z) >= infx(y), then supx(x) <= infx(y) <= infx(z). Or we can choose infx(z) < infx(y). Example: infx(y)=10, supx(x)=8. Let infx(z)=9. 8 <= 9. This is possible.
- x is right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)): Possible. We have supx(z) <= infx(y). No constraint on infx(x). We can choose infx(x) to be greater than supx(z). Example: supx(z)=5. Let infx(x)=6. 5 <= 6. This is possible.
- x overlaps z horizontally (infx(z) <= supx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(z)): Possible. infx(z) <= supx(x) is possible (e.g., infx(y)=10, supx(x)=8, supx(z)=5, infx(z)=0; 0 <= 8). infx(x) <= supx(z) is possible (e.g., infx(y)=10, supx(x)=8, supx(z)=15, infx(z)=0, infx(x)=1; 1 <= 15). Can both hold? Yes. Example: z=(0,0)-(10,10). y=(11,0)-(13,10). x NW y implies supx(x)<=11, infy(x)>=10. Pick x=(5,11)-(7,12). infx(x)=5, supx(x)=7, infy(x)=11, supy(x)=12. z=(0,0)-(10,10). infx(z)=0, supx(z)=10. infx(z)<=supx(x) (0<=7), infx(x)<=supx(z) (5<=10). Yes, possible.

Based on the possibility of horizontal and vertical relations:
- N: supy(z) <= infy(x) (possible) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (possible horizontal overlap). N is possible.
- NE: supy(z) <= infy(x) (possible) AND supx(z) <= infx(x) (possible horizontal right). NE is possible.
- NW: supy(z) <= infy(x) (possible) AND supx(x) <= infx(z) (possible horizontal left). NW is possible.
- E: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (possible vertical overlap) AND supx(z) <= infx(x) (possible horizontal right). E is possible.
- W: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (possible vertical overlap) AND supx(x) <= infx(z) (possible horizontal left). W is possible.
- B: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (possible vertical containment) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (possible horizontal containment). B is possible.

We have constructed examples in the thought block showing that N, NE, NW, W, E, and B are all possible.
S, SW, SE are impossible due to the y-constraints.

Possible relations: N, NE, NW, W, E, B.

The order required is N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.
Possible relations in this order: N, NE, E, NW, W, B.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, E, NW, W, B}$.
