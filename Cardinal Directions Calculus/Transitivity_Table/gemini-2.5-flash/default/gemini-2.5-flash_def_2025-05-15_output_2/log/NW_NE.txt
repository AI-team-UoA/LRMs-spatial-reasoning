PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the regions be $x, y, z$.
We are given the following cardinal direction relations:
1. $x$ NW $y$
2. $y$ NE $z$

The definitions of these relations in terms of the bounds of the minimum bounding box are:
$a$ NW $b \iff supx(a) \le infx(b)$ and $supy(b) \le infy(a)$
$a$ NE $b \iff supx(b) \le infx(a)$ and $supy(b) \le infy(a)$

Applying these definitions to the given relations:
1. $x$ NW $y \iff supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(x)$
2. $y$ NE $z \iff supx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(y)$

From the vertical inequalities in the two conditions:
$supy(y) \le infy(x)$
$supy(z) \le infy(y)$

Combining these inequalities, we get $supy(z) \le infy(y) \le supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
Thus, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.

Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, they are non-empty and have a positive area. This implies that for any region $a$, $infy(a) < supy(a)$.
Using this, we can refine the combined inequality:
$infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$.

This implies that $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
This vertical relationship tells us that the top of the bounding box of $z$ is at or below the bottom of the bounding box of $x$.

Now let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ ($x$ R $z$). We examine the vertical conditions required for each relation $a$ R $b$ (where $a=x, b=z$). The definitions are provided in the problem description:

- $x$ S $z \iff supy(x) \le infy(z)$ ... This contradicts $infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
- $x$ SW $z \iff supy(x) \le infy(z)$ ... Impossible.
- $x$ SE $z \iff supy(x) \le infy(z)$ ... Impossible.

- $x$ W $z \iff infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ ... The condition $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ contradicts $supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
- $x$ E $z \iff infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ ... Impossible.
- $x$ B $z \iff infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ ... Impossible.

- $x$ N $z \iff supy(z) \le infy(x)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. The vertical condition $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is satisfied by our derivation. This relation is possible if the horizontal conditions $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ can be satisfied simultaneously with the initial conditions.
- $x$ NW $z \iff supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. The vertical condition $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is satisfied. This relation is possible if the horizontal condition $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ can be satisfied.
- $x$ NE $z \iff supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. The vertical condition $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is satisfied. This relation is possible if the horizontal condition $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ can be satisfied.

Now we need to check if the required horizontal relationships for N, NW, and NE are consistent with the initial horizontal constraints:
$supx(x) \le infx(y)$
$supx(z) \le infx(y)$

These constraints imply that $infx(y)$ is greater than or equal to both $supx(x)$ and $supx(z)$. This does not impose any specific order between $supx(x)$ and $supx(z)$, or between $infx(x)$ and $infx(z)$.
Let's see if we can construct scenarios where N, NW, or NE holds for $x$ and $z$ while the initial relations hold.

Scenario for $x$ N $z$: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
Let $infx(x)=5, supx(x)=10$. We need $infx(z) \le 5$ and $10 \le supx(z)$. Let $infx(z)=4, supx(z)=11$.
We need $infx(y) \ge supx(x)=10$ and $infx(y) \ge supx(z)=11$. Let $infx(y)=12$. This is possible. We showed a full example in thought block.

Scenario for $x$ NW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$.
Let $infx(x)=5, supx(x)=10$. We need $10 \le infx(z)$. Let $infx(z)=11, supx(z)=12$.
We need $infx(y) \ge supx(x)=10$ and $infx(y) \ge supx(z)=12$. Let $infx(y)=13$. This is possible. We showed a full example in thought block.

Scenario for $x$ NE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$.
Let $infx(x)=5, supx(x)=10$. We need $supx(z) \le 5$. Let $infx(z)=3, supx(z)=4$.
We need $infx(y) \ge supx(x)=10$ and $infx(y) \ge supx(z)=4$. Let $infx(y)=10$. This is possible. We showed a full example in thought block.

Since N, NW, and NE are the only relations whose vertical conditions are compatible with $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, and we have shown by construction that the required horizontal conditions for each of N, NW, and NE are consistent with the initial relations, these three relations are the only possible ones between $x$ and $z$.

The possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$ are N, NW, and NE.

N, NE, NW

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, NW}$.
