PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the regions be x, y, and z.
Let BB(r) denote the minimum bounding box of a region r, defined by [infx(r), supx(r)] x [infy(r), supy(r)].
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes have non-zero width and height, i.e., supx(r) > infx(r) and supy(r) > infy(r) for any region r in REG.

We are given the relations:
1. x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints on their bounding boxes.

From (1):
infx(x) >= supx(y)  (x is to the East of or aligned with the East boundary of y)
infy(x) >= supy(y)  (x is to the North of or aligned with the North boundary of y)

From (2):
infx(y) >= supx(z)  (y is to the East of or aligned with the East boundary of z)
infy(y) >= infy(z)  (The South boundary of y is at or below the South boundary of z)
supy(y) <= supy(z)  (The North boundary of y is at or below the North boundary of z)

Combining the x-constraints:
infx(x) >= supx(y) and infx(y) >= supx(z).
Since supx(y) >= infx(y) (as regions have non-zero width), we have infx(x) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= supx(z).
This implies infx(x) >= supx(z).
This constraint means the left boundary of x is to the East of or aligned with the right boundary of z. This immediately rules out any relation where x is West of z (W, SW, NW) and the bounding box relation (B) which requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Since supx(x) > infx(x) and supx(z) > infx(z), infx(x) >= supx(z) implies supx(x) > infx(x) >= supx(z) > infx(z), so supx(x) > supx(z). Thus B is impossible.

The relations potentially possible given infx(x) >= supx(z) are E, NE, SE.

Let's combine the y-constraints:
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(y) >= infy(z)
supy(y) <= supy(z)

From infy(x) >= supy(y) and infy(y) >= infy(z), and supy(y) >= infy(y), we get infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= infy(z).
This implies infy(x) >= infy(z).
The South boundary of x is at or above the South boundary of z.

Now let's evaluate the remaining possible relations (E, NE, SE) between x and z based on the derived constraints and their definitions:

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
  supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied by our combined x-constraint.
  For supy(z) <= infy(x) to be possible, we need to find regions x, y, z satisfying the initial conditions such that supy(z) <= infy(x).
  We know infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
  If we can choose y such that supy(y) is close to supy(z), and x such that infy(x) is close to supy(y), then infy(x) can be >= supy(z).
  Example: Let z = [0,1] x [0,1]. supx(z)=1, supy(z)=1.
  y E z: infx(y) >= 1, infy(y) >= 0, supy(y) <= 1. Let y = [1.1, 1.2] x [0.9, 1.0]. supx(y)=1.2, supy(y)=1.0.
  x NE y: infx(x) >= supx(y)=1.2, infy(x) >= supy(y)=1.0. Let x = [1.3, 1.4] x [1.0, 1.1]. infx(x)=1.3, infy(x)=1.0.
  Check x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x)? 1 <= 1.3 (Yes). supy(z) <= infy(x)? 1 <= 1.0 (Yes, boundaries touch).
  So, x NE z is possible.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
  infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied by our derived infy(x) >= infy(z).
  For supy(x) <= supy(z) to be possible, we need to find regions x, y, z satisfying the initial conditions such that supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We know infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), and supy(x) > infy(x).
  We need supy(x) <= supy(z). This requires the height of x above infy(x) to be limited, and infy(x) not to be too high relative to supy(z).
  Example: Let z = [0,1] x [0,1]. supx(z)=1, infy(z)=0, supy(z)=1.
  y E z: infx(y) >= 1, infy(y) >= 0, supy(y) <= 1. Let y = [2,3] x [0, 0.5]. supx(y)=3, infy(y)=0, supy(y)=0.5.
  x NE y: infx(x) >= supx(y)=3, infy(x) >= supy(y)=0.5. Let x = [4,5] x [0.6, 0.8]. infx(x)=4, infy(x)=0.6, supy(x)=0.8.
  Check x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x)? 1 <= 4 (Yes). infy(z) <= infy(x)? 0 <= 0.6 (Yes). supy(x) <= supy(z)? 0.8 <= 1 (Yes).
  So, x E z is possible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
  supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
  For supy(x) <= infy(z) to be possible, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
  However, we derived infy(x) >= infy(z).
  Since regions in REG have non-zero height, supy(x) > infy(x).
  Thus, supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(z), which means supy(x) > infy(z).
  This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z).
  So, x SE z is not possible for regions in REG.

The relations ruled out by infx(x) >= supx(z) were W, SW, NW, B.
The relation ruled out by supy(x) > infy(z) (derived from initial conditions and height > 0) is SE, S.
The relation ruled out by supx(x) > infx(z) (derived from initial conditions and width > 0) was N (requires supx(x) <= supx(z)) - let's recheck N properly:
- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). We derived infx(x) >= supx(z), and we know supx(x) > infx(x) and supx(z) > infx(z). This gives supx(x) > infx(x) >= supx(z) > infx(z), so supx(x) > supx(z). This contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So N is impossible.

The only possible relations are E and NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, NE}$.
