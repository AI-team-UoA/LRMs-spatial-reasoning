PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The definitions of the given relations in terms of bounding box coordinates are:
x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We are given that x B y and y E z hold. Let's derive the necessary relationships between the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

From x B y:
1) infx(y) <= infx(x)
2) supx(x) <= supx(y)
3) infy(y) <= infy(x)
4) supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y E z:
5) supx(z) <= infx(y)
6) infy(z) <= infy(y)
7) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these inequalities:
For the x-coordinates:
From (5) and (1): supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x). (Derived Constraint C1)

For the y-coordinates:
From (6) and (3): infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x). (Derived Constraint C2)
From (4) and (7): supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z). (Derived Constraint C3)

So, if x B y and y E z hold, the bounding boxes of x and z must satisfy these three conditions:
C1: supx(z) <= infx(x)
C2: infy(z) <= infy(x)
C3: supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now let's check which of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with these derived constraints. The definition of x R z is:
x R z if relation_conditions(infx(z), supx(z), infy(z), supy(z), infx(x), supx(x), infy(x), supy(x)) hold.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
  These are exactly the three derived constraints C1, C2, and C3. Thus, if x B y and y E z hold, x E z must hold. E is a possible relation.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
  From the properties of regions homeomorphic to a disk, infy(x) < supy(x). From C3, supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Combining these: infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z). Thus, infy(x) < supy(z).
  This contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So N is not possible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z)
  From the properties of regions, infy(x) < supy(x). From C2, infy(z) <= infy(x).
  Combining these: infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). Thus, infy(z) < supy(x).
  This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So S is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
  From the properties of regions, infx(x) < supx(x). From C1, supx(z) <= infx(x).
  Combining these: supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). Thus, supx(z) < supx(x).
  If supx(x) <= infx(z) holds, then supx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(z). This implies supx(z) < infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) < supx(z). So W is not possible.

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible (as shown for N). So NE is not possible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
  supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible (as shown for S). So SE is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  Neither condition is possible (as shown for W and N). So NW is not possible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
  Neither condition is possible (as shown for W and S). So SW is not possible.

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
  The y-conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are guaranteed by C2 and C3.
  However, the x-conditions require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We have C1: supx(z) <= infx(x).
  If x B z holds, then supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x).
  This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x) for regions in REG. So B is not possible.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box relations and the properties of the regions, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is E.

The final answer is $\boxed{E}$.
