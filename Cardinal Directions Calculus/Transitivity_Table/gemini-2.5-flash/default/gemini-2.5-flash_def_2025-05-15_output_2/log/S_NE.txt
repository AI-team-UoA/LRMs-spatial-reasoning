PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are x S y and y NE z. We use the definitions based on the infimum and supremum of the x and y projections of the regions. Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds for region a.

The definition of x S y is:
1) supy(x) <= infy(y)
2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

The definition of y NE z is:
4) supx(z) <= infx(y)
5) supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relations R between x and z, i.e., x R z, from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's combine the given inequalities to derive constraints on the relative positions of x and z.
From (2) and (4): supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
So, we have a necessary condition: supx(z) <= infx(x).
This means the supremum of the x-projection of z is less than or equal to the infimum of the x-projection of x. In terms of bounding boxes, the right edge of z's bounding box is at or to the left of the left edge of x's bounding box. This implies z's bounding box is generally to the West of or aligned with the left edge of x's bounding box.

Now let's check which of the nine possible relations between x and z are compatible with supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions (regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk have supx > infx and supy > infy).

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), this implies supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This is only possible for degenerate regions where supx=infx. Not possible for regions in REG.
- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z). Not possible for regions in REG.
- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z). Not possible for regions in REG.
- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Not possible for regions in REG.
- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Not possible for regions in REG.
- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Not possible for regions in REG.

Thus, the only possible relations for x relative to z that are compatible with supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions are E, NE, SE. Let's check if each of these is possible by constructing examples of regions x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions (x S y and y NE z) and the respective relation (x R z).

From (1) and (5): supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). Both x and z are positioned such that their maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of y. This means both x and z are entirely below or touching the bottom edge of y's bounding box.

Now let's consider the y-relation between x and z based on supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y).

Case 1: x is North of z in terms of y-projection (supy(z) <= infy(x)).
Combining with supx(z) <= infx(x), this gives the condition for x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
Example: Let x box = [10, 15] x [10, 15], z box = [0, 5] x [0, 5].
supx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supy(z)=5 <= infy(x)=10 (T). x NE z holds.
Can we find a y such that x S y and y NE z?
x S y: supy(x)=15 <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x)=10, supx(x)=15 <= supx(y).
y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y), supy(z)=5 <= infy(y).
Constraints on y: infy(y) >= 15, infy(y) >= 5 (so infy(y) >= 15). infx(y) <= 10, infx(y) >= 5 (so 5 <= infx(y) <= 10). supx(y) >= 15.
Let y box = [7, 20] x [18, 25]. infx(y)=7, supx(y)=20, infy(y)=18, supy(y)=25.
Check x S y: supy(x)=15 <= infy(y)=18 (T). infx(y)=7 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supx(x)=15 <= supx(y)=20 (T). x S y holds.
Check y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=7 (T). supy(z)=5 <= infy(y)=18 (T). y NE z holds.
Thus, NE is a possible relation.

Case 2: x is South of z in terms of y-projection (supy(x) <= infy(z)).
Combining with supx(z) <= infx(x), this gives the condition for x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
Example: Let x box = [10, 15] x [0, 5], z box = [0, 5] x [10, 15].
supx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supy(x)=5 <= infy(z)=10 (T). x SE z holds.
Can we find a y such that x S y and y NE z?
x S y: supy(x)=5 <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x)=10, supx(x)=15 <= supx(y).
y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y), supy(z)=15 <= infy(y).
Constraints on y: infy(y) >= 5, infy(y) >= 15 (so infy(y) >= 15). infx(y) <= 10, infx(y) >= 5 (so 5 <= infx(y) <= 10). supx(y) >= 15.
Let y box = [7, 20] x [18, 25]. Same as before.
Check x S y: supy(x)=5 <= infy(y)=18 (T). infx(y)=7 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supx(x)=15 <= supx(y)=20 (T). x S y holds.
Check y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=7 (T). supy(z)=15 <= infy(y)=18 (T). y NE z holds.
Thus, SE is a possible relation.

Case 3: x and z overlap in terms of y-projection, and not disjoint as in Case 1 or 2.
The definition of x E z is: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is necessary. The y-conditions are infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). This means z's y-projection starts lower or at the same level as x's, and ends higher or at the same level as x's. This is satisfied if z's y-projection contains x's y-projection, or they share a boundary.
Example: Let x box = [10, 15] x [10, 15], z box = [0, 5] x [5, 20].
supx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=10 (T). infy(z)=5 <= infy(x)=10 (T). supy(x)=15 <= supy(z)=20 (T). x E z holds.
Can we find a y such that x S y and y NE z?
x S y: supy(x)=15 <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x)=10, supx(x)=15 <= supx(y).
y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y), supy(z)=20 <= infy(y).
Constraints on y: infy(y) >= 15, infy(y) >= 20 (so infy(y) >= 20). infx(y) <= 10, infx(y) >= 5 (so 5 <= infx(y) <= 10). supx(y) >= 15.
Let y box = [7, 20] x [22, 30]. infx(y)=7, supx(y)=20, infy(y)=22, supy(y)=30.
Check x S y: supy(x)=15 <= infy(y)=22 (T). infx(y)=7 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supx(x)=15 <= supx(y)=20 (T). x S y holds.
Check y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=7 (T). supy(z)=20 <= infy(y)=22 (T). y NE z holds.
Thus, E is a possible relation.

We have shown that E, NE, and SE are possible relations between x and z. Based on the initial analysis, no other single-tile relation is possible for non-degenerate regions.

The possible relations are NE, SE, E.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, SE, E}$.
