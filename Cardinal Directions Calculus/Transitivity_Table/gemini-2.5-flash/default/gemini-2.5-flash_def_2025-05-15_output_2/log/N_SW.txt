PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given information is:
1) x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y).
2) y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z).

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on the provided definitions.
Let's combine the inequalities:
From (1):
(I1) infy(x) >= supy(y)
(I2) infx(x) >= infx(y)
(I3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

From (2):
(I4) infx(z) >= supx(y)
(I5) infy(z) >= supy(y)

Let's analyze the x-axis relations between x and z.
From (I3) and (I4), we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).
So, supx(x) <= infx(z).

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies their minimum bounding boxes have non-zero width and height. Thus, for any region 'a' in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).
Since x is in REG, infx(x) < supx(x).
Since z is in REG, infx(z) < supx(z).

Combining supx(x) <= infx(z) with the non-degenerate property, we get infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) < supx(z).
This implies that the projection of region x on the x-axis, [infx(x), supx(x)], is entirely to the left of or touching the projection of region z on the x-axis, [infx(z), supx(z)].

Now let's examine the x-conditions for each cardinal direction relation:
- B: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). This requires [infx(x), supx(x)] to be contained within [infx(z), supx(z)].
- S: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). (Same x-condition as B)
- SW: supx(x) <= infx(z).
- W: supx(x) <= infx(z).
- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z).
- N: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). (Same x-condition as B)
- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x). This requires [infx(z), supx(z)] to be to the left of or touching [infx(x), supx(x)].
- E: supx(z) <= infx(x). (Same x-condition as NE)
- SE: supx(z) <= infx(x). (Same x-condition as NE)

We have derived that supx(x) <= infx(z) must hold.
If supx(x) <= infx(z), then it is impossible for supx(z) <= infx(x) to hold, because infx(x) < supx(x) and infx(z) < supx(z), so infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) < supx(z), which implies infx(x) < supx(z). This rules out relations E, NE, SE.

Now consider the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) (required for B, S, N). If both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z) must hold, then infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z). This inequality chain implies infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z). This contradicts the non-degenerate property infx(x) < supx(x) for regions in REG. Therefore, the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) is incompatible with supx(x) <= infx(z) for regions in REG. This rules out relations B, S, N.

The only relations whose x-conditions are compatible with supx(x) <= infx(z) are SW, W, and NW. We must now check if the y-conditions for each of these are possible.

Let's analyze the y-axis relations between x and z.
From (I1) and (I5):
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(z) >= supy(y)
This tells us that both the bottom of x and the bottom of z are above or touching the top of y. The relative vertical position of x and z is not fixed by these inequalities alone.

Consider the possible relations SW, W, NW:
- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (true) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
Is supy(x) <= infy(z) possible?
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[0,1]. supy(y)=1.
x N y: infx(x) >= 0, supx(x) <= 1, infy(x) >= 1. Let x = [0,1]x[1.1, 1.2]. supy(x)=1.2, infy(x)=1.1.
y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z). 1 <= infx(z), 1 <= infy(z). Let z = [2,3]x[1.3, 1.4]. infx(z)=2, infy(z)=1.3.
Check x SW z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True). supy(x)=1.2 <= infy(z)=1.3 (True).
SW is possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (true) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
Is infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z) possible? This condition means the y-interval of z contains the y-interval of x.
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[0,1]. supy(y)=1.
x N y: infx(x) >= 0, supx(x) <= 1, infy(x) >= 1. Let x = [0.2, 0.8]x[2, 3]. infy(x)=2, supy(x)=3.
y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z). 1 <= infx(z), 1 <= infy(z). Let z = [2,3]x[1.5, 3.5]. infx(z)=2, infy(z)=1.5, supy(z)=3.5.
Check x W z: supx(x)=0.8 <= infx(z)=2 (True). infy(z)=1.5 <= infy(x)=2 (True). supy(x)=3 <= supy(z)=3.5 (True).
W is possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (true) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
Is supy(z) <= infy(x) possible?
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[0,1]. supy(y)=1.
x N y: infx(x) >= 0, supx(x) <= 1, infy(x) >= 1. Let x = [0,1]x[3, 4]. infy(x)=3, supy(x)=4.
y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z). 1 <= infx(z), 1 <= infy(z). Let z = [2,3]x[1.5, 2.5]. infx(z)=2, infy(z)=1.5, supy(z)=2.5.
Check x NW z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True). supy(z)=2.5 <= infy(x)=3 (True).
NW is possible.

Since relations B, S, N, E, NE, SE are impossible, and relations SW, W, NW are all possible, the possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW, W, NW}$.
