PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given information is:
1) Region x is SW of region y:
   supx(x) <= infx(y)
   supy(x) <= infy(y)

2) Region y is N of region z:
   supy(z) <= infy(y)
   infx(z) <= infx(y)
   supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's denote the bounds as ix(a), sx(a), iy(a), sy(a) for infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) respectively.
The given constraints are:
1) sx(x) <= ix(y)
   sy(x) <= iy(y)
2) sy(z) <= iy(y)
   ix(z) <= ix(y)
   sx(y) <= sx(z)

We are looking for possible relations between x and z. We need to check which of the 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with these constraints.
The 9 relations for x and z are defined based on their bounding boxes [ix(x), sx(x)] x [iy(x), sy(x)] and [ix(z), sx(z)] x [iy(z), sy(z)].

Let's deduce some relationships between the bounds of x and z.
From sx(x) <= ix(y) and sx(y) <= sx(z), and knowing that ix(y) <= sx(y) for a non-degenerate region y (homeomorphic to a disk), we have sx(x) <= ix(y) <= sx(y) <= sx(z).
Thus, we must always have sx(x) <= sx(z).

Now let's check each of the 9 possible relations for x and z:

1.  x E z: sx(z) <= ix(x), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z).
    From sx(z) <= ix(x) and ix(x) <= sx(x), we get sx(z) <= sx(x). Since we must also have sx(x) <= sx(z), this implies sx(x) = sx(z) and ix(x) = sx(x) (for non-degenerate x). A region homeomorphic to a disk is not a vertical line, so ix(x) < sx(x). Thus, sx(z) <= ix(x) is impossible given sx(x) <= sx(z) for non-degenerate regions.
    So, E is impossible.

2.  x NE z: sx(z) <= ix(x) and sy(z) <= iy(x).
    Impossible because sx(z) <= ix(x) is impossible.

3.  x SE z: sx(z) <= ix(x) and sy(x) <= iy(z).
    Impossible because sx(z) <= ix(x) is impossible.

4.  x S z: sy(x) <= iy(z), ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z).
    We know sx(x) <= sx(z) is always true.
    Are sy(x) <= iy(z) and ix(z) <= ix(x) possible?
    We need to find regions x, y, z satisfying the initial constraints and x S z.
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-1,-0.5] x [-2,-1.5]. ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=-0.5, iy(x)=-2, sy(x)=-1.5. (sx(x)=-0.5 <= 0, sy(x)=-1.5 <= 0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-2,1.5] x [-1,-0.5]. ix(z)=-2, sx(z)=1.5, iy(z)=-1, sy(z)=-0.5. (sy(z)=-0.5 <= 0, ix(z)=-2 <= 0, sx(y)=1 <= sx(z)=1.5. Yes).
    Check x S z: sy(x) <= iy(z)? -1.5 <= -1. Yes. ix(z) <= ix(x)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sx(x) <= sx(z)? -0.5 <= 1.5. Yes.
    So, S is possible.

5.  x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z).
    Are these possible?
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-2,-1] x [-2,-0.5]. ix(x)=-2, sx(x)=-1, iy(x)=-2, sy(x)=-0.5. (sx(x)=-1 <= 0, sy(x)=-0.5 <= 0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-0.5,1.5] x [-3,-1]. ix(z)=-0.5, sx(z)=1.5, iy(z)=-3, sy(z)=-1. (sy(z)=-1 <= 0, ix(z)=-0.5 <= 0, sx(y)=1 <= sx(z)=1.5. Yes).
    Check x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z)? -1 <= -0.5. Yes. iy(z) <= iy(x)? -3 <= -2. Yes. sy(x) <= sy(z)? -0.5 <= -1. No. The example failed.
    Let's construct another example for W.
    x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z).
    Let y=[0,0.5]x[0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=0.5, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x=[-3,-2]x[-2,-1]. ix(x)=-3, sx(x)=-2, iy(x)=-2, sy(x)=-1. (-2<=0, -1<=0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z=[-1,1]x[-3,-0.5]. ix(z)=-1, sx(z)=1, iy(z)=-3, sy(z)=-0.5. (-0.5<=0, -1<=0, 0.5<=1. Yes).
    Check x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z)? -2 <= -1. Yes. iy(z) <= iy(x)? -3 <= -2. Yes. sy(x) <= sy(z)? -1 <= -0.5. Yes.
    So, W is possible.

6.  x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) and sy(z) <= iy(x).
    Are these possible?
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-2,-1] x [-0.5,-0.1]. ix(x)=-2, sx(x)=-1, iy(x)=-0.5, sy(x)=-0.1. (sx(x)=-1 <= 0, sy(x)=-0.1 <= 0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-0.5, 1.5] x [-2,-0.6]. ix(z)=-0.5, sx(z)=1.5, iy(z)=-2, sy(z)=-0.6. (sy(z)=-0.6 <= 0, ix(z)=-0.5 <= 0, sx(y)=1 <= sx(z)=1.5. Yes).
    Check x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z)? -1 <= -0.5. Yes. sy(z) <= iy(x)? -0.6 <= -0.5. Yes.
    So, NW is possible.

7.  x N z: sy(z) <= iy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(a) <= supx(b).
    x N z: sy(z) <= iy(x), ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z).
    We know sx(x) <= sx(z) is always true.
    Are sy(z) <= iy(x) and ix(z) <= ix(x) possible?
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-1,-0.5] x [-1,-0.5]. ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=-0.5, iy(x)=-1, sy(x)=-0.5. (-0.5<=0, -0.5<=0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-2, 1.5] x [-2,-1.5]. ix(z)=-2, sx(z)=1.5, iy(z)=-2, sy(z)=-1.5. (-1.5<=0, -2<=0, 1<=1.5. Yes).
    Check x N z: sy(z) <= iy(x)? -1.5 <= -1. Yes. ix(z) <= ix(x)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sx(x) <= sx(z)? -0.5 <= 1.5. Yes.
    So, N is possible.

8.  x SW z: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
    x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) and sy(x) <= iy(z).
    Are these possible?
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-3,-2] x [-3,-2]. ix(x)=-3, sx(x)=-2, iy(x)=-3, sy(x)=-2. (-2<=0, -2<=0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-1,2] x [-1.5,-0.5]. ix(z)=-1, sx(z)=2, iy(z)=-1.5, sy(z)=-0.5. (-0.5<=0, -1<=0, 1<=2. Yes).
    Check x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sy(x) <= iy(z)? -2 <= -1.5. Yes.
    So, SW is possible.

9.  x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(a) <= supy(b).
    x B z: ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z).
    We know sx(x) <= sx(z) is always true.
    Are the other three possible simultaneously?
    Let y = [0,0.5] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=0.5, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-1,-0.5] x [-1,-0.5]. ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=-0.5, iy(x)=-1, sy(x)=-0.5. (-0.5<=0, -0.5<=0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-2,1] x [-2,-0.2]. ix(z)=-2, sx(z)=1, iy(z)=-2, sy(z)=-0.2. (-0.2<=0, -2<=0, 0.5<=1. Yes).
    Check x B z: ix(z) <= ix(x)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sx(x) <= sx(z)? -0.5 <= 1. Yes. iy(z) <= iy(x)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sy(x) <= sy(z)? -0.5 <= -0.2. Yes.
    So, B is possible.

The possible relations are those for which we found a valid construction: S, W, NW, N, SW, B.
The relations E, NE, SE are impossible.

The possible relations are: S, SW, W, NW, N, B.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}$.
