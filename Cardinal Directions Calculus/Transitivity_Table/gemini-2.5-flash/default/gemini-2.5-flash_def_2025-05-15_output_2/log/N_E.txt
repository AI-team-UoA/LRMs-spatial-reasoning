PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be represented by the interval [infx(a), supx(a)] on the x-axis and [infy(a), supy(a)] on the y-axis. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies they have a non-zero area. Consequently, their bounding boxes must have non-zero width and height, meaning infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

The given premises are:
1.  x is N of y (x N y):
    - supy(y) <= infy(x)
    - infx(y) <= infx(x)
    - supx(x) <= supx(y)
2.  y is E of z (y E z):
    - supx(z) <= infx(y)
    - infy(z) <= infy(y)
    - supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these inequalities, we can derive relationships between x and z:

Horizontal relationship:
From (4) supx(z) <= infx(y)
From (2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x).
Since regions have positive width (infx < supx), we have supx(z) > infx(z) and supx(x) > infx(x).
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) implies infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). So, infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(z) < supx(x). The bounding box of z is to the west of the bounding box of x, possibly tangential.

Vertical relationship:
From (5) infy(z) <= infy(y)
From (1) supy(y) <= infy(x)
Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
Since regions have positive height (infy < supy), we have infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). So, infy(z) < supy(x). The bottom boundary of x is above or aligned with the bottom boundary of z.

Now let's check which cardinal relations x R z are possible given supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x), and the positive width/height constraint (inf < sup).

The possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.

-   x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived supx(z) <= infx(x). Combined with supx(x) <= supx(z), this implies supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) < supx(x), this is a contradiction. N is not possible.

-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is consistent with the derivation.
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is consistent with the derivation (e.g., infy(z)=0, supy(z)=5, infy(y)=1, supy(y)=2, infy(x)=3. supy(y)<=infy(x) -> 2<=3. supy(y)<=supy(z) -> 2<=5. infy(z)<=infy(y) -> 0<=1. And supy(z)<=infy(x) -> 5<=3 is false. My prior NE example construction was supy(z)<=infy(x). Let me recheck that. infy(z)=0, supy(z)=10. infy(y)=8, supy(y)=9. infy(x)=10. supy(z)=10 <= infy(x)=10. This is possible. So NE is possible).

-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is consistent.
    infy(z) <= infy(x) is derived.
    supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible (as shown in a previous example construction). E is possible.

-   x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x). Thus, infy(z) < supy(x).
    The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is a contradiction. SE is not possible.

-   x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible (same reason as SE). S is not possible.

-   x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We know infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). Thus, infx(z) < supx(x).
    The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) is a contradiction. SW is not possible.

-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Impossible (supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts derivation). W is not possible.

-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible (supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts derivation). NW is not possible.

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible.
    infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
    supx(x) <= supx(z). But we derived supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) < supx(x), so supx(z) < supx(x).
    The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is a contradiction. B is not possible.

Under the assumption that regions in REG have bounding boxes with positive width and height, the only possible relations are NE and E.

NE, E.
