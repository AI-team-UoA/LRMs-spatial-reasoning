PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let BB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. For regions in REG, we know that infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) (the bounding box has positive width and height).

The given relations are:
1.  x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints on their bounding boxes relative to each other.

From (1) and (2):
supx(x) <= infx(y)
supx(z) <= infx(y)
These inequalities tell us that the right edges of the bounding boxes of x and z are both to the left of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of y. This means infx(y) is an upper bound for both supx(x) and supx(z). This does not directly constrain the relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z (infx(x), supx(x) vs infx(z), supx(z)).

From (1) and (2):
supy(x) <= infy(y)
supy(y) <= infy(z)
Also, infy(y) <= supy(y) (property of a bounding box).
Combining these, we get: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
This chain implies supy(x) <= infy(z).
Since regions in REG have bounding boxes with positive height, infy(y) < supy(y) and infy(z) < supy(z).
supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z) implies supy(x) < infy(z).
So, supy(x) <= infy(z) must hold (strictly speaking supy(x) < infy(z)).

Let's also deduce other y-coordinate relations between x and z:
infy(x) < supy(x) (property of bbox)
supy(x) < infy(z) (derived above)
infy(z) < supy(z) (property of bbox)

From infy(x) < supy(x) < infy(z), we get infy(x) < infy(z).
From supy(x) < infy(z) < supy(z), we get supy(x) < supy(z).
From infy(x) < supy(x) < supy(z), we get infy(x) < supy(z).

So, the necessary y-coordinate relationships between x and z are:
infy(x) < infy(z)
supy(x) <= infy(z) (specifically, supy(x) < infy(z))
supy(x) < supy(z)
infy(x) < supy(z)

Now let's check which cardinal direction relations between x and z are possible given these y-constraints and the unconstrained x-relationships derived from supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y).

-   x W z: requires infy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < infy(z). W is not possible.
-   x NW z: requires supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) < supy(z). NW is not possible.
-   x N z: requires supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) < supy(z). N is not possible.
-   x NE z: requires supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) < supy(z). NE is not possible.
-   x E z: requires infy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < infy(z). E is not possible.
-   x B z: requires infy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < infy(z). B is not possible.

The only remaining possible relations are S, SW, and SE, as they only require supy(x) <= infy(z) or supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we know are true), and conditions on x-coordinates that are not directly contradicted by the premises.

Let's examine the x-coordinate conditions for S, SW, and SE:
-   S(x, z): infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
-   SW(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z)
-   SE(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x)

Can we construct examples of regions x, y, z from REG satisfying x SW y and y SE z, which result in x R z for R in {S, SW, SE}?

1.  **Possibility: S(x, z)**
    We need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The last condition is always true.
    We need to find x, y, z such that supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y), supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z), AND infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Let BB(y) = [2, 3] x [-3, -2]. infx(y)=2, supx(y)=3, infy(y)=-3, supy(y)=-2.
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 2, supy(x) <= -3. Let BB(x) = [0, 1] x [-5, -4]. supx(x)=1 <= 2 (T), supy(x)=-4 <= -3 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 2, supy(y)=-2 <= infy(z). Let BB(z) = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]. supx(z)=1 <= 2 (T), supy(y)=-2 <= infy(z)=-1 (T).
    Check S(x, z) for BB(x)=[0,1]x[-5,-4] and BB(z)=[-1,1]x[-1,1]:
    supy(x) <= infy(z) => -4 <= -1 (T)
    infx(z) <= infx(x) => -1 <= 0 (T)
    supx(x) <= supx(z) => 1 <= 1 (T)
    All conditions for S(x, z) are met. S is a possible relation.

2.  **Possibility: SW(x, z)**
    We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition is always true.
    We need to find x, y, z such that supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y), supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z), AND supx(x) <= infx(z).
    Let BB(y) = [12, 13] x [8, 9]. infx(y)=12, supx(y)=13, infy(y)=8, supy(y)=9.
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 12, supy(x) <= 8. Let BB(x) = [0, 1] x [0, 1]. supx(x)=1 <= 12 (T), supy(x)=1 <= 8 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 12, supy(y)=9 <= infy(z). Let BB(z) = [10, 11] x [10, 11]. supx(z)=11 <= 12 (T), supy(y)=9 <= infy(z)=10 (T).
    Check SW(x, z) for BB(x)=[0,1]x[0,1] and BB(z)=[10,11]x[10,11]:
    supx(x) <= infx(z) => 1 <= 10 (T)
    supy(x) <= infy(z) => 1 <= 10 (T)
    All conditions for SW(x, z) are met. SW is a possible relation.

3.  **Possibility: SE(x, z)**
    We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition is always true.
    We need to find x, y, z such that supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y), supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z), AND supx(z) <= infx(x).
    Let BB(y) = [0, 1] x [0, 1]. infx(y)=0, supx(y)=1, infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 0, supy(x) <= 0. Let BB(x) = [-3, -1] x [-3, -1]. supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(x)=-1 <= 0 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 0, supy(y)=1 <= infy(z). Let BB(z) = [-2, -0.5] x [2, 3]. supx(z)=-0.5 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=2 (T).
    Check SE(x, z) for BB(x)=[-3,-1]x[-3,-1] and BB(z)=[-2,-0.5]x[2,3]:
    supx(z) <= infx(x) => -0.5 <= -3 (F). Example failed. Let's try again.

    Let BB(y) = [0, 1] x [0, 1].
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 0, supy(x) <= 0. Let BB(x) = [-2, -1] x [-2, -1]. supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(x)=-1 <= 0 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 0, supy(y)=1 <= infy(z). Let BB(z) = [-4, -3] x [2, 3]. supx(z)=-3 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=2 (T).
    Check SE(x, z) for BB(x)=[-2,-1]x[-2,-1] and BB(z)=[-4,-3]x[2,3]:
    supx(z) <= infx(x) => -3 <= -2 (T)
    supy(x) <= infy(z) => -1 <= 2 (T)
    All conditions for SE(x, z) are met. SE is a possible relation.

We have shown that S, SW, and SE are all possible relations between region x and region z given the premises. We have also shown that all other relations (W, NW, N, NE, E, B) are impossible due to necessary consequences for the y-coordinates.

The possible relations between region x and region z are S, SW, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW, SE}$.
