PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of the projection of a region r on the x and y axes, respectively. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are 2D regions with non-empty interior and a connected boundary, and thus their bounding boxes have positive width and height. That is, for any region r in REG, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

We are given two relations:
1) Region x is B of region y (x B y):
   infx(y) <= infx(x)
   supx(x) <= supx(y)
   infy(y) <= infy(x)
   supy(x) <= supy(y)

2) Region y is W of region z (y W z):
   supx(y) <= infx(z)
   infy(z) <= infy(y)
   supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z (x R z). Let's combine the inequalities derived from the given relations.

From `supx(x) <= supx(y)` (from x B y) and `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (from y W z), we get:
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
Thus, **supx(x) <= infx(z)**.

From `infy(y) <= infy(x)` (from x B y) and `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (from y W z), we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
Thus, **infy(z) <= infy(x)**.

From `supy(x) <= supy(y)` (from x B y) and `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (from y W z), we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
Thus, **supy(x) <= supy(z)**.

So, we have derived three inequalities that must hold for regions x and z:
(A) supx(x) <= infx(z)
(B) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(C) supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible relations for x R z and see which are consistent with these derived inequalities and the property that regions in REG have positive width and height bounding boxes (inf < sup).

- **W (x W z):** supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  These are exactly the inequalities (A), (B), and (C). Since (A), (B), and (C) are always true given the premises, the W relation is always possible.

- **B (x B z):** infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  From x B y and y W z, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
  Since regions have positive width, infx(y) < supx(y).
  So, infx(x) >= infx(y) and infx(z) >= supx(y) > infx(y).
  Also, from infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) (using inf < sup property), we get infx(x) < infx(z).
  The condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for B contradicts infx(x) < infx(z). Thus, B is not possible.

- **E (x E z):** supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  From the chain infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) < supx(z), we get infx(x) < supx(z).
  The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for E contradicts infx(x) < supx(z). Thus, E is not possible. Similarly, NE and SE are not possible as they also require supx(z) <= infx(x).

- **N (x N z):** supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  From the chain infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), we get infy(x) < supy(z).
  The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for N contradicts infy(x) < supy(z). Thus, N is not possible. Similarly, NW and NE are not possible as they also require supy(z) <= infy(x).

- **S (x S z):** supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  From the chain infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x), we get infy(z) < supy(x).
  The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for S contradicts infy(z) < supy(x). Thus, S is not possible. Similarly, SW and SE are not possible as they also require supy(x) <= infy(z).

Based on the bounding box definitions and the properties of regions in REG (positive width and height), the only possible relation between x and z is W.

The final answer is $\boxed{W}$.
