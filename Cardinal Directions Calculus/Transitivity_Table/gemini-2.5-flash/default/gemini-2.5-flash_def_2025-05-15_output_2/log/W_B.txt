PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given premises are:
1. Region x is W of region y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. Region y is B of region z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z)

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, implying that for any region 'a', infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's derive the implications for the bounds of x and z.

Vertical relations between x and z:
From infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2), we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) => infy(z) <= infy(x)

From supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 1) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 2), we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) => supy(x) <= supy(z)

These two inequalities, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), describe the possible vertical relationship between x and z. Let Ix = [infy(x), supy(x)] and Iz = [infy(z), supy(z)] be the vertical projections.
infy(z) <= infy(x) means the lower bound of z's vertical projection is less than or equal to the lower bound of x's vertical projection.
supy(x) <= supy(z) means the upper bound of x's vertical projection is less than or equal to the upper bound of z's vertical projection.

Consider the standard cardinal relations based on vertical positions:
- S, SW, SE require supy(a) <= infy(b). Here, for x S z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z). However, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= supy(y). If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y). Combined with infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1), we would need supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x). Since x is a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(x) is impossible. Therefore, S, SW, SE are not possible relations between x and z.
- N, NW, NE require infy(a) >= supy(b). Here, for x N z, we would need infy(x) >= supy(z). However, we have supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 1) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 2), so supy(x) <= supy(z). If infy(x) >= supy(z), then infy(x) >= supy(z) >= supy(y). Combined with supy(x) <= supy(y), we would need infy(x) >= supy(y) >= supy(x). This implies infy(x) >= supy(x). Since x is a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x). Thus, infy(x) >= supy(x) is impossible. Therefore, N, NW, NE are not possible relations between x and z.

Based on the vertical constraints alone, only relations that imply vertical overlap or bounding are possible: B, W, E. These relations require infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b), which are exactly the derived conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now let's examine the horizontal relations between x and z based on the initial premises:
(A) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(B) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(C) supx(y) <= supx(z)

Consider the remaining possible relations between x and z: B, W, E.

- Case 1: x B z
  Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  - supx(x) <= supx(z): From (A) supx(x) <= infx(y). Since y is a region, infx(y) < supx(y). From (C) supx(y) <= supx(z). Combining these, supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z). This sequence implies supx(x) < supx(z). So supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
  - infx(z) <= infx(x): From (B) infx(z) <= infx(y). From (A) supx(x) <= infx(y). We also know infx(x) < supx(x). Can we construct a case where infx(z) <= infx(x)?
    Let infx(y) = 10. Then infx(z) <= 10 and supx(x) <= 10. Let infx(z) = 5, and let x be [6, 8]. Then infx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=6. This is possible. We need to ensure this is compatible with other conditions.
    x = [6, 8] (infx(x)=6, supx(x)=8). y = [10, 12] (infx(y)=10, supx(y)=12). z = [5, 14] (infx(z)=5, supx(z)=14).
    x W y? supx(x)=8 <= infx(y)=10 (True). Vertical must hold.
    y B z? infx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=10 (True). supx(y)=12 <= supx(z)=14 (True). Vertical must hold.
    x B z? infx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=6 (True). supx(x)=8 <= supx(z)=14 (True). Vertical must hold.
    Since we found a consistent example, x B z is a possible relation.

- Case 2: x W z
  Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z).
  From (A) supx(x) <= infx(y). From (B) infx(z) <= infx(y). Can we have supx(x) <= infx(z)?
  Let infx(y) = 10. supx(x) <= 10, infx(z) <= 10. We need supx(x) <= infx(z).
  Let supx(x) = 8, infx(z) = 9. Then supx(x) <= infx(z) (8 <= 9). This is possible if 8 <= infx(y) and 9 <= infx(y). Let infx(y) = 10.
  x = [infx(x), 8], y = [10, supx(y)], z = [9, supx(z)].
  Conditions: supx(x)=8 <= infx(y)=10 (True). infx(z)=9 <= infx(y)=10 (True).
  supx(y) <= supx(z) (from C). Let supx(y)=12, supx(z)=15. 12 <= 15 (True).
  Vertical conditions must hold (always true).
  So, x W z is possible.

- Case 3: x E z
  Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x).
  We know infx(x) < supx(x) (for a region). So we need supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x).
  We know supx(y) <= supx(z) (from C). So supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
  We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from A). So infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y).
  Combining, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y).
  This implies supx(y) < infx(y). This is impossible for a region in REG, as infx(y) < supx(y).
  Therefore, x E z is not possible.

The only possible relations are B and W.

The final answer is $\boxed{B, W}$.
