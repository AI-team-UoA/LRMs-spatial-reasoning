PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by combining the constraints from `x NE y` and `y W z`.

From `x NE y`:
1. `supx(y) <= infx(x)` (x is to the East of y's right edge)
2. `supy(y) <= infy(x)` (x is to the North of y's top edge)

From `y W z`:
3. `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (y is to the West of z's left edge, equivalently z is to the East of y's right edge)
4. `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (z's bottom edge is below or at y's bottom edge)
5. `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (y's top edge is below or at z's top edge)

Combining these inequalities:
- For the x-axis: We have `infx(x) >= supx(y)` and `infx(z) >= supx(y)`. This means both `x` and `z` start at or after the right edge of `y`'s bounding box. Their relative horizontal positions (`x` vs `z`) are not fixed; `x` could be to the West of `z`, to the East of `z`, or overlap with `z`.

- For the y-axis: We have `supy(y) <= infy(x)` (from 2) and `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (from 4). Since `infy(y) <= supy(y)` for any non-degenerate region `y`, we can chain these: `infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`. This gives us the strict inequality `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, meaning the bottom edge of `z`'s bounding box is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of `x`'s bounding box.

This constraint `infy(z) <= infy(x)` rules out any relation where `x` is strictly South of `z`, because that would require `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, which is impossible if `infy(x) >= infy(z)` unless both are point regions at the same y-level (which is a trivial and non-representative case for regions). Thus, relations S, SW, and SE are not possible.

The possible relations between `x` and `z` must therefore involve `x` being North of `z` or overlapping with `z` vertically. The remaining possible relations are N, NE, NW, E, W, and B. We need to check if each of these is possible by constructing example regions that satisfy the initial conditions (`x NE y` and `y W z`) and the specific relation between `x` and `z`.

By constructing various examples of bounding boxes for `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy the given conditions, it can be shown that all the remaining six relations are possible:

1.  **N:** x is North of z, with x's x-projection contained within z's x-projection. (Possible)
2.  **NE:** x is North-East of z (bounding boxes do not overlap). (Possible)
3.  **E:** x is East of z, with x's y-projection contained within z's y-projection. (Possible)
4.  **W:** x is West of z, with x's y-projection contained within z's y-projection. (Possible)
5.  **NW:** x is North-West of z (bounding boxes do not overlap). (Possible)
6.  **B:** x's bounding box is contained within z's bounding box. (Possible)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, NW, E, W, and B.

N, NE, E, NW, W, B
