PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The problem asks for the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z. The regions are in the set REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies their minimum bounding boxes have non-zero width and height.

Let the minimum bounding box of a region `a` be defined by the intervals [infx(a), supx(a)] and [infy(a), supy(a)]. For regions in REG, we have infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

The given relations are:
1.  x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2.  y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's derive the constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x relative to z by combining these inequalities and using the property that inf < sup for any region in REG.

From x NW y and y W z (in the x-direction):
infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z) < supx(z)
Combining these inequalities, we get:
infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) <= infx(z)
infx(x) < infx(y) <= infx(z)
infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z)

From infx(x) < supx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(y), we have infx(x) < infx(y) unless supx(x) = infx(y) and infx(x) = supx(x), which is impossible. So infx(x) < infx(y).
From infx(y) < supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we have infx(y) < infx(z) unless supx(y) = infx(z) and infx(y) = supx(y), which is impossible. So infx(y) < infx(z).

Therefore, infx(x) < infx(y) < infx(z).
Also, supx(x) <= infx(y) < infx(z), so supx(x) < infx(z).

The necessary constraints on the x-coordinates of x relative to z are:
- infx(x) < infx(z)
- supx(x) < infx(z) (unless supx(x) = infx(y) and infx(y) = supx(y) and supx(y) = infx(z), which is impossible)

Wait, let's be careful about strict vs non-strict inequalities.
infx(x) < supx(x)
supx(x) <= infx(y)
infx(y) < supx(y)
supx(y) <= infx(z)
infx(z) < supx(z)

Chain 1: infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) <= infx(z). This gives infx(x) <= infx(z). If infx(x) = infx(z), then infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(y) = supx(y) = infx(z), which is impossible (zero width for x and y, and zero difference between y and z). Thus, infx(x) < infx(z) must hold.

Chain 2: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This gives supx(x) <= infx(z). Equality is possible if supx(x) = infx(y) and supx(y) = infx(z). This means x's right edge touches y's left edge, and y's right edge touches z's left edge.

So, the necessary constraints on the x-coordinates are:
- infx(x) < infx(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

Now let's derive the constraints on the y-coordinates:
infy(x) < supy(x)
supy(y) <= infy(x)
infy(y) < supy(y)
infy(z) <= infy(y)
supy(y) <= supy(z)
infy(z) < supy(z)

Chain 1: infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x).
This implies infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(z) < supy(x).
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). If infy(z) = infy(x), then infy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y) = infy(x), which means y has zero height and infy(y) = supy(y) is equal to infy(x) and infy(z). This is possible if y is a horizontal line segment, but regions are 2D. So infy(y) < supy(y) must hold.
This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x). So infy(z) < infy(x) or infy(z) = infy(y) and infy(y) < supy(y) = infy(x).
Let's stick to non-strict for now, but remember the non-degenerate property.
From the chain infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), we get infy(z) <= infy(x).

Chain 2: supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). No direct relation between infy(x) and supy(z) is forced.

Necessary conditions:
1. infx(x) < infx(z)
2. supx(x) <= infx(z)
3. infy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's check which relations between x and z are compatible with these conditions:
- S (South): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), contradicts infx(x) < infx(z). Impossible.
- SW (South West): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). From infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) < supy(x), we have infy(z) < supy(x). So supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible.
- W (West): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Compatible with conditions 2 and 3. We need to check if supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible. We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). It is possible to construct regions where supy(x) <= supy(z) holds (e.g., x is short, z is tall). (Example was shown in thought process). W is possible.
- NW (North West): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). Compatible with condition 2. Need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible. We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). It is possible to construct regions where supy(z) <= infy(x) holds (e.g., y and z are low, x is high). (Example was shown in thought process). NW is possible.
- N (North): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), contradicts infx(x) < infx(z). Impossible.
- NE (North East): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). From infx(x) < infx(z) <= supx(z), this is impossible.
- E (East): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Impossible.
- SE (South East): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Impossible.
- B (Bounding Box): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), contradicts infx(x) < infx(z). Impossible.

Based on the bounding box definitions and the non-degenerate property of regions in REG, the only possible relations between x and z are W and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, NW}$.
