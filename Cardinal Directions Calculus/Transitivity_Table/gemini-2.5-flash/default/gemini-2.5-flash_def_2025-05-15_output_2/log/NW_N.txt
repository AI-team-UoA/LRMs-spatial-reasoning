PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The problem defines cardinal direction relations based on the bounding boxes of regions that are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (regions in REG). We are given that region x is NW of region y, and region y is N of region z. We need to find the possible single-tile cardinal relations between region x and region z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)] denote the minimum bounding box of a region a.
Since regions are in REG, they have non-zero width and height, meaning infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a.

The given relations are:
1.  x NW y:
    supx(x) <= infx(y)  (x is to the West of y's left edge or aligned with it)
    supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is to the North of y's top edge or aligned with it)

2.  y N z:
    supy(z) <= infy(y)  (y is to the North of z's top edge or aligned with it)
    infx(z) <= infx(y)  (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection or aligned with edges)
    supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection or aligned with edges)

We want to find the possible relation(s) between x and z, i.e., x R z. This requires comparing the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

Comparing y-coordinates:
From (1) and (2), we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y).
Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) is always true. This means the top edge of z's bounding box is below or aligned with the bottom edge of x's bounding box. This implies that x must be vertically North of, or vertically aligned with the top edge of, z.
Let's check which relations satisfy supy(z) <= infy(x) for 'a R b' where a=x and b=z:
-   N: supy(b) <= infy(a) (Yes)
-   NE: supy(b) <= infy(a) (Yes)
-   NW: supy(b) <= infy(a) (Yes)
-   S: supy(a) <= infy(b) (Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Since supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), this implies supy(z) < supy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z), so supy(z) < infy(z), which is impossible for regions in REG). S is impossible.
-   SW: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible for the same reason as S. SW is impossible.
-   SE: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible for the same reason as S. SE is impossible.
-   E: Requires infy(b) <= infy(a) AND supy(a) <= supy(b) (infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)). We know supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). If supy(x) <= supy(z), this contradicts supy(z) < supy(x). E is impossible.
-   W: Requires infy(b) <= infy(a) AND supy(a) <= supy(b) (infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)). Impossible for the same reason as E. W is impossible.
-   B: Requires infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b) (infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)). Requires supy(x) <= supy(z), which is impossible. B is impossible.

So, the only possible single-tile relations are N, NE, and NW. All three satisfy the vertical condition supy(z) <= infy(x). We now examine the horizontal conditions.

Horizontal conditions:
-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
-   x N z: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z)
-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x)

Let's analyze the horizontal constraints from the given relations:
From x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
From y N z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
Also, for regions in REG, infx(y) < supx(y).

Combining supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) < supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true (specifically supx(x) < supx(z) unless all x, y, z have zero width, which is not allowed for REG).

Now let's check the possibility of each remaining relation (N, NW, NE):

-   Can x be NW of z? This requires supx(x) <= infx(z).
    We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
    It is possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). Consider the x-projections:
    x: [-3, -2], y: [-1, 0], z: [-1.5, 2].
    supx(x)=-2, infx(y)=-1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (-2 <= -1, Yes).
    infx(z)=-1.5, infx(y)=-1. infx(z) <= infx(y) (-1.5 <= -1, Yes).
    supx(y)=0, supx(z)=2. supx(y) <= supx(z) (0 <= 2, Yes).
    Now check x NW z: supx(x)=-2, infx(z)=-1.5. supx(x) <= infx(z) (-2 <= -1.5, Yes).
    So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

-   Can x be N of z? This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We already showed supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
    It is possible for infx(z) <= infx(x). Consider the x-projections:
    x: [-2, -1], y: [0, 1], z: [-3, 2].
    supx(x)=-1, infx(y)=0. supx(x) <= infx(y) (-1 <= 0, Yes).
    infx(z)=-3, infx(y)=0. infx(z) <= infx(y) (-3 <= 0, Yes).
    supx(y)=1, supx(z)=2. supx(y) <= supx(z) (1 <= 2, Yes).
    Now check x N z horizontal: infx(z)=-3, infx(x)=-2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (-3 <= -2, Yes). supx(x)=-1, supx(z)=2. supx(x) <= supx(z) (-1 <= 2, Yes).
    So, N is a possible relation between x and z.

-   Can x be NE of z? This requires supx(z) <= infx(x).
    We derived that infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
    This chain of inequalities implies infx(x) < supx(z).
    The condition for NE (supx(z) <= infx(x)) is incompatible with infx(x) < supx(z) for regions with positive width.
    So, NE is impossible.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box definitions and the transitivity of the given relations, the only possible single-tile cardinal relations between region x and region z from the allowed set are N and NW. While other relative positions (like overlaps) might occur based on the bounding boxes, the question asks for possible relations *from the given set* of single-tile relations.

The possible relations are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
