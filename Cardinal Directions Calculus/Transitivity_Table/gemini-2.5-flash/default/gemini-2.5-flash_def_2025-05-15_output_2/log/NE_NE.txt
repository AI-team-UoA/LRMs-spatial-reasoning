PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of region a.
The definitions of the single-tile cardinal direction relations based on bounding boxes are given.
We are given that region x is NE of region y, and region y is NE of region z.
Applying the definition of NE:
1) x NE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(y) <= infy(x)`
2) y NE z: `supx(z) <= infx(y)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z, i.e., the possible relations R such that x R z. We need to check if the conditions for each relation R can be satisfied by regions x, y, z in REG satisfying the given NE relations.

Let's analyze the horizontal and vertical relationships implied by the given NE relations.

Horizontal relationship between x and z:
From (1), `supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
From (2), `supx(z) <= infx(y)`.
Since regions in REG have non-zero horizontal extent, we know `infx(y) <= supx(y)`.
Combining the inequalities: `supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
This implies `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
This condition corresponds to x being to the East of z, or their bounding boxes touching along the eastern edge of z. This condition is part of the definitions for relations E, NE, and SE.

Can x be to the West of z, i.e., `supx(x) <= infx(z)`?
From the inequalities: `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
This implies `supx(x) <= infx(x)`. Since regions in REG have non-zero horizontal extent (`infx(a) < supx(a)`), this is impossible.
Thus, relations W, NW, and SW are not possible between x and z.

Can x and z be horizontally contained within each other, or overlap in other ways? Relations B, N, S require horizontal containment conditions like `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
The condition `supx(x) <= supx(z)` implies `supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`, which again leads to `supx(x) <= infx(x)`, impossible for regions in REG.
Thus, relations B, N, and S are not possible between x and z (due to the horizontal constraints).

So, horizontally, the only possibility is that x is to the East of z (or touching), captured by `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. This limits the possible relations to E, NE, SE.

Vertical relationship between x and z:
From (1), `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
From (2), `supy(z) <= infy(y)`.
Since regions in REG have non-zero vertical extent, we know `infy(y) <= supy(y)`.
Combining the inequalities: `supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
This implies `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
This condition corresponds to x being to the North of z, or their bounding boxes touching along the northern edge of z. This condition is part of the definitions for relations N, NE, and NW.

Can x be to the South of z, i.e., `supy(x) <= infy(z)`?
From the inequalities: `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
This implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`. Since regions in REG have non-zero vertical extent (`infy(a) < supy(a)`), this is impossible.
Thus, relations S, SE, and SW are not possible between x and z.

Can x and z be vertically contained within each other, or overlap in other ways? Relations B, E, W require vertical containment conditions like `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
The condition `supy(x) <= supy(z)` implies `supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`, which again leads to `supy(x) <= infy(x)`, impossible for regions in REG.
Thus, relations B, E, and W are not possible between x and z (due to the vertical constraints).

So, vertically, the only possibility is that x is to the North of z (or touching), captured by `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This limits the possible relations to N, NE, NW.

Now we combine the possible horizontal and vertical relations for x R z:
Possible horizontal relations: E, NE, SE (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`)
Possible vertical relations: N, NE, NW (`supy(z) <= infy(x)`)

The relation x R z must satisfy both the horizontal and vertical conditions from its definition. We check the definitions:
- `x NE z`: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Both of these conditions must hold, as derived above. So NE is a possible relation. In fact, it is a necessary relation.
- `x E z`: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (holds), `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. We showed `supy(x) <= supy(z)` is impossible. So E is not possible.
- `x SE z`: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (holds) and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. We showed `supy(x) <= infy(z)` is impossible. So SE is not possible.
- `x N z`: Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (holds), `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. We showed `supx(x) <= supx(z)` is impossible. So N is not possible.
- `x NW z`: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (holds). We showed `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is impossible. So NW is not possible.
- `x W z`: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (impossible), `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (impossible). So W is not possible.
- `x SW z`: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (impossible) and `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (impossible). So SW is not possible.
- `x S z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (impossible), `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (impossible). So S is not possible.
- `x B z`: Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (impossible), `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (impossible). So B is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the constraints implied by regions being in REG (having non-zero extent), the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
