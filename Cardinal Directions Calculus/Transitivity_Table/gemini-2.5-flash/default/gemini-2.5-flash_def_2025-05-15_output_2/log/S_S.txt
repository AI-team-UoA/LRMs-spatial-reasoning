PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region 'a' be defined by the intervals [infx(a), supx(a)] and [infy(a), supy(a)].
The given relation x S y is defined by the following conditions:
1) supy(x) <= infy(y)
2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

The given relation y S z is defined by the following conditions:
4) supy(y) <= infy(z)
5) infx(z) <= infx(y)
6) supx(y) <= supx(z)

We are looking for the possible relation(s) x R z, defined by comparing the bounding boxes of x and z.

From conditions 2 and 5, we can combine the inequalities for the x-infimum:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, we get:
7) infx(z) <= infx(x)

From conditions 3 and 6, we can combine the inequalities for the x-supremum:
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
So, we get:
8) supx(x) <= supx(z)

From conditions 1 and 4, we can combine the inequalities for the y-supremum of the lower region and the y-infimum of the upper region:
supy(x) <= infy(y)
supy(y) <= infy(z)

For any region 'a' in REG (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk), the interior is non-empty, which implies infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).
Using this property, we have infy(y) < supy(y).
Combining the y-inequalities:
supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z)
So, we get:
9) supy(x) <= infy(z)

The relations between the bounding boxes of x and z derived from x S y and y S z are:
i) infx(z) <= infx(x)
ii) supx(x) <= supx(z)
iii) supy(x) <= infy(z)

Now, let's check which of the possible single-tile cardinal relations a R b (where a is x and b is z) match these derived conditions:

- a B b: infx(b)<=infx(a), supx(a)<=supx(b), infy(b)<=infy(a), supy(a)<=supy(b)
  For x B z: infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
  Conditions i and ii match. Condition iii is supy(x)<=infy(z). For B, we need infy(z)<=infy(x). From condition iii and infy(x) < supy(x) (property of REG regions), we have infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z). This implies infy(x) < infy(z). Thus, infy(z)<=infy(x) is not possible for regions in REG. B is not possible.

- a S b: supy(a)<=infy(b), infx(b)<=infx(a), supx(a)<=supx(b)
  For x S z: supy(x)<=infy(z), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z).
  These three conditions match exactly with our derived conditions i, ii, and iii. S is possible.

- a N b: supy(b)<=infy(a), infx(b)<=infx(a), supx(a)<=supx(b)
  For x N z: supy(z)<=infy(x), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z).
  Conditions i and ii match. For N, we need supy(z)<=infy(x). From condition iii and infy(z) < supy(z) and infy(x) < supy(x), we have infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z). This implies infy(x) < supy(z). Thus, supy(z)<=infy(x) is not possible. N is not possible.

- a W b: supx(a)<=infx(b), infy(b)<=infy(a), supy(a)<=supy(b)
  For x W z: supx(x)<=infx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
  Condition iii is supy(x)<=infy(z), which implies supy(x)<=supy(z). Condition infy(z)<=infy(x) is not possible as shown for B. The condition supx(x)<=infx(z) contradicts infx(z)<=infx(x) (from i) for regions with extent (infx < supx), as it would imply supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(x) <= infx(x). W is not possible.

- a E b: supx(b)<=infx(a), infy(b)<=infy(a), supy(a)<=supy(b)
  For x E z: supx(z)<=infx(x), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
  Condition supx(z)<=infx(x) contradicts supx(x)<=supx(z) (from ii) and infx(x) < supx(x) for regions with extent, as it would imply supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z), which means supx(z) < supx(z). E is not possible.

- a SW b: supx(a)<=infx(b), supy(a)<=infy(b)
  For x SW z: supx(x)<=infx(z), supy(x)<=infy(z).
  Condition supx(x)<=infx(z) is not possible as shown for W. SW is not possible.

- a NW b: supx(a)<=infx(b), supy(b)<=infy(a)
  For x NW z: supx(x)<=infx(z), supy(z)<=infy(x).
  Both conditions are not possible as shown for W and N. NW is not possible.

- a SE b: supx(b)<=infx(a), supy(a)<=infy(b)
  For x SE z: supx(z)<=infx(x), supy(x)<=infy(z).
  Condition supx(z)<=infx(x) is not possible as shown for E. SE is not possible.

- a NE b: supx(b)<=infx(a), supy(b)<=infy(a)
  For x NE z: supx(z)<=infx(x), supy(z)<=infy(x).
  Both conditions are not possible as shown for E and N. NE is not possible.

Based on the definitions provided and the properties of regions in REG, the only possible relation between region x and region z, given that region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, is S.
