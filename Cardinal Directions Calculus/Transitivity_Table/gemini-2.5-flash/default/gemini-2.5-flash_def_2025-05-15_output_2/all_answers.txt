For r1: N, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: W, NW
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be represented by the interval [infx(a), supx(a)] on the x-axis and [infy(a), supy(a)] on the y-axis. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies they have a non-zero area. Consequently, their bounding boxes must have non-zero width and height, meaning infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

The given premises are:
1.  x is N of y (x N y):
    - supy(y) <= infy(x)
    - infx(y) <= infx(x)
    - supx(x) <= supx(y)
2.  y is E of z (y E z):
    - supx(z) <= infx(y)
    - infy(z) <= infy(y)
    - supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these inequalities, we can derive relationships between x and z:

Horizontal relationship:
From (4) supx(z) <= infx(y)
From (2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x).
Since regions have positive width (infx < supx), we have supx(z) > infx(z) and supx(x) > infx(x).
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) implies infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). So, infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(z) < supx(x). The bounding box of z is to the west of the bounding box of x, possibly tangential.

Vertical relationship:
From (5) infy(z) <= infy(y)
From (1) supy(y) <= infy(x)
Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
Since regions have positive height (infy < supy), we have infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). So, infy(z) < supy(x). The bottom boundary of x is above or aligned with the bottom boundary of z.

Now let's check which cardinal relations x R z are possible given supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x), and the positive width/height constraint (inf < sup).

The possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.

-   x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived supx(z) <= infx(x). Combined with supx(x) <= supx(z), this implies supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) < supx(x), this is a contradiction. N is not possible.

-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is consistent with the derivation.
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is consistent with the derivation (e.g., infy(z)=0, supy(z)=5, infy(y)=1, supy(y)=2, infy(x)=3. supy(y)<=infy(x) -> 2<=3. supy(y)<=supy(z) -> 2<=5. infy(z)<=infy(y) -> 0<=1. And supy(z)<=infy(x) -> 5<=3 is false. My prior NE example construction was supy(z)<=infy(x). Let me recheck that. infy(z)=0, supy(z)=10. infy(y)=8, supy(y)=9. infy(x)=10. supy(z)=10 <= infy(x)=10. This is possible. So NE is possible).

-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is consistent.
    infy(z) <= infy(x) is derived.
    supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible (as shown in a previous example construction). E is possible.

-   x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x). Thus, infy(z) < supy(x).
    The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) is a contradiction. SE is not possible.

-   x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible (same reason as SE). S is not possible.

-   x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We know infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x). Thus, infx(z) < supx(x).
    The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) is a contradiction. SW is not possible.

-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Impossible (supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts derivation). W is not possible.

-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible (supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts derivation). NW is not possible.

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are possible.
    infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible.
    supx(x) <= supx(z). But we derived supx(z) <= infx(x) and infx(x) < supx(x), so supx(z) < supx(x).
    The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is a contradiction. B is not possible.

Under the assumption that regions in REG have bounding boxes with positive width and height, the only possible relations are NE and E.

NE, E.
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: N, S, B
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: The given information is:
1) x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y).
2) y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z).

We want to find the possible relations between x and z based on the provided definitions.
Let's combine the inequalities:
From (1):
(I1) infy(x) >= supy(y)
(I2) infx(x) >= infx(y)
(I3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

From (2):
(I4) infx(z) >= supx(y)
(I5) infy(z) >= supy(y)

Let's analyze the x-axis relations between x and z.
From (I3) and (I4), we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).
So, supx(x) <= infx(z).

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies their minimum bounding boxes have non-zero width and height. Thus, for any region 'a' in REG, infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).
Since x is in REG, infx(x) < supx(x).
Since z is in REG, infx(z) < supx(z).

Combining supx(x) <= infx(z) with the non-degenerate property, we get infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) < supx(z).
This implies that the projection of region x on the x-axis, [infx(x), supx(x)], is entirely to the left of or touching the projection of region z on the x-axis, [infx(z), supx(z)].

Now let's examine the x-conditions for each cardinal direction relation:
- B: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). This requires [infx(x), supx(x)] to be contained within [infx(z), supx(z)].
- S: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). (Same x-condition as B)
- SW: supx(x) <= infx(z).
- W: supx(x) <= infx(z).
- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z).
- N: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). (Same x-condition as B)
- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x). This requires [infx(z), supx(z)] to be to the left of or touching [infx(x), supx(x)].
- E: supx(z) <= infx(x). (Same x-condition as NE)
- SE: supx(z) <= infx(x). (Same x-condition as NE)

We have derived that supx(x) <= infx(z) must hold.
If supx(x) <= infx(z), then it is impossible for supx(z) <= infx(x) to hold, because infx(x) < supx(x) and infx(z) < supx(z), so infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) < supx(z), which implies infx(x) < supx(z). This rules out relations E, NE, SE.

Now consider the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) (required for B, S, N). If both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z) must hold, then infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z). This inequality chain implies infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z). This contradicts the non-degenerate property infx(x) < supx(x) for regions in REG. Therefore, the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) is incompatible with supx(x) <= infx(z) for regions in REG. This rules out relations B, S, N.

The only relations whose x-conditions are compatible with supx(x) <= infx(z) are SW, W, and NW. We must now check if the y-conditions for each of these are possible.

Let's analyze the y-axis relations between x and z.
From (I1) and (I5):
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(z) >= supy(y)
This tells us that both the bottom of x and the bottom of z are above or touching the top of y. The relative vertical position of x and z is not fixed by these inequalities alone.

Consider the possible relations SW, W, NW:
- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (true) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
Is supy(x) <= infy(z) possible?
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[0,1]. supy(y)=1.
x N y: infx(x) >= 0, supx(x) <= 1, infy(x) >= 1. Let x = [0,1]x[1.1, 1.2]. supy(x)=1.2, infy(x)=1.1.
y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z). 1 <= infx(z), 1 <= infy(z). Let z = [2,3]x[1.3, 1.4]. infx(z)=2, infy(z)=1.3.
Check x SW z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True). supy(x)=1.2 <= infy(z)=1.3 (True).
SW is possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (true) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
Is infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z) possible? This condition means the y-interval of z contains the y-interval of x.
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[0,1]. supy(y)=1.
x N y: infx(x) >= 0, supx(x) <= 1, infy(x) >= 1. Let x = [0.2, 0.8]x[2, 3]. infy(x)=2, supy(x)=3.
y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z). 1 <= infx(z), 1 <= infy(z). Let z = [2,3]x[1.5, 3.5]. infx(z)=2, infy(z)=1.5, supy(z)=3.5.
Check x W z: supx(x)=0.8 <= infx(z)=2 (True). infy(z)=1.5 <= infy(x)=2 (True). supy(x)=3 <= supy(z)=3.5 (True).
W is possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (true) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
Is supy(z) <= infy(x) possible?
Example: Let y = [0,1]x[0,1]. supy(y)=1.
x N y: infx(x) >= 0, supx(x) <= 1, infy(x) >= 1. Let x = [0,1]x[3, 4]. infy(x)=3, supy(x)=4.
y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z). 1 <= infx(z), 1 <= infy(z). Let z = [2,3]x[1.5, 2.5]. infx(z)=2, infy(z)=1.5, supy(z)=2.5.
Check x NW z: supx(x)=1 <= infx(z)=2 (True). supy(z)=2.5 <= infy(x)=3 (True).
NW is possible.

Since relations B, S, N, E, NE, SE are impossible, and relations SW, W, NW are all possible, the possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW, W, NW}$.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: NE, E, SE
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: N, B
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Let the bounding box of a region $a$ be denoted by $[infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$. Regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies that for any region $a \in REG$, $infx(a) < supx(a)$ and $infy(a) < supy(a)$.

The given relations are:
1) $x$ W $y$:
   $supx(x) \le infx(y)$
   $infy(y) \le infy(x)$
   $supy(x) \le supy(y)$

2) $y$ N $z$:
   $supy(z) \le infy(y)$
   $infx(z) \le infx(y)$
   $supx(y) \le supx(z)$

We want to find the possible relations $R(x, z)$ based on the definitions of the single-tile cardinal directions:
B($a,b$): $infx(b) \le infx(a)$ & $supx(a) \le supx(b)$ & $infy(b) \le infy(a)$ & $supy(a) \le supy(b)$
S($a,b$): $supy(a) \le infy(b)$ & $infx(b) \le infx(a)$ & $supx(a) \le supx(b)$
SW($a,b$): $supx(a) \le infx(b)$ & $supy(a) \le infy(b)$
W($a,b$): $supx(a) \le infx(b)$ & $infy(b) \le infy(a)$ & $supy(a) \le supy(b)$
NW($a,b$): $supx(a) \le infx(b)$ & $supy(b) \le infy(a)$
N($a,b$): $supy(b) \le infy(a)$ & $infx(b) \le infx(a)$ & $supx(a) \le supx(b)$
NE($a,b$): $supx(b) \le infx(a)$ & $supy(b) \le infy(a)$
E($a,b$): $supx(b) \le infx(a)$ & $infy(b) \le infy(a)$ & $supy(a) \le supy(b)$
SE($a,b$): $supx(b) \le infx(a)$ & $supy(a) \le infy(b)$

Let's combine the inequalities from (1) and (2) to find relations between $x$ and $z$.

Vertical relations between $x$ and $z$:
From (1): $infy(y) \le infy(x)$
From (2): $supy(z) \le infy(y)$
Combining these: $supy(z) \le infy(y) \le infy(x)$.
So, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is always true. This means the top of the bounding box of $z$ is below or aligns with the bottom of the bounding box of $x$. In other words, $z$ is below or touches the bottom of $x$.

This eliminates relations where $x$ is below $z$, which require $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
Let's check if $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ is possible.
From (1): $supy(x) \le supy(y)$
From (2): $supy(z) \le infy(y)$
Also, for any region in REG, $infy(y) < supy(y)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$ and $infy(x) < supy(x)$.
We have $supy(x) \le supy(y)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(y)$.
So, $infy(z) < infy(y) \le supy(y) \ge supy(x)$. No direct constraint between $supy(x)$ and $infy(z)$.
Suppose $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
We also know $infy(z) \le supy(z)$ (since $z$ has positive height) and $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ (from $y$ N $z$).
So, $supy(x) \le infy(z) \le supy(z) \le infy(y)$.
From $x$ W $y$, $infy(y) \le infy(x)$.
So, $supy(x) \le infy(z) \le supy(z) \le infy(y) \le infy(x)$.
Since $x \in REG$, $infy(x) < supy(x)$.
So, $supy(x) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$. This is a contradiction.
Therefore, $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ is impossible.
This rules out the relations S, SW, SE for $R(x,z)$, as they require $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.

Horizontal relations between $x$ and $z$:
From (1): $supx(x) \le infx(y)$
From (2): $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$
Also, for any region in REG, $infx(x) < supx(x)$, $infx(y) < supx(y)$, $infx(z) < supx(z)$.

Can $x$ be entirely to the right of $z$? This requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$.
From the inequalities: $infx(x) < supx(x) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
So, $infx(x) < supx(z)$ is always true.
Thus, $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ is impossible.
This rules out the relations E and NE for $R(x,z)$, as they require $supx(z) \le infx(x)$.

The possible relations are now narrowed down to N, NW, W, B. Let's check each one.

NW($x,z$): $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ & $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
We know $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is always true.
Is $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ possible?
We have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(z) \le infx(y)$.
Consider Example 1 from thought process:
x: [-2, -1] x [1, 2]
y: [ 0,  1] x [1, 2]
z: [ 0,  1] x [-1, 0]
These regions are boxes with non-zero height/width, homeomorphic to disks.
x W y holds. y N z holds.
For R(x,z): $supx(x)=-1$, $infx(z)=0$. $-1 \le 0$. Yes, $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is possible.
$supy(z)=0$, $infy(x)=1$. $0 \le 1$. Yes, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is always true.
NW(x,z) is possible.

N($x,z$): $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ & $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ & $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
We know $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is always true.
We need $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (horizontal containment of x by z).
Consider Example 2 from thought process:
x: [-3, -2] x [0, 1]
y: [-0.5, 0.5] x [0, 1]
z: [-3, 1] x [-2, -1]
These regions are boxes with non-zero height/width.
x W y holds. y N z holds.
For R(x,z): $supy(z)=-1$, $infy(x)=0$. Yes.
$infx(z)=-3$, $infx(x)=-3$. $-3 \le -3$. Yes.
$supx(x)=-2$, $supx(z)=1$. $-2 \le 1$. Yes.
N(x,z) is possible.

W($x,z$): $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ & $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ & $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
We know $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is possible (from NW case).
We know $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ is always true.
We need $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
From (1): $supy(x) \le supy(y)$.
From (2): $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.
Also, $infy(y) < supy(y)$ and $infy(x) < supy(x)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$.
We need $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
$supy(x) \le supy(z) \le infy(y) \le supy(y)$.
Also, $infy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$.
So, $infy(y) < supy(x)$.
Combining with $supy(x) \le infy(y)$, we get $infy(y) < infy(y)$, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ is impossible for regions with positive height bounding boxes under these conditions.
This rules out W(x,z).

B($x,z$): $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ & $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ & $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ & $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
This requires horizontal containment ($infx(z) \le infx(x)$ & $supx(x) \le supx(z)$) AND vertical containment ($infy(z) \le infy(x)$ & $supy(x) \le supy(z)$).
We know horizontal containment is possible (from N case).
We know $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ is always true.
We need $supy(x) \le supy(z)$. As shown above, this is impossible for regions with positive height bounding boxes under these conditions.
This rules out B(x,z).

Based on the definitions provided and the assumption that regions homeomorphic to a disk have non-zero height and width bounding boxes, only N and NW are possible relations between x and z.

The possible relations are N, NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The relation x W y is defined as:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y)

The relation y W z is defined as:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these conditions, we can derive necessary conditions for the relation between x and z.
From (1) and (4): supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z). Since infx(y) <= supx(y) (for any non-empty region), we have supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This implies:
A) supx(x) <= infx(z)

From (2) and (5): infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This implies:
B) infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x)

From (3) and (6): supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This implies:
C) supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, if x W y and y W z, it is necessary that supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, let's check which single-tile cardinal direction relations R between x and z (x R z) are possible given these necessary conditions. A relation is possible if there exists at least one set of regions x, y, z in REG satisfying x W y and y W z, such that x R z holds. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which includes points as a limiting case (a disk collapsed to a point).

Let's test each possible relation R:

-   **W**: x W z means supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). These are exactly the necessary conditions A, B, and C we derived.
    Example: x=[0,1]x[0,1], y=[2,3]x[0,1], z=[4,5]x[0,1].
    x W y: 1<=2, 0<=0, 1<=1 (True).
    y W z: 3<=4, 0<=0, 1<=1 (True).
    x W z: 1<=4, 0<=0, 1<=1 (True).
    W is a possible relation.

-   **NW**: x NW z means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Condition A matches the first part. The second part, supy(z) <= infy(x), is not a necessary consequence of B (infy(z) <= infy(x)) and C (supy(x) <= supy(z)).
    From B and C, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x) also holds, then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x), which means x must be a horizontal line segment. For a region in REG, this means x must be a point.
    Let's see if we can construct an example where x is a point and NW holds.
    Let x = (0,1). Then infx(x)=0, supx(x)=0, infy(x)=1, supy(x)=1.
    Let z = [2,3]x[0,1]. Then infx(z)=2, supx(z)=3, infy(z)=0, supy(z)=1.
    x NW z: supx(x)<=infx(z) (0<=2, True), supy(z)<=infy(x) (1<=1, True). x NW z holds.
    Now we need to find y in REG such that x W y and y W z.
    x W y: supx(x)<=infx(y) (0<=infx(y)), infy(y)<=infy(x) (infy(y)<=1), supy(x)<=supy(y) (1<=supy(y)).
    y W z: supx(y)<=infx(z) (supx(y)<=2), infy(z)<=infy(y) (0<=infy(y)), supy(y)<=supy(z) (supy(y)<=1).
    Combining conditions for y: 0<=infx(y), supx(y)<=2, 0<=infy(y), infy(y)<=1, 1<=supy(y), supy(y)<=1.
    infy(y)<=1 and 1<=supy(y) and supy(y)<=1 implies infy(y)=supy(y)=1. So y must be a point on y=1.
    0<=infx(y) and supx(y)<=2. Let y=(1,1). infx(y)=1, supx(y)=1, infy(y)=1, supy(y)=1.
    Check x W y: 0<=1, 1<=1, 1<=1 (True).
    Check y W z: 1<=2, 0<=1, 1<=1 (True).
    Since x=(0,1), y=(1,1), and z=[2,3]x[0,1] are in REG and satisfy the W relations, and x NW z holds, NW is a possible relation.

-   **SW**: x SW z means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Condition A matches the first part. The second part, supy(x) <= infy(z), is not a necessary consequence of B (infy(z) <= infy(x)) and C (supy(x) <= supy(z)). Similar to NW, this requires x to be a point.
    Let x = (0,1). Let z = [2,3]x[1,2].
    x SW z: supx(x)<=infx(z) (0<=2, True), supy(x)<=infy(z) (1<=1, True). x SW z holds.
    Using y=(1,1) as before:
    x W y: x=(0,1), y=(1,1). 0<=1, 1<=1, 1<=1 (True).
    y W z: y=(1,1), z=[2,3]x[1,2]. 1<=2, 1<=1, 1<=2 (True).
    Since x=(0,1), y=(1,1), and z=[2,3]x[1,2] are in REG and satisfy the W relations, and x SW z holds, SW is a possible relation.

-   **N**: x N z means supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Condition A is supx(x) <= infx(z). If infx(z) <= infx(x) also holds, then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), implying supx(x) <= infx(x), so x must be a point. If x is a point, infx(x)=supx(x), so infx(z)=infx(x).
    Condition B is infy(z) <= infy(x). Condition C is supy(x) <= supy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x) also holds, then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x), so x must be a point. If x is a point, infy(x)=supy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This requires infy(z) <= infy(x) = supy(z).
    So N requires x to be a point, infx(z)=infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) = supy(z).
    Let x=(0,1). Let z=[0,2]x[0,1].
    x N z: supy(z)=1<=infy(x)=1 (True), infx(z)=0<=infx(x)=0 (True), supx(x)=0<=supx(z)=2 (True). x N z holds.
    Need y such that x W y and y W z.
    x=(0,1), z=[0,2]x[0,1].
    x W y: 0<=infx(y), infy(y)<=1, 1<=supy(y).
    y W z: supx(y)<=0, infy(z)=0<=infy(y), supy(y)<=supy(z)=1.
    This implies infx(y)=supx(y)=0, 0<=infy(y)<=1, 1<=supy(y)<=1.
    So y must be a vertical line segment at x=0 with y-projection [infy(y), 1], where 0<=infy(y)<=1. For y to be in REG (not a line segment), it must be a point. So infy(y)=supy(y)=1. y=(0,1).
    Let x=(0,1), y=(0,1), z=[0,2]x[0,1].
    x W y: x=y is a point. supx(x)<=infx(x) (0<=0, True), infy(x)<=infy(x) (True), supy(x)<=supy(x) (True). x W y holds.
    y W z: y=(0,1), z=[0,2]x[0,1]. supx(y)=0<=infx(z)=0 (True), infy(z)=0<=infy(y)=1 (True), supy(y)=1<=supy(z)=1 (True). y W z holds.
    Since x=(0,1), y=(0,1), z=[0,2]x[0,1] are in REG and satisfy the W relations, and x N z holds, N is a possible relation.

-   **S**: x S z means supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Similar logic to N, requires x to be a point, infx(z)=infx(x), supy(x)=infy(z), supy(x)<=supy(z).
    Let x=(0,1). Let z=[0,2]x[1,2].
    x S z: supy(x)=1<=infy(z)=1 (True), infx(z)=0<=infx(x)=0 (True), supx(x)=0<=supx(z)=2 (True). x S z holds.
    Using y=(0,1) as before:
    x W y: x=y point. Holds.
    y W z: y=(0,1), z=[0,2]x[1,2]. supx(y)=0<=infx(z)=0 (True), infy(z)=1<=infy(y)=1 (True), supy(y)=1<=supy(z)=2 (True). Holds.
    Since x=(0,1), y=(0,1), z=[0,2]x[1,2] are in REG and satisfy the W relations, and x S z holds, S is a possible relation.

-   **E**: x E z means supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(x) <= infy(z), supy(z) <= supy(x).
    From A (supx(x)<=infx(z)) and supx(z)<=infx(x), similar to N, this implies x is a point and infx(x)=infx(z)=supx(z). Thus z must also be a point at the same x-coordinate as x.
    From B (infy(z)<=infy(x)), C (supy(x)<=supy(z)), infy(x)<=infy(z), supy(z)<=supy(x), if x and z are points (x0, yx) and (x0, yz), this implies yx <= yz and yz <= yx and yz <= yx and yz <= yx. This requires yx=yz. So x=z.
    If x=z, then x W y and y W x. As shown before, this requires x=y and x is a point. So x=y=z must be a point.
    Let x=y=z=(0,1). x,y,z are in REG.
    x W y: x=y point. Holds.
    y W z: y=z point. Holds.
    x E z: x=z point. supx(x)<=infx(x) (0<=0, True), infy(x)<=infy(x) (True), supy(x)<=supy(x) (True). Holds.
    Since x=y=z=(0,1) satisfies the W relations and x E z holds, E is a possible relation.

-   **NE**: x NE z means supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). Similar logic to E, requires x and z to be points at the same x-coordinate. Let x=(x0, yx), z=(x0, yz). supy(z)<=infy(x) becomes yz<=yx. W relations give yz<=yx and yx<=yz, implying yx=yz. So x=z. Requires x=y=z point.
    Let x=y=z=(0,1). x NE z holds for a point. NE is a possible relation.

-   **SE**: x SE z means supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). Similar logic to E, requires x and z to be points at the same x-coordinate. Let x=(x0, yx), z=(x0, yz). supy(x)<=infy(z) becomes yx<=yz. W relations give yz<=yx and yx<=yz, implying yx=yz. So x=z. Requires x=y=z point.
    Let x=y=z=(0,1). x SE z holds for a point. SE is a possible relation.

-   **B**: x B z means infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
    From A (supx(x)<=infx(z)) and infx(z)<=infx(x), this implies x is a point and infx(x)=infx(z). supx(x)<=supx(z) becomes infx(x)<=supx(z), which is consistent with infx(z)<=supx(z).
    infy(z)<=infy(x) and supy(x)<=supy(z) are exactly conditions B and C from W composition.
    So B requires x to be a point and infx(z)=infx(x), and infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
    Let x=(0,1). Let z=[0,2]x[0,2]. infx(z)=0, supx(z)=2, infy(z)=0, supy(z)=2.
    x B z: infx(z)=0<=infx(x)=0 (True), supx(x)=0<=supx(z)=2 (True), infy(z)=0<=infy(x)=1 (True), supy(x)=1<=supy(z)=2 (True). x B z holds.
    Using y=(0,1) as before:
    x W y: x=y point. Holds.
    y W z: y=(0,1), z=[0,2]x[0,2]. supx(y)=0<=infx(z)=0 (True), infy(z)=0<=infy(y)=1 (True), supy(y)=1<=supy(z)=2 (True). Holds.
    Since x=(0,1), y=(0,1), z=[0,2]x[0,2] are in REG and satisfy the W relations, and x B z holds, B is a possible relation.

Since we have found examples in REG for all 9 relations (W, NW, SW, N, S, E, NE, SE, B) to hold between x and z when x W y and y W z, all of them are possible relations.

The possible relations between region x and region z are W, NW, SW, N, S, E, NE, SE, B.

N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}$.
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: W E B
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: S SW
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: S, SW, SE
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: N NE NW
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: The given premises are:
1. Region x is W of region y:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. Region y is B of region z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z)

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, implying that for any region 'a', infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Let's derive the implications for the bounds of x and z.

Vertical relations between x and z:
From infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2), we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) => infy(z) <= infy(x)

From supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 1) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 2), we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) => supy(x) <= supy(z)

These two inequalities, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), describe the possible vertical relationship between x and z. Let Ix = [infy(x), supy(x)] and Iz = [infy(z), supy(z)] be the vertical projections.
infy(z) <= infy(x) means the lower bound of z's vertical projection is less than or equal to the lower bound of x's vertical projection.
supy(x) <= supy(z) means the upper bound of x's vertical projection is less than or equal to the upper bound of z's vertical projection.

Consider the standard cardinal relations based on vertical positions:
- S, SW, SE require supy(a) <= infy(b). Here, for x S z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z). However, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= supy(y). If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y). Combined with infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1), we would need supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x). Since x is a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(x) is impossible. Therefore, S, SW, SE are not possible relations between x and z.
- N, NW, NE require infy(a) >= supy(b). Here, for x N z, we would need infy(x) >= supy(z). However, we have supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 1) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 2), so supy(x) <= supy(z). If infy(x) >= supy(z), then infy(x) >= supy(z) >= supy(y). Combined with supy(x) <= supy(y), we would need infy(x) >= supy(y) >= supy(x). This implies infy(x) >= supy(x). Since x is a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x). Thus, infy(x) >= supy(x) is impossible. Therefore, N, NW, NE are not possible relations between x and z.

Based on the vertical constraints alone, only relations that imply vertical overlap or bounding are possible: B, W, E. These relations require infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b), which are exactly the derived conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now let's examine the horizontal relations between x and z based on the initial premises:
(A) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(B) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(C) supx(y) <= supx(z)

Consider the remaining possible relations between x and z: B, W, E.

- Case 1: x B z
  Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  - supx(x) <= supx(z): From (A) supx(x) <= infx(y). Since y is a region, infx(y) < supx(y). From (C) supx(y) <= supx(z). Combining these, supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z). This sequence implies supx(x) < supx(z). So supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
  - infx(z) <= infx(x): From (B) infx(z) <= infx(y). From (A) supx(x) <= infx(y). We also know infx(x) < supx(x). Can we construct a case where infx(z) <= infx(x)?
    Let infx(y) = 10. Then infx(z) <= 10 and supx(x) <= 10. Let infx(z) = 5, and let x be [6, 8]. Then infx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=6. This is possible. We need to ensure this is compatible with other conditions.
    x = [6, 8] (infx(x)=6, supx(x)=8). y = [10, 12] (infx(y)=10, supx(y)=12). z = [5, 14] (infx(z)=5, supx(z)=14).
    x W y? supx(x)=8 <= infx(y)=10 (True). Vertical must hold.
    y B z? infx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=10 (True). supx(y)=12 <= supx(z)=14 (True). Vertical must hold.
    x B z? infx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=6 (True). supx(x)=8 <= supx(z)=14 (True). Vertical must hold.
    Since we found a consistent example, x B z is a possible relation.

- Case 2: x W z
  Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z).
  From (A) supx(x) <= infx(y). From (B) infx(z) <= infx(y). Can we have supx(x) <= infx(z)?
  Let infx(y) = 10. supx(x) <= 10, infx(z) <= 10. We need supx(x) <= infx(z).
  Let supx(x) = 8, infx(z) = 9. Then supx(x) <= infx(z) (8 <= 9). This is possible if 8 <= infx(y) and 9 <= infx(y). Let infx(y) = 10.
  x = [infx(x), 8], y = [10, supx(y)], z = [9, supx(z)].
  Conditions: supx(x)=8 <= infx(y)=10 (True). infx(z)=9 <= infx(y)=10 (True).
  supx(y) <= supx(z) (from C). Let supx(y)=12, supx(z)=15. 12 <= 15 (True).
  Vertical conditions must hold (always true).
  So, x W z is possible.

- Case 3: x E z
  Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x).
  We know infx(x) < supx(x) (for a region). So we need supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x).
  We know supx(y) <= supx(z) (from C). So supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x).
  We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from A). So infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y).
  Combining, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y).
  This implies supx(y) < infx(y). This is impossible for a region in REG, as infx(y) < supx(y).
  Therefore, x E z is not possible.

The only possible relations are B and W.

The final answer is $\boxed{B, W}$.
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: N, NE
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: E, W, B
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: S, SE
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: N, NW, NE
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: S SW SE
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The definitions of the given relations in terms of bounding box coordinates are:
x E y: infx(x) >= supx(y), infy(x) >= infy(y), supy(x) <= supy(y)
y SE z: infx(y) >= supx(z), infy(z) >= supy(y)

From these inequalities, let's derive constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

For x-coordinates:
We have infx(x) >= supx(y) and infx(y) >= supx(z).
Since y is a region in REG, its bounding box has positive width, so supx(y) > infx(y).
Combining these, we get: infx(x) >= supx(y) > infx(y) >= supx(z).
This chain implies infx(x) > supx(z).
Since x and z are regions in REG, infx(x) <= supx(x) and infx(z) <= supx(z).
The condition infx(x) > supx(z) means that the minimum x-coordinate of x is strictly greater than the maximum x-coordinate of z. This implies that the bounding box of z is entirely to the left of the bounding box of x, with a horizontal gap or touching only at boundaries represented by equality in the original definitions. Let's check the definitions again. The definition of E, NE, SE relations implies supx(b) <= infx(a) for a R b. The strict inequality derived `infx(x) > supx(z)` means `supx(z) < infx(x)`, which satisfies `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. The strict inequality further implies no horizontal overlap in their interior projections or projections that share more than a boundary.

For y-coordinates:
We have supy(x) <= supy(y) and infy(z) >= supy(y).
Combining these, we get: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
This chain implies supy(x) <= infy(z).
This condition means that the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of z. This implies that the bounding box of x is entirely below or touching the bottom edge of the bounding box of z.

So, for any regions x, y, z in REG satisfying the given relations, the bounding boxes of x and z must satisfy:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (and strictly supx(z) < infx(x) as shown above)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

Now let's check which of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with these two conditions:
- N(x, z): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) contradicts supx(z) < infx(x) because infx(x) <= supx(x) for a region, leading to supx(x) <= supx(z) < infx(x) <= supx(x), which is impossible. N is not possible.
- NE(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is consistent (supx(z) < infx(x)). The second condition supy(z) <= infy(x) must hold. We derived supy(x) <= infy(z). Can both supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) hold simultaneously? Yes, for example if x and z's y-intervals are separated. However, the initial relations link the y-intervals via y: infy(x) >= infy(y), supy(x) <= supy(y), infy(z) >= supy(y), supy(z) >= infy(z). From supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), we get supy(x) <= infy(z). From infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z), we have supy(z) >= infy(z) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) <= infy(x). We need to check if there exists a configuration where supy(z) <= infy(x) holds. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then we have supy(y) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) <= infy(x). So, NE(x, z) requires supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x). But we know from supy(x) <= infy(z) that x is below or touching the bottom of z. If infy(z) <= infy(x), then the bottom of z is below or touching the bottom of x. This would imply x and z are vertically overlapping or x is mostly above z. This contradicts x being below or touching z, unless they align perfectly at a boundary, which is ruled out by the properties of regions and relations. A formal proof shows NE is impossible due to the y-constraints chaining through y.
- SE(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). These are exactly the two conditions we derived (with strict inequality for the first part). This relation is consistent.
- S(x, z): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). The first condition is consistent. The second and third conditions imply horizontal overlap or alignment, which contradicts supx(z) < infx(x). S is not possible.
- E(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is consistent. The second and third conditions imply vertical overlap or containment. Our derived condition supy(x) <= infy(z) means x is below or touching z. Vertical overlap (infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)) is inconsistent with x being below z unless bounding boxes are points (supy(x)=infy(x) and supy(z)=infy(z) and supy(x)=infy(z)), which is not allowed. E is not possible.
- NW(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts supx(z) < infx(x) because infx(z) <= supx(z), leading to supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) < infx(x) <= supx(x), which is impossible. NW is not possible.
- W(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts supx(z) < infx(x). W is not possible.
- SW(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts supx(z) < infx(x). SW is not possible.
- B(x, z): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). supx(x) <= supx(z) contradicts supx(z) < infx(x). B is not possible.

The only relation consistent with the derived necessary conditions supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) is SE. We also demonstrated with an example that SE is indeed possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{SE}$.
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: B, E
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: S N B
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: SW, W
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: E, SE
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Let the bounding box of a region 'a' be defined by the intervals [infx(a), supx(a)] and [infy(a), supy(a)].
The given relation x S y is defined by the following conditions:
1) supy(x) <= infy(y)
2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

The given relation y S z is defined by the following conditions:
4) supy(y) <= infy(z)
5) infx(z) <= infx(y)
6) supx(y) <= supx(z)

We are looking for the possible relation(s) x R z, defined by comparing the bounding boxes of x and z.

From conditions 2 and 5, we can combine the inequalities for the x-infimum:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, we get:
7) infx(z) <= infx(x)

From conditions 3 and 6, we can combine the inequalities for the x-supremum:
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
So, we get:
8) supx(x) <= supx(z)

From conditions 1 and 4, we can combine the inequalities for the y-supremum of the lower region and the y-infimum of the upper region:
supy(x) <= infy(y)
supy(y) <= infy(z)

For any region 'a' in REG (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk), the interior is non-empty, which implies infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).
Using this property, we have infy(y) < supy(y).
Combining the y-inequalities:
supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z)
So, we get:
9) supy(x) <= infy(z)

The relations between the bounding boxes of x and z derived from x S y and y S z are:
i) infx(z) <= infx(x)
ii) supx(x) <= supx(z)
iii) supy(x) <= infy(z)

Now, let's check which of the possible single-tile cardinal relations a R b (where a is x and b is z) match these derived conditions:

- a B b: infx(b)<=infx(a), supx(a)<=supx(b), infy(b)<=infy(a), supy(a)<=supy(b)
  For x B z: infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
  Conditions i and ii match. Condition iii is supy(x)<=infy(z). For B, we need infy(z)<=infy(x). From condition iii and infy(x) < supy(x) (property of REG regions), we have infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z). This implies infy(x) < infy(z). Thus, infy(z)<=infy(x) is not possible for regions in REG. B is not possible.

- a S b: supy(a)<=infy(b), infx(b)<=infx(a), supx(a)<=supx(b)
  For x S z: supy(x)<=infy(z), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z).
  These three conditions match exactly with our derived conditions i, ii, and iii. S is possible.

- a N b: supy(b)<=infy(a), infx(b)<=infx(a), supx(a)<=supx(b)
  For x N z: supy(z)<=infy(x), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z).
  Conditions i and ii match. For N, we need supy(z)<=infy(x). From condition iii and infy(z) < supy(z) and infy(x) < supy(x), we have infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z). This implies infy(x) < supy(z). Thus, supy(z)<=infy(x) is not possible. N is not possible.

- a W b: supx(a)<=infx(b), infy(b)<=infy(a), supy(a)<=supy(b)
  For x W z: supx(x)<=infx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
  Condition iii is supy(x)<=infy(z), which implies supy(x)<=supy(z). Condition infy(z)<=infy(x) is not possible as shown for B. The condition supx(x)<=infx(z) contradicts infx(z)<=infx(x) (from i) for regions with extent (infx < supx), as it would imply supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), which means supx(x) <= infx(x). W is not possible.

- a E b: supx(b)<=infx(a), infy(b)<=infy(a), supy(a)<=supy(b)
  For x E z: supx(z)<=infx(x), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
  Condition supx(z)<=infx(x) contradicts supx(x)<=supx(z) (from ii) and infx(x) < supx(x) for regions with extent, as it would imply supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z), which means supx(z) < supx(z). E is not possible.

- a SW b: supx(a)<=infx(b), supy(a)<=infy(b)
  For x SW z: supx(x)<=infx(z), supy(x)<=infy(z).
  Condition supx(x)<=infx(z) is not possible as shown for W. SW is not possible.

- a NW b: supx(a)<=infx(b), supy(b)<=infy(a)
  For x NW z: supx(x)<=infx(z), supy(z)<=infy(x).
  Both conditions are not possible as shown for W and N. NW is not possible.

- a SE b: supx(b)<=infx(a), supy(a)<=infy(b)
  For x SE z: supx(z)<=infx(x), supy(x)<=infy(z).
  Condition supx(z)<=infx(x) is not possible as shown for E. SE is not possible.

- a NE b: supx(b)<=infx(a), supy(b)<=infy(a)
  For x NE z: supx(z)<=infx(x), supy(z)<=infy(x).
  Both conditions are not possible as shown for E and N. NE is not possible.

Based on the definitions provided and the properties of regions in REG, the only possible relation between region x and region z, given that region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, is S.

S
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: W, NW, SW
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: The given relations are x S y and y NE z. We use the definitions based on the infimum and supremum of the x and y projections of the regions. Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds for region a.

The definition of x S y is:
1) supy(x) <= infy(y)
2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

The definition of y NE z is:
4) supx(z) <= infx(y)
5) supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relations R between x and z, i.e., x R z, from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let's combine the given inequalities to derive constraints on the relative positions of x and z.
From (2) and (4): supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
So, we have a necessary condition: supx(z) <= infx(x).
This means the supremum of the x-projection of z is less than or equal to the infimum of the x-projection of x. In terms of bounding boxes, the right edge of z's bounding box is at or to the left of the left edge of x's bounding box. This implies z's bounding box is generally to the West of or aligned with the left edge of x's bounding box.

Now let's check which of the nine possible relations between x and z are compatible with supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions (regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk have supx > infx and supy > infy).

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), this implies supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This is only possible for degenerate regions where supx=infx. Not possible for regions in REG.
- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z). Not possible for regions in REG.
- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z). Not possible for regions in REG.
- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Not possible for regions in REG.
- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Not possible for regions in REG.
- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(x), the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Not possible for regions in REG.

Thus, the only possible relations for x relative to z that are compatible with supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions are E, NE, SE. Let's check if each of these is possible by constructing examples of regions x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions (x S y and y NE z) and the respective relation (x R z).

From (1) and (5): supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). Both x and z are positioned such that their maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of y. This means both x and z are entirely below or touching the bottom edge of y's bounding box.

Now let's consider the y-relation between x and z based on supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y).

Case 1: x is North of z in terms of y-projection (supy(z) <= infy(x)).
Combining with supx(z) <= infx(x), this gives the condition for x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
Example: Let x box = [10, 15] x [10, 15], z box = [0, 5] x [0, 5].
supx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supy(z)=5 <= infy(x)=10 (T). x NE z holds.
Can we find a y such that x S y and y NE z?
x S y: supy(x)=15 <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x)=10, supx(x)=15 <= supx(y).
y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y), supy(z)=5 <= infy(y).
Constraints on y: infy(y) >= 15, infy(y) >= 5 (so infy(y) >= 15). infx(y) <= 10, infx(y) >= 5 (so 5 <= infx(y) <= 10). supx(y) >= 15.
Let y box = [7, 20] x [18, 25]. infx(y)=7, supx(y)=20, infy(y)=18, supy(y)=25.
Check x S y: supy(x)=15 <= infy(y)=18 (T). infx(y)=7 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supx(x)=15 <= supx(y)=20 (T). x S y holds.
Check y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=7 (T). supy(z)=5 <= infy(y)=18 (T). y NE z holds.
Thus, NE is a possible relation.

Case 2: x is South of z in terms of y-projection (supy(x) <= infy(z)).
Combining with supx(z) <= infx(x), this gives the condition for x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
Example: Let x box = [10, 15] x [0, 5], z box = [0, 5] x [10, 15].
supx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supy(x)=5 <= infy(z)=10 (T). x SE z holds.
Can we find a y such that x S y and y NE z?
x S y: supy(x)=5 <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x)=10, supx(x)=15 <= supx(y).
y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y), supy(z)=15 <= infy(y).
Constraints on y: infy(y) >= 5, infy(y) >= 15 (so infy(y) >= 15). infx(y) <= 10, infx(y) >= 5 (so 5 <= infx(y) <= 10). supx(y) >= 15.
Let y box = [7, 20] x [18, 25]. Same as before.
Check x S y: supy(x)=5 <= infy(y)=18 (T). infx(y)=7 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supx(x)=15 <= supx(y)=20 (T). x S y holds.
Check y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=7 (T). supy(z)=15 <= infy(y)=18 (T). y NE z holds.
Thus, SE is a possible relation.

Case 3: x and z overlap in terms of y-projection, and not disjoint as in Case 1 or 2.
The definition of x E z is: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We know supx(z) <= infx(x) is necessary. The y-conditions are infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). This means z's y-projection starts lower or at the same level as x's, and ends higher or at the same level as x's. This is satisfied if z's y-projection contains x's y-projection, or they share a boundary.
Example: Let x box = [10, 15] x [10, 15], z box = [0, 5] x [5, 20].
supx(z)=5 <= infx(x)=10 (T). infy(z)=5 <= infy(x)=10 (T). supy(x)=15 <= supy(z)=20 (T). x E z holds.
Can we find a y such that x S y and y NE z?
x S y: supy(x)=15 <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x)=10, supx(x)=15 <= supx(y).
y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y), supy(z)=20 <= infy(y).
Constraints on y: infy(y) >= 15, infy(y) >= 20 (so infy(y) >= 20). infx(y) <= 10, infx(y) >= 5 (so 5 <= infx(y) <= 10). supx(y) >= 15.
Let y box = [7, 20] x [22, 30]. infx(y)=7, supx(y)=20, infy(y)=22, supy(y)=30.
Check x S y: supy(x)=15 <= infy(y)=22 (T). infx(y)=7 <= infx(x)=10 (T). supx(x)=15 <= supx(y)=20 (T). x S y holds.
Check y NE z: supx(z)=5 <= infx(y)=7 (T). supy(z)=20 <= infy(y)=22 (T). y NE z holds.
Thus, E is a possible relation.

We have shown that E, NE, and SE are possible relations between x and z. Based on the initial analysis, no other single-tile relation is possible for non-degenerate regions.

The possible relations are NE, SE, E.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, SE, E}$.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: B S
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: The problem defines cardinal direction relations based on the bounding boxes of regions that are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (regions in REG). We are given that region x is NW of region y, and region y is N of region z. We need to find the possible single-tile cardinal relations between region x and region z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)] denote the minimum bounding box of a region a.
Since regions are in REG, they have non-zero width and height, meaning infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a.

The given relations are:
1.  x NW y:
    supx(x) <= infx(y)  (x is to the West of y's left edge or aligned with it)
    supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is to the North of y's top edge or aligned with it)

2.  y N z:
    supy(z) <= infy(y)  (y is to the North of z's top edge or aligned with it)
    infx(z) <= infx(y)  (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection or aligned with edges)
    supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection or aligned with edges)

We want to find the possible relation(s) between x and z, i.e., x R z. This requires comparing the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

Comparing y-coordinates:
From (1) and (2), we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y).
Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x).
Thus, supy(z) <= infy(x) is always true. This means the top edge of z's bounding box is below or aligned with the bottom edge of x's bounding box. This implies that x must be vertically North of, or vertically aligned with the top edge of, z.
Let's check which relations satisfy supy(z) <= infy(x) for 'a R b' where a=x and b=z:
-   N: supy(b) <= infy(a) (Yes)
-   NE: supy(b) <= infy(a) (Yes)
-   NW: supy(b) <= infy(a) (Yes)
-   S: supy(a) <= infy(b) (Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Since supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), this implies supy(z) < supy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z), so supy(z) < infy(z), which is impossible for regions in REG). S is impossible.
-   SW: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible for the same reason as S. SW is impossible.
-   SE: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible for the same reason as S. SE is impossible.
-   E: Requires infy(b) <= infy(a) AND supy(a) <= supy(b) (infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)). We know supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). If supy(x) <= supy(z), this contradicts supy(z) < supy(x). E is impossible.
-   W: Requires infy(b) <= infy(a) AND supy(a) <= supy(b) (infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)). Impossible for the same reason as E. W is impossible.
-   B: Requires infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b) (infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)). Requires supy(x) <= supy(z), which is impossible. B is impossible.

So, the only possible single-tile relations are N, NE, and NW. All three satisfy the vertical condition supy(z) <= infy(x). We now examine the horizontal conditions.

Horizontal conditions:
-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
-   x N z: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z)
-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x)

Let's analyze the horizontal constraints from the given relations:
From x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
From y N z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
Also, for regions in REG, infx(y) < supx(y).

Combining supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) < supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true (specifically supx(x) < supx(z) unless all x, y, z have zero width, which is not allowed for REG).

Now let's check the possibility of each remaining relation (N, NW, NE):

-   Can x be NW of z? This requires supx(x) <= infx(z).
    We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).
    It is possible for supx(x) <= infx(z). Consider the x-projections:
    x: [-3, -2], y: [-1, 0], z: [-1.5, 2].
    supx(x)=-2, infx(y)=-1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (-2 <= -1, Yes).
    infx(z)=-1.5, infx(y)=-1. infx(z) <= infx(y) (-1.5 <= -1, Yes).
    supx(y)=0, supx(z)=2. supx(y) <= supx(z) (0 <= 2, Yes).
    Now check x NW z: supx(x)=-2, infx(z)=-1.5. supx(x) <= infx(z) (-2 <= -1.5, Yes).
    So, NW is a possible relation between x and z.

-   Can x be N of z? This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We already showed supx(x) <= supx(z) is always true.
    It is possible for infx(z) <= infx(x). Consider the x-projections:
    x: [-2, -1], y: [0, 1], z: [-3, 2].
    supx(x)=-1, infx(y)=0. supx(x) <= infx(y) (-1 <= 0, Yes).
    infx(z)=-3, infx(y)=0. infx(z) <= infx(y) (-3 <= 0, Yes).
    supx(y)=1, supx(z)=2. supx(y) <= supx(z) (1 <= 2, Yes).
    Now check x N z horizontal: infx(z)=-3, infx(x)=-2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (-3 <= -2, Yes). supx(x)=-1, supx(z)=2. supx(x) <= supx(z) (-1 <= 2, Yes).
    So, N is a possible relation between x and z.

-   Can x be NE of z? This requires supx(z) <= infx(x).
    We derived that infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
    This chain of inequalities implies infx(x) < supx(z).
    The condition for NE (supx(z) <= infx(x)) is incompatible with infx(x) < supx(z) for regions with positive width.
    So, NE is impossible.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box definitions and the transitivity of the given relations, the only possible single-tile cardinal relations between region x and region z from the allowed set are N and NW. While other relative positions (like overlaps) might occur based on the bounding boxes, the question asks for possible relations *from the given set* of single-tile relations.

The possible relations are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: The problem asks for the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z. The regions are in the set REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies their minimum bounding boxes have non-zero width and height.

Let the minimum bounding box of a region `a` be defined by the intervals [infx(a), supx(a)] and [infy(a), supy(a)]. For regions in REG, we have infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

The given relations are:
1.  x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2.  y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's derive the constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x relative to z by combining these inequalities and using the property that inf < sup for any region in REG.

From x NW y and y W z (in the x-direction):
infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z) < supx(z)
Combining these inequalities, we get:
infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) <= infx(z)
infx(x) < infx(y) <= infx(z)
infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z)

From infx(x) < supx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(y), we have infx(x) < infx(y) unless supx(x) = infx(y) and infx(x) = supx(x), which is impossible. So infx(x) < infx(y).
From infx(y) < supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we have infx(y) < infx(z) unless supx(y) = infx(z) and infx(y) = supx(y), which is impossible. So infx(y) < infx(z).

Therefore, infx(x) < infx(y) < infx(z).
Also, supx(x) <= infx(y) < infx(z), so supx(x) < infx(z).

The necessary constraints on the x-coordinates of x relative to z are:
- infx(x) < infx(z)
- supx(x) < infx(z) (unless supx(x) = infx(y) and infx(y) = supx(y) and supx(y) = infx(z), which is impossible)

Wait, let's be careful about strict vs non-strict inequalities.
infx(x) < supx(x)
supx(x) <= infx(y)
infx(y) < supx(y)
supx(y) <= infx(z)
infx(z) < supx(z)

Chain 1: infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) <= infx(z). This gives infx(x) <= infx(z). If infx(x) = infx(z), then infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(y) = supx(y) = infx(z), which is impossible (zero width for x and y, and zero difference between y and z). Thus, infx(x) < infx(z) must hold.

Chain 2: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This gives supx(x) <= infx(z). Equality is possible if supx(x) = infx(y) and supx(y) = infx(z). This means x's right edge touches y's left edge, and y's right edge touches z's left edge.

So, the necessary constraints on the x-coordinates are:
- infx(x) < infx(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

Now let's derive the constraints on the y-coordinates:
infy(x) < supy(x)
supy(y) <= infy(x)
infy(y) < supy(y)
infy(z) <= infy(y)
supy(y) <= supy(z)
infy(z) < supy(z)

Chain 1: infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x).
This implies infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(z) < supy(x).
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). If infy(z) = infy(x), then infy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y) = infy(x), which means y has zero height and infy(y) = supy(y) is equal to infy(x) and infy(z). This is possible if y is a horizontal line segment, but regions are 2D. So infy(y) < supy(y) must hold.
This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x). So infy(z) < infy(x) or infy(z) = infy(y) and infy(y) < supy(y) = infy(x).
Let's stick to non-strict for now, but remember the non-degenerate property.
From the chain infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), we get infy(z) <= infy(x).

Chain 2: supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). No direct relation between infy(x) and supy(z) is forced.

Necessary conditions:
1. infx(x) < infx(z)
2. supx(x) <= infx(z)
3. infy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's check which relations between x and z are compatible with these conditions:
- S (South): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), contradicts infx(x) < infx(z). Impossible.
- SW (South West): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z). Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). From infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) < supy(x), we have infy(z) < supy(x). So supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible.
- W (West): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Compatible with conditions 2 and 3. We need to check if supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible. We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). It is possible to construct regions where supy(x) <= supy(z) holds (e.g., x is short, z is tall). (Example was shown in thought process). W is possible.
- NW (North West): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x). Compatible with condition 2. Need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible. We have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). It is possible to construct regions where supy(z) <= infy(x) holds (e.g., y and z are low, x is high). (Example was shown in thought process). NW is possible.
- N (North): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z). Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), contradicts infx(x) < infx(z). Impossible.
- NE (North East): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x). Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). From infx(x) < infx(z) <= supx(z), this is impossible.
- E (East): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Impossible.
- SE (South East): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z). Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). Impossible.
- B (Bounding Box): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), contradicts infx(x) < infx(z). Impossible.

Based on the bounding box definitions and the non-degenerate property of regions in REG, the only possible relations between x and z are W and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{W, NW}$.
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: N, NE, E, NW, W, B
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: N, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: NW, W, SW
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: B:S:SW:W:NW:N:NE:E:SE
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Let the regions be $x, y, z$.
We are given the following cardinal direction relations:
1. $x$ NW $y$
2. $y$ NE $z$

The definitions of these relations in terms of the bounds of the minimum bounding box are:
$a$ NW $b \iff supx(a) \le infx(b)$ and $supy(b) \le infy(a)$
$a$ NE $b \iff supx(b) \le infx(a)$ and $supy(b) \le infy(a)$

Applying these definitions to the given relations:
1. $x$ NW $y \iff supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(x)$
2. $y$ NE $z \iff supx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(y)$

From the vertical inequalities in the two conditions:
$supy(y) \le infy(x)$
$supy(z) \le infy(y)$

Combining these inequalities, we get $supy(z) \le infy(y) \le supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
Thus, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.

Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, they are non-empty and have a positive area. This implies that for any region $a$, $infy(a) < supy(a)$.
Using this, we can refine the combined inequality:
$infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$.

This implies that $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
This vertical relationship tells us that the top of the bounding box of $z$ is at or below the bottom of the bounding box of $x$.

Now let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ ($x$ R $z$). We examine the vertical conditions required for each relation $a$ R $b$ (where $a=x, b=z$). The definitions are provided in the problem description:

- $x$ S $z \iff supy(x) \le infy(z)$ ... This contradicts $infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
- $x$ SW $z \iff supy(x) \le infy(z)$ ... Impossible.
- $x$ SE $z \iff supy(x) \le infy(z)$ ... Impossible.

- $x$ W $z \iff infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ ... The condition $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ contradicts $supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
- $x$ E $z \iff infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ ... Impossible.
- $x$ B $z \iff infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ ... Impossible.

- $x$ N $z \iff supy(z) \le infy(x)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. The vertical condition $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is satisfied by our derivation. This relation is possible if the horizontal conditions $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ can be satisfied simultaneously with the initial conditions.
- $x$ NW $z \iff supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. The vertical condition $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is satisfied. This relation is possible if the horizontal condition $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ can be satisfied.
- $x$ NE $z \iff supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. The vertical condition $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ is satisfied. This relation is possible if the horizontal condition $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ can be satisfied.

Now we need to check if the required horizontal relationships for N, NW, and NE are consistent with the initial horizontal constraints:
$supx(x) \le infx(y)$
$supx(z) \le infx(y)$

These constraints imply that $infx(y)$ is greater than or equal to both $supx(x)$ and $supx(z)$. This does not impose any specific order between $supx(x)$ and $supx(z)$, or between $infx(x)$ and $infx(z)$.
Let's see if we can construct scenarios where N, NW, or NE holds for $x$ and $z$ while the initial relations hold.

Scenario for $x$ N $z$: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
Let $infx(x)=5, supx(x)=10$. We need $infx(z) \le 5$ and $10 \le supx(z)$. Let $infx(z)=4, supx(z)=11$.
We need $infx(y) \ge supx(x)=10$ and $infx(y) \ge supx(z)=11$. Let $infx(y)=12$. This is possible. We showed a full example in thought block.

Scenario for $x$ NW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$.
Let $infx(x)=5, supx(x)=10$. We need $10 \le infx(z)$. Let $infx(z)=11, supx(z)=12$.
We need $infx(y) \ge supx(x)=10$ and $infx(y) \ge supx(z)=12$. Let $infx(y)=13$. This is possible. We showed a full example in thought block.

Scenario for $x$ NE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$.
Let $infx(x)=5, supx(x)=10$. We need $supx(z) \le 5$. Let $infx(z)=3, supx(z)=4$.
We need $infx(y) \ge supx(x)=10$ and $infx(y) \ge supx(z)=4$. Let $infx(y)=10$. This is possible. We showed a full example in thought block.

Since N, NW, and NE are the only relations whose vertical conditions are compatible with $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, and we have shown by construction that the required horizontal conditions for each of N, NW, and NE are consistent with the initial relations, these three relations are the only possible ones between $x$ and $z$.

The possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$ are N, NW, and NE.

N, NE, NW

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, NW}$.
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: N, NW, W, B
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: The given information is:
1) Region x is SW of region y:
   supx(x) <= infx(y)
   supy(x) <= infy(y)

2) Region y is N of region z:
   supy(z) <= infy(y)
   infx(z) <= infx(y)
   supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's denote the bounds as ix(a), sx(a), iy(a), sy(a) for infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) respectively.
The given constraints are:
1) sx(x) <= ix(y)
   sy(x) <= iy(y)
2) sy(z) <= iy(y)
   ix(z) <= ix(y)
   sx(y) <= sx(z)

We are looking for possible relations between x and z. We need to check which of the 9 single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with these constraints.
The 9 relations for x and z are defined based on their bounding boxes [ix(x), sx(x)] x [iy(x), sy(x)] and [ix(z), sx(z)] x [iy(z), sy(z)].

Let's deduce some relationships between the bounds of x and z.
From sx(x) <= ix(y) and sx(y) <= sx(z), and knowing that ix(y) <= sx(y) for a non-degenerate region y (homeomorphic to a disk), we have sx(x) <= ix(y) <= sx(y) <= sx(z).
Thus, we must always have sx(x) <= sx(z).

Now let's check each of the 9 possible relations for x and z:

1.  x E z: sx(z) <= ix(x), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z).
    From sx(z) <= ix(x) and ix(x) <= sx(x), we get sx(z) <= sx(x). Since we must also have sx(x) <= sx(z), this implies sx(x) = sx(z) and ix(x) = sx(x) (for non-degenerate x). A region homeomorphic to a disk is not a vertical line, so ix(x) < sx(x). Thus, sx(z) <= ix(x) is impossible given sx(x) <= sx(z) for non-degenerate regions.
    So, E is impossible.

2.  x NE z: sx(z) <= ix(x) and sy(z) <= iy(x).
    Impossible because sx(z) <= ix(x) is impossible.

3.  x SE z: sx(z) <= ix(x) and sy(x) <= iy(z).
    Impossible because sx(z) <= ix(x) is impossible.

4.  x S z: sy(x) <= iy(z), ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z).
    We know sx(x) <= sx(z) is always true.
    Are sy(x) <= iy(z) and ix(z) <= ix(x) possible?
    We need to find regions x, y, z satisfying the initial constraints and x S z.
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-1,-0.5] x [-2,-1.5]. ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=-0.5, iy(x)=-2, sy(x)=-1.5. (sx(x)=-0.5 <= 0, sy(x)=-1.5 <= 0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-2,1.5] x [-1,-0.5]. ix(z)=-2, sx(z)=1.5, iy(z)=-1, sy(z)=-0.5. (sy(z)=-0.5 <= 0, ix(z)=-2 <= 0, sx(y)=1 <= sx(z)=1.5. Yes).
    Check x S z: sy(x) <= iy(z)? -1.5 <= -1. Yes. ix(z) <= ix(x)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sx(x) <= sx(z)? -0.5 <= 1.5. Yes.
    So, S is possible.

5.  x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z).
    Are these possible?
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-2,-1] x [-2,-0.5]. ix(x)=-2, sx(x)=-1, iy(x)=-2, sy(x)=-0.5. (sx(x)=-1 <= 0, sy(x)=-0.5 <= 0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-0.5,1.5] x [-3,-1]. ix(z)=-0.5, sx(z)=1.5, iy(z)=-3, sy(z)=-1. (sy(z)=-1 <= 0, ix(z)=-0.5 <= 0, sx(y)=1 <= sx(z)=1.5. Yes).
    Check x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z)? -1 <= -0.5. Yes. iy(z) <= iy(x)? -3 <= -2. Yes. sy(x) <= sy(z)? -0.5 <= -1. No. The example failed.
    Let's construct another example for W.
    x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z).
    Let y=[0,0.5]x[0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=0.5, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x=[-3,-2]x[-2,-1]. ix(x)=-3, sx(x)=-2, iy(x)=-2, sy(x)=-1. (-2<=0, -1<=0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z=[-1,1]x[-3,-0.5]. ix(z)=-1, sx(z)=1, iy(z)=-3, sy(z)=-0.5. (-0.5<=0, -1<=0, 0.5<=1. Yes).
    Check x W z: sx(x) <= ix(z)? -2 <= -1. Yes. iy(z) <= iy(x)? -3 <= -2. Yes. sy(x) <= sy(z)? -1 <= -0.5. Yes.
    So, W is possible.

6.  x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) and sy(z) <= iy(x).
    Are these possible?
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-2,-1] x [-0.5,-0.1]. ix(x)=-2, sx(x)=-1, iy(x)=-0.5, sy(x)=-0.1. (sx(x)=-1 <= 0, sy(x)=-0.1 <= 0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-0.5, 1.5] x [-2,-0.6]. ix(z)=-0.5, sx(z)=1.5, iy(z)=-2, sy(z)=-0.6. (sy(z)=-0.6 <= 0, ix(z)=-0.5 <= 0, sx(y)=1 <= sx(z)=1.5. Yes).
    Check x NW z: sx(x) <= ix(z)? -1 <= -0.5. Yes. sy(z) <= iy(x)? -0.6 <= -0.5. Yes.
    So, NW is possible.

7.  x N z: sy(z) <= iy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(a) <= supx(b).
    x N z: sy(z) <= iy(x), ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z).
    We know sx(x) <= sx(z) is always true.
    Are sy(z) <= iy(x) and ix(z) <= ix(x) possible?
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-1,-0.5] x [-1,-0.5]. ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=-0.5, iy(x)=-1, sy(x)=-0.5. (-0.5<=0, -0.5<=0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-2, 1.5] x [-2,-1.5]. ix(z)=-2, sx(z)=1.5, iy(z)=-2, sy(z)=-1.5. (-1.5<=0, -2<=0, 1<=1.5. Yes).
    Check x N z: sy(z) <= iy(x)? -1.5 <= -1. Yes. ix(z) <= ix(x)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sx(x) <= sx(z)? -0.5 <= 1.5. Yes.
    So, N is possible.

8.  x SW z: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
    x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z) and sy(x) <= iy(z).
    Are these possible?
    Let y = [0,1] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=1, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-3,-2] x [-3,-2]. ix(x)=-3, sx(x)=-2, iy(x)=-3, sy(x)=-2. (-2<=0, -2<=0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-1,2] x [-1.5,-0.5]. ix(z)=-1, sx(z)=2, iy(z)=-1.5, sy(z)=-0.5. (-0.5<=0, -1<=0, 1<=2. Yes).
    Check x SW z: sx(x) <= ix(z)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sy(x) <= iy(z)? -2 <= -1.5. Yes.
    So, SW is possible.

9.  x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(a) <= supy(b).
    x B z: ix(z) <= ix(x), sx(x) <= sx(z), iy(z) <= iy(x), sy(x) <= sy(z).
    We know sx(x) <= sx(z) is always true.
    Are the other three possible simultaneously?
    Let y = [0,0.5] x [0,1]. ix(y)=0, sx(y)=0.5, iy(y)=0, sy(y)=1.
    x SW y: sx(x) <= 0, sy(x) <= 0. Let x = [-1,-0.5] x [-1,-0.5]. ix(x)=-1, sx(x)=-0.5, iy(x)=-1, sy(x)=-0.5. (-0.5<=0, -0.5<=0. Yes).
    y N z: sy(z) <= 0, ix(z) <= 0, sx(y) <= sx(z). Let z = [-2,1] x [-2,-0.2]. ix(z)=-2, sx(z)=1, iy(z)=-2, sy(z)=-0.2. (-0.2<=0, -2<=0, 0.5<=1. Yes).
    Check x B z: ix(z) <= ix(x)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sx(x) <= sx(z)? -0.5 <= 1. Yes. iy(z) <= iy(x)? -2 <= -1. Yes. sy(x) <= sy(z)? -0.5 <= -0.2. Yes.
    So, B is possible.

The possible relations are those for which we found a valid construction: S, W, NW, N, SW, B.
The relations E, NE, SE are impossible.

The possible relations are: S, SW, W, NW, N, B.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}$.
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: SW, W
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: SE, S, E, W, SW, B
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: S, SW
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: SW, W, NW
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Let the minimum bounding box of a region $a$ be denoted by $[infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$.
The definition of the single-tile cardinal direction relation SW is:
$a \text{ SW } b \iff supx(a) \le infx(b) \text{ and } supy(a) \le infy(b)$

We are given two relations:
1) $x \text{ SW } y$: $supx(x) \le infx(y) \text{ and } supy(x) \le infy(y)$
2) $y \text{ SW } z$: $supx(y) \le infx(z) \text{ and } supy(y) \le infy(z)$

We want to find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$. Let's deduce the constraints on the bounding box coordinates of $x$ and $z$.

From the x-axis conditions:
$supx(x) \le infx(y)$ (from 1)
$supx(y) \le infx(z)$ (from 2)
Since $y$ is a region in REG, its projection on the x-axis is an interval $[infx(y), supx(y)]$ with $infx(y) \le supx(y)$.
Combining the inequalities, we get:
$supx(x) \le infx(y) \le supx(y) \le infx(z)$
This implies $supx(x) \le infx(z)$.

From the y-axis conditions:
$supy(x) \le infy(y)$ (from 1)
$supy(y) \le infy(z)$ (from 2)
Similarly, for region $y$, its y-projection is an interval $[infy(y), supy(y)]$ with $infy(y) \le supy(y)$.
Combining the inequalities, we get:
$supy(x) \le infy(y) \le supy(y) \le infy(z)$
This implies $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.

So, if $x$ is SW of $y$ and $y$ is SW of $z$, it must be true that $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.

Now, let's check which of the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ satisfy these two conditions. The definitions are given in terms of $a$ and $b$, we apply them to $x$ and $z$.

- $x \text{ N } z$: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. This does not necessarily satisfy $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ or $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
- $x \text{ NE } z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. This does not necessarily satisfy $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ or $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
- $x \text{ E } z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$. This does not necessarily satisfy $supx(x) \le infx(z)$.
- $x \text{ SE } z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. This requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. We know $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. For both $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ to hold when $infx < supx$ for both $x$ and $z$, the intervals must be positioned such that $supx(z) \le infx(x) < supx(x) \le infx(z)$. This is impossible as it implies $supx(z) < infx(z)$. Thus SE is not possible.
- $x \text{ S } z$: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. This requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$. We know $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. For both $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ to hold when $infx < supx$ for $x$, this implies $supx(x) \le infx(z) \le infx(x)$, which is impossible. Thus S is not possible.
- $x \text{ W } z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$. This requires $infy(z) \le infy(x)$. We know $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. For both $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ to hold when $infy < supy$ for $x$, this implies $supy(x) \le infy(z) \le infy(x)$, which is impossible. Thus W is not possible.
- $x \text{ NW } z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. This requires $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. We know $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. For both $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ to hold when $infy < supy$ for both $x$ and $z$, this implies $supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x) \le infy(z)$, which is impossible as it implies $supy(z) < infy(z)$. Thus NW is not possible.
- $x \text{ SW } z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. These are exactly the conditions we derived. So SW is a possible relation.
- $x \text{ B } z$: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$. This requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. Combined with $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, this implies $supx(x) \le infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. The first part implies $supx(x) = infx(z) = infx(x)$, which is impossible for regions in REG. Thus B is not possible.

The only relation from the given list that is consistent with the derived conditions $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ is SW.
Furthermore, we can construct examples of regions $x, y, z$ in REG satisfying $x \text{ SW } y$ and $y \text{ SW } z$. For instance, take three disjoint disks whose bounding boxes are $[0,1]\times[0,1]$, $[2,3]\times[2,3]$, and $[4,5]\times[4,5]$ respectively. Their bounding boxes satisfy the SW relations as shown in the thoughts. The relation between the first and the third disk is also SW.

Since the derived conditions are necessary consequences and only the SW relation is defined by these conditions, the only possible relation is SW.

SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Let BB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. For regions in REG, we know that infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) (the bounding box has positive width and height).

The given relations are:
1.  x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints on their bounding boxes relative to each other.

From (1) and (2):
supx(x) <= infx(y)
supx(z) <= infx(y)
These inequalities tell us that the right edges of the bounding boxes of x and z are both to the left of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of y. This means infx(y) is an upper bound for both supx(x) and supx(z). This does not directly constrain the relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z (infx(x), supx(x) vs infx(z), supx(z)).

From (1) and (2):
supy(x) <= infy(y)
supy(y) <= infy(z)
Also, infy(y) <= supy(y) (property of a bounding box).
Combining these, we get: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
This chain implies supy(x) <= infy(z).
Since regions in REG have bounding boxes with positive height, infy(y) < supy(y) and infy(z) < supy(z).
supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z) implies supy(x) < infy(z).
So, supy(x) <= infy(z) must hold (strictly speaking supy(x) < infy(z)).

Let's also deduce other y-coordinate relations between x and z:
infy(x) < supy(x) (property of bbox)
supy(x) < infy(z) (derived above)
infy(z) < supy(z) (property of bbox)

From infy(x) < supy(x) < infy(z), we get infy(x) < infy(z).
From supy(x) < infy(z) < supy(z), we get supy(x) < supy(z).
From infy(x) < supy(x) < supy(z), we get infy(x) < supy(z).

So, the necessary y-coordinate relationships between x and z are:
infy(x) < infy(z)
supy(x) <= infy(z) (specifically, supy(x) < infy(z))
supy(x) < supy(z)
infy(x) < supy(z)

Now let's check which cardinal direction relations between x and z are possible given these y-constraints and the unconstrained x-relationships derived from supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y).

-   x W z: requires infy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < infy(z). W is not possible.
-   x NW z: requires supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) < supy(z). NW is not possible.
-   x N z: requires supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) < supy(z). N is not possible.
-   x NE z: requires supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) < supy(z). NE is not possible.
-   x E z: requires infy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < infy(z). E is not possible.
-   x B z: requires infy(z) <= infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < infy(z). B is not possible.

The only remaining possible relations are S, SW, and SE, as they only require supy(x) <= infy(z) or supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we know are true), and conditions on x-coordinates that are not directly contradicted by the premises.

Let's examine the x-coordinate conditions for S, SW, and SE:
-   S(x, z): infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
-   SW(x, z): supx(x) <= infx(z)
-   SE(x, z): supx(z) <= infx(x)

Can we construct examples of regions x, y, z from REG satisfying x SW y and y SE z, which result in x R z for R in {S, SW, SE}?

1.  **Possibility: S(x, z)**
    We need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The last condition is always true.
    We need to find x, y, z such that supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y), supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z), AND infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Let BB(y) = [2, 3] x [-3, -2]. infx(y)=2, supx(y)=3, infy(y)=-3, supy(y)=-2.
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 2, supy(x) <= -3. Let BB(x) = [0, 1] x [-5, -4]. supx(x)=1 <= 2 (T), supy(x)=-4 <= -3 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 2, supy(y)=-2 <= infy(z). Let BB(z) = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]. supx(z)=1 <= 2 (T), supy(y)=-2 <= infy(z)=-1 (T).
    Check S(x, z) for BB(x)=[0,1]x[-5,-4] and BB(z)=[-1,1]x[-1,1]:
    supy(x) <= infy(z) => -4 <= -1 (T)
    infx(z) <= infx(x) => -1 <= 0 (T)
    supx(x) <= supx(z) => 1 <= 1 (T)
    All conditions for S(x, z) are met. S is a possible relation.

2.  **Possibility: SW(x, z)**
    We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition is always true.
    We need to find x, y, z such that supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y), supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z), AND supx(x) <= infx(z).
    Let BB(y) = [12, 13] x [8, 9]. infx(y)=12, supx(y)=13, infy(y)=8, supy(y)=9.
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 12, supy(x) <= 8. Let BB(x) = [0, 1] x [0, 1]. supx(x)=1 <= 12 (T), supy(x)=1 <= 8 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 12, supy(y)=9 <= infy(z). Let BB(z) = [10, 11] x [10, 11]. supx(z)=11 <= 12 (T), supy(y)=9 <= infy(z)=10 (T).
    Check SW(x, z) for BB(x)=[0,1]x[0,1] and BB(z)=[10,11]x[10,11]:
    supx(x) <= infx(z) => 1 <= 10 (T)
    supy(x) <= infy(z) => 1 <= 10 (T)
    All conditions for SW(x, z) are met. SW is a possible relation.

3.  **Possibility: SE(x, z)**
    We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition is always true.
    We need to find x, y, z such that supx(x) <= infx(y), supy(x) <= infy(y), supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(y) <= infy(z), AND supx(z) <= infx(x).
    Let BB(y) = [0, 1] x [0, 1]. infx(y)=0, supx(y)=1, infy(y)=0, supy(y)=1.
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 0, supy(x) <= 0. Let BB(x) = [-3, -1] x [-3, -1]. supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(x)=-1 <= 0 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 0, supy(y)=1 <= infy(z). Let BB(z) = [-2, -0.5] x [2, 3]. supx(z)=-0.5 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=2 (T).
    Check SE(x, z) for BB(x)=[-3,-1]x[-3,-1] and BB(z)=[-2,-0.5]x[2,3]:
    supx(z) <= infx(x) => -0.5 <= -3 (F). Example failed. Let's try again.

    Let BB(y) = [0, 1] x [0, 1].
    x SW y: supx(x) <= 0, supy(x) <= 0. Let BB(x) = [-2, -1] x [-2, -1]. supx(x)=-1 <= 0 (T), supy(x)=-1 <= 0 (T).
    y SE z: supx(z) <= 0, supy(y)=1 <= infy(z). Let BB(z) = [-4, -3] x [2, 3]. supx(z)=-3 <= 0 (T), supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=2 (T).
    Check SE(x, z) for BB(x)=[-2,-1]x[-2,-1] and BB(z)=[-4,-3]x[2,3]:
    supx(z) <= infx(x) => -3 <= -2 (T)
    supy(x) <= infy(z) => -1 <= 2 (T)
    All conditions for SE(x, z) are met. SE is a possible relation.

We have shown that S, SW, and SE are all possible relations between region x and region z given the premises. We have also shown that all other relations (W, NW, N, NE, E, B) are impossible due to necessary consequences for the y-coordinates.

The possible relations between region x and region z are S, SW, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW, SE}$.

For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: N, NE
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are determined by combining the constraints from `x NE y` and `y W z`.

From `x NE y`:
1. `supx(y) <= infx(x)` (x is to the East of y's right edge)
2. `supy(y) <= infy(x)` (x is to the North of y's top edge)

From `y W z`:
3. `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (y is to the West of z's left edge, equivalently z is to the East of y's right edge)
4. `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (z's bottom edge is below or at y's bottom edge)
5. `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (y's top edge is below or at z's top edge)

Combining these inequalities:
- For the x-axis: We have `infx(x) >= supx(y)` and `infx(z) >= supx(y)`. This means both `x` and `z` start at or after the right edge of `y`'s bounding box. Their relative horizontal positions (`x` vs `z`) are not fixed; `x` could be to the West of `z`, to the East of `z`, or overlap with `z`.

- For the y-axis: We have `supy(y) <= infy(x)` (from 2) and `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (from 4). Since `infy(y) <= supy(y)` for any non-degenerate region `y`, we can chain these: `infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`. This gives us the strict inequality `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, meaning the bottom edge of `z`'s bounding box is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of `x`'s bounding box.

This constraint `infy(z) <= infy(x)` rules out any relation where `x` is strictly South of `z`, because that would require `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, which is impossible if `infy(x) >= infy(z)` unless both are point regions at the same y-level (which is a trivial and non-representative case for regions). Thus, relations S, SW, and SE are not possible.

The possible relations between `x` and `z` must therefore involve `x` being North of `z` or overlapping with `z` vertically. The remaining possible relations are N, NE, NW, E, W, and B. We need to check if each of these is possible by constructing example regions that satisfy the initial conditions (`x NE y` and `y W z`) and the specific relation between `x` and `z`.

By constructing various examples of bounding boxes for `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy the given conditions, it can be shown that all the remaining six relations are possible:

1.  **N:** x is North of z, with x's x-projection contained within z's x-projection. (Possible)
2.  **NE:** x is North-East of z (bounding boxes do not overlap). (Possible)
3.  **E:** x is East of z, with x's y-projection contained within z's y-projection. (Possible)
4.  **W:** x is West of z, with x's y-projection contained within z's y-projection. (Possible)
5.  **NW:** x is North-West of z (bounding boxes do not overlap). (Possible)
6.  **B:** x's bounding box is contained within z's bounding box. (Possible)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, NW, E, W, and B.

N, NE, E, NW, W, B
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Let the regions be x, y, and z.
Let BB(r) denote the minimum bounding box of a region r, defined by [infx(r), supx(r)] x [infy(r), supy(r)].
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes have non-zero width and height, i.e., supx(r) > infx(r) and supy(r) > infy(r) for any region r in REG.

We are given the relations:
1. x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints on their bounding boxes.

From (1):
infx(x) >= supx(y)  (x is to the East of or aligned with the East boundary of y)
infy(x) >= supy(y)  (x is to the North of or aligned with the North boundary of y)

From (2):
infx(y) >= supx(z)  (y is to the East of or aligned with the East boundary of z)
infy(y) >= infy(z)  (The South boundary of y is at or below the South boundary of z)
supy(y) <= supy(z)  (The North boundary of y is at or below the North boundary of z)

Combining the x-constraints:
infx(x) >= supx(y) and infx(y) >= supx(z).
Since supx(y) >= infx(y) (as regions have non-zero width), we have infx(x) >= supx(y) >= infx(y) >= supx(z).
This implies infx(x) >= supx(z).
This constraint means the left boundary of x is to the East of or aligned with the right boundary of z. This immediately rules out any relation where x is West of z (W, SW, NW) and the bounding box relation (B) which requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Since supx(x) > infx(x) and supx(z) > infx(z), infx(x) >= supx(z) implies supx(x) > infx(x) >= supx(z) > infx(z), so supx(x) > supx(z). Thus B is impossible.

The relations potentially possible given infx(x) >= supx(z) are E, NE, SE.

Let's combine the y-constraints:
infy(x) >= supy(y)
infy(y) >= infy(z)
supy(y) <= supy(z)

From infy(x) >= supy(y) and infy(y) >= infy(z), and supy(y) >= infy(y), we get infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(y) >= infy(z).
This implies infy(x) >= infy(z).
The South boundary of x is at or above the South boundary of z.

Now let's evaluate the remaining possible relations (E, NE, SE) between x and z based on the derived constraints and their definitions:

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
  supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied by our combined x-constraint.
  For supy(z) <= infy(x) to be possible, we need to find regions x, y, z satisfying the initial conditions such that supy(z) <= infy(x).
  We know infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
  If we can choose y such that supy(y) is close to supy(z), and x such that infy(x) is close to supy(y), then infy(x) can be >= supy(z).
  Example: Let z = [0,1] x [0,1]. supx(z)=1, supy(z)=1.
  y E z: infx(y) >= 1, infy(y) >= 0, supy(y) <= 1. Let y = [1.1, 1.2] x [0.9, 1.0]. supx(y)=1.2, supy(y)=1.0.
  x NE y: infx(x) >= supx(y)=1.2, infy(x) >= supy(y)=1.0. Let x = [1.3, 1.4] x [1.0, 1.1]. infx(x)=1.3, infy(x)=1.0.
  Check x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x)? 1 <= 1.3 (Yes). supy(z) <= infy(x)? 1 <= 1.0 (Yes, boundaries touch).
  So, x NE z is possible.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
  supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
  infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied by our derived infy(x) >= infy(z).
  For supy(x) <= supy(z) to be possible, we need to find regions x, y, z satisfying the initial conditions such that supy(x) <= supy(z).
  We know infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), and supy(x) > infy(x).
  We need supy(x) <= supy(z). This requires the height of x above infy(x) to be limited, and infy(x) not to be too high relative to supy(z).
  Example: Let z = [0,1] x [0,1]. supx(z)=1, infy(z)=0, supy(z)=1.
  y E z: infx(y) >= 1, infy(y) >= 0, supy(y) <= 1. Let y = [2,3] x [0, 0.5]. supx(y)=3, infy(y)=0, supy(y)=0.5.
  x NE y: infx(x) >= supx(y)=3, infy(x) >= supy(y)=0.5. Let x = [4,5] x [0.6, 0.8]. infx(x)=4, infy(x)=0.6, supy(x)=0.8.
  Check x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x)? 1 <= 4 (Yes). infy(z) <= infy(x)? 0 <= 0.6 (Yes). supy(x) <= supy(z)? 0.8 <= 1 (Yes).
  So, x E z is possible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
  supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
  For supy(x) <= infy(z) to be possible, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
  However, we derived infy(x) >= infy(z).
  Since regions in REG have non-zero height, supy(x) > infy(x).
  Thus, supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(z), which means supy(x) > infy(z).
  This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z).
  So, x SE z is not possible for regions in REG.

The relations ruled out by infx(x) >= supx(z) were W, SW, NW, B.
The relation ruled out by supy(x) > infy(z) (derived from initial conditions and height > 0) is SE, S.
The relation ruled out by supx(x) > infx(z) (derived from initial conditions and width > 0) was N (requires supx(x) <= supx(z)) - let's recheck N properly:
- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). We derived infx(x) >= supx(z), and we know supx(x) > infx(x) and supx(z) > infx(z). This gives supx(x) > infx(x) >= supx(z) > infx(z), so supx(x) > supx(z). This contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So N is impossible.

The only possible relations are E and NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, NE}$.
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, B
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: N NE NW
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), supy(a) denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box of region a.
The definitions of the single-tile cardinal direction relations based on bounding boxes are given.
We are given that region x is NE of region y, and region y is NE of region z.
Applying the definition of NE:
1) x NE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(y) <= infy(x)`
2) y NE z: `supx(z) <= infx(y)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z, i.e., the possible relations R such that x R z. We need to check if the conditions for each relation R can be satisfied by regions x, y, z in REG satisfying the given NE relations.

Let's analyze the horizontal and vertical relationships implied by the given NE relations.

Horizontal relationship between x and z:
From (1), `supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
From (2), `supx(z) <= infx(y)`.
Since regions in REG have non-zero horizontal extent, we know `infx(y) <= supx(y)`.
Combining the inequalities: `supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
This implies `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
This condition corresponds to x being to the East of z, or their bounding boxes touching along the eastern edge of z. This condition is part of the definitions for relations E, NE, and SE.

Can x be to the West of z, i.e., `supx(x) <= infx(z)`?
From the inequalities: `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
This implies `supx(x) <= infx(x)`. Since regions in REG have non-zero horizontal extent (`infx(a) < supx(a)`), this is impossible.
Thus, relations W, NW, and SW are not possible between x and z.

Can x and z be horizontally contained within each other, or overlap in other ways? Relations B, N, S require horizontal containment conditions like `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
The condition `supx(x) <= supx(z)` implies `supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`, which again leads to `supx(x) <= infx(x)`, impossible for regions in REG.
Thus, relations B, N, and S are not possible between x and z (due to the horizontal constraints).

So, horizontally, the only possibility is that x is to the East of z (or touching), captured by `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. This limits the possible relations to E, NE, SE.

Vertical relationship between x and z:
From (1), `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
From (2), `supy(z) <= infy(y)`.
Since regions in REG have non-zero vertical extent, we know `infy(y) <= supy(y)`.
Combining the inequalities: `supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
This implies `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
This condition corresponds to x being to the North of z, or their bounding boxes touching along the northern edge of z. This condition is part of the definitions for relations N, NE, and NW.

Can x be to the South of z, i.e., `supy(x) <= infy(z)`?
From the inequalities: `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
This implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`. Since regions in REG have non-zero vertical extent (`infy(a) < supy(a)`), this is impossible.
Thus, relations S, SE, and SW are not possible between x and z.

Can x and z be vertically contained within each other, or overlap in other ways? Relations B, E, W require vertical containment conditions like `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
The condition `supy(x) <= supy(z)` implies `supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`, which again leads to `supy(x) <= infy(x)`, impossible for regions in REG.
Thus, relations B, E, and W are not possible between x and z (due to the vertical constraints).

So, vertically, the only possibility is that x is to the North of z (or touching), captured by `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This limits the possible relations to N, NE, NW.

Now we combine the possible horizontal and vertical relations for x R z:
Possible horizontal relations: E, NE, SE (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`)
Possible vertical relations: N, NE, NW (`supy(z) <= infy(x)`)

The relation x R z must satisfy both the horizontal and vertical conditions from its definition. We check the definitions:
- `x NE z`: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Both of these conditions must hold, as derived above. So NE is a possible relation. In fact, it is a necessary relation.
- `x E z`: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (holds), `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. We showed `supy(x) <= supy(z)` is impossible. So E is not possible.
- `x SE z`: Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (holds) and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. We showed `supy(x) <= infy(z)` is impossible. So SE is not possible.
- `x N z`: Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (holds), `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. We showed `supx(x) <= supx(z)` is impossible. So N is not possible.
- `x NW z`: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (holds). We showed `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is impossible. So NW is not possible.
- `x W z`: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (impossible), `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (impossible). So W is not possible.
- `x SW z`: Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (impossible) and `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (impossible). So SW is not possible.
- `x S z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (impossible), `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, and `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (impossible). So S is not possible.
- `x B z`: Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (impossible), `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (impossible). So B is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the constraints implied by regions being in REG (having non-zero extent), the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: B N NE E
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: Let infx(r), supx(r), infy(r), and supy(r) denote the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of the projection of a region r on the x and y axes, respectively. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are 2D regions with non-empty interior and a connected boundary, and thus their bounding boxes have positive width and height. That is, for any region r in REG, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

We are given two relations:
1) Region x is B of region y (x B y):
   infx(y) <= infx(x)
   supx(x) <= supx(y)
   infy(y) <= infy(x)
   supy(x) <= supy(y)

2) Region y is W of region z (y W z):
   supx(y) <= infx(z)
   infy(z) <= infy(y)
   supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z (x R z). Let's combine the inequalities derived from the given relations.

From `supx(x) <= supx(y)` (from x B y) and `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (from y W z), we get:
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
Thus, **supx(x) <= infx(z)**.

From `infy(y) <= infy(x)` (from x B y) and `infy(z) <= infy(y)` (from y W z), we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
Thus, **infy(z) <= infy(x)**.

From `supy(x) <= supy(y)` (from x B y) and `supy(y) <= supy(z)` (from y W z), we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
Thus, **supy(x) <= supy(z)**.

So, we have derived three inequalities that must hold for regions x and z:
(A) supx(x) <= infx(z)
(B) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(C) supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible relations for x R z and see which are consistent with these derived inequalities and the property that regions in REG have positive width and height bounding boxes (inf < sup).

- **W (x W z):** supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  These are exactly the inequalities (A), (B), and (C). Since (A), (B), and (C) are always true given the premises, the W relation is always possible.

- **B (x B z):** infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  From x B y and y W z, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
  Since regions have positive width, infx(y) < supx(y).
  So, infx(x) >= infx(y) and infx(z) >= supx(y) > infx(y).
  Also, from infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) (using inf < sup property), we get infx(x) < infx(z).
  The condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for B contradicts infx(x) < infx(z). Thus, B is not possible.

- **E (x E z):** supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  From the chain infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) < supx(z), we get infx(x) < supx(z).
  The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for E contradicts infx(x) < supx(z). Thus, E is not possible. Similarly, NE and SE are not possible as they also require supx(z) <= infx(x).

- **N (x N z):** supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  From the chain infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), we get infy(x) < supy(z).
  The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for N contradicts infy(x) < supy(z). Thus, N is not possible. Similarly, NW and NE are not possible as they also require supy(z) <= infy(x).

- **S (x S z):** supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  From the chain infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x), we get infy(z) < supy(x).
  The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for S contradicts infy(z) < supy(x). Thus, S is not possible. Similarly, SW and SE are not possible as they also require supy(x) <= infy(z).

Based on the bounding box definitions and the properties of regions in REG (positive width and height), the only possible relation between x and z is W.

The final answer is $\boxed{W}$.
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The definitions of the given relations in terms of bounding box coordinates are:
x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We are given that x B y and y E z hold. Let's derive the necessary relationships between the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

From x B y:
1) infx(y) <= infx(x)
2) supx(x) <= supx(y)
3) infy(y) <= infy(x)
4) supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y E z:
5) supx(z) <= infx(y)
6) infy(z) <= infy(y)
7) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these inequalities:
For the x-coordinates:
From (5) and (1): supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x). (Derived Constraint C1)

For the y-coordinates:
From (6) and (3): infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x). (Derived Constraint C2)
From (4) and (7): supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z). (Derived Constraint C3)

So, if x B y and y E z hold, the bounding boxes of x and z must satisfy these three conditions:
C1: supx(z) <= infx(x)
C2: infy(z) <= infy(x)
C3: supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now let's check which of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with these derived constraints. The definition of x R z is:
x R z if relation_conditions(infx(z), supx(z), infy(z), supy(z), infx(x), supx(x), infy(x), supy(x)) hold.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
  These are exactly the three derived constraints C1, C2, and C3. Thus, if x B y and y E z hold, x E z must hold. E is a possible relation.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
  From the properties of regions homeomorphic to a disk, infy(x) < supy(x). From C3, supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Combining these: infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z). Thus, infy(x) < supy(z).
  This contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So N is not possible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z)
  From the properties of regions, infy(x) < supy(x). From C2, infy(z) <= infy(x).
  Combining these: infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). Thus, infy(z) < supy(x).
  This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So S is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
  From the properties of regions, infx(x) < supx(x). From C1, supx(z) <= infx(x).
  Combining these: supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). Thus, supx(z) < supx(x).
  If supx(x) <= infx(z) holds, then supx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(z). This implies supx(z) < infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) < supx(z). So W is not possible.

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  supy(z) <= infy(x) is not possible (as shown for N). So NE is not possible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
  supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible (as shown for S). So SE is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  Neither condition is possible (as shown for W and N). So NW is not possible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
  Neither condition is possible (as shown for W and S). So SW is not possible.

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
  The y-conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are guaranteed by C2 and C3.
  However, the x-conditions require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  We have C1: supx(z) <= infx(x).
  If x B z holds, then supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x).
  This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x) for regions in REG. So B is not possible.

Based on the analysis of the bounding box relations and the properties of the regions, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is E.

The final answer is $\boxed{E}$.
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Let `infx(a)`, `supx(a)`, `infy(a)`, and `supy(a)` denote the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of the projection of region `a` on the x and y axes, respectively. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are closed, connected, have connected boundaries, and importantly, have a positive area. This means that for any region `a` in REG, its bounding box intervals `[infx(a), supx(a)]` and `[infy(a), supy(a)]` must have positive length, i.e., `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

We are given two relations:
1.  Region x is B of region y (`x B y`)
2.  Region y is SW of region z (`y SW z`)

Let's write these relations using the bounding box coordinates based on the provided definitions:
`x B y` means:
-   `infx(y) <= infx(x)`
-   `supx(x) <= supx(y)`
-   `infy(y) <= infy(x)`
-   `supy(x) <= supy(y)`

`y SW z` means:
-   `supx(y) <= infx(z)`
-   `supy(y) <= infy(z)`

Now, let's combine these inequalities to find the possible relations between x and z.
From `supx(x) <= supx(y)` and `supx(y) <= infx(z)`, by transitivity, we get:
`supx(x) <= infx(z)`

From `supy(x) <= supy(y)` and `supy(y) <= infy(z)`, by transitivity, we get:
`supy(x) <= infy(z)`

These two derived inequalities, `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, are precisely the defining conditions for the relation `x SW z`. This means that based on the given information, the relation `x SW z` is always satisfied.

Now, we need to determine if any other relation between x and z is possible. Let's examine the conditions for each of the 9 single-tile relations between x and z:

-   `x B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    We know `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. If `infx(z) <= infx(x)` is also true, then `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x)`. Since `infx(x) < supx(x)` for any region in REG, this is impossible. So, B is not possible.

-   `x S z`: `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (True), `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`. As shown for B, this contradicts `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. So, S is not possible.

-   `x SW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (True), `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (True).
    Both conditions are necessarily true. SW is possible.

-   `x W z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (True), `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requires `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. We know `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. If `infy(z) <= infy(x)` is true, then `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x)`. Since `infy(x) < supy(x)` for any region in REG, this is impossible. So, W is not possible.

-   `x NW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (True), `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. We know `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. If `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is true, then `supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z)`. This implies `infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z)`, meaning both x and z have zero height, which is not allowed. So, NW is not possible.

-   `x N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (Impossible as shown for NW) and `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible as shown for B). So, N is not possible.

-   `x NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. We know `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. If `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is true, then `supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) < supx(z)`. This implies `infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z)`, meaning both x and z have zero width, which is not allowed. So, NE is not possible.
    Also requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, which is impossible (as shown for NW). So, NE is not possible.

-   `x E z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible as shown for NE) and `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (Impossible as shown for W). So, E is not possible.

-   `x SE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (True).
    Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Impossible (as shown for NE, E). So, SE is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the property that regions homeomorphic to a disk have positive width and height projections, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

SW
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Let $x, y, z$ be regions in REG.
Let $infx(r)$, $supx(r)$, $infy(r)$, $supy(r)$ denote the bounds of the projection of a region $r$ on the x and y axes. The minimum bounding box of $r$ is $MBB(r) = [infx(r), supx(r)] \times [infy(r), supy(r)]$.

The given conditions are:
1. Region $x$ is B of region $y$. According to the definition:
$infx(y) \le infx(x)$
$supx(x) \le supx(y)$
$infy(y) \le infy(x)$
$supy(x) \le supy(y)$
These four inequalities mean $MBB(x) \subseteq MBB(y)$. Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, their MBBs have non-zero width and height, so $infx(x) < supx(x)$ and $infy(x) < supy(x)$.

2. Region $y$ is SE of region $z$. According to the definition:
$supx(z) \le infx(y)$
$supy(y) \le infy(z)$
These two inequalities mean that the right edge of $MBB(z)$ is to the left of or coincides with the left edge of $MBB(y)$, AND the top edge of $MBB(y)$ is below or coincides with the bottom edge of $MBB(z)$.

We want to find the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$. Let's find the constraints on $MBB(x)$ relative to $MBB(z)$.
From $supx(z) \le infx(y)$ (from $y$ SE $z$) and $infx(y) \le infx(x)$ (from $x$ B $y$), we get:
$supx(z) \le infx(x)$
This means the right edge of $MBB(z)$ is to the left of or coincides with the left edge of $MBB(x)$.

From supy(x) $\le$ supy(y) (from $x$ B $y$) and supy(y) $\le$ infy(z) (from $y$ SE $z$), we get:
$supy(x) \le infy(z)$
This means the top edge of $MBB(x)$ is below or coincides with the bottom edge of $MBB(z)$.

So, the relations between $x$ and $z$ must satisfy the two conditions:
(A) $supx(z) \le infx(x)$
(B) $supy(x) \le infy(z)$

Now let's check which of the possible single-tile relations between $x$ and $z$ are compatible with these two conditions. Let R be a relation from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

- $x$ B $z \iff infx(z) \le infx(x), supx(x) \le supx(z), infy(z) \le infy(x), supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
Condition (A) is $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. This, combined with $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, implies $supx(x) \le supx(z) \le infx(x)$. Since $infx(x) < supx(x)$ (regions are not points), this is impossible. So B is not possible.

- $x$ S $z \iff supy(x) \le infy(z), infx(z) \le infx(x), supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
Condition (B) is $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, which is the first condition for S. However, the x-conditions for S ($\infx(z) \le \infx(x)$ and $\supx(x) \le \supx(z)$) combined with condition (A) ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) lead to the same contradiction as for B: $supx(x) \le supx(z) \le infx(x)$, which is impossible. So S is not possible.

- $x$ SW $z \iff supx(x) \le infx(z), supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
Condition (B) is $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, which is the second condition for SW. However, condition (A) is $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, while SW requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. If both $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ hold, then $supx(x) \le infx(z) \le supx(z) \le infx(x)$. Since $infx(x) < supx(x)$ and $infx(z) < supx(z)$, this is impossible. So SW is not possible.

- $x$ W $z \iff supx(x) \le infx(z), infy(z) \le infy(x), supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, which contradicts condition (A) as shown for SW. So W is not possible.

- $x$ NW $z \iff supx(x) \le infx(z), supy(z) \le infy(a)$.
Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, which contradicts condition (A) as shown for SW. So NW is not possible.

- $x$ N $z \iff supy(z) \le infy(a), infx(z) \le infx(a), supx(a) \le supx(z)$.
Requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, which contradicts condition (A) as shown for B. So N is not possible.

- $x$ NE $z \iff supx(z) \le infx(x), supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
Condition (A) is $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, which is the first condition for NE. The second condition is $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. We have condition (B): $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. Can $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ hold together with $supy(x) \le infy(z)$?
Let's try the example from the thought process:
$MBB(z) = [0, 1] \times [0, 1]$. $\supx(z)=1, \supy(z)=1, \infy(z)=0$.
$MBB(y) = [1.5, 2.5] \times [-2.5, -1.5]$. $\infx(y)=1.5, \supy(y)=-1.5, \infy(y)=-2.5$.
$y$ SE $z$: $1 \le 1.5$ (OK), $-1.5 \le 0$ (OK).
$MBB(x) = [1.6, 2.4] \times [-2.4, -1.6]$. $\infx(x)=1.6, \supy(x)=-1.6, \infy(x)=-2.4$.
$x$ B $y$: $1.5 \le 1.6, 2.4 \le 2.5, -2.5 \le -2.4, -1.6 \le -1.5$ (All OK).
Check $x$ NE $z$: $\supx(z) \le infx(x) \implies 1 \le 1.6$ (OK). $\supy(z) \le infy(x) \implies 1 \le -2.4$ (FAIL).
NE is not possible.

- $x$ E $z \iff supx(z) \le infx(x), infy(z) \le infy(x), supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
Condition (A) is $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, which is the first condition for E. Conditions (B) is $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. The y-conditions for E are $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$ and $\supy(x) \le \supy(z)$. Can $\infy(z) \le \infy(x)$ hold together with $\supy(x) \le infy(z)$? This implies $\supy(x) \le infy(z) \le infy(x)$. Since $\infy(x) < supy(x)$ (for non-degenerate regions), this is impossible. So E is not possible.

- $x$ SE $z \iff supx(z) \le infx(x), supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
Conditions (A) and (B) are exactly the definition of SE. Thus, SE is a possible relation. We have already constructed examples in the thought process where this relation holds.

Since the single-tile cardinal relations are defined based on the exhaustive and mutually exclusive relationships between the MBB interval endpoints, and the conditions derived from the premises are exactly the definition of the SE relation, no other single-tile relation is possible.

The only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{SE}$.
