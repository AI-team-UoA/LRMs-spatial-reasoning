PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region $a$ be defined by the intervals $[infx(a), supx(a)]$ on the x-axis and $[infy(a), supy(a)]$ on the y-axis. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes have positive width and height: $infx(a) < supx(a)$ and $infy(a) < supy(a)$.

We are given two relations:
1. Region $x$ is NW of region $y$: $x$ NW $y$.
   According to the definition:
   $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ (x is to the West of y horizontally, or they touch)
   $supy(y) \le infy(x)$ (x is to the North of y vertically, or they touch)

2. Region $y$ is N of region $z$: $y$ N $z$.
   According to the definition:
   $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ (y is to the North of z vertically, or they touch)
   $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ (y's x-projection overlaps or contains z's x-projection)
   $supx(y) \le supx(z)$ (y's x-projection overlaps or is contained by z's x-projection)

We want to find the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$ from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}. Let's analyze the vertical and horizontal relationships between $x$ and $z$ based on the given inequalities.

Vertical Relation between $x$ and $z$:
From $x$ NW $y$, we have $supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
From $y$ N $z$, we have $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.
Combining these, we get $supy(z) \le infy(y) \le supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
This implies $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
Since regions in REG have positive height, $infy(y) < supy(y)$.
Thus, the inequality chain is actually $supy(z) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
This implies $supy(z) < infy(x)$ must hold strictly, unless $infy(y) = supy(y)$, which is not allowed for regions in REG.
So, the highest point of $z$ is strictly below the lowest point of $x$. This means $x$ is strictly North of $z$ vertically.
The vertical condition for $x$ relative to $z$ must be $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (which implies strict inequality due to REG property).
Looking at the definitions of the single-tile relations, the relations having this vertical condition are N, NW, and NE.

Horizontal Relation between $x$ and $z$:
From $x$ NW $y$, we have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
From $y$ N $z$, we have $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
Since regions in REG have positive width, $infx(y) < supx(y)$.
Thus, the inequality chain related to $y$'s horizontal extent is $infx(z) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
This means the horizontal projection of $y$ is contained within or is equal to the horizontal projection of $z$. $z$ horizontally contains $y$.

Now consider $x$'s horizontal position relative to $z$. We have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
Since $infx(y) \le supx(z)$ (from $infx(y) < supx(y) \le supx(z)$), we have $supx(x) \le infx(y) \le supx(z)$.
This implies $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. This means $x$ cannot be entirely to the East of $z$. E, SE, NE are ruled out horizontally.

Let's analyze possible horizontal relations between $x$ and $z$ based on $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(z) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
1. $x$ is West of $z$ (or touching): $supx(x) \le infx(z)$.
   From $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(z) \le infx(y)$.
   If $infx(z) = infx(y)$, then $supx(x) \le infx(y) = infx(z)$. This is possible. For example, let $infx(y)=5$, $supx(y)=10$, $infx(z)=5$, $supx(z)=12$. Let $supx(x)=4$. This satisfies $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (4<=5) and $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ (4<=5). This case corresponds to the horizontal condition for W, NW, SW.

2. $z$ horizontally contains $x$: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
   We already showed $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ is necessary.
   Is $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ possible?
   We know $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(x) < supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
   Let $infx(y)=5$. $infx(z) \le 5$. $infx(x) < supx(x) \le 5$.
   Let $infx(z)=2$, $infx(x)=3$. This is possible ($2 \le 3$). Example: $y_x = [5,10]$, $z_x = [2,12]$, $x_x = [3,4]$. $infx(z)=2 \le infx(x)=3$ and $supx(x)=4 \le supx(z)=12$. This case corresponds to the horizontal condition for N, S, B.

3. $x$ overlaps $z$ (x starts West, ends within z): $infx(x) < infx(z)$ and $infx(z) < supx(x) < supx(z)$.
   Is $infx(x) < infx(z)$ possible? Yes. Let $infx(y)=5$. $infx(z) \le 5$. $infx(x) < supx(x) \le 5$.
   Let $infx(z)=3$, $infx(x)=1$. $1 < 3$ is possible.
   Is $infx(z) < supx(x)$ possible? Yes. Let $infx(y)=5$. $infx(z) \le 5$. $supx(x) \le 5$.
   Let $infx(z)=3$, $supx(x)=4$. $3 < 4$ is possible.
   Let $y_x = [5,10]$, $z_x = [3,12]$, $x_x = [1,4]$. $infx(x)=1 < infx(z)=3$, $infx(z)=3 < supx(x)=4$, $supx(x)=4 < supx(z)=12$. This case is geometrically possible.

So, possible horizontal relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
H1: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (West or Touching West)
H2: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (Z contains X horizontally or Equal)
H3: $infx(x) < infx(z)$ and $infx(z) < supx(x)$ and $supx(x) < supx(z)$ (X overlaps Z, West part)

Now we combine the mandatory vertical condition (V1: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$) with these possible horizontal conditions and check which single-tile relations match.

- N: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (V1) AND $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (H2).
  This combination of vertical and horizontal conditions is possible. So **N** is a possible relation.

- NW: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (H1) AND $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (V1).
  This combination of vertical and horizontal conditions is possible. So **NW** is a possible relation.

- NE: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (V1).
  Horizontal part $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ contradicts our finding that $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (strictly $supx(x) < supx(z)$ given REG). NE is not possible.

- S, SW, SE: These relations require the vertical condition $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. Our derivation $supy(z) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$ leads to $supy(x) > infy(x) > supy(z) > infy(z)$, so $supy(x) > infy(z)$. These relations are not possible.

- W, E, B: These relations require the vertical condition $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ AND $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
  We have $infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$.
  $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ is satisfied.
  $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. These relations are not possible.

The horizontal overlap case H3 (infx(x) < infx(z) AND infx(z) < supx(x) AND supx(x) < supx(z)) combined with the vertical condition V1 describes a valid spatial relationship between $x$ and $z$ based on the bounding boxes. However, this combination of bounding box relations does not match the definition of any of the 9 single-tile relations provided in the problem statement. Since the possible answers must come from the given list, this case, although geometrically possible, must not correspond to one of the listed relations. The problem asks for possible relations *from the given list*.

Therefore, the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$ from the provided list are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
