PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. We are given two conditions:
1.  x B y
2.  y E z

We need to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's translate the given conditions into inequalities using the definitions of the bounding box coordinates:

From the definition of x B y:
(B1) infx(y) <= infx(x)
(B2) supx(x) <= supx(y)
(B3) infy(y) <= infy(x)
(B4) supy(x) <= supy(y)

From the definition of y E z:
(E1) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(E2) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(E3) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's combine these inequalities to find the relationship between the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

Combine (E1) and (B1):
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
This gives us:
(XZ1) supx(z) <= infx(x)

Combine (E2) and (B3):
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
This gives us:
(XZ2) infy(z) <= infy(x)

Combine (B4) and (E3):
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
This gives us:
(XZ3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, from the given conditions, we derived the following necessary conditions for the relationship between x and z:
(XZ1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(XZ2) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(XZ3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now let's check which of the possible single-tile cardinal relations between x and z are consistent with these derived conditions. The definitions for x R z are:

-   **x B z**: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    XZ2 and XZ3 match the y-conditions for B. For the x-conditions, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). However, we derived XZ1: supx(z) <= infx(x). If x B z also holds, then supx(x) <= supx(z). Combining this with XZ1, we get supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed disk, they have a positive horizontal extent, meaning supx(x) > infx(x). Thus, supx(x) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG. So, x B z is impossible.

-   **x S z**: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived XZ3: supy(x) <= supy(z) and XZ2: infy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) holds, then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(x) <= infy(x). This is impossible for regions in REG (positive vertical extent). So, x S z is impossible.

-   **x SW z**: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    The second condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), is impossible as shown for S. So, x SW z is impossible.

-   **x W z**: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    XZ2 and XZ3 match the y-conditions for W. For the x-condition, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). We derived XZ1: supx(z) <= infx(x). If x W z also holds, then supx(x) <= infx(z). For regions with positive horizontal extent, it is impossible to have supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) simultaneously, unless they are the same vertical line segment or point, which is not allowed for regions in REG. So, x W z is impossible.

-   **x NW z**: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is impossible as shown for W. So, x NW z is impossible.

-   **x N z**: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    The first condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), implies supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) (using XZ3), which means supy(x) <= infy(x). This is impossible for regions in REG. So, x N z is impossible.

-   **x NE z**: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    The first condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), matches XZ1, which we derived. The second condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), is impossible as shown for N. So, x NE z is impossible.

-   **x E z**: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    These are exactly the three conditions (XZ1, XZ2, XZ3) that we derived from the premises x B y and y E z.
    Since these conditions are necessary consequences of the premises, x E z must hold whenever x B y and y E z hold.
    We can construct an example: Let z be the unit disk centered at (0,0), y be a disk centered at (3,0) with radius 0.5, and x be a disk centered at (3,0) with radius 0.2. As shown in the thoughts, x B y and y E z hold, and x E z also holds.

-   **x SE z**: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    The first condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), matches XZ1. The second condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), is impossible as shown for S. So, x SE z is impossible.

Based on this analysis, for any regions x, y, z in REG such that x B y and y E z, the relation x E z must hold, and no other single-tile cardinal relation (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, SE) can hold between x and z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is E.

E

The final answer is $\boxed{E}$.
