PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the regions be x, y, and z.
We are given:
1.  x W y
2.  y B z

The definitions based on projection bounds are:
-   a W b: supx(a) <= infx(b) AND infy(b) <= infy(a) AND supy(a) <= supy(b)
-   a B b: infx(b) <= infx(a) AND supx(a) <= supx(b) AND infy(b) <= infy(a) AND supy(a) <= supy(b)

Applying these definitions to the given conditions:
From x W y:
(1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(2) infy(y) <= infy(x)
(3) supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y B z:
(4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(5) supx(y) <= supx(z)
(6) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(7) supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints on the projection bounds of x relative to z.

**Analysis of y-bounds (x vs z):**
Combine (6) and (2): infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x).
Combine (3) and (7): supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z).

These two inequalities, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), must hold for regions x and z.
Let's check which of the single-tile cardinal direction relations (a, b) implies these y-conditions for (x, z):
-   B(x,z): infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches the derived conditions.
-   S(x,z): supy(x) <= infy(z). This, combined with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), implies supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). For regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed disk), the y-projection is a non-degenerate interval, so infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z). If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < infy(x) cannot hold simultaneously unless supy(x) = infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(z), which means the y-projections are points. This is not possible for regions in REG. So, S is impossible.
-   SW(x,z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible for the same reason as S.
-   W(x,z): infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches the derived conditions.
-   NW(x,z): supy(z) <= infy(x). This, combined with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), implies infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). For REG regions, infy(z) < supy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x), then infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x). Also supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This requires supy(x) <= infy(x). Since infy(x) < supy(x) for REG regions, this is impossible unless supy(x) = infy(x) = supy(z) = infy(z), which is not possible for REG regions. So, NW is impossible.
-   N(x,z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible for the same reason as NW.
-   NE(x,z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible for the same reason as NW.
-   E(x,z): infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches the derived conditions.
-   SE(x,z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible for the same reason as S.

Based purely on the derived y-conditions, only B, W, and E are potentially possible relations between x and z.

**Analysis of x-bounds (x vs z):**
From (1): supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (4): infx(z) <= infx(y)
From (5): supx(y) <= supx(z)
For regions in REG, infx(y) < supx(y).

Combining (1), infx(y) < supx(y), and (5):
supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) < supx(z). (Technically supx(x) <= supx(z) is guaranteed, and strict inequality holds for REG).

Also, for region x, infx(x) < supx(x).
So, infx(x) < supx(x) < supx(z).
This implies infx(x) < supx(z) must always hold.

Now let's check the x-conditions for the potentially possible relations (B, W, E) based on the y-analysis:
-   W(x,z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Is this possible?
    From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), it is possible for supx(x) to be less than or equal to infx(z). For example, if infx(y) is much larger than both supx(x) and infx(z), and supx(x) <= infx(z). Let infx(z)=0, infx(y)=5, supx(x)=-1. Then supx(x) <= infx(z) (-1 <= 0) holds, and supx(x) <= infx(y) (-1 <= 5) holds, and infx(z) <= infx(y) (0 <= 5) holds. We've shown in thought process that a configuration exists where x W y, y B z, and x W z. So W is possible.

-   B(x,z): Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We already know supx(x) <= supx(z) must hold (strictly supx(x) < supx(z) for REG). So the second x-condition for B is always satisfied for REG regions.
    Is infx(z) <= infx(x) possible?
    We have infx(z) <= infx(y). There is no direct constraint on infx(x) relative to infx(y) or infx(z) from the premise x W y (only supx(x) is constrained relative to infx(y)). It is possible to choose regions such that infx(z) <= infx(x) holds. For example, let z = [0,10]x[0,10], y = [1,9]x[1,9]. For x W y, supx(x) <= 1. We need infx(z) <= infx(x), i.e., 0 <= infx(x). We can pick infx(x)=0.5 and supx(x)=0.8. This satisfies 0 <= 0.5 and 0.5 < 0.8 <= 1. We've shown in thought process that a configuration exists where x W y, y B z, and x B z. So B is possible.

-   E(x,z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x).
    We derived that infx(x) < supx(z) must always hold for regions in REG.
    infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
    This chain implies infx(x) < supx(z).
    Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. E is impossible.

The possible relations are those where the y-conditions match (B, W, E) AND the x-conditions are possible. We found W is possible and B is possible, but E is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are W and B.

W, B
