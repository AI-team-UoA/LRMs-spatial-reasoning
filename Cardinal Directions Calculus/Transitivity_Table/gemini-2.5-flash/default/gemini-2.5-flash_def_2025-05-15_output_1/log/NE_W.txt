PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let [infx(r), supx(r)] and [infy(r), supy(r)] denote the minimum bounding box of a region r on the x and y axes, respectively.
The given relations are defined based on these bounding boxes. Regions being homeomorphic to a closed unit disk implies their bounding boxes are non-degenerate rectangles, meaning inf < sup for both x and y bounds.

We are given:
1.  x NE y:
    -   supx(y) <= infx(x)
    -   supy(y) <= infy(x)

2.  y W z:
    -   supx(z) <= infx(y)
    -   infy(z) <= infy(y)
    -   supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's combine the inequalities:

From supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x). This means the right edge of z's bounding box is to the left of or touching the left edge of x's bounding box.

From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
Therefore, infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom edge of z's bounding box is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of x's bounding box.

Now let's check the definitions of the cardinal relations x R z (where 'a' in the definition is x and 'b' is z) based on the derived inequalities:

-   x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    From infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) >= infy(x) (for non-degenerate regions), we have supy(x) >= infy(x) >= infy(z). So supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible for non-degenerate regions. S is not possible.

-   x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    From supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) >= infx(x), we have supx(x) >= infx(x) >= supx(z). So supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for non-degenerate regions (requires x's right edge <= z's left edge, but z's right edge <= x's left edge). SW is not possible.

-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions. W is not possible.

-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions. NW is not possible.

-   x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible (we know infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(z) >= supy(y)).
    infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) means the horizontal interval of x is contained within the horizontal interval of z.
    However, we derived supx(z) <= infx(x). For a non-degenerate interval [infx(x), supx(x)] to be contained within [infx(z), supx(z)] (i.e., infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) while simultaneously supx(z) <= infx(x), requires infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z). This implies point regions, which are degenerate. N is not possible for non-degenerate regions.

-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is derived. Yes.
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible (e.g., supy(y)=3, supy(z)=4, infy(x)=5). Yes.
    NE is possible.

-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is derived. Yes.
    infy(z) <= infy(x) is derived. Yes.
    supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible (e.g., supy(y)=3, supy(z)=5, infy(x)=4, supy(x)=4.5). Yes.
    E is possible.

-   x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is derived. Yes.
    supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) for non-degenerate regions. SE is not possible.

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions (requires x's horizontal bbox contained in z's, while z's is to the left of x's). B is not possible.

Based on the bounding box definitions and assuming non-degenerate regions (as implied by homeomorphism to a closed unit disk), the only possible relations are NE and E.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, E}$.
