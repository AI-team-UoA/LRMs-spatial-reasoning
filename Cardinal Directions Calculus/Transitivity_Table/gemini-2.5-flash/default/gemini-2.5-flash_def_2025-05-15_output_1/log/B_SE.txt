PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The given information is:
1. x B y
2. y SE z

Let's write down the definitions of these relations in terms of the bounds of the bounding boxes:
1. x B y iff infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
2. y SE z iff supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's derive constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z from the given relations.

From supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x B y), we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x). (A)

From supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z), we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z). (B)

These two inequalities, supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), must hold for any regions x, y, z that satisfy the premises x B y and y SE z.

Now let's check which of the possible cardinal relations between x and z are compatible with these derived constraints (A) and (B). Recall that regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies that for any region r, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

Let's examine each possible relation for x relative to z:

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  - From (A), supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= supx(z) (required for B), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) < supx(x). So B is impossible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  - supy(x) <= infy(z) is true from (B).
  - supx(x) <= supx(z) is required for S. From (A), supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) < supx(x). So S is impossible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  - supy(x) <= infy(z) is true from (B).
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) is required for SW. From (A), supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) hold simultaneously, along with strict inequalities for widths (infx < supx), we get infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies infx(x) < infx(x), a contradiction. So SW is impossible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) is required for W. This is impossible, as shown for SW. So W is impossible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) is required for NW. This is impossible, as shown for SW. So NW is impossible.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  - supy(z) <= infy(x) is required for N. From (B), supy(x) <= infy(z). We also know infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x). This implies infy(x) < infy(x), a contradiction. So supy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible. Thus N is impossible.

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  - supx(z) <= infx(x) is true from (A).
  - supy(z) <= infy(x) is required for NE. This is impossible, as shown for N. So NE is impossible.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  - supx(z) <= infx(x) is true from (A).
  - supy(x) <= supy(z) is implied by (B) (supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) < supy(z) => supy(x) < supy(z)).
  - infy(z) <= infy(x) is required for E. From (B), supy(x) <= infy(z). We also know infy(x) < supy(x). If infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(x) < supy(x). So infy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible. Thus E is impossible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  - These are exactly the inequalities (A) and (B) that we derived from the premises. Since (A) and (B) must be true whenever x B y and y SE z are true for some y, the relation x SE z must necessarily hold between x and z.
  - This means x SE z is always a possible relation.

Since all other relations have been shown to be impossible based on the necessary consequences of the premises (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)) and the properties of regions in REG (positive width and height), only SE is a possible relation.

The final answer is $\boxed{SE}$.
