PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
We are given two relations:
1.  x N y (x is North of y)
2.  y B z (y is Bounding box of z)

Let's write these using the definitions of the bounding box bounds:
1.  x N y:
    *   supy(y) <= infy(x)
    *   infx(y) <= infx(x)
    *   supx(x) <= supx(y)

2.  y B z:
    *   infx(z) <= infx(y)
    *   supx(y) <= supx(z)
    *   infy(z) <= infy(y)
    *   supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's derive the relations between x and z by combining these inequalities.

**Horizontal Relation (x-axis):**
From (1): infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
From (2): infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)  =>  infx(z) <= infx(x)
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)  =>  supx(x) <= supx(z)

These two inequalities (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) describe a situation where the horizontal projection of x is contained within or aligns with the horizontal projection of z.

Let's examine the horizontal conditions for the single-tile relations for x relative to z:
*   W, NW, SW require supx(x) <= infx(z). From our findings, infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), so supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible for regions in REG (which have positive width).
*   E, NE, SE require supx(z) <= infx(x). From our findings, infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z), so supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG (which have positive width, and x's horizontal projection is contained in z's).

This means the only possible horizontal relationship is the containment/alignment captured by infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This horizontal property is shared by B, N, and S relations.

**Vertical Relation (y-axis):**
From (1): supy(y) <= infy(x)
From (2): infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x):
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) => infy(z) <= infy(x)

This means the bottom of x's bounding box is at or above the bottom of z's bounding box.

Let's examine the vertical conditions for the single-tile relations for x relative to z, considering infy(z) <= infy(x):
*   S, SW, SE require supy(x) <= infy(z). From our finding infy(z) <= infy(x), this would imply supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Since regions in REG have positive height, infy(x) < supy(x), so supy(x) <= infy(x) is impossible. Thus, S, SW, and SE are not possible.
*   N, NE, NW require supy(z) <= infy(x). Is this possible? Yes, it is possible for infy(x) to be greater than or equal to supy(z). For example, y could be near the bottom of z, and x could be far above y (and thus far above z).

Combining Horizontal and Vertical Findings:
The possible relations must have the horizontal property (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) and cannot be S, SW, SE, W, NW, E, NE.
The only remaining possibilities from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} are B and N.

Let's check if B and N are indeed possible.

*   **Is x B z possible?**
    x B z requires: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We have already derived the first three: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and infy(z) <= infy(x).
    We need to check if supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible.
    We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
    Consider the example: z = [0,10]x[0,10], y = [1,9]x[1,9]. y B z holds.
    Let x be a region N of y, specifically x = [1,9]x[9,10].
    Check x N y: supy(y)=9 <= infy(x)=9 (holds), infx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=1 (holds), supx(x)=9 <= supx(y)=9 (holds). x N y holds.
    Check x B z: infx(z)=0<=infx(x)=1 (holds), supx(x)=9<=supx(z)=10 (holds), infy(z)=0<=infy(x)=9 (holds), supy(x)=10<=supy(z)=10 (holds). x B z holds.
    So, B is a possible relation.

*   **Is x N z possible?**
    x N z requires: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We have already derived the last two: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
    We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
    Consider the example: z = [0,10]x[0,10], y = [1,9]x[1,9]. y B z holds.
    Let x be a region N of y, specifically x = [1,9]x[11,12].
    Check x N y: supy(y)=9 <= infy(x)=11 (holds), infx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=1 (holds), supx(x)=9 <= supx(y)=9 (holds). x N y holds.
    Check x N z: supy(z)=10 <= infy(x)=11 (holds), infx(z)=0<=infx(x)=1 (holds), supx(x)=9<=supx(z)=10 (holds). x N z holds.
    So, N is a possible relation.

Any other relation from the defined set would require horizontal separation or vertical separation (x below z), which we have shown are impossible given the initial conditions and the definition of regions in REG. While other spatial configurations are possible between x and z (e.g., horizontal containment with vertical overlap where x extends above z), they do not correspond to any single-tile relation in the defined set. Therefore, only B and N are the possible single-tile relations.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, B}$.
