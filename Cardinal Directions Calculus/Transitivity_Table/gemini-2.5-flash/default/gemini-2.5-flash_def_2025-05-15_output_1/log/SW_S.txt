PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given information is:
1.  x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) AND supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(y) AND supx(y) <= supx(z)
All regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their bounding box has positive width and height (i.e., infx < supx and infy < supy for any region).

Let's combine the inequalities:
From x SW y:
(1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(2) supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y S z:
(3) supy(y) <= infy(z)
(4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(5) supx(y) <= supx(z)

Also, for any region a in REG, we know infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Combining (2) and (3), using infy(y) < supy(y):
supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z)
Thus, we get:
(A) supy(x) < infy(z).
This implies the y-projection of x is strictly below the y-projection of z. This eliminates any relation where the y-intervals overlap or x's y-interval is above z's y-interval. The relations that require supy(x) <= infy(z) are S, SW, SE. The relations that require overlapping y-intervals (infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)) are W, E, B. As argued in the thought process, supy(x) < infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) for regions with positive height. The relations that require supy(z) <= infy(x) are N, NW, NE. supy(x) < infy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x).
So, only S, SW, SE are possible based on the y-axis relation.

Now consider the x-axis relations for S, SW, SE:
- S (x S z): requires infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z)
- SW (x SW z): requires supx(x) <= infx(z)
- SE (x SE z): requires supx(z) <= infx(x)

Let's see what we can derive about the x-bounds of x and z.
From (1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
From (5) supx(y) <= supx(z)
Also, infx(y) < supx(y).

Combining (1) and (5), using infx(y) < supx(y):
supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z)
Thus, we get:
(B) supx(x) < supx(z).
This confirms the second condition required for S.

Now let's check the remaining conditions for S, SW, SE using (1), (4), and (B).

For S (x S z), we need infx(z) <= infx(x).
From (4), infx(z) <= infx(y).
From (1), supx(x) <= infx(y).
It is possible for infx(z) <= infx(x) to hold given these conditions. For example, if infx(y) = 10, we can have infx(z) = 5 and infx(x) = 8. Both 5 <= 10 and 8 <= 10 are true, and 5 <= 8 is true.
Let's construct a valid example:
Let y = [10, 20] x [10, 20].
For x SW y, supx(x) <= 10 and supy(x) <= 10. Let x = [-10, -5] x [0, 5]. supx(x)=-5<=10, supy(x)=5<=10. x SW y holds.
For y S z, supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z). 20 <= infy(z), infx(z) <= 10, 20 <= supx(z).
Let z = [-20, 25] x [30, 40]. infy(z)=30>=20, infx(z)=-20<=10, supx(z)=25>=20. y S z holds.
Now check x S z for x=[-10,-5]x[0,5] and z=[-20,25]x[30,40]:
supy(x)=5 <= infy(z)=30 (True, actually 5 < 30).
infx(z)=-20 <= infx(x)=-10 (True).
supx(x)=-5 <= supx(z)=25 (True, consistent with (B)).
All conditions for S are met. S is possible.

For SW (x SW z), we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
From (1), supx(x) <= infx(y).
From (4), infx(z) <= infx(y).
It is possible for supx(x) <= infx(z) to hold given these conditions. For example, if infx(y) = 10, we can have supx(x) = 5 and infx(z) = 8. Both 5 <= 10 and 8 <= 10 are true, and 5 <= 8 is true.
Let's construct a valid example:
Let y = [10, 20] x [10, 20].
For x SW y, supx(x) <= 10 and supy(x) <= 10. Let x = [0, 5] x [0, 5]. supx(x)=5<=10, supy(x)=5<=10. x SW y holds.
For y S z, supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z). 20 <= infy(z), infx(z) <= 10, 20 <= supx(z).
Let z = [8, 25] x [30, 40]. infy(z)=30>=20, infx(z)=8<=10, supx(z)=25>=20. y S z holds.
Now check x SW z for x=[0,5]x[0,5] and z=[8,25]x[30,40]:
supy(x)=5 <= infy(z)=30 (True, actually 5 < 30).
supx(x)=5 <= infx(z)=8 (True).
All conditions for SW are met. SW is possible.

For SE (x SE z), we need supx(z) <= infx(x).
From (B), we know supx(x) < supx(z).
For any region in REG, infx(x) < supx(x).
Combining these, infx(x) < supx(x) < supx(z).
This directly contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x).
Thus, SE is not possible for regions in REG.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relations between region x and region z are S and SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW}$.
