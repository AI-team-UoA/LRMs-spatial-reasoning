PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. The given relations are:
1. x is NE of y (x NE y)
2. y is E of z (y E z)

From the definitions of these relations based on the minimum bounding box bounds:
x NE y means:
(NE.1) supx(y) <= infx(x)
(NE.2) supy(y) <= infy(x)

y E z means:
(E.1) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(E.2) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(E.3) supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations R between x and z (x R z) from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. These relations are also defined based on the bounds.

Let's combine the inequalities to derive constraints on the bounds of x relative to the bounds of z.

From (E.1) and (NE.1):
supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
Assuming regions in REG have non-zero width (infx < supx), we have infx(y) <= supx(y).
Chaining the inequalities: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
This implies supx(z) <= infx(x).
This is a necessary condition for x R z. Geometrically, it means the x-projection of x starts at or to the East of the point supx(z).

From (E.2), (E.3), and (NE.2):
infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z), and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Assuming regions in REG have non-zero height (infy < supy), we have infy(y) <= supy(y).
Chaining the inequalities: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies infy(z) <= infy(x).
This is another necessary condition for x R z. Geometrically, it means the y-projection of x starts at or above the point infy(z).

So, for any relation R between x and z to be possible, the bounding boxes of x and z must satisfy:
(C.1) infx(x) >= supx(z)
(C.2) infy(x) >= infy(z)

Now let's examine each possible relation R for x R z and check if it's compatible with these necessary conditions (C.1) and (C.2), considering that regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which allows for degenerate cases like a single point. Let z be a non-degenerate region as per condition iv) in the definition of cardinal direction relations which applies to "any reference region b".

- x B z: infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
  Requires infx(z)<=infx(x) and supx(x)<=supx(z). With (C.1) infx(x) >= supx(z), this implies infx(z)<=infx(x) and supx(x)<=supx(z)<=infx(x). This can only hold if infx(x)=supx(z) and supx(x)<=supx(z). For a non-degenerate region x (infx(x)<supx(x)), this is impossible. It is possible if x is a degenerate region, specifically a 0-width line or point located at x = supx(z), and contained vertically within z's bounds. Such a point region is in REG. Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [1,2]x[0,1], x = point (1, 0.5). x B z holds. This is possible.

- x S z: supy(x)<=infy(z), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(a)<=supx(b).
  Requires supy(x)<=infy(z). With (C.2) infy(x) >= infy(z), this implies supy(x)<=infy(z)<=infy(x). For a non-degenerate region x (infy(x)<supy(x)), this is impossible. It is possible if x is a degenerate point region (px, py) located at y = infy(z) (so py = infy(z)), and horizontally within z's bounds or on its East edge (due to C.1). Specifically, need infx(z)<=px<=supx(z) and px>=supx(z). This implies px=supx(z). Possible if x is the point (supx(z), infy(z)) (bottom-right corner of z's bounding box). Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [1,2]x[0,1], x = point (1, 0). x S z holds. This is possible.

- x SW z: supx(x)<=infx(z), supy(x)<=infy(z).
  Requires supx(x)<=infx(z) and supy(x)<=infy(z). With (C.1) infx(x)>=supx(z), this requires supx(x)<=infx(z)<supx(z)<=infx(x) (assuming non-degenerate z). This implies supx(x)<infx(x), impossible for non-degenerate x. If x is a point, px<=infx(z) and px>=supx(z), impossible for non-degenerate z. SW is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x)<=infx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(a)<=supy(b).
  Requires supx(x)<=infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW. W is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x)<=infx(z), supy(b)<=infy(a).
  Requires supx(x)<=infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW. NW is not possible.

- x N z: supy(z)<=infy(x), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(a)<=supx(b).
  Requires infx(z)<=infx(x) and supx(x)<=supx(z). With (C.1) infx(x)>=supx(z), this is only possible if x is a 0-width line or point located at x=supx(z) (as shown for B). Requires supy(z)<=infy(x) (compatible with C.2). Possible if x is a point (supx(z), py) with py >= supy(z). Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [1,2]x[0,1], x = point (1, 2). x N z holds. This is possible.

- x NE z: supx(z)<=infx(x), supy(z)<=infy(x).
  Compatible with (C.1) and (C.2). Can be satisfied for non-degenerate regions. Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [2,3]x[0,1], x = [4,5]x[2,3]. x NE y (3<=4, 1<=2), y E z (1<=2, 0<=0, 1<=1). x NE z (1<=4, 1<=2). NE is possible.

- x E z: supx(z)<=infx(x), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(a)<=supy(b).
  Compatible with (C.1) and (C.2) except for supy(a)<=supy(b) (supy(x)<=supy(z)). Can be satisfied for non-degenerate regions. Example: z = [0,5]x[0,10], y = [6,7]x[5,6], x = [8,9]x[7,9]. x NE y (7<=8, 6<=7), y E z (5<=6, 0<=5, 6<=10). x E z (5<=8, 0<=7, 9<=10). E is possible.

- x SE z: supx(z)<=infx(x), supy(x)<=infy(b).
  Requires supy(x)<=infy(z). Impossible for non-degenerate x as shown for S. Possible if x is a point (px, py) located at y=infy(z) (so py=infy(z)) and starting at or after supx(z) horizontally (px>=supx(z)). Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [1,2]x[0,1], x = point (2, 0). x SE z holds. This is possible.

Considering that regions can be degenerate points, the possible relations are B, S, N, NE, E, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, B}$.
