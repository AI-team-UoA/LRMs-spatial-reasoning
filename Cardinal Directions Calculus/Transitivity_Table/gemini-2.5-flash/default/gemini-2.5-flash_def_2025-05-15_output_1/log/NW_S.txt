PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are:
1. x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) AND supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(y) AND supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints on their bounding boxes:

From (1a): supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (1b): supy(y) <= infy(x)
From (2a): supy(y) <= infy(z)
From (2b): infx(z) <= infx(y)
From (2c): supx(y) <= supx(z)

Consider the x-coordinates of x and z: infx(x), supx(x), infx(z), supx(z).
From (1a) supx(x) <= infx(y).
From (2b) infx(z) <= infx(y).
From (2c) supx(y) <= supx(z).

Let's check if the relation x E z, x NE z, or x SE z is possible. These require supx(z) <= infx(x).
If supx(z) <= infx(x), then from (2c), supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). So supx(y) <= infx(x).
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
For regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, the projection on an axis is a closed interval [inf, sup] where inf < sup (non-degenerate).
If supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), for non-degenerate intervals, this can only be satisfied if the intervals [infx(x), supx(x)] and [infx(y), supx(y)] are disjoint and x is to the left of y (supx(x) < infx(y)) and y is to the left of x (supx(y) < infx(x)). This is a contradiction. The only way the inequalities hold without strict inequality for non-degenerate intervals is if infx(x)=supx(x) and infx(y)=supx(y), meaning they are points, which is not the case for regions in REG.
Thus, the assumption supx(z) <= infx(x) leads to a contradiction for regions in REG.
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible.
This rules out the relations E, NE, and SE between x and z.

The remaining possible relations are N, S, B, NW, W, SW. We need to check if each of these is possible by finding a configuration of regions x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions (x NW y and y S z) and the relation being tested.

- N (x N z): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[2,3]x[5,6], y=[4,5]x[3,4], z=[1,6]x[4.5, 4.8].

- S (x S z): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[2,3]x[3,4], y=[4,5]x[1,2], z=[1,6]x[5,6].

- B (x B z): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[2,3]x[3,4], y=[4,5]x[1,2], z=[1,6]x[3,5].

- NW (x NW z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  Possible. Example: x=[1,2]x[5,6], y=[3,4]x[3,4], z=[3,5]x[4.5, 4.8].

- W (x W z): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[1,2]x[3,4], y=[3,4]x[1,2], z=[3,5]x[3,5].

- SW (x SW z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[1,2]x[3,4], y=[3,4]x[1,2], z=[3,5]x[5,6].

All relations N, S, B, NW, W, SW are possible. E, NE, SE are not possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, B, NW, W, SW.

N, S, NW, W, SW, B
