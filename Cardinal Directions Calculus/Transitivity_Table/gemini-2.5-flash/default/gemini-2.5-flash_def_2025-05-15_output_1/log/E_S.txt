PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `r` be denoted by `[infx(r), supx(r)] x [infy(r), supy(r)]`.

Given:
1.  `x E y`: `supx(y) <= infx(x)`, `infy(y) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(y)`
2.  `y S z`: `supy(y) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, `supx(y) <= supx(z)`

We want to find possible relations between `x` and `z`. Let's combine the inequalities:

From `x E y` and `y S z` (vertical constraints):
`supy(x) <= supy(y)` and `supy(y) <= infy(z)`
This implies `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
This inequality means the upper bound of `x`'s y-projection is less than or equal to the lower bound of `z`'s y-projection. In other words, region `x` is vertically below or touching the lower edge of region `z`.

Let's look at the definitions of the single-tile relations for `a R b` when `a=x` and `b=z`:
*   N, NE, NW require `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This contradicts `supy(x) <= infy(z)` for non-degenerate regions. So N, NE, NW are impossible.
*   W, E, B require vertical overlap (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`). For `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and vertical overlap to hold for regions in REG (which have positive vertical extent), we would need `supy(x) = infy(z)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. This implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`, which means the region x has zero vertical extent, contradicting the definition of REG regions. So W, E, B are impossible.

The only remaining possible relations are S, SW, and SE, which all require `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (or `supy(a) <= infy(b)`). We have already established this condition. Now let's check the horizontal constraints for S, SW, SE based on the given information.

From `x E y` and `y S z` (horizontal constraints):
`supx(y) <= infx(x)`
`infx(z) <= infx(y)`
`supx(y) <= supx(z)`

Also, for any region `r` in REG, `infx(r) < supx(r)` and `infy(r) < supy(r)`.
So, `infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)`. This chain implies `infx(z) <= infx(x)`.

Let's check S, SW, and SE for `x R z`:
*   `x S z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (satisfied), `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (satisfied by derivation), and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    *   Is `supx(x) <= supx(z)` always true? No.
    *   Is `x S z` possible? Yes. Consider y = [0,1]x[0,1], x = [2,3]x[0.5,0.6], z = [-2,4]x[2,3].
        *   `x E y`: `supx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (ok), `infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0.5` (ok), `supy(x)=0.6 <= supy(y)=1` (ok).
        *   `y S z`: `supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=2` (ok), `infx(z)=-2 <= infx(y)=0` (ok), `supx(y)=1 <= supx(z)=4` (ok).
        *   `x S z`: `supy(x)=0.6 <= infy(z)=2` (ok), `infx(z)=-2 <= infx(x)=2` (ok), `supx(x)=3 <= supx(z)=4` (ok).
        *   So, S is a possible relation.

*   `x SW z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (satisfied) and `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
    *   Is `supx(x) <= infx(z)` possible? We have `infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)`. This chain implies `infx(z) < supx(x)` (since regions have positive width). Thus, `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
    *   So, SW is not a possible relation.

*   `x SE z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (satisfied) and `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
    *   Is `supx(z) <= infx(x)` possible? Yes.
    *   Is `x SE z` possible? Yes. Consider y = [0,1]x[0,1], x = [2,3]x[0.5,0.6], z = [-1,1.5]x[2,3].
        *   `x E y`: `supx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (ok), `infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0.5` (ok), `supy(x)=0.6 <= supy(y)=1` (ok).
        *   `y S z`: `supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=2` (ok), `infx(z)=-1 <= infx(y)=0` (ok), `supx(y)=1 <= supx(z)=1.5` (ok).
        *   `x SE z`: `supy(x)=0.6 <= infy(z)=2` (ok), `supx(z)=1.5 <= infx(x)=2` (ok).
        *   So, SE is a possible relation.

Based on the analysis, the only possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S and SE.
