PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let x NE y and y NW z. The definitions of these cardinal relations based on the minimum bounding boxes (BB) are as follows:

x NE y:
supx(y) <= infx(x)  (The East boundary of BB(y) is less than or equal to the West boundary of BB(x))
supy(y) <= infy(x)  (The North boundary of BB(y) is less than or equal to the South boundary of BB(x))

y NW z:
supx(z) <= infx(y)  (The East boundary of BB(z) is less than or equal to the West boundary of BB(y))
supy(z) <= infy(y)  (The North boundary of BB(z) is less than or equal to the South boundary of BB(y))

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they have positive area. Therefore, their bounding boxes must have positive width and height.
infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

Combining the inequalities:
From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y NW z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
We also know infx(y) < supx(y).
So, supx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x).
This chain of inequalities implies supx(z) < infx(x).

Similarly, combining the vertical inequalities:
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y NW z, we have supy(z) <= infy(y).
We also know infy(y) < supy(y).
So, supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
This chain of inequalities implies supy(z) < infy(x).

Thus, for any regions x, y, z from REG satisfying x NE y and y NW z, the bounding boxes of x and z must satisfy the strict inequalities:
1) supx(z) < infx(x)
2) supy(z) < infy(x)

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible cardinal relations R between x and z (x R z) and check which ones are compatible with these necessary strict inequalities.

x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) (compatible with supy(z) < infy(x)).
   Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   If supx(x) <= supx(z) holds, combined with supx(z) < infx(x), we get supx(x) < infx(x). This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x) for regions in REG. Thus, x N z is impossible.

x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both are compatible with the necessary strict inequalities supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(z) < infy(x). This relation is possible (e.g., BB(y)=[0,1]x[0,1], BB(x)=[2,3]x[2,3], BB(z)=[-2,-1]x[-2,-1] satisfies x NE y, y NW z and x NE z).

x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (compatible).
   Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   If supy(x) <= supy(z) holds, combined with supy(z) < infy(x), we get supy(x) < infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) for regions in REG. Thus, x E z is impossible.

x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (compatible).
   Requires supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We have supy(z) < infy(x). Can supy(x) <= infy(z) hold? Let's try to construct y.
   We need to find infx(y), supx(y), infy(y), supy(y) such that:
   supx(y) <= infx(x), supy(y) <= infy(x) (for x NE y)
   supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(z) <= infy(y) (for y NW z)
   And supy(x) <= infy(z) (for x SE z).
   We need infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) < infy(x), which we already know.
   We also need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Can we find y such that supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)?
   Let's check the vertical constraints on y: infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies the interval [infy(y), supy(y)] must be within [supy(z), infy(x)]. Since infy(y) < supy(y), this interval must have positive length. So supy(z) < infy(x).
   If supy(x) <= infy(z), then the interval [supy(z), infy(x)] contains the interval [supy(z), infy(z)], which contains supy(x).
   We need to be able to place BB(y) vertically such that infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
   Consider the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). We also have infy(z) < supy(z) (if z is in REG). This implies supy(x) < supy(z).
   But we know infy(x) > supy(z).
   Can supy(x) <= infy(z) hold? Example: BB(x)=[..]x[5,6], BB(z)=[..]x[0,1]. supy(x)=6, infy(z)=0. No.
   Example: BB(x)=[..]x[0,1], BB(z)=[..]x[2,3]. supy(x)=1, infy(z)=2. Yes.
   Let BB(x) = [2, 3]x[0, 1], BB(z) = [0, 1]x[2, 3]. x SE z holds (supx(z)=1<=infx(x)=2, supy(x)=1<=infy(z)=2).
   x NE y requires supx(y) <= 2, supy(y) <= 0.
   y NW z requires supx(z)=1 <= infx(y), supy(z)=3 <= infy(y).
   So we need supy(y) <= 0 and infy(y) >= 3. This implies 3 <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= 0, so 3 <= 0, impossible. Thus, x SE z is impossible.

x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible as shown for SE.
   Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Impossible as shown for N.
   Thus, x S z is impossible.

x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible as shown for SE.
   Requires supx(x) <= infx(z).
   Let's try to construct y. We need infx(y) >= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
   We also need supx(x) <= infx(z).
   Can supx(x) <= infx(z) hold when infx(x) > supx(z)? Yes. Example: BB(x)=[0,1]x[..], BB(z)=[2,3]x[..]. supx(x)=1, infx(z)=2. Yes.
   Let BB(x) = [0, 1]x[1, 2], BB(z) = [2, 3]x[2, 3]. x SW z holds (supx(x)=1<=infx(z)=2, supy(x)=2<=infy(z)=2).
   x NE y requires supx(y) <= 0, supy(y) <= 1.
   y NW z requires supx(z)=3 <= infx(y), supy(z)=2 <= infy(y).
   So we need supx(y) <= 0 and infx(y) >= 3. This implies 3 <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= 0, so 3 <= 0, impossible. Thus, x SW z is impossible.

x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW.
   Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). Impossible as shown for E.
   Thus, x W z is impossible.

x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW.
   Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) (compatible).
   Thus, x NW z is impossible.

x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Impossible as shown for N.
   Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). Impossible as shown for E.
   Thus, x B z is impossible.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
