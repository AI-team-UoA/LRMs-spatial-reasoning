PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let `infx(a)`, `supx(a)`, `infy(a)`, and `supy(a)` denote the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of the projection of region `a` on the x and y axes, respectively.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are 2D regions with positive area. Thus, for any region `a` in REG, we have `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

We are given two relations:
1.  `x W y`: `supx(x) <= infx(y)`, `infy(y) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(y)`
2.  `y SW z`: `supx(y) <= infx(z)`, `supy(y) <= infy(z)`

We want to find the possible relations between `x` and `z`. Let's derive constraints on the bounding boxes of `x` and `z`.

From (1) and the property of bounding boxes (`infx(y) < supx(y)`):
`supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y)`

From (2):
`supx(y) <= infx(z)`

Combining these inequalities:
`supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z)`
This implies `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. (Constraint C1)

From (1):
`supy(x) <= supy(y)`

From (2):
`supy(y) <= infy(z)`

Combining these inequalities:
`supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)`
This implies `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. (Constraint C2)

Constraints C1 (`supx(x) <= infx(z)`) and C2 (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`) are necessary conditions for any relationship between `x` and `z` derived from the premises.

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible cardinal relations between `x` and `z` and see which ones are consistent with C1, C2, and the non-degenerate nature of the regions.

-   **x S z**: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (matches C2).
    Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1 (`supx(x) <= infx(z)`), this gives `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x)`. Since `infx(x) < supx(x)` for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. S is not possible.

-   **x SW z**: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    These are exactly C1 and C2. Since we derived C1 and C2 from the premises, x SW z is a possible relation. We can construct examples where this holds (e.g., x=[0,1]x[0,1], y=[2,3]x[-1,2], z=[4,5]x[2,3]).

-   **x W z**: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (matches C1).
    Requires `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. Together with C2 (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`), this gives `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x)`. Since `infy(x) < supy(x)` for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. W is not possible.

-   **x NW z**: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (matches C1).
    Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. We know from the premises that `supy(y) <= infy(z)` and `infy(y) <= infy(x)`. So `infy(z) >= supy(y)`. For NW to hold, we need `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Since `infy(z) < supy(z)`, this would imply `infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Combined with `infy(z) >= supy(y)` and `supy(y) >= supy(x)`, this implies `infy(z) >= supy(x)`. So we would need `supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Since `infy(x) < supy(x)`, this is impossible. NW is not possible.

-   **x SE z**: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (matches C2).
    Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1 (`supx(x) <= infx(z)`), this gives `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Since `infx(x) < supx(x)` for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. SE is not possible.

-   **x NE z**: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(z) <= infy(a)` (assuming typo corrected to `infy(x)`).
    Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1, this requires horizontal degeneracy. Not possible.
    Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. As shown for NW, this is not possible given C2 and non-degeneracy. NE is not possible.

-   **x N z**: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Not possible (as shown for NW).
    Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1, requires horizontal degeneracy. Not possible. N is not possible.

-   **x E z**: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1, requires horizontal degeneracy. Not possible.
    Requires `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. Together with C2, requires vertical degeneracy. Not possible. E is not possible.

-   **x B z**: `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1, requires horizontal degeneracy. Not possible.
    Requires `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. Together with C2, requires vertical degeneracy. Not possible. B is not possible.

Based on the definitions provided and the constraint that regions are non-degenerate (homeomorphic to a disk), the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW}$.
