PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let BB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of region a, given by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

The premises are:
1. x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)

From the definitions and the non-degenerate property of regions:
infx(a) < supx(a) for a in REG
infy(a) < supy(a) for a in REG

Let's derive the necessary relations between the bounding boxes of x and z.

Y-axis relations:
From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
From y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y).
Combining these: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This implies supy(z) <= infy(x). (z's top is at or below x's bottom)
Also, infy(y) <= infy(x) implies infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) (since x is non-degenerate).
Combining this with supy(z) <= infy(y): supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This implies supy(z) < supy(x). (z's top is strictly below x's top)
What about infy(z) vs infy(x)?
We have infy(z) < supy(z) (since z is non-degenerate).
So, infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) <= infy(x). (z's bottom is at or below x's bottom)

Necessary Y-axis constraints between x and z:
(Y1) supy(z) <= infy(x)
(Y2) supy(z) < supy(x)
(Y3) infy(z) <= infy(x)

X-axis relations:
From x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y).
From y N z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
Also, infx(y) < supx(y) (since y is non-degenerate).

Combining: supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) < supx(z). (x's right edge is strictly left of z's right edge)

Necessary X-axis constraint between x and z:
(X1) supx(x) < supx(z)

Let's check which single-tile relations are possible given these necessary constraints. We need to evaluate the conditions for a R z for each R in {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}:

- S (a S b): supy(a) <= infy(b) and infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts (Y2) supy(z) < supy(x) and the fact that infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) > supy(z) >= infy(z). Impossible.
- SW (a SW b): supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b). Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible (same as S).
- SE (a SE b): supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b). Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible (same as S).

So, S, SW, SE are impossible. The remaining possible relations require supy(z) <= infy(x), which is (Y1) and is always true.

- B (a B b): infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b).
Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts (Y2) supy(z) < supy(x). Impossible.

- W (a W b): supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b).
Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts (Y2) supy(z) < supy(x). Impossible.

- E (a E b): supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b).
Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts (Y2) supy(z) < supy(x). Impossible.

- NE (a NE b): supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). However, from the x-axis relations, we have infx(x) < supx(x) < supx(z). This implies infx(x) < supx(z). Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. Impossible.

The only remaining possibilities are N and NW. Let's check if their conditions are compatible with our necessary constraints and if examples can be constructed.

- N (a N b): supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b).
For x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x) (Y1 - Yes), infx(z) <= infx(x) (Possible - no fixed relation), supx(x) <= supx(z) (X1 - Yes, strict inequality implies less than or equal to).
This relation is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible, which it is. Example: BB(y) = [10, 15]x[10, 15], BB(x) = [8, 9]x[12, 14], BB(z) = [7, 16]x[5, 8].

- NW (a NW b): supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
For x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (Possible - no fixed relation between supx(x) and infx(z)), supy(z) <= infy(x) (Y1 - Yes).
This relation is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible, which it is. Example: BB(y) = [10, 15]x[10, 15], BB(x) = [8, 9]x[12, 14], BB(z) = [10, 16]x[5, 8]. No, this example does not work.
Example for NW: Let BB(y) = [10, 15] x [10, 20].
x W y: supx(x) <= 10, infy(x) >= 10, supy(x) <= 20. Let BB(x) = [5, 8] x [12, 18]. (8<=10, 12>=10, 18<=20. Ok)
y N z: supy(z) <= 10, infx(z) <= 10, supx(y)=15 <= supx(z). Let BB(z) = [10, 20] x [0, 8]. (8<=10, 10<=10, 15<=20. Ok)
Compare x and z: BB(x)=[5, 8]x[12, 18], BB(z)=[10, 20]x[0, 8].
supy(z)=8, infy(x)=12. supy(z) <= infy(x) (8 <= 12 Yes).
supx(x)=8, infx(z)=10. supx(x) <= infx(z) (8 <= 10 Yes).
NW is possible.

The possible relations are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
