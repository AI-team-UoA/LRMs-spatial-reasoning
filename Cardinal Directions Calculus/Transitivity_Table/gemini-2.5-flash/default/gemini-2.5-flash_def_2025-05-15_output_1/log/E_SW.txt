PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions provided:
- x E y means: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y SW z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z)

From x E y, we have:
1) supx(y) <= infx(x)
2) infy(y) <= infy(x)
3) supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y SW z, we have:
4) supx(y) <= infx(z)
5) supy(y) <= infy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's look at the bounds of x and z.
From (3) and (5), we can chain the inequalities for the y-bounds:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
This gives us supy(x) <= infy(z).
This inequality implies that the top of the bounding box of x is below or aligned with the bottom of the bounding box of z. This rules out any relation where x overlaps z vertically or is above z.

Let's examine the definitions of the possible cardinal directions (a relation between region a and region b is checked):
- S: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b). The y-condition supy(a) <= infy(b) matches our derived supy(x) <= infy(z).
- SW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b). The y-condition supy(a) <= infy(b) matches our derived supy(x) <= infy(z).
- SE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b). The y-condition supy(a) <= infy(b) matches our derived supy(x) <= infy(z).
- N: supy(b) <= infy(a). This requires infy(z) <= infy(x), which would contradict supy(x) <= infy(z) unless the regions have zero height (supy=infy), which is not the case for regions homeomorphic to a disk. N is not possible.
- NE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a). Same y-problem as N. Not possible.
- NW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a). Same y-problem as N. Not possible.
- E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b). Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which is impossible for regions with non-zero height. E is not possible.
- W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b). Same y-problem as E. Not possible.
- B: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b). Same y-problem as E. Not possible.

So, only S, SW, and SE are possible based on the derived y-relation. We now need to check if all three are actually achievable.

Case 1: Can x SW z be possible?
x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We already know supy(x) <= infy(z) must hold. Can supx(x) <= infx(z) also hold?
Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[2,3]x[0,1], z=[3,4]x[2,3].
x E y: supx(y)=1<=infx(x)=2, infy(y)=0<=infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1<=supy(y)=1. (True)
y SW z: supx(y)=1<=infx(z)=3, supy(y)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
x SW z: supx(x)=3<=infx(z)=3, supy(x)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
So SW is possible.

Case 2: Can x S z be possible?
x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) must hold. Can infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) also hold?
Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[2,3]x[0,1], z=[2,4]x[2,3].
x E y: supx(y)=1<=infx(x)=2, infy(y)=0<=infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1<=supy(y)=1. (True)
y SW z: supx(y)=1<=infx(z)=2, supy(y)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
x S z: supy(x)=1<=infy(z)=2, infx(z)=2<=infx(x)=2, supx(x)=3<=supx(z)=4. (True)
So S is possible.

Case 3: Can x SE z be possible?
x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) must hold. Can supx(z) <= infx(x) also hold?
Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[4,5]x[0,1], z=[2,3]x[2,3].
x E y: supx(y)=1<=infx(x)=4, infy(y)=0<=infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1<=supy(y)=1. (True)
y SW z: supx(y)=1<=infx(z)=2, supy(y)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
x SE z: supx(z)=3<=infx(x)=4, supy(x)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
So SE is possible.

All three relations S, SW, and SE are possible outcomes for the relation between region x and region z.

S, SW, SE
