PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let MBB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by the intervals [infx(a), supx(a)] and [infy(a), supy(a)].
The given conditions are:
1. x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these inequalities, we can derive necessary conditions for the relation between x and z.

Horizontal relations (x-axis):
From supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y), and since infx(y) <= supx(y) for any non-degenerate region y, we have:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
This implies supx(z) <= infx(x).

Vertical relations (y-axis):
From infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y), we have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
This implies infy(z) <= infy(x).

From supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y), we have:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
This implies supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, any possible relation between x and z must satisfy these three conditions for their minimum bounding boxes:
(1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(2) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, let's examine which of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with these three necessary conditions. The regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk, which means infx < supx and infy < supy for any region.

The possible relations are {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. Let's check each one based on its definition relating 'a' and 'b' and our derived necessary conditions for x (as 'a') and z (as 'b').

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Combined with (1) supx(z) <= infx(x), this implies supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) < supx(x) for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. B is not possible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Impossible as shown for B. S is not possible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Combined with (1) supx(z) <= infx(x), this implies supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(z) < supx(z), this leads to a contradiction unless all bounds are equal (point regions), which is not allowed. SW is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW. W is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW. NW is not possible.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Impossible as shown for B. N is not possible.

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  Horizontal condition supx(z) <= infx(x) matches (1).
  Vertical condition supy(z) <= infy(x). From our necessary conditions, we have supy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(z) <= infy(x) also holds, then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Since infy(x) < supy(x) for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. NE is not possible.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  These three conditions are exactly the necessary conditions (1), (2), and (3) that we derived.
  We need to check if an example exists where x E y and y E z hold, and x E z also holds.
  Let MBB(z) = [0,1] x [0,1]. Let MBB(y) = [2,3] x [0,1]. Let MBB(x) = [4,5] x [0,1].
  Check y E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=0 (ok). supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (ok). y E z holds for these bounding boxes.
  Check x E y: supx(y)=3 <= infx(x)=4 (ok). infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (ok). supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (ok). x E y holds for these bounding boxes.
  Check x E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=4 (ok). infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (ok). supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (ok). x E z holds for these bounding boxes.
  Since regions exist (e.g., squares which are homeomorphic to a disk) with these bounding boxes, E is a possible relation.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Horizontal condition supx(z) <= infx(x) matches (1).
  Vertical condition supy(x) <= infy(z). From our necessary conditions, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supy(x) <= infy(z) also holds, then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Since infy(x) < supy(x) for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. SE is not possible.

Based on the analysis, only the E relation is consistent with the necessary conditions derived from x E y and y E z, and we provided an example showing that E is indeed possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{E}$.
