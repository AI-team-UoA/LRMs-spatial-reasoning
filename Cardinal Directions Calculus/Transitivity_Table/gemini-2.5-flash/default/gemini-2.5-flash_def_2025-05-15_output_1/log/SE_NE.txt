PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region $r$ be defined by the intervals $[infx(r), supx(r)]$ on the x-axis and $[infy(r), supy(r)]$ on the y-axis. Regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, implying $infx(r) < supx(r)$ and $infy(r) < supy(r)$ for any region $r$.

We are given the following relations:
1. `x SE y`: By definition, $supx(y) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(y)$.
2. `y NE z`: By definition, $supx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.

Let's analyze the constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

From the x-coordinates:
We have $supx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
Since $y$ is a region homeomorphic to a disk, its x-projection has non-zero width, so $infx(y) < supx(y)$.
Combining the inequalities, we get:
$supx(z) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
This implies $supx(z) < infx(x)$.
If we allow boundaries to touch, the relation is $supx(z) \le infx(x)$.

This inequality, $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, means that the right edge of the bounding box of z is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of x. This geometric configuration corresponds to relations where the first region is East of the second region.

Let's examine the definitions of the cardinal relations between `x` and `z` based on this finding:
- `x S z`: Requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (overlap in x-projection). $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ contradicts $infx(x) \le supx(z)$ unless $infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z)$, which is not possible for regions with positive area. So, S is not possible.
- `x SW z`: Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. This contradicts $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ unless $infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z)$, which is not possible. So, SW is not possible.
- `x W z`: Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. Not possible for the same reason as SW.
- `x NW z`: Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. Not possible for the same reason as SW.
- `x N z`: Requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (overlap in x-projection). Not possible for the same reason as S.
- `x B z`: Requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (overlap in x-projection, containment). Not possible for the same reason as S.

The only relations that can satisfy $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ are those where x is located to the East of z (or touching). These are:
- `x E z`: Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
- `x NE z`: Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
- `x SE z`: Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.

Since $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ is always true given the premises, we only need to check if the conditions on the y-coordinates are possible for each of E, NE, and SE.

From the y-coordinates:
We have $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.
This means both the top edge of x and the top edge of z are below or aligned with the bottom edge of y. This does not impose a strict ordering between the y-intervals of x and z.

Let's check if we can construct scenarios that satisfy the y-conditions for E, NE, and SE:

- For `x E z`: We need $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ AND $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
  Let $infy(y) = 100$. $supy(x) \le 100$, $supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(x) = 50$, $supy(x) = 60$. (Condition $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ holds: $60 \le 100$).
  We need $infy(z) \le 50$ and $60 \le supy(z)$. Also $infy(z) < supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(z) = 40$, $supy(z) = 70$. (Condition $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ holds: $70 \le 100$).
  $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ ($40 \le 50$) holds. $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ ($60 \le 70$) holds.
  This configuration is possible for the y-coordinates. Since the x-condition ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) is always true, `x E z` is possible.

- For `x NE z`: We need $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
  Let $infy(y) = 100$. $supy(x) \le 100$, $supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(x) = 60$, $supy(x) = 70$. (Condition $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ holds: $70 \le 100$).
  We need $supy(z) \le 60$. Also $infy(z) < supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(z) = 40$, $supy(z) = 50$. (Condition $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ holds: $50 \le 100$).
  $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ ($50 \le 60$) holds.
  This configuration is possible for the y-coordinates. `x NE z` is possible.

- For `x SE z`: We need $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
  Let $infy(y) = 100$. $supy(x) \le 100$, $supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(x) = 40$, $supy(x) = 50$. (Condition $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ holds: $50 \le 100$).
  We need $50 \le infy(z)$. Also $infy(z) < supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(z) = 60$, $supy(z) = 70$. (Condition $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ holds: $70 \le 100$).
  $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ ($50 \le 60$) holds.
  This configuration is possible for the y-coordinates. `x SE z` is possible.

Since E, NE, and SE are the only relations consistent with the x-coordinate constraint ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$), and we have shown that the y-coordinate constraints for E, NE, and SE are all possible given the initial conditions, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

The possible relations are E, NE, SE.

E, NE, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, NE, SE}$.
