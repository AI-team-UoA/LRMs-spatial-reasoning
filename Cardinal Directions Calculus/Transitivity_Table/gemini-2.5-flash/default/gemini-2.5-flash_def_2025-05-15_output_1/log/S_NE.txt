PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by `B(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
We are given the relations:
1. Region `x` is S of region `y`:
   - `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
   - `infx(y) <= infx(x)`
   - `supx(x) <= supx(y)`

2. Region `y` is NE of region `z`:
   - `supx(z) <= infx(y)`
   - `supy(z) <= infy(y)`

We want to find the possible relations between region `x` and region `z`. We need to compare the bounding box coordinates of `x` and `z`.

Let's combine the given inequalities:
From (1) and (2), we have:
- `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
- `supy(z) <= infy(y)`

This tells us that both `x` and `z` are located entirely below or touching the lower boundary of `y`'s y-projection.

Now let's look at the x-coordinates:
- `infx(y) <= infx(x)` (from x S y)
- `supx(z) <= infx(y)` (from y NE z)

Combining these two inequalities, we get:
`supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)`
So, `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.

This inequality means the maximum x-coordinate of `z` is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of `x`. In terms of cardinal directions, this implies that region `z` is located to the West of region `x`, or they are touching at their boundaries (the right boundary of `z` touching the left boundary of `x`).

Now let's consider the possible relationships between the y-projections of `x` and `z`, given that `supy(x) <= infy(y)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`. Let `infy(y)` be some value Y_min. Then `supy(x) <= Y_min` and `supy(z) <= Y_min`.
There are three main possibilities for the relative position of the y-intervals `[infy(x), supy(x)]` and `[infy(z), supy(z)]`:

Possibility A: Region `x` is below or touching the lower boundary of region `z`.
This corresponds to `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
Is this possible given the constraints? Yes. For example, let `infy(y)=10`. We can choose `supy(x)=5`, `infy(x)=2` (satisfies `supy(x) <= 10`) and `supy(z)=8`, `infy(z)=6` (satisfies `supy(z) <= 10`). Here, `supy(x) = 5` and `infy(z) = 6`, so `supy(x) <= infy(z)` holds.

Possibility B: Region `x` overlaps with region `z` in the y-dimension.
This corresponds to `infy(z) <= supy(x)` and `infy(x) <= supy(z)` (and neither contains the other, but the definition of E handles overlap/containment).
Is this possible given the constraints? Yes. For example, let `infy(y)=10`. We can choose `infy(x)=3`, `supy(x)=7` (satisfies `supy(x) <= 10`) and `infy(z)=4`, `supy(z)=8` (satisfies `supy(z) <= 10`). Here, `infy(z)=4 <= supy(x)=7` and `infy(x)=3 <= supy(z)=8`. The y-intervals [3, 7] and [4, 8] overlap.

Possibility C: Region `x` is above or touching the upper boundary of region `z`.
This corresponds to `infy(x) >= supy(z)`.
Is this possible given the constraints? Yes. For example, let `infy(y)=10`. We can choose `infy(x)=6`, `supy(x)=8` (satisfies `supy(x) <= 10`) and `infy(z)=2`, `supy(z)=4` (satisfies `supy(z) <= 10`). Here, `infy(x) = 6` and `supy(z) = 4`, so `infy(x) >= supy(z)` holds.

Now we combine the x-constraint (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`) with the possible y-relations between `x` and `z`. The condition `supx(z) <= infx(x)` means that `x` is located to the East of `z` or touching its western boundary.

Let's check the definitions of the possible cardinal relations for `a = x` and `b = z`:
- `x W z`, `x NW z`, `x SW z`: These require `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. This contradicts `supx(z) <= infx(x)` unless `supx(x)=infx(z)` and `supx(z)=infx(x)`, which is impossible for non-degenerate regions (inf < sup). Thus, W, NW, SW are not possible.
- `x N z`, `x S z`, `x B z`: These require `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. From our derivation `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. If `supx(x) <= supx(z)` also holds, then `supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x)`. For non-degenerate regions, this implies `supx(x) = infx(x)`, which is a point, contradicting the definition of regions being homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (which have non-zero area and thus inf < sup). Thus, N, S, B are not possible.

The only remaining possibilities for x relative to z are E, NE, SE, which are consistent with the derived x-constraint `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.

Now let's match these with the y-possibilities:
- If `x` is above `z` in y-projection (Possibility C: `infy(x) >= supy(z)`) AND `x` is East of `z` in x-projection (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`), this corresponds to the **NE** relation (`a NE b` iff `supx(b) <= infx(a)` and `supy(b) <= infy(a)`). We showed this is possible.
- If `x` overlaps with `z` in y-projection (Possibility B: `infy(z) <= supy(x)` and `infy(x) <= supy(z)`) AND `x` is East of `z` in x-projection (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`), this corresponds to the **E** relation (`a E b` iff `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)` and `supy(a) <= supy(b)`). We showed this is possible.
- If `x` is below `z` in y-projection (Possibility A: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`) AND `x` is East of `z` in x-projection (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`), this corresponds to the **SE** relation (`a SE b` iff `supx(b) <= infx(a)` and `supy(a) <= infy(z)`). We showed this is possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region `x` and region `z` are NE, E, and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, E, SE}$.
