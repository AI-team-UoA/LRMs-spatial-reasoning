PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The given relations are:
1.  `x SE y`: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
2.  `y N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(y)`, `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, and `supx(y) <= supx(z)`

Let's analyze the possible bounding box relations between x and z based on these inequalities.

From `x SE y`, x is horizontally to the East of or aligned with the East boundary of y. `infx(x) >= supx(y)`.
From `y N z`, y is horizontally overlapping or to the East of z on the left side (`infx(z) <= infx(y)`) and overlapping or to the West of z on the right side (`supx(y) <= supx(z)`).

Combining these, we have the horizontal inequalities:
`infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`
`supx(y) <= supx(z)`
`supx(y) <= infx(x)`

From `infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`, we deduce `infx(z) <= infx(x)`. This means the west boundary of x is never to the west of the west boundary of z.

Consider the horizontal relation `x W z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
If this holds, then `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(y)`. So `supx(x) <= infx(y)`.
Also, from `x SE y`, we have `supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
For non-degenerate regions homeomorphic to a disk, their bounding boxes have non-zero width, so `infx(x) < supx(x)` and `infx(y) < supx(y)`.
So, if `x W z` holds, we have `infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)`. This chain of inequalities `infx(x) < ... <= infx(x)` is a contradiction.
Therefore, `x W z` is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
Similarly, `x SW z` and `x NW z` are impossible as they require `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.

The possible remaining relations are {B, S, N, NE, E, SE}. Let's check if each of these is possible by constructing example regions.

Vertical relations between x and z:
From `supy(x) <= infy(y)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`, both x and z are vertically below or aligned with the southern boundary of y.

-   Can `x N z` be true? (`supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 5]x[0, 1], `y`=[1, 4]x[2, 3]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[4, 5]x[1.5, 2]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=4 >= supx(y)=4`, `supy(x)=2 <= infy(y)=2`).
    Check `x N z`: `supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1.5` (True), `infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=4` (True), `supx(x)=5 <= supx(z)=5` (True).
    So, `x N z` is possible.

-   Can `x S z` be true? (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 5]x[1, 2], `y`=[1, 4]x[3, 4]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[4, 5]x[0, 1]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=4 >= supx(y)=4`, `supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=3`).
    Check `x S z`: `supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=1` (True), `infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=4` (True), `supx(x)=5 <= supx(z)=5` (True).
    So, `x S z` is possible.

-   Can `x B z` be true? (`infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 5]x[0, 5], `y`=[1, 4]x[6, 7]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[4, 5]x[0, 5]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=4 >= supx(y)=4`, `supy(x)=5 <= infy(y)=6`).
    Check `x B z`: `infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=4` (True), `supx(x)=5 <= supx(z)=5` (True), `infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0` (True), `supy(x)=5 <= supy(z)=5` (True).
    So, `x B z` is possible.

-   Can `x E z` be true? (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 4]x[0, 1], `y`=[1, 3]x[2, 3]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[4, 5]x[0, 1]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=4 >= supx(y)=3`, `supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=2`).
    Check `x E z`: `supx(z)=4 <= infx(x)=4` (True), `infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0` (True), `supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=1` (True).
    So, `x E z` is possible.

-   Can `x SE z` be true? (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 1]x[0, 1], `y`=[0, 1]x[2, 3]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[2, 3]x[-1, 0]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=2 >= supx(y)=1`, `supy(x)=0 <= infy(y)=2`).
    Check `x SE z`: `supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (True), `supy(x)=0 <= infy(z)=0` (True).
    So, `x SE z` is possible.

-   Can `x NE z` be true? (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[-1, 1]x[0, 0.5], `y`=[0, 1]x[1, 1]. `y N z` is true. (Using epsilon=1 for simplicity)
    Let `x`=[2, 3]x[0.5, 1]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=2 >= supx(y)=1`, `supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=1`).
    Check `x NE z`: `supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (True), `supy(z)=0.5 <= infy(x)=0.5` (True).
    So, `x NE z` is possible.

We have shown that B, S, N, SE, NE, E are all possible relations between x and z. We have also shown that W, SW, NW are impossible for non-degenerate regions.

The possible relations are B, S, N, SE, NE, E.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, B}$.
