For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Let infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), and supy(a) denote the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of the projections of region a on the x and y axes, respectively. Regions belong to the set REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk and thus their projections are non-degenerate intervals (infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a)).

The given relations are:
1.  x N y:
    *   supy(y) <= infy(x)
    *   infx(y) <= infx(x)
    *   supx(x) <= supx(y)

2.  y N z:
    *   supy(z) <= infy(y)
    *   infx(z) <= infx(y)
    *   supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relation(s) R between x and z, i.e., x R z. Let's derive the constraints on the bounding box of x relative to the bounding box of z by combining the given inequalities:

Combining the y-axis inequalities:
supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Also, since regions are in REG, infy < supy for any region. So, infy(y) < supy(y) and infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z).
Thus, supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies supy(z) <= infy(x).

Let's also look at the other y-bounds:
infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x).
This implies:
infy(z) < infy(y) < infy(x), so infy(z) < infy(x), which satisfies infy(z) <= infy(x).
supy(z) < supy(y) < supy(x), so supy(z) < supy(x), which means supy(x) <= supy(z) is false.

Combining the x-axis inequalities:
infx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x) => infx(z) <= infx(x).
supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) => supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, the bounding box of x relative to the bounding box of z must satisfy:
*   infx(z) <= infx(x)
*   supx(x) <= supx(z)
*   supy(z) <= infy(x)

Now let's check which of the single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z are defined by these conditions. Let R be a single-tile relation from the list {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

*   x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We have infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and infy(z) <= infy(x). However, we found supy(x) > supy(z), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). So B is not possible.

*   x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We found supy(x) > supy(z) and supy(z) > infy(z) (since regions are in REG), so supy(x) > infy(z). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So S is not possible.

*   x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We found supy(x) > infy(z), contradicting supy(x) <= infy(z). Also, we have supx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x). Since regions are in REG, supx(x) > infx(x), leading to a contradiction. So supx(x) <= infx(z) is false. SW is not possible.

*   x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We found supx(x) <= infx(z) is false and supy(x) <= supy(z) is false. W is not possible.

*   x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
    We have supy(z) <= infy(x). However, we found supx(x) <= infx(z) is false. NW is not possible.

*   x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    These are precisely the three inequalities we derived as necessary conditions for the bounding box relation between x and z. Thus, x N z must hold.

*   x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(a).
    We have supy(z) <= infy(x). However, we found supx(z) <= infx(x) is false (it would imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= infx(z), contradicting supx > infx). NE is not possible.

*   x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b).
    Mapping (a,b) to (x,z): x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We found supx(z) <= infx(x) is false and supy(x) <= supy(z) is false. E is not possible.

*   x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
    Mapping (a,b) to (x,z): x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    We found supx(z) <= infx(x) is false and supy(x) <= infy(z) is false. SE is not possible.

Based on the definitions provided, the derived bounding box relationships between x and z (infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x)) exactly match the definition of x N z and contradict the definitions of all other single-tile cardinal relations.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.

N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: E NE
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: E:NE
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: N, S, B
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Let `infx(a)`, `supx(a)`, `infy(a)`, `supy(a)` denote the bounds of the minimum bounding box for a region `a`. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, meaning they are 2-dimensional and non-degenerate, so `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)` for any region `a` in REG.

The given relations are:
1. `x N y`:
   - `supy(y) <= infy(x)`
   - `infx(y) <= infx(x)`
   - `supx(x) <= supx(y)`

2. `y NW z`:
   - `supx(y) <= infx(z)`
   - `supy(z) <= infy(y)`

We want to find the possible relations between x and z, which are defined by the relative positions of their bounding boxes. Let's combine the inequalities to relate the bounds of x and z.

From the x-coordinates:
We have `supx(x) <= supx(y)` (from `x N y`) and `supx(y) <= infx(z)` (from `y NW z`).
Combining these, we get `supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)`, which implies `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
This inequality means the bounding box of x is to the west of or aligned with the western edge of the bounding box of z.

From the y-coordinates:
We have `supy(y) <= infy(x)` (from `x N y`) and `supy(z) <= infy(y)` (from `y NW z`).
Since y is a non-degenerate region, `infy(y) < supy(y)`.
Combining the inequalities involving y: `supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
This chain implies `supy(z) < infy(x)`. Since < implies <=, we have `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
This inequality means the bounding box of x is to the north of or aligned with the northern edge of the bounding box of z.

So, we have derived two necessary conditions for the relation between x and z:
(A) `supx(x) <= infx(z)`
(B) `supy(z) <= infy(x)`

Let's check which of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are defined by these conditions. The possible relations are B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE.

- `x NW z` is defined by `supx(x) <= infx(z)` AND `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
  Conditions (A) and (B) match this definition exactly. Thus, NW is a possible relation.

Let's check if any other relation is possible.
- `x S z`: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. From (B), `infy(x) >= supy(z)`. Since `infy(x) < supy(x)` and `infy(z) < supy(z)`, we have `supy(x) > infy(x) >= supy(z) > infy(z)`. Thus `supy(x) > infy(z)`, which contradicts `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. S is not possible.
- `x SW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (satisfied by A) AND `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. As shown for S, the second condition is impossible. SW is not possible.
- `x W z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (satisfied by A) AND `infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. From (B), `infy(x) >= supy(z)`. If `supy(x) <= supy(z)` is also true, combined with `infy(x) < supy(x)`, we get `supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z)`, which implies `infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z)`. This would mean the y-projection of x is a single point or line, which contradicts x being in REG. W is not possible.
- `x N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (satisfied by B) AND `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. From (A), `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. If `infx(z) <= infx(x)` is also true, combined with `infx(x) < supx(x)`, we get `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x)`, which implies `infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z)`. This would mean the x-projection of x is a single point or line, which contradicts x being in REG. N is not possible.
- `x NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (satisfied by B). From (A), `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. If `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is also true, combined with `infx(z) < supx(z)` and `infx(x) < supx(x)`, we get `infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z)`, implying `infx(z) < infx(z)`. Contradiction unless bounds are equal, which implies degeneracy. NE is not possible.
- `x E z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (requires degeneracy) AND `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (satisfied by B) AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (requires degeneracy). E is not possible.
- `x SE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (requires degeneracy) AND `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (impossible). SE is not possible.
- `x B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(x)` AND `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (requires degeneracy, see N/B x-part) AND `infy(z) <= infy(x)` AND `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (requires degeneracy, see W/B y-part). B is not possible.

Based on the definitions of the relations using bounding boxes and the fact that regions are non-degenerate (homeomorphic to a disk), the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: NW, W, SW
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: NE, E, SE
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: Let MBR(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)].
The given relations are defined based on the MBRs.

We are given:
1.  x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2.  y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

From the given conditions, we can derive relationships between the bounding box coordinates of x and z:

From x N y, we have:
(N1) supy(y) <= infy(x)
(N2) infx(y) <= infx(x)
(N3) supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y NE z, we have:
(NE1) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(NE2) supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining (NE1) and (N2):
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
This gives us:
(D1) supx(z) <= infx(x)

Combining (NE2), the definition of MBR (infy(y) <= supy(y)), and (N1):
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
This gives us:
(D2) supy(z) <= infy(x)

Now we check which of the possible relations between x and z are consistent with the derived conditions (D1) and (D2). The regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes are non-degenerate (infx < supx and infy < supy).

Let's examine the definition of each possible relation for x R z:

*   **x B z**: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From (D1), supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= supx(z) also holds, then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) <= supx(x) for non-degenerate regions, this requires infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z), meaning x is a vertical line segment. This contradicts the definition of regions in REG. Thus, B is not possible.

*   **x S z**: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). As shown for B, this is impossible given (D1) for regions in REG. Thus, S is not possible.

*   **x SW z**: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). From (D1), supx(z) <= infx(x). If both supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) hold, then supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), implying infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z). This means x and z are vertical line segments at the same x-coordinate, contradicting REG. Thus, SW is not possible.

*   **x W z**: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible for regions in REG given (D1), as shown for SW. Thus, W is not possible.

*   **x NW z**: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible for regions in REG given (D1), as shown for SW. (D2) supy(z) <= infy(x) holds, but the first condition makes NW impossible. Thus, NW is not possible.

*   **x N z**: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    (D2) supy(z) <= infy(x) holds. Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Impossible for regions in REG given (D1), as shown for B. Thus, N is not possible.

*   **x NE z**: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
    These are exactly the conditions (D1) and (D2) that we derived from the given relations. Thus, NE is a possible relation.

*   **x E z**: infx(z) <= supx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    From (D1), supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(z) <= supx(z) and infx(x) <= supx(x), it follows that infx(z) <= supx(x). This part is consistent.
    Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). From (D2), supy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) <= supy(z) also holds, then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Since infy(x) <= supy(x) for non-degenerate regions, this requires infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z), meaning x is a horizontal line segment. This contradicts REG. Thus, E is not possible.

*   **x SE z**: infx(z) <= supx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
    infx(z) <= supx(x) is consistent (as shown for E). Requires supy(x) <= infy(z).
    From (D2), supy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) hold, and infy(z) <= supy(z) and infy(x) <= supy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). This implies infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z), meaning x and z are horizontal line segments at the same y-coordinate. This contradicts REG. Thus, SE is not possible.

Based on the derived necessary conditions and the properties of regions in REG, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
We are given two relations:
1.  x N y (x is North of y)
2.  y B z (y is Bounding box of z)

Let's write these using the definitions of the bounding box bounds:
1.  x N y:
    *   supy(y) <= infy(x)
    *   infx(y) <= infx(x)
    *   supx(x) <= supx(y)

2.  y B z:
    *   infx(z) <= infx(y)
    *   supx(y) <= supx(z)
    *   infy(z) <= infy(y)
    *   supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's derive the relations between x and z by combining these inequalities.

**Horizontal Relation (x-axis):**
From (1): infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
From (2): infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)  =>  infx(z) <= infx(x)
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)  =>  supx(x) <= supx(z)

These two inequalities (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) describe a situation where the horizontal projection of x is contained within or aligns with the horizontal projection of z.

Let's examine the horizontal conditions for the single-tile relations for x relative to z:
*   W, NW, SW require supx(x) <= infx(z). From our findings, infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), so supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible for regions in REG (which have positive width).
*   E, NE, SE require supx(z) <= infx(x). From our findings, infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z), so supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG (which have positive width, and x's horizontal projection is contained in z's).

This means the only possible horizontal relationship is the containment/alignment captured by infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This horizontal property is shared by B, N, and S relations.

**Vertical Relation (y-axis):**
From (1): supy(y) <= infy(x)
From (2): infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x):
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) => infy(z) <= infy(x)

This means the bottom of x's bounding box is at or above the bottom of z's bounding box.

Let's examine the vertical conditions for the single-tile relations for x relative to z, considering infy(z) <= infy(x):
*   S, SW, SE require supy(x) <= infy(z). From our finding infy(z) <= infy(x), this would imply supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Since regions in REG have positive height, infy(x) < supy(x), so supy(x) <= infy(x) is impossible. Thus, S, SW, and SE are not possible.
*   N, NE, NW require supy(z) <= infy(x). Is this possible? Yes, it is possible for infy(x) to be greater than or equal to supy(z). For example, y could be near the bottom of z, and x could be far above y (and thus far above z).

Combining Horizontal and Vertical Findings:
The possible relations must have the horizontal property (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) and cannot be S, SW, SE, W, NW, E, NE.
The only remaining possibilities from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} are B and N.

Let's check if B and N are indeed possible.

*   **Is x B z possible?**
    x B z requires: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    We have already derived the first three: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and infy(z) <= infy(x).
    We need to check if supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible.
    We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
    Consider the example: z = [0,10]x[0,10], y = [1,9]x[1,9]. y B z holds.
    Let x be a region N of y, specifically x = [1,9]x[9,10].
    Check x N y: supy(y)=9 <= infy(x)=9 (holds), infx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=1 (holds), supx(x)=9 <= supx(y)=9 (holds). x N y holds.
    Check x B z: infx(z)=0<=infx(x)=1 (holds), supx(x)=9<=supx(z)=10 (holds), infy(z)=0<=infy(x)=9 (holds), supy(x)=10<=supy(z)=10 (holds). x B z holds.
    So, B is a possible relation.

*   **Is x N z possible?**
    x N z requires: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We have already derived the last two: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.
    We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
    Consider the example: z = [0,10]x[0,10], y = [1,9]x[1,9]. y B z holds.
    Let x be a region N of y, specifically x = [1,9]x[11,12].
    Check x N y: supy(y)=9 <= infy(x)=11 (holds), infx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=1 (holds), supx(x)=9 <= supx(y)=9 (holds). x N y holds.
    Check x N z: supy(z)=10 <= infy(x)=11 (holds), infx(z)=0<=infx(x)=1 (holds), supx(x)=9<=supx(z)=10 (holds). x N z holds.
    So, N is a possible relation.

Any other relation from the defined set would require horizontal separation or vertical separation (x below z), which we have shown are impossible given the initial conditions and the definition of regions in REG. While other spatial configurations are possible between x and z (e.g., horizontal containment with vertical overlap where x extends above z), they do not correspond to any single-tile relation in the defined set. Therefore, only B and N are the possible single-tile relations.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, B}$.
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Let BB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of region a, given by [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes are non-degenerate, i.e., infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

The premises are:
1. x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)

From the definitions and the non-degenerate property of regions:
infx(a) < supx(a) for a in REG
infy(a) < supy(a) for a in REG

Let's derive the necessary relations between the bounding boxes of x and z.

Y-axis relations:
From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
From y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y).
Combining these: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This implies supy(z) <= infy(x). (z's top is at or below x's bottom)
Also, infy(y) <= infy(x) implies infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) (since x is non-degenerate).
Combining this with supy(z) <= infy(y): supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This implies supy(z) < supy(x). (z's top is strictly below x's top)
What about infy(z) vs infy(x)?
We have infy(z) < supy(z) (since z is non-degenerate).
So, infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This implies infy(z) <= infy(x). (z's bottom is at or below x's bottom)

Necessary Y-axis constraints between x and z:
(Y1) supy(z) <= infy(x)
(Y2) supy(z) < supy(x)
(Y3) infy(z) <= infy(x)

X-axis relations:
From x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y).
From y N z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
Also, infx(y) < supx(y) (since y is non-degenerate).

Combining: supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) < supx(z). (x's right edge is strictly left of z's right edge)

Necessary X-axis constraint between x and z:
(X1) supx(x) < supx(z)

Let's check which single-tile relations are possible given these necessary constraints. We need to evaluate the conditions for a R z for each R in {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}:

- S (a S b): supy(a) <= infy(b) and infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts (Y2) supy(z) < supy(x) and the fact that infy(z) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) > supy(z) >= infy(z). Impossible.
- SW (a SW b): supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b). Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible (same as S).
- SE (a SE b): supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b). Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible (same as S).

So, S, SW, SE are impossible. The remaining possible relations require supy(z) <= infy(x), which is (Y1) and is always true.

- B (a B b): infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b).
Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts (Y2) supy(z) < supy(x). Impossible.

- W (a W b): supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b).
Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts (Y2) supy(z) < supy(x). Impossible.

- E (a E b): supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b).
Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts (Y2) supy(z) < supy(x). Impossible.

- NE (a NE b): supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
Requires supx(z) <= infx(x). However, from the x-axis relations, we have infx(x) < supx(x) < supx(z). This implies infx(x) < supx(z). Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. Impossible.

The only remaining possibilities are N and NW. Let's check if their conditions are compatible with our necessary constraints and if examples can be constructed.

- N (a N b): supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b).
For x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x) (Y1 - Yes), infx(z) <= infx(x) (Possible - no fixed relation), supx(x) <= supx(z) (X1 - Yes, strict inequality implies less than or equal to).
This relation is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible, which it is. Example: BB(y) = [10, 15]x[10, 15], BB(x) = [8, 9]x[12, 14], BB(z) = [7, 16]x[5, 8].

- NW (a NW b): supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
For x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (Possible - no fixed relation between supx(x) and infx(z)), supy(z) <= infy(x) (Y1 - Yes).
This relation is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z) is possible, which it is. Example: BB(y) = [10, 15]x[10, 15], BB(x) = [8, 9]x[12, 14], BB(z) = [10, 16]x[5, 8]. No, this example does not work.
Example for NW: Let BB(y) = [10, 15] x [10, 20].
x W y: supx(x) <= 10, infy(x) >= 10, supy(x) <= 20. Let BB(x) = [5, 8] x [12, 18]. (8<=10, 12>=10, 18<=20. Ok)
y N z: supy(z) <= 10, infx(z) <= 10, supx(y)=15 <= supx(z). Let BB(z) = [10, 20] x [0, 8]. (8<=10, 10<=10, 15<=20. Ok)
Compare x and z: BB(x)=[5, 8]x[12, 18], BB(z)=[10, 20]x[0, 8].
supy(z)=8, infy(x)=12. supy(z) <= infy(x) (8 <= 12 Yes).
supx(x)=8, infx(z)=10. supx(x) <= infx(z) (8 <= 10 Yes).
NW is possible.

The possible relations are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: W, E, B
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: S, SW
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: Let `infx(a)`, `supx(a)`, `infy(a)`, and `supy(a)` denote the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of the projection of region `a` on the x and y axes, respectively.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are 2D regions with positive area. Thus, for any region `a` in REG, we have `infx(a) < supx(a)` and `infy(a) < supy(a)`.

We are given two relations:
1.  `x W y`: `supx(x) <= infx(y)`, `infy(y) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(y)`
2.  `y SW z`: `supx(y) <= infx(z)`, `supy(y) <= infy(z)`

We want to find the possible relations between `x` and `z`. Let's derive constraints on the bounding boxes of `x` and `z`.

From (1) and the property of bounding boxes (`infx(y) < supx(y)`):
`supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y)`

From (2):
`supx(y) <= infx(z)`

Combining these inequalities:
`supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z)`
This implies `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. (Constraint C1)

From (1):
`supy(x) <= supy(y)`

From (2):
`supy(y) <= infy(z)`

Combining these inequalities:
`supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)`
This implies `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. (Constraint C2)

Constraints C1 (`supx(x) <= infx(z)`) and C2 (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`) are necessary conditions for any relationship between `x` and `z` derived from the premises.

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible cardinal relations between `x` and `z` and see which ones are consistent with C1, C2, and the non-degenerate nature of the regions.

-   **x S z**: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (matches C2).
    Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1 (`supx(x) <= infx(z)`), this gives `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x)`. Since `infx(x) < supx(x)` for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. S is not possible.

-   **x SW z**: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    These are exactly C1 and C2. Since we derived C1 and C2 from the premises, x SW z is a possible relation. We can construct examples where this holds (e.g., x=[0,1]x[0,1], y=[2,3]x[-1,2], z=[4,5]x[2,3]).

-   **x W z**: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (matches C1).
    Requires `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. Together with C2 (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`), this gives `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x)`. Since `infy(x) < supy(x)` for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. W is not possible.

-   **x NW z**: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
    Requires `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (matches C1).
    Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. We know from the premises that `supy(y) <= infy(z)` and `infy(y) <= infy(x)`. So `infy(z) >= supy(y)`. For NW to hold, we need `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Since `infy(z) < supy(z)`, this would imply `infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Combined with `infy(z) >= supy(y)` and `supy(y) >= supy(x)`, this implies `infy(z) >= supy(x)`. So we would need `supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Since `infy(x) < supy(x)`, this is impossible. NW is not possible.

-   **x SE z**: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
    Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (matches C2).
    Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1 (`supx(x) <= infx(z)`), this gives `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Since `infx(x) < supx(x)` for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. SE is not possible.

-   **x NE z**: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(z) <= infy(a)` (assuming typo corrected to `infy(x)`).
    Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1, this requires horizontal degeneracy. Not possible.
    Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. As shown for NW, this is not possible given C2 and non-degeneracy. NE is not possible.

-   **x N z**: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    Requires `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Not possible (as shown for NW).
    Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1, requires horizontal degeneracy. Not possible. N is not possible.

-   **x E z**: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requires `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1, requires horizontal degeneracy. Not possible.
    Requires `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. Together with C2, requires vertical degeneracy. Not possible. E is not possible.

-   **x B z**: `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
    Requires `infx(z) <= infx(x)`. Together with C1, requires horizontal degeneracy. Not possible.
    Requires `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. Together with C2, requires vertical degeneracy. Not possible. B is not possible.

Based on the definitions provided and the constraint that regions are non-degenerate (homeomorphic to a disk), the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{SW}$.
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: SE, S, SW
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: N NE NW
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Let the regions be x, y, and z.
We are given:
1.  x W y
2.  y B z

The definitions based on projection bounds are:
-   a W b: supx(a) <= infx(b) AND infy(b) <= infy(a) AND supy(a) <= supy(b)
-   a B b: infx(b) <= infx(a) AND supx(a) <= supx(b) AND infy(b) <= infy(a) AND supy(a) <= supy(b)

Applying these definitions to the given conditions:
From x W y:
(1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(2) infy(y) <= infy(x)
(3) supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y B z:
(4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(5) supx(y) <= supx(z)
(6) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(7) supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints on the projection bounds of x relative to z.

**Analysis of y-bounds (x vs z):**
Combine (6) and (2): infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). Thus, infy(z) <= infy(x).
Combine (3) and (7): supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). Thus, supy(x) <= supy(z).

These two inequalities, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), must hold for regions x and z.
Let's check which of the single-tile cardinal direction relations (a, b) implies these y-conditions for (x, z):
-   B(x,z): infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches the derived conditions.
-   S(x,z): supy(x) <= infy(z). This, combined with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), implies supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). For regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed disk), the y-projection is a non-degenerate interval, so infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z). If supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < infy(x) cannot hold simultaneously unless supy(x) = infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(z), which means the y-projections are points. This is not possible for regions in REG. So, S is impossible.
-   SW(x,z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible for the same reason as S.
-   W(x,z): infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches the derived conditions.
-   NW(x,z): supy(z) <= infy(x). This, combined with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), implies infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). For REG regions, infy(z) < supy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x), then infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x). Also supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This requires supy(x) <= infy(x). Since infy(x) < supy(x) for REG regions, this is impossible unless supy(x) = infy(x) = supy(z) = infy(z), which is not possible for REG regions. So, NW is impossible.
-   N(x,z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible for the same reason as NW.
-   NE(x,z): supy(z) <= infy(x). Impossible for the same reason as NW.
-   E(x,z): infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). Matches the derived conditions.
-   SE(x,z): supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible for the same reason as S.

Based purely on the derived y-conditions, only B, W, and E are potentially possible relations between x and z.

**Analysis of x-bounds (x vs z):**
From (1): supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (4): infx(z) <= infx(y)
From (5): supx(y) <= supx(z)
For regions in REG, infx(y) < supx(y).

Combining (1), infx(y) < supx(y), and (5):
supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
This implies supx(x) < supx(z). (Technically supx(x) <= supx(z) is guaranteed, and strict inequality holds for REG).

Also, for region x, infx(x) < supx(x).
So, infx(x) < supx(x) < supx(z).
This implies infx(x) < supx(z) must always hold.

Now let's check the x-conditions for the potentially possible relations (B, W, E) based on the y-analysis:
-   W(x,z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Is this possible?
    From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), it is possible for supx(x) to be less than or equal to infx(z). For example, if infx(y) is much larger than both supx(x) and infx(z), and supx(x) <= infx(z). Let infx(z)=0, infx(y)=5, supx(x)=-1. Then supx(x) <= infx(z) (-1 <= 0) holds, and supx(x) <= infx(y) (-1 <= 5) holds, and infx(z) <= infx(y) (0 <= 5) holds. We've shown in thought process that a configuration exists where x W y, y B z, and x W z. So W is possible.

-   B(x,z): Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We already know supx(x) <= supx(z) must hold (strictly supx(x) < supx(z) for REG). So the second x-condition for B is always satisfied for REG regions.
    Is infx(z) <= infx(x) possible?
    We have infx(z) <= infx(y). There is no direct constraint on infx(x) relative to infx(y) or infx(z) from the premise x W y (only supx(x) is constrained relative to infx(y)). It is possible to choose regions such that infx(z) <= infx(x) holds. For example, let z = [0,10]x[0,10], y = [1,9]x[1,9]. For x W y, supx(x) <= 1. We need infx(z) <= infx(x), i.e., 0 <= infx(x). We can pick infx(x)=0.5 and supx(x)=0.8. This satisfies 0 <= 0.5 and 0.5 < 0.8 <= 1. We've shown in thought process that a configuration exists where x W y, y B z, and x B z. So B is possible.

-   E(x,z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x).
    We derived that infx(x) < supx(z) must always hold for regions in REG.
    infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z).
    This chain implies infx(x) < supx(z).
    Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. E is impossible.

The possible relations are those where the y-conditions match (B, W, E) AND the x-conditions are possible. We found W is possible and B is possible, but E is not possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are W and B.

W, B
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: N, NE
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: W, E, B
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Let MBB(a) denote the minimum bounding box of a region a, defined by the intervals [infx(a), supx(a)] and [infy(a), supy(a)].
The given conditions are:
1. x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these inequalities, we can derive necessary conditions for the relation between x and z.

Horizontal relations (x-axis):
From supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y), and since infx(y) <= supx(y) for any non-degenerate region y, we have:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
This implies supx(z) <= infx(x).

Vertical relations (y-axis):
From infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y), we have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
This implies infy(z) <= infy(x).

From supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y), we have:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
This implies supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, any possible relation between x and z must satisfy these three conditions for their minimum bounding boxes:
(1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(2) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, let's examine which of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with these three necessary conditions. The regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk, which means infx < supx and infy < supy for any region.

The possible relations are {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. Let's check each one based on its definition relating 'a' and 'b' and our derived necessary conditions for x (as 'a') and z (as 'b').

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Combined with (1) supx(z) <= infx(x), this implies supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(x) < supx(x) for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. B is not possible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Impossible as shown for B. S is not possible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Combined with (1) supx(z) <= infx(x), this implies supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(z) < supx(z), this leads to a contradiction unless all bounds are equal (point regions), which is not allowed. SW is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW. W is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW. NW is not possible.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Impossible as shown for B. N is not possible.

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  Horizontal condition supx(z) <= infx(x) matches (1).
  Vertical condition supy(z) <= infy(x). From our necessary conditions, we have supy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(z) <= infy(x) also holds, then supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Since infy(x) < supy(x) for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. NE is not possible.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  These three conditions are exactly the necessary conditions (1), (2), and (3) that we derived.
  We need to check if an example exists where x E y and y E z hold, and x E z also holds.
  Let MBB(z) = [0,1] x [0,1]. Let MBB(y) = [2,3] x [0,1]. Let MBB(x) = [4,5] x [0,1].
  Check y E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok). infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=0 (ok). supy(y)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (ok). y E z holds for these bounding boxes.
  Check x E y: supx(y)=3 <= infx(x)=4 (ok). infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (ok). supy(x)=1 <= supy(y)=1 (ok). x E y holds for these bounding boxes.
  Check x E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=4 (ok). infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0 (ok). supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=1 (ok). x E z holds for these bounding boxes.
  Since regions exist (e.g., squares which are homeomorphic to a disk) with these bounding boxes, E is a possible relation.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Horizontal condition supx(z) <= infx(x) matches (1).
  Vertical condition supy(x) <= infy(z). From our necessary conditions, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supy(x) <= infy(z) also holds, then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). Since infy(x) < supy(x) for a non-degenerate region, this is impossible. SE is not possible.

Based on the analysis, only the E relation is consistent with the necessary conditions derived from x E y and y E z, and we provided an example showing that E is indeed possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{E}$.
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `r` be denoted by `[infx(r), supx(r)] x [infy(r), supy(r)]`.

Given:
1.  `x E y`: `supx(y) <= infx(x)`, `infy(y) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(y)`
2.  `y S z`: `supy(y) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, `supx(y) <= supx(z)`

We want to find possible relations between `x` and `z`. Let's combine the inequalities:

From `x E y` and `y S z` (vertical constraints):
`supy(x) <= supy(y)` and `supy(y) <= infy(z)`
This implies `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
This inequality means the upper bound of `x`'s y-projection is less than or equal to the lower bound of `z`'s y-projection. In other words, region `x` is vertically below or touching the lower edge of region `z`.

Let's look at the definitions of the single-tile relations for `a R b` when `a=x` and `b=z`:
*   N, NE, NW require `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This contradicts `supy(x) <= infy(z)` for non-degenerate regions. So N, NE, NW are impossible.
*   W, E, B require vertical overlap (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`). For `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and vertical overlap to hold for regions in REG (which have positive vertical extent), we would need `supy(x) = infy(z)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. This implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`, which means the region x has zero vertical extent, contradicting the definition of REG regions. So W, E, B are impossible.

The only remaining possible relations are S, SW, and SE, which all require `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (or `supy(a) <= infy(b)`). We have already established this condition. Now let's check the horizontal constraints for S, SW, SE based on the given information.

From `x E y` and `y S z` (horizontal constraints):
`supx(y) <= infx(x)`
`infx(z) <= infx(y)`
`supx(y) <= supx(z)`

Also, for any region `r` in REG, `infx(r) < supx(r)` and `infy(r) < supy(r)`.
So, `infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)`. This chain implies `infx(z) <= infx(x)`.

Let's check S, SW, and SE for `x R z`:
*   `x S z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (satisfied), `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (satisfied by derivation), and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`.
    *   Is `supx(x) <= supx(z)` always true? No.
    *   Is `x S z` possible? Yes. Consider y = [0,1]x[0,1], x = [2,3]x[0.5,0.6], z = [-2,4]x[2,3].
        *   `x E y`: `supx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (ok), `infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0.5` (ok), `supy(x)=0.6 <= supy(y)=1` (ok).
        *   `y S z`: `supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=2` (ok), `infx(z)=-2 <= infx(y)=0` (ok), `supx(y)=1 <= supx(z)=4` (ok).
        *   `x S z`: `supy(x)=0.6 <= infy(z)=2` (ok), `infx(z)=-2 <= infx(x)=2` (ok), `supx(x)=3 <= supx(z)=4` (ok).
        *   So, S is a possible relation.

*   `x SW z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (satisfied) and `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
    *   Is `supx(x) <= infx(z)` possible? We have `infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)`. This chain implies `infx(z) < supx(x)` (since regions have positive width). Thus, `supx(x) <= infx(z)` is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
    *   So, SW is not a possible relation.

*   `x SE z`: Requires `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (satisfied) and `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
    *   Is `supx(z) <= infx(x)` possible? Yes.
    *   Is `x SE z` possible? Yes. Consider y = [0,1]x[0,1], x = [2,3]x[0.5,0.6], z = [-1,1.5]x[2,3].
        *   `x E y`: `supx(y)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (ok), `infy(y)=0 <= infy(x)=0.5` (ok), `supy(x)=0.6 <= supy(y)=1` (ok).
        *   `y S z`: `supy(y)=1 <= infy(z)=2` (ok), `infx(z)=-1 <= infx(y)=0` (ok), `supx(y)=1 <= supx(z)=1.5` (ok).
        *   `x SE z`: `supy(x)=0.6 <= infy(z)=2` (ok), `supx(z)=1.5 <= infx(x)=2` (ok).
        *   So, SE is a possible relation.

Based on the analysis, the only possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S and SE.

S, SE
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions provided:
- x E y means: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y SW z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z)

From x E y, we have:
1) supx(y) <= infx(x)
2) infy(y) <= infy(x)
3) supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y SW z, we have:
4) supx(y) <= infx(z)
5) supy(y) <= infy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's look at the bounds of x and z.
From (3) and (5), we can chain the inequalities for the y-bounds:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
This gives us supy(x) <= infy(z).
This inequality implies that the top of the bounding box of x is below or aligned with the bottom of the bounding box of z. This rules out any relation where x overlaps z vertically or is above z.

Let's examine the definitions of the possible cardinal directions (a relation between region a and region b is checked):
- S: supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b). The y-condition supy(a) <= infy(b) matches our derived supy(x) <= infy(z).
- SW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b). The y-condition supy(a) <= infy(b) matches our derived supy(x) <= infy(z).
- SE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b). The y-condition supy(a) <= infy(b) matches our derived supy(x) <= infy(z).
- N: supy(b) <= infy(a). This requires infy(z) <= infy(x), which would contradict supy(x) <= infy(z) unless the regions have zero height (supy=infy), which is not the case for regions homeomorphic to a disk. N is not possible.
- NE: supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a). Same y-problem as N. Not possible.
- NW: supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a). Same y-problem as N. Not possible.
- E: supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b). Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which is impossible for regions with non-zero height. E is not possible.
- W: supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b). Same y-problem as E. Not possible.
- B: infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b). Same y-problem as E. Not possible.

So, only S, SW, and SE are possible based on the derived y-relation. We now need to check if all three are actually achievable.

Case 1: Can x SW z be possible?
x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We already know supy(x) <= infy(z) must hold. Can supx(x) <= infx(z) also hold?
Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[2,3]x[0,1], z=[3,4]x[2,3].
x E y: supx(y)=1<=infx(x)=2, infy(y)=0<=infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1<=supy(y)=1. (True)
y SW z: supx(y)=1<=infx(z)=3, supy(y)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
x SW z: supx(x)=3<=infx(z)=3, supy(x)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
So SW is possible.

Case 2: Can x S z be possible?
x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) must hold. Can infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) also hold?
Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[2,3]x[0,1], z=[2,4]x[2,3].
x E y: supx(y)=1<=infx(x)=2, infy(y)=0<=infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1<=supy(y)=1. (True)
y SW z: supx(y)=1<=infx(z)=2, supy(y)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
x S z: supy(x)=1<=infy(z)=2, infx(z)=2<=infx(x)=2, supx(x)=3<=supx(z)=4. (True)
So S is possible.

Case 3: Can x SE z be possible?
x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b).
We know supy(x) <= infy(z) must hold. Can supx(z) <= infx(x) also hold?
Yes. Consider y=[0,1]x[0,1], x=[4,5]x[0,1], z=[2,3]x[2,3].
x E y: supx(y)=1<=infx(x)=4, infy(y)=0<=infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1<=supy(y)=1. (True)
y SW z: supx(y)=1<=infx(z)=2, supy(y)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
x SE z: supx(z)=3<=infx(x)=4, supy(x)=1<=infy(z)=2. (True)
So SE is possible.

All three relations S, SW, and SE are possible outcomes for the relation between region x and region z.

S, SW, SE
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Let $x_L = \infx(x)$, $x_R = \supx(x)$, $x_B = \infy(x)$, $x_T = \supy(x)$. Similarly for y and z.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their projections on the axes are closed intervals with positive length. Thus, for any region r in REG, $\infx(r) < \supx(r)$ and $\infy(r) < \supy(r)$.

The relation x E y is defined as:
1) $y_R \le x_L$
2) $y_B \le x_B$
3) $x_T \le y_T$

The relation y SE z is defined as:
4) $z_R \le y_L$
5) $y_T \le z_B$

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's combine the given inequalities:
From (1) and (4), using $y_L \le y_R$:
$z_R \le y_L \le y_R \le x_L \implies z_R \le x_L$. (Condition A)

From (3) and (5):
$x_T \le y_T \le z_B \implies x_T \le z_B$. (Condition B)

These two conditions, $z_R \le x_L$ and $x_T \le z_B$, must hold for the bounding boxes of x and z if x E y and y SE z. Now let's check which single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z are defined by these conditions or are consistent with them.

Let's list the definitions for x R z:
- x B z: $z_L \le x_L, x_R \le z_R, z_B \le x_B, x_T \le z_T$. Requires $x_R \le z_R$. From (A), $z_R \le x_L$. Since $x_L < x_R$, we have $z_R \le x_L < x_R$. So $z_R < x_R$. The condition $x_R \le z_R$ cannot be met. B is impossible.
- x S z: $x_T \le z_B, z_L \le x_L, x_R \le z_R$. Requires $x_R \le z_R$. Impossible (same reason as B). S is impossible.
- x SW z: $x_R \le z_L, x_T \le z_B$. Requires $x_R \le z_L$. From (A), $z_R \le x_L$. Since $z_L < z_R$, we have $z_L < z_R \le x_L$. Also $x_L < x_R$. So $z_L < x_R$. The condition $x_R \le z_L$ implies $x_R \le z_L < x_R$, which is a contradiction. SW is impossible.
- x W z: $x_R \le z_L, z_B \le x_B, x_T \le z_T$. Requires $x_R \le z_L$. Impossible (same reason as SW). W is impossible.
- x NW z: $x_R \le z_L, z_T \le x_B$. Requires $x_R \le z_L$. Impossible (same reason as SW). NW is impossible.
- x N z: $z_T \le x_B, z_L \le x_L, x_R \le z_R$. Requires $x_R \le z_R$. Impossible (same reason as B). N is impossible.
- x NE z: $z_R \le x_L, z_T \le x_B$. Requires $z_T \le x_B$. From (B), $x_T \le z_B$. Since $x_B < x_T$, we have $x_B < x_T \le z_B$. Since $z_B < z_T$, we have $z_B < z_T$. So we have $x_B < z_B < z_T$. If $z_T \le x_B$, then $z_T \le x_B < z_B < z_T$, which implies $z_T < z_T$, a contradiction. NE is impossible.
- x E z: $z_R \le x_L, z_B \le x_B, x_T \le z_T$. Requires $z_B \le x_B$. From (B), $x_T \le z_B$. Since $x_B < x_T$, we have $x_B < x_T \le z_B$. This implies $x_B < z_B$. If $z_B \le x_B$, then $z_B \le x_B < z_B$, which is a contradiction. E is impossible.
- x SE z: $z_R \le x_L, x_T \le z_B$. These are exactly the two conditions (A and B) derived from the given relations. We need to check if it's possible to find regions x, y, z in REG whose bounding boxes satisfy the conditions for x E y and y SE z.
  Consider the bounding boxes:
  z: [0,1]x[5,6] ($z_L=0, z_R=1, z_B=5, z_T=6$)
  y: [1,2]x[3,4] ($y_L=1, y_R=2, y_B=3, y_T=4$)
  x: [3,4]x[3,4] ($x_L=3, x_R=4, x_B=3, x_T=4$)
  Check x E y: $y_R=2 \le x_L=3$ (True), $y_B=3 \le x_B=3$ (True), $x_T=4 \le y_T=4$ (True). So x E y is possible.
  Check y SE z: $z_R=1 \le y_L=1$ (True), $y_T=4 \le z_B=5$ (True). So y SE z is possible.
  Now check x SE z: $z_R=1 \le x_L=3$ (True), $x_T=4 \le z_B=5$ (True). So x SE z is possible.

Since the definition of single-tile relations is based solely on bounding boxes, and only the SE relation's conditions are necessary and sufficient based on the derived constraints, SE is the only possible relation.

The final answer is $\boxed{SE}$.

For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by `B(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
We are given the relations:
1. Region `x` is S of region `y`:
   - `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
   - `infx(y) <= infx(x)`
   - `supx(x) <= supx(y)`

2. Region `y` is NE of region `z`:
   - `supx(z) <= infx(y)`
   - `supy(z) <= infy(y)`

We want to find the possible relations between region `x` and region `z`. We need to compare the bounding box coordinates of `x` and `z`.

Let's combine the given inequalities:
From (1) and (2), we have:
- `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
- `supy(z) <= infy(y)`

This tells us that both `x` and `z` are located entirely below or touching the lower boundary of `y`'s y-projection.

Now let's look at the x-coordinates:
- `infx(y) <= infx(x)` (from x S y)
- `supx(z) <= infx(y)` (from y NE z)

Combining these two inequalities, we get:
`supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)`
So, `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.

This inequality means the maximum x-coordinate of `z` is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of `x`. In terms of cardinal directions, this implies that region `z` is located to the West of region `x`, or they are touching at their boundaries (the right boundary of `z` touching the left boundary of `x`).

Now let's consider the possible relationships between the y-projections of `x` and `z`, given that `supy(x) <= infy(y)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`. Let `infy(y)` be some value Y_min. Then `supy(x) <= Y_min` and `supy(z) <= Y_min`.
There are three main possibilities for the relative position of the y-intervals `[infy(x), supy(x)]` and `[infy(z), supy(z)]`:

Possibility A: Region `x` is below or touching the lower boundary of region `z`.
This corresponds to `supy(x) <= infy(z)`.
Is this possible given the constraints? Yes. For example, let `infy(y)=10`. We can choose `supy(x)=5`, `infy(x)=2` (satisfies `supy(x) <= 10`) and `supy(z)=8`, `infy(z)=6` (satisfies `supy(z) <= 10`). Here, `supy(x) = 5` and `infy(z) = 6`, so `supy(x) <= infy(z)` holds.

Possibility B: Region `x` overlaps with region `z` in the y-dimension.
This corresponds to `infy(z) <= supy(x)` and `infy(x) <= supy(z)` (and neither contains the other, but the definition of E handles overlap/containment).
Is this possible given the constraints? Yes. For example, let `infy(y)=10`. We can choose `infy(x)=3`, `supy(x)=7` (satisfies `supy(x) <= 10`) and `infy(z)=4`, `supy(z)=8` (satisfies `supy(z) <= 10`). Here, `infy(z)=4 <= supy(x)=7` and `infy(x)=3 <= supy(z)=8`. The y-intervals [3, 7] and [4, 8] overlap.

Possibility C: Region `x` is above or touching the upper boundary of region `z`.
This corresponds to `infy(x) >= supy(z)`.
Is this possible given the constraints? Yes. For example, let `infy(y)=10`. We can choose `infy(x)=6`, `supy(x)=8` (satisfies `supy(x) <= 10`) and `infy(z)=2`, `supy(z)=4` (satisfies `supy(z) <= 10`). Here, `infy(x) = 6` and `supy(z) = 4`, so `infy(x) >= supy(z)` holds.

Now we combine the x-constraint (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`) with the possible y-relations between `x` and `z`. The condition `supx(z) <= infx(x)` means that `x` is located to the East of `z` or touching its western boundary.

Let's check the definitions of the possible cardinal relations for `a = x` and `b = z`:
- `x W z`, `x NW z`, `x SW z`: These require `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. This contradicts `supx(z) <= infx(x)` unless `supx(x)=infx(z)` and `supx(z)=infx(x)`, which is impossible for non-degenerate regions (inf < sup). Thus, W, NW, SW are not possible.
- `x N z`, `x S z`, `x B z`: These require `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. From our derivation `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. If `supx(x) <= supx(z)` also holds, then `supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x)`. For non-degenerate regions, this implies `supx(x) = infx(x)`, which is a point, contradicting the definition of regions being homeomorphic to a closed unit disk (which have non-zero area and thus inf < sup). Thus, N, S, B are not possible.

The only remaining possibilities for x relative to z are E, NE, SE, which are consistent with the derived x-constraint `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.

Now let's match these with the y-possibilities:
- If `x` is above `z` in y-projection (Possibility C: `infy(x) >= supy(z)`) AND `x` is East of `z` in x-projection (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`), this corresponds to the **NE** relation (`a NE b` iff `supx(b) <= infx(a)` and `supy(b) <= infy(a)`). We showed this is possible.
- If `x` overlaps with `z` in y-projection (Possibility B: `infy(z) <= supy(x)` and `infy(x) <= supy(z)`) AND `x` is East of `z` in x-projection (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`), this corresponds to the **E** relation (`a E b` iff `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)` and `supy(a) <= supy(b)`). We showed this is possible.
- If `x` is below `z` in y-projection (Possibility A: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`) AND `x` is East of `z` in x-projection (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`), this corresponds to the **SE** relation (`a SE b` iff `supx(b) <= infx(a)` and `supy(a) <= infy(z)`). We showed this is possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region `x` and region `z` are NE, E, and SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, E, SE}$.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: S, B
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Let the bounding box of a region $a$ be defined by the intervals $[infx(a), supx(a)]$ on the x-axis and $[infy(a), supy(a)]$ on the y-axis. Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies their bounding boxes have positive width and height: $infx(a) < supx(a)$ and $infy(a) < supy(a)$.

We are given two relations:
1. Region $x$ is NW of region $y$: $x$ NW $y$.
   According to the definition:
   $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ (x is to the West of y horizontally, or they touch)
   $supy(y) \le infy(x)$ (x is to the North of y vertically, or they touch)

2. Region $y$ is N of region $z$: $y$ N $z$.
   According to the definition:
   $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ (y is to the North of z vertically, or they touch)
   $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ (y's x-projection overlaps or contains z's x-projection)
   $supx(y) \le supx(z)$ (y's x-projection overlaps or is contained by z's x-projection)

We want to find the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$ from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}. Let's analyze the vertical and horizontal relationships between $x$ and $z$ based on the given inequalities.

Vertical Relation between $x$ and $z$:
From $x$ NW $y$, we have $supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
From $y$ N $z$, we have $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.
Combining these, we get $supy(z) \le infy(y) \le supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
This implies $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
Since regions in REG have positive height, $infy(y) < supy(y)$.
Thus, the inequality chain is actually $supy(z) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(x)$.
This implies $supy(z) < infy(x)$ must hold strictly, unless $infy(y) = supy(y)$, which is not allowed for regions in REG.
So, the highest point of $z$ is strictly below the lowest point of $x$. This means $x$ is strictly North of $z$ vertically.
The vertical condition for $x$ relative to $z$ must be $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (which implies strict inequality due to REG property).
Looking at the definitions of the single-tile relations, the relations having this vertical condition are N, NW, and NE.

Horizontal Relation between $x$ and $z$:
From $x$ NW $y$, we have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
From $y$ N $z$, we have $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
Since regions in REG have positive width, $infx(y) < supx(y)$.
Thus, the inequality chain related to $y$'s horizontal extent is $infx(z) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
This means the horizontal projection of $y$ is contained within or is equal to the horizontal projection of $z$. $z$ horizontally contains $y$.

Now consider $x$'s horizontal position relative to $z$. We have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
Since $infx(y) \le supx(z)$ (from $infx(y) < supx(y) \le supx(z)$), we have $supx(x) \le infx(y) \le supx(z)$.
This implies $supx(x) \le supx(z)$. This means $x$ cannot be entirely to the East of $z$. E, SE, NE are ruled out horizontally.

Let's analyze possible horizontal relations between $x$ and $z$ based on $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(z) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le supx(z)$.
1. $x$ is West of $z$ (or touching): $supx(x) \le infx(z)$.
   From $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(z) \le infx(y)$.
   If $infx(z) = infx(y)$, then $supx(x) \le infx(y) = infx(z)$. This is possible. For example, let $infx(y)=5$, $supx(y)=10$, $infx(z)=5$, $supx(z)=12$. Let $supx(x)=4$. This satisfies $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (4<=5) and $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ (4<=5). This case corresponds to the horizontal condition for W, NW, SW.

2. $z$ horizontally contains $x$: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
   We already showed $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ is necessary.
   Is $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ possible?
   We know $infx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $infx(x) < supx(x) \le infx(y)$.
   Let $infx(y)=5$. $infx(z) \le 5$. $infx(x) < supx(x) \le 5$.
   Let $infx(z)=2$, $infx(x)=3$. This is possible ($2 \le 3$). Example: $y_x = [5,10]$, $z_x = [2,12]$, $x_x = [3,4]$. $infx(z)=2 \le infx(x)=3$ and $supx(x)=4 \le supx(z)=12$. This case corresponds to the horizontal condition for N, S, B.

3. $x$ overlaps $z$ (x starts West, ends within z): $infx(x) < infx(z)$ and $infx(z) < supx(x) < supx(z)$.
   Is $infx(x) < infx(z)$ possible? Yes. Let $infx(y)=5$. $infx(z) \le 5$. $infx(x) < supx(x) \le 5$.
   Let $infx(z)=3$, $infx(x)=1$. $1 < 3$ is possible.
   Is $infx(z) < supx(x)$ possible? Yes. Let $infx(y)=5$. $infx(z) \le 5$. $supx(x) \le 5$.
   Let $infx(z)=3$, $supx(x)=4$. $3 < 4$ is possible.
   Let $y_x = [5,10]$, $z_x = [3,12]$, $x_x = [1,4]$. $infx(x)=1 < infx(z)=3$, $infx(z)=3 < supx(x)=4$, $supx(x)=4 < supx(z)=12$. This case is geometrically possible.

So, possible horizontal relations between $x$ and $z$ are:
H1: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (West or Touching West)
H2: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (Z contains X horizontally or Equal)
H3: $infx(x) < infx(z)$ and $infx(z) < supx(x)$ and $supx(x) < supx(z)$ (X overlaps Z, West part)

Now we combine the mandatory vertical condition (V1: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$) with these possible horizontal conditions and check which single-tile relations match.

- N: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (V1) AND $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (H2).
  This combination of vertical and horizontal conditions is possible. So **N** is a possible relation.

- NW: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (H1) AND $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (V1).
  This combination of vertical and horizontal conditions is possible. So **NW** is a possible relation.

- NE: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (V1).
  Horizontal part $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ contradicts our finding that $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (strictly $supx(x) < supx(z)$ given REG). NE is not possible.

- S, SW, SE: These relations require the vertical condition $supy(x) \le infy(z)$. Our derivation $supy(z) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$ leads to $supy(x) > infy(x) > supy(z) > infy(z)$, so $supy(x) > infy(z)$. These relations are not possible.

- W, E, B: These relations require the vertical condition $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ AND $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
  We have $infy(z) < supy(z) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(x) < supy(x)$.
  $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ is satisfied.
  $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ contradicts $supy(z) < supy(x)$. These relations are not possible.

The horizontal overlap case H3 (infx(x) < infx(z) AND infx(z) < supx(x) AND supx(x) < supx(z)) combined with the vertical condition V1 describes a valid spatial relationship between $x$ and $z$ based on the bounding boxes. However, this combination of bounding box relations does not match the definition of any of the 9 single-tile relations provided in the problem statement. Since the possible answers must come from the given list, this case, although geometrically possible, must not correspond to one of the listed relations. The problem asks for possible relations *from the given list*.

Therefore, the possible relations between region $x$ and region $z$ from the provided list are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: B W NW N NE E
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: The given relations are:
1. x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) AND supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(y) AND supx(y) <= supx(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze the constraints on their bounding boxes:

From (1a): supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (1b): supy(y) <= infy(x)
From (2a): supy(y) <= infy(z)
From (2b): infx(z) <= infx(y)
From (2c): supx(y) <= supx(z)

Consider the x-coordinates of x and z: infx(x), supx(x), infx(z), supx(z).
From (1a) supx(x) <= infx(y).
From (2b) infx(z) <= infx(y).
From (2c) supx(y) <= supx(z).

Let's check if the relation x E z, x NE z, or x SE z is possible. These require supx(z) <= infx(x).
If supx(z) <= infx(x), then from (2c), supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). So supx(y) <= infx(x).
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
For regions homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, the projection on an axis is a closed interval [inf, sup] where inf < sup (non-degenerate).
If supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), for non-degenerate intervals, this can only be satisfied if the intervals [infx(x), supx(x)] and [infx(y), supx(y)] are disjoint and x is to the left of y (supx(x) < infx(y)) and y is to the left of x (supx(y) < infx(x)). This is a contradiction. The only way the inequalities hold without strict inequality for non-degenerate intervals is if infx(x)=supx(x) and infx(y)=supx(y), meaning they are points, which is not the case for regions in REG.
Thus, the assumption supx(z) <= infx(x) leads to a contradiction for regions in REG.
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible.
This rules out the relations E, NE, and SE between x and z.

The remaining possible relations are N, S, B, NW, W, SW. We need to check if each of these is possible by finding a configuration of regions x, y, and z that satisfy the initial conditions (x NW y and y S z) and the relation being tested.

- N (x N z): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[2,3]x[5,6], y=[4,5]x[3,4], z=[1,6]x[4.5, 4.8].

- S (x S z): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[2,3]x[3,4], y=[4,5]x[1,2], z=[1,6]x[5,6].

- B (x B z): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[2,3]x[3,4], y=[4,5]x[1,2], z=[1,6]x[3,5].

- NW (x NW z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  Possible. Example: x=[1,2]x[5,6], y=[3,4]x[3,4], z=[3,5]x[4.5, 4.8].

- W (x W z): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[1,2]x[3,4], y=[3,4]x[1,2], z=[3,5]x[3,5].

- SW (x SW z): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  Possible. Example: x=[1,2]x[3,4], y=[3,4]x[1,2], z=[3,5]x[5,6].

All relations N, S, B, NW, W, SW are possible. E, NE, SE are not possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, B, NW, W, SW.

N, S, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: NW, W, SW
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: N, NE, NW
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: N, NW, W, B
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: S, SW, W, NW, N, B
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: SW, W
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: B, S, SW, W, E, SE
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: The given information is:
1.  x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) AND supy(x) <= infy(y)
2.  y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(y) AND supx(y) <= supx(z)
All regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies their bounding box has positive width and height (i.e., infx < supx and infy < supy for any region).

Let's combine the inequalities:
From x SW y:
(1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
(2) supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y S z:
(3) supy(y) <= infy(z)
(4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
(5) supx(y) <= supx(z)

Also, for any region a in REG, we know infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a).

Combining (2) and (3), using infy(y) < supy(y):
supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(z)
Thus, we get:
(A) supy(x) < infy(z).
This implies the y-projection of x is strictly below the y-projection of z. This eliminates any relation where the y-intervals overlap or x's y-interval is above z's y-interval. The relations that require supy(x) <= infy(z) are S, SW, SE. The relations that require overlapping y-intervals (infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z)) are W, E, B. As argued in the thought process, supy(x) < infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) for regions with positive height. The relations that require supy(z) <= infy(x) are N, NW, NE. supy(x) < infy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x).
So, only S, SW, SE are possible based on the y-axis relation.

Now consider the x-axis relations for S, SW, SE:
- S (x S z): requires infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z)
- SW (x SW z): requires supx(x) <= infx(z)
- SE (x SE z): requires supx(z) <= infx(x)

Let's see what we can derive about the x-bounds of x and z.
From (1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
From (4) infx(z) <= infx(y)
From (5) supx(y) <= supx(z)
Also, infx(y) < supx(y).

Combining (1) and (5), using infx(y) < supx(y):
supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= supx(z)
Thus, we get:
(B) supx(x) < supx(z).
This confirms the second condition required for S.

Now let's check the remaining conditions for S, SW, SE using (1), (4), and (B).

For S (x S z), we need infx(z) <= infx(x).
From (4), infx(z) <= infx(y).
From (1), supx(x) <= infx(y).
It is possible for infx(z) <= infx(x) to hold given these conditions. For example, if infx(y) = 10, we can have infx(z) = 5 and infx(x) = 8. Both 5 <= 10 and 8 <= 10 are true, and 5 <= 8 is true.
Let's construct a valid example:
Let y = [10, 20] x [10, 20].
For x SW y, supx(x) <= 10 and supy(x) <= 10. Let x = [-10, -5] x [0, 5]. supx(x)=-5<=10, supy(x)=5<=10. x SW y holds.
For y S z, supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z). 20 <= infy(z), infx(z) <= 10, 20 <= supx(z).
Let z = [-20, 25] x [30, 40]. infy(z)=30>=20, infx(z)=-20<=10, supx(z)=25>=20. y S z holds.
Now check x S z for x=[-10,-5]x[0,5] and z=[-20,25]x[30,40]:
supy(x)=5 <= infy(z)=30 (True, actually 5 < 30).
infx(z)=-20 <= infx(x)=-10 (True).
supx(x)=-5 <= supx(z)=25 (True, consistent with (B)).
All conditions for S are met. S is possible.

For SW (x SW z), we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
From (1), supx(x) <= infx(y).
From (4), infx(z) <= infx(y).
It is possible for supx(x) <= infx(z) to hold given these conditions. For example, if infx(y) = 10, we can have supx(x) = 5 and infx(z) = 8. Both 5 <= 10 and 8 <= 10 are true, and 5 <= 8 is true.
Let's construct a valid example:
Let y = [10, 20] x [10, 20].
For x SW y, supx(x) <= 10 and supy(x) <= 10. Let x = [0, 5] x [0, 5]. supx(x)=5<=10, supy(x)=5<=10. x SW y holds.
For y S z, supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z). 20 <= infy(z), infx(z) <= 10, 20 <= supx(z).
Let z = [8, 25] x [30, 40]. infy(z)=30>=20, infx(z)=8<=10, supx(z)=25>=20. y S z holds.
Now check x SW z for x=[0,5]x[0,5] and z=[8,25]x[30,40]:
supy(x)=5 <= infy(z)=30 (True, actually 5 < 30).
supx(x)=5 <= infx(z)=8 (True).
All conditions for SW are met. SW is possible.

For SE (x SE z), we need supx(z) <= infx(x).
From (B), we know supx(x) < supx(z).
For any region in REG, infx(x) < supx(x).
Combining these, infx(x) < supx(x) < supx(z).
This directly contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x).
Thus, SE is not possible for regions in REG.

Based on the analysis, the only possible relations between region x and region z are S and SW.

The final answer is $\boxed{S, SW}$.
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: W, NW, SW
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Let $MBB(a)$ denote the minimum bounding box of a region $a$, given by the rectangle $[infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$. For any region $a \in REG$ (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk), its MBB must have positive width and height, meaning $infx(a) < supx(a)$ and $infy(a) < supy(a)$.

We are given that region $x$ is SW of region $y$ ($x$ SW $y$), and region $y$ is SE of region $z$ ($y$ SE $z$). Let's write these relations using the definitions based on MBBs:
1.  $x$ SW $y$: $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ AND $supy(x) \le infy(y)$
2.  $y$ SE $z$: $supx(y) \le infx(z)$ AND $supy(y) \le infy(z)$

Let's analyze the implications of these conditions for the relationship between $x$ and $z$.
From condition 1, we have $supx(x) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(y)$.
From condition 2, we have $supx(y) \le infx(z)$ and $supy(y) \le infy(z)$.

Since $y \in REG$, we know that $infx(y) < supx(y)$ and $infy(y) < supy(y)$.

Combining the inequalities for the x-coordinates:
$supx(x) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le infx(z)$
This implies $supx(x) < infx(z)$.

Combining the inequalities for the y-coordinates:
$supy(x) \le infy(y) < supy(y) \le infy(z)$
This implies $supy(x) < infy(z)$.

So, the premises $x$ SW $y$ and $y$ SE $z$ imply that $supx(x) < infx(z)$ and $supy(x) < infy(z)$.
This means that the maximum x-coordinate of region $x$ is strictly less than the minimum x-coordinate of region $z$, and the maximum y-coordinate of region $x$ is strictly less than the minimum y-coordinate of region $z$.
In terms of minimum bounding boxes, MBB(x) is located strictly to the west of MBB(z) and strictly to the south of MBB(z). The two bounding boxes are strictly disjoint.

Now let's check which of the possible cardinal relations between $x$ and $z$ are consistent with the derived strict inequalities $supx(x) < infx(z)$ and $supy(x) < infy(z)$.
We check each relation definition:
-   $x$ B $z$: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ contradicts $supx(x) < infx(z)$ (since $infx(x) < supx(x)$). Impossible.
-   $x$ S $z$: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ is true (since $supy(x) < infy(z)$).
    $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ contradicts $supx(x) < infx(z)$. Impossible.
-   $x$ SW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ AND $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
    $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is true (since $supx(x) < infx(z)$).
    $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ is true (since $supy(x) < infy(z)$).
    So, $x$ SW $z$ is always true.
-   $x$ W $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is true.
    Requires $infy(z) \le infy(x)$. But we know $supy(x) < infy(z)$. If $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, then $supy(x) < infy(z) \le infy(x)$, which contradicts $infy(x) < supy(x)$. Impossible.
-   $x$ NW $z$: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ AND $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is true.
    Requires $supy(z) \le infy(x)$. But we know $supy(x) < infy(z)$ and $infy(z) < supy(z)$. Thus $supy(x) < supy(z)$.
    If $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, then $supy(z) \le infy(x) < supy(x) < infy(z) < supy(z)$, which gives $supy(z) < supy(z)$. Impossible.
-   $x$ N $z$: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
    Requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$. Contradicts $supx(x) < infx(z)$. Impossible.
-   $x$ NE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
    Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. But $infx(x) < supx(x) < infx(z) < supx(z)$. This implies $supx(z) \le infx(x) < supx(x) < infx(z) < supx(z)$, which gives $supx(z) < supx(z)$. Impossible.
-   $x$ E $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
    Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. Impossible as shown for NE.
-   $x$ SE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ AND $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
    $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ is true.
    Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$. Impossible as shown for NE.

The only relation that is consistent with the derived strict inequalities $supx(x) < infx(z)$ and $supy(x) < infy(z)$ is SW. Since the definition of SW is $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ AND $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, and we have derived the strictly stronger conditions, SW is always true. The other relations require conditions (like overlap or reversed relative position in one dimension) that contradict the derived strict separation.

Given the definitions and the properties of regions in REG, the only possible relation between region $x$ and region $z$ is SW.

SW
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: S, SW, W, B
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: The given relations are:
1.  `x SE y`: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
2.  `y N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(y)`, `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, and `supx(y) <= supx(z)`

Let's analyze the possible bounding box relations between x and z based on these inequalities.

From `x SE y`, x is horizontally to the East of or aligned with the East boundary of y. `infx(x) >= supx(y)`.
From `y N z`, y is horizontally overlapping or to the East of z on the left side (`infx(z) <= infx(y)`) and overlapping or to the West of z on the right side (`supx(y) <= supx(z)`).

Combining these, we have the horizontal inequalities:
`infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`
`supx(y) <= supx(z)`
`supx(y) <= infx(x)`

From `infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`, we deduce `infx(z) <= infx(x)`. This means the west boundary of x is never to the west of the west boundary of z.

Consider the horizontal relation `x W z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
If this holds, then `supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(y)`. So `supx(x) <= infx(y)`.
Also, from `x SE y`, we have `supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
For non-degenerate regions homeomorphic to a disk, their bounding boxes have non-zero width, so `infx(x) < supx(x)` and `infx(y) < supx(y)`.
So, if `x W z` holds, we have `infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)`. This chain of inequalities `infx(x) < ... <= infx(x)` is a contradiction.
Therefore, `x W z` is impossible for non-degenerate regions.
Similarly, `x SW z` and `x NW z` are impossible as they require `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.

The possible remaining relations are {B, S, N, NE, E, SE}. Let's check if each of these is possible by constructing example regions.

Vertical relations between x and z:
From `supy(x) <= infy(y)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`, both x and z are vertically below or aligned with the southern boundary of y.

-   Can `x N z` be true? (`supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 5]x[0, 1], `y`=[1, 4]x[2, 3]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[4, 5]x[1.5, 2]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=4 >= supx(y)=4`, `supy(x)=2 <= infy(y)=2`).
    Check `x N z`: `supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1.5` (True), `infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=4` (True), `supx(x)=5 <= supx(z)=5` (True).
    So, `x N z` is possible.

-   Can `x S z` be true? (`supy(x) <= infy(z)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 5]x[1, 2], `y`=[1, 4]x[3, 4]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[4, 5]x[0, 1]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=4 >= supx(y)=4`, `supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=3`).
    Check `x S z`: `supy(x)=1 <= infy(z)=1` (True), `infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=4` (True), `supx(x)=5 <= supx(z)=5` (True).
    So, `x S z` is possible.

-   Can `x B z` be true? (`infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 5]x[0, 5], `y`=[1, 4]x[6, 7]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[4, 5]x[0, 5]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=4 >= supx(y)=4`, `supy(x)=5 <= infy(y)=6`).
    Check `x B z`: `infx(z)=0 <= infx(x)=4` (True), `supx(x)=5 <= supx(z)=5` (True), `infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0` (True), `supy(x)=5 <= supy(z)=5` (True).
    So, `x B z` is possible.

-   Can `x E z` be true? (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 4]x[0, 1], `y`=[1, 3]x[2, 3]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[4, 5]x[0, 1]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=4 >= supx(y)=3`, `supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=2`).
    Check `x E z`: `supx(z)=4 <= infx(x)=4` (True), `infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=0` (True), `supy(x)=1 <= supy(z)=1` (True).
    So, `x E z` is possible.

-   Can `x SE z` be true? (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[0, 1]x[0, 1], `y`=[0, 1]x[2, 3]. `y N z` is true.
    Let `x`=[2, 3]x[-1, 0]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=2 >= supx(y)=1`, `supy(x)=0 <= infy(y)=2`).
    Check `x SE z`: `supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (True), `supy(x)=0 <= infy(z)=0` (True).
    So, `x SE z` is possible.

-   Can `x NE z` be true? (`supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supy(z) <= infy(x)`)
    Example: Let `z`=[-1, 1]x[0, 0.5], `y`=[0, 1]x[1, 1]. `y N z` is true. (Using epsilon=1 for simplicity)
    Let `x`=[2, 3]x[0.5, 1]. `x SE y` is true (`infx(x)=2 >= supx(y)=1`, `supy(x)=1 <= infy(y)=1`).
    Check `x NE z`: `supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=2` (True), `supy(z)=0.5 <= infy(x)=0.5` (True).
    So, `x NE z` is possible.

We have shown that B, S, N, SE, NE, E are all possible relations between x and z. We have also shown that W, SW, NW are impossible for non-degenerate regions.

The possible relations are B, S, N, SE, NE, E.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, B}$.
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: SE, S, E, W, SW, B
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: E, SE
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: S SE
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: SE
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: Let the bounding box of a region $r$ be defined by the intervals $[infx(r), supx(r)]$ on the x-axis and $[infy(r), supy(r)]$ on the y-axis. Regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, implying $infx(r) < supx(r)$ and $infy(r) < supy(r)$ for any region $r$.

We are given the following relations:
1. `x SE y`: By definition, $supx(y) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(y)$.
2. `y NE z`: By definition, $supx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.

Let's analyze the constraints on the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

From the x-coordinates:
We have $supx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
Since $y$ is a region homeomorphic to a disk, its x-projection has non-zero width, so $infx(y) < supx(y)$.
Combining the inequalities, we get:
$supx(z) \le infx(y) < supx(y) \le infx(x)$.
This implies $supx(z) < infx(x)$.
If we allow boundaries to touch, the relation is $supx(z) \le infx(x)$.

This inequality, $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, means that the right edge of the bounding box of z is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of the bounding box of x. This geometric configuration corresponds to relations where the first region is East of the second region.

Let's examine the definitions of the cardinal relations between `x` and `z` based on this finding:
- `x S z`: Requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (overlap in x-projection). $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ contradicts $infx(x) \le supx(z)$ unless $infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z)$, which is not possible for regions with positive area. So, S is not possible.
- `x SW z`: Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. This contradicts $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ unless $infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z)$, which is not possible. So, SW is not possible.
- `x W z`: Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. Not possible for the same reason as SW.
- `x NW z`: Requires $supx(x) \le infx(z)$. Not possible for the same reason as SW.
- `x N z`: Requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (overlap in x-projection). Not possible for the same reason as S.
- `x B z`: Requires $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (overlap in x-projection, containment). Not possible for the same reason as S.

The only relations that can satisfy $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ are those where x is located to the East of z (or touching). These are:
- `x E z`: Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
- `x NE z`: Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
- `x SE z`: Requires $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.

Since $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ is always true given the premises, we only need to check if the conditions on the y-coordinates are possible for each of E, NE, and SE.

From the y-coordinates:
We have $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.
This means both the top edge of x and the top edge of z are below or aligned with the bottom edge of y. This does not impose a strict ordering between the y-intervals of x and z.

Let's check if we can construct scenarios that satisfy the y-conditions for E, NE, and SE:

- For `x E z`: We need $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ AND $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
  Let $infy(y) = 100$. $supy(x) \le 100$, $supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(x) = 50$, $supy(x) = 60$. (Condition $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ holds: $60 \le 100$).
  We need $infy(z) \le 50$ and $60 \le supy(z)$. Also $infy(z) < supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(z) = 40$, $supy(z) = 70$. (Condition $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ holds: $70 \le 100$).
  $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ ($40 \le 50$) holds. $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ ($60 \le 70$) holds.
  This configuration is possible for the y-coordinates. Since the x-condition ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$) is always true, `x E z` is possible.

- For `x NE z`: We need $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
  Let $infy(y) = 100$. $supy(x) \le 100$, $supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(x) = 60$, $supy(x) = 70$. (Condition $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ holds: $70 \le 100$).
  We need $supy(z) \le 60$. Also $infy(z) < supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(z) = 40$, $supy(z) = 50$. (Condition $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ holds: $50 \le 100$).
  $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ ($50 \le 60$) holds.
  This configuration is possible for the y-coordinates. `x NE z` is possible.

- For `x SE z`: We need $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
  Let $infy(y) = 100$. $supy(x) \le 100$, $supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(x) = 40$, $supy(x) = 50$. (Condition $supy(x) \le infy(y)$ holds: $50 \le 100$).
  We need $50 \le infy(z)$. Also $infy(z) < supy(z) \le 100$.
  Let $infy(z) = 60$, $supy(z) = 70$. (Condition $supy(z) \le infy(y)$ holds: $70 \le 100$).
  $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ ($50 \le 60$) holds.
  This configuration is possible for the y-coordinates. `x SE z` is possible.

Since E, NE, and SE are the only relations consistent with the x-coordinate constraint ($supx(z) \le infx(x)$), and we have shown that the y-coordinate constraints for E, NE, and SE are all possible given the initial conditions, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

The possible relations are E, NE, SE.

E, NE, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, NE, SE}$.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: B, S, E, SE
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: N, NE
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Let [infx(r), supx(r)] and [infy(r), supy(r)] denote the minimum bounding box of a region r on the x and y axes, respectively.
The given relations are defined based on these bounding boxes. Regions being homeomorphic to a closed unit disk implies their bounding boxes are non-degenerate rectangles, meaning inf < sup for both x and y bounds.

We are given:
1.  x NE y:
    -   supx(y) <= infx(x)
    -   supy(y) <= infy(x)

2.  y W z:
    -   supx(z) <= infx(y)
    -   infy(z) <= infy(y)
    -   supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's combine the inequalities:

From supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x). This means the right edge of z's bounding box is to the left of or touching the left edge of x's bounding box.

From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
Therefore, infy(z) <= infy(x). This means the bottom edge of z's bounding box is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of x's bounding box.

Now let's check the definitions of the cardinal relations x R z (where 'a' in the definition is x and 'b' is z) based on the derived inequalities:

-   x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    From infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) >= infy(x) (for non-degenerate regions), we have supy(x) >= infy(x) >= infy(z). So supy(x) <= infy(z) is not possible for non-degenerate regions. S is not possible.

-   x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    From supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) >= infx(x), we have supx(x) >= infx(x) >= supx(z). So supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible for non-degenerate regions (requires x's right edge <= z's left edge, but z's right edge <= x's left edge). SW is not possible.

-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions. W is not possible.

-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions. NW is not possible.

-   x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible (we know infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(z) >= supy(y)).
    infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) means the horizontal interval of x is contained within the horizontal interval of z.
    However, we derived supx(z) <= infx(x). For a non-degenerate interval [infx(x), supx(x)] to be contained within [infx(z), supx(z)] (i.e., infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) while simultaneously supx(z) <= infx(x), requires infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z) = supx(z). This implies point regions, which are degenerate. N is not possible for non-degenerate regions.

-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is derived. Yes.
    supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible (e.g., supy(y)=3, supy(z)=4, infy(x)=5). Yes.
    NE is possible.

-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is derived. Yes.
    infy(z) <= infy(x) is derived. Yes.
    supy(x) <= supy(z) is possible (e.g., supy(y)=3, supy(z)=5, infy(x)=4, supy(x)=4.5). Yes.
    E is possible.

-   x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is derived. Yes.
    supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) for non-degenerate regions. SE is not possible.

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) for non-degenerate regions (requires x's horizontal bbox contained in z's, while z's is to the left of x's). B is not possible.

Based on the bounding box definitions and assuming non-degenerate regions (as implied by homeomorphism to a closed unit disk), the only possible relations are NE and E.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, E}$.
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. The given relations are:
1. x is NE of y (x NE y)
2. y is E of z (y E z)

From the definitions of these relations based on the minimum bounding box bounds:
x NE y means:
(NE.1) supx(y) <= infx(x)
(NE.2) supy(y) <= infy(x)

y E z means:
(E.1) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(E.2) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(E.3) supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations R between x and z (x R z) from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. These relations are also defined based on the bounds.

Let's combine the inequalities to derive constraints on the bounds of x relative to the bounds of z.

From (E.1) and (NE.1):
supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
Assuming regions in REG have non-zero width (infx < supx), we have infx(y) <= supx(y).
Chaining the inequalities: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
This implies supx(z) <= infx(x).
This is a necessary condition for x R z. Geometrically, it means the x-projection of x starts at or to the East of the point supx(z).

From (E.2), (E.3), and (NE.2):
infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z), and supy(y) <= infy(x).
Assuming regions in REG have non-zero height (infy < supy), we have infy(y) <= supy(y).
Chaining the inequalities: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
This implies infy(z) <= infy(x).
This is another necessary condition for x R z. Geometrically, it means the y-projection of x starts at or above the point infy(z).

So, for any relation R between x and z to be possible, the bounding boxes of x and z must satisfy:
(C.1) infx(x) >= supx(z)
(C.2) infy(x) >= infy(z)

Now let's examine each possible relation R for x R z and check if it's compatible with these necessary conditions (C.1) and (C.2), considering that regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which allows for degenerate cases like a single point. Let z be a non-degenerate region as per condition iv) in the definition of cardinal direction relations which applies to "any reference region b".

- x B z: infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(x)<=supx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(x)<=supy(z).
  Requires infx(z)<=infx(x) and supx(x)<=supx(z). With (C.1) infx(x) >= supx(z), this implies infx(z)<=infx(x) and supx(x)<=supx(z)<=infx(x). This can only hold if infx(x)=supx(z) and supx(x)<=supx(z). For a non-degenerate region x (infx(x)<supx(x)), this is impossible. It is possible if x is a degenerate region, specifically a 0-width line or point located at x = supx(z), and contained vertically within z's bounds. Such a point region is in REG. Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [1,2]x[0,1], x = point (1, 0.5). x B z holds. This is possible.

- x S z: supy(x)<=infy(z), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(a)<=supx(b).
  Requires supy(x)<=infy(z). With (C.2) infy(x) >= infy(z), this implies supy(x)<=infy(z)<=infy(x). For a non-degenerate region x (infy(x)<supy(x)), this is impossible. It is possible if x is a degenerate point region (px, py) located at y = infy(z) (so py = infy(z)), and horizontally within z's bounds or on its East edge (due to C.1). Specifically, need infx(z)<=px<=supx(z) and px>=supx(z). This implies px=supx(z). Possible if x is the point (supx(z), infy(z)) (bottom-right corner of z's bounding box). Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [1,2]x[0,1], x = point (1, 0). x S z holds. This is possible.

- x SW z: supx(x)<=infx(z), supy(x)<=infy(z).
  Requires supx(x)<=infx(z) and supy(x)<=infy(z). With (C.1) infx(x)>=supx(z), this requires supx(x)<=infx(z)<supx(z)<=infx(x) (assuming non-degenerate z). This implies supx(x)<infx(x), impossible for non-degenerate x. If x is a point, px<=infx(z) and px>=supx(z), impossible for non-degenerate z. SW is not possible.

- x W z: supx(x)<=infx(z), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(a)<=supy(b).
  Requires supx(x)<=infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW. W is not possible.

- x NW z: supx(x)<=infx(z), supy(b)<=infy(a).
  Requires supx(x)<=infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW. NW is not possible.

- x N z: supy(z)<=infy(x), infx(z)<=infx(x), supx(a)<=supx(b).
  Requires infx(z)<=infx(x) and supx(x)<=supx(z). With (C.1) infx(x)>=supx(z), this is only possible if x is a 0-width line or point located at x=supx(z) (as shown for B). Requires supy(z)<=infy(x) (compatible with C.2). Possible if x is a point (supx(z), py) with py >= supy(z). Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [1,2]x[0,1], x = point (1, 2). x N z holds. This is possible.

- x NE z: supx(z)<=infx(x), supy(z)<=infy(x).
  Compatible with (C.1) and (C.2). Can be satisfied for non-degenerate regions. Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [2,3]x[0,1], x = [4,5]x[2,3]. x NE y (3<=4, 1<=2), y E z (1<=2, 0<=0, 1<=1). x NE z (1<=4, 1<=2). NE is possible.

- x E z: supx(z)<=infx(x), infy(z)<=infy(x), supy(a)<=supy(b).
  Compatible with (C.1) and (C.2) except for supy(a)<=supy(b) (supy(x)<=supy(z)). Can be satisfied for non-degenerate regions. Example: z = [0,5]x[0,10], y = [6,7]x[5,6], x = [8,9]x[7,9]. x NE y (7<=8, 6<=7), y E z (5<=6, 0<=5, 6<=10). x E z (5<=8, 0<=7, 9<=10). E is possible.

- x SE z: supx(z)<=infx(x), supy(x)<=infy(b).
  Requires supy(x)<=infy(z). Impossible for non-degenerate x as shown for S. Possible if x is a point (px, py) located at y=infy(z) (so py=infy(z)) and starting at or after supx(z) horizontally (px>=supx(z)). Example: z = [0,1]x[0,1], y = [1,2]x[0,1], x = point (2, 0). x SE z holds. This is possible.

Considering that regions can be degenerate points, the possible relations are B, S, N, NE, E, SE.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, SE, S, E, B}$.
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: NE, N, E, SE, S, B
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: Let x NE y and y NW z. The definitions of these cardinal relations based on the minimum bounding boxes (BB) are as follows:

x NE y:
supx(y) <= infx(x)  (The East boundary of BB(y) is less than or equal to the West boundary of BB(x))
supy(y) <= infy(x)  (The North boundary of BB(y) is less than or equal to the South boundary of BB(x))

y NW z:
supx(z) <= infx(y)  (The East boundary of BB(z) is less than or equal to the West boundary of BB(y))
supy(z) <= infy(y)  (The North boundary of BB(z) is less than or equal to the South boundary of BB(y))

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they have positive area. Therefore, their bounding boxes must have positive width and height.
infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

Combining the inequalities:
From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y NW z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
We also know infx(y) < supx(y).
So, supx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x).
This chain of inequalities implies supx(z) < infx(x).

Similarly, combining the vertical inequalities:
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y NW z, we have supy(z) <= infy(y).
We also know infy(y) < supy(y).
So, supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
This chain of inequalities implies supy(z) < infy(x).

Thus, for any regions x, y, z from REG satisfying x NE y and y NW z, the bounding boxes of x and z must satisfy the strict inequalities:
1) supx(z) < infx(x)
2) supy(z) < infy(x)

Now let's examine the definitions of the possible cardinal relations R between x and z (x R z) and check which ones are compatible with these necessary strict inequalities.

x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) (compatible with supy(z) < infy(x)).
   Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   If supx(x) <= supx(z) holds, combined with supx(z) < infx(x), we get supx(x) < infx(x). This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x) for regions in REG. Thus, x N z is impossible.

x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both are compatible with the necessary strict inequalities supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(z) < infy(x). This relation is possible (e.g., BB(y)=[0,1]x[0,1], BB(x)=[2,3]x[2,3], BB(z)=[-2,-1]x[-2,-1] satisfies x NE y, y NW z and x NE z).

x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (compatible).
   Requires infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   If supy(x) <= supy(z) holds, combined with supy(z) < infy(x), we get supy(x) < infy(x). This contradicts infy(x) < supy(x) for regions in REG. Thus, x E z is impossible.

x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) (compatible).
   Requires supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We have supy(z) < infy(x). Can supy(x) <= infy(z) hold? Let's try to construct y.
   We need to find infx(y), supx(y), infy(y), supy(y) such that:
   supx(y) <= infx(x), supy(y) <= infy(x) (for x NE y)
   supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(z) <= infy(y) (for y NW z)
   And supy(x) <= infy(z) (for x SE z).
   We need infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) < infy(x), which we already know.
   We also need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Can we find y such that supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)?
   Let's check the vertical constraints on y: infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x). This implies the interval [infy(y), supy(y)] must be within [supy(z), infy(x)]. Since infy(y) < supy(y), this interval must have positive length. So supy(z) < infy(x).
   If supy(x) <= infy(z), then the interval [supy(z), infy(x)] contains the interval [supy(z), infy(z)], which contains supy(x).
   We need to be able to place BB(y) vertically such that infy(y) >= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
   Consider the condition supy(x) <= infy(z). We also have infy(z) < supy(z) (if z is in REG). This implies supy(x) < supy(z).
   But we know infy(x) > supy(z).
   Can supy(x) <= infy(z) hold? Example: BB(x)=[..]x[5,6], BB(z)=[..]x[0,1]. supy(x)=6, infy(z)=0. No.
   Example: BB(x)=[..]x[0,1], BB(z)=[..]x[2,3]. supy(x)=1, infy(z)=2. Yes.
   Let BB(x) = [2, 3]x[0, 1], BB(z) = [0, 1]x[2, 3]. x SE z holds (supx(z)=1<=infx(x)=2, supy(x)=1<=infy(z)=2).
   x NE y requires supx(y) <= 2, supy(y) <= 0.
   y NW z requires supx(z)=1 <= infx(y), supy(z)=3 <= infy(y).
   So we need supy(y) <= 0 and infy(y) >= 3. This implies 3 <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= 0, so 3 <= 0, impossible. Thus, x SE z is impossible.

x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible as shown for SE.
   Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Impossible as shown for N.
   Thus, x S z is impossible.

x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Requires supy(x) <= infy(z). Impossible as shown for SE.
   Requires supx(x) <= infx(z).
   Let's try to construct y. We need infx(y) >= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
   We also need supx(x) <= infx(z).
   Can supx(x) <= infx(z) hold when infx(x) > supx(z)? Yes. Example: BB(x)=[0,1]x[..], BB(z)=[2,3]x[..]. supx(x)=1, infx(z)=2. Yes.
   Let BB(x) = [0, 1]x[1, 2], BB(z) = [2, 3]x[2, 3]. x SW z holds (supx(x)=1<=infx(z)=2, supy(x)=2<=infy(z)=2).
   x NE y requires supx(y) <= 0, supy(y) <= 1.
   y NW z requires supx(z)=3 <= infx(y), supy(z)=2 <= infy(y).
   So we need supx(y) <= 0 and infx(y) >= 3. This implies 3 <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= 0, so 3 <= 0, impossible. Thus, x SW z is impossible.

x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW.
   Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). Impossible as shown for E.
   Thus, x W z is impossible.

x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Requires supx(x) <= infx(z). Impossible as shown for SW.
   Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) (compatible).
   Thus, x NW z is impossible.

x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Requires supx(x) <= supx(z). Impossible as shown for N.
   Requires supy(x) <= supy(z). Impossible as shown for E.
   Thus, x B z is impossible.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: NE, SE, E
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: N, NE, E, B
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG. We are given two conditions:
1.  x B y
2.  y E z

We need to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's translate the given conditions into inequalities using the definitions of the bounding box coordinates:

From the definition of x B y:
(B1) infx(y) <= infx(x)
(B2) supx(x) <= supx(y)
(B3) infy(y) <= infy(x)
(B4) supy(x) <= supy(y)

From the definition of y E z:
(E1) supx(z) <= infx(y)
(E2) infy(z) <= infy(y)
(E3) supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's combine these inequalities to find the relationship between the bounding box coordinates of x and z.

Combine (E1) and (B1):
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
This gives us:
(XZ1) supx(z) <= infx(x)

Combine (E2) and (B3):
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
This gives us:
(XZ2) infy(z) <= infy(x)

Combine (B4) and (E3):
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
This gives us:
(XZ3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, from the given conditions, we derived the following necessary conditions for the relationship between x and z:
(XZ1) supx(z) <= infx(x)
(XZ2) infy(z) <= infy(x)
(XZ3) supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now let's check which of the possible single-tile cardinal relations between x and z are consistent with these derived conditions. The definitions for x R z are:

-   **x B z**: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    XZ2 and XZ3 match the y-conditions for B. For the x-conditions, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). However, we derived XZ1: supx(z) <= infx(x). If x B z also holds, then supx(x) <= supx(z). Combining this with XZ1, we get supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x). Since regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed disk, they have a positive horizontal extent, meaning supx(x) > infx(x). Thus, supx(x) <= infx(x) is impossible for regions in REG. So, x B z is impossible.

-   **x S z**: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    We derived XZ3: supy(x) <= supy(z) and XZ2: infy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) holds, then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(x) <= infy(x). This is impossible for regions in REG (positive vertical extent). So, x S z is impossible.

-   **x SW z**: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    The second condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), is impossible as shown for S. So, x SW z is impossible.

-   **x W z**: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    XZ2 and XZ3 match the y-conditions for W. For the x-condition, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). We derived XZ1: supx(z) <= infx(x). If x W z also holds, then supx(x) <= infx(z). For regions with positive horizontal extent, it is impossible to have supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) simultaneously, unless they are the same vertical line segment or point, which is not allowed for regions in REG. So, x W z is impossible.

-   **x NW z**: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is impossible as shown for W. So, x NW z is impossible.

-   **x N z**: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
    The first condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), implies supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) (using XZ3), which means supy(x) <= infy(x). This is impossible for regions in REG. So, x N z is impossible.

-   **x NE z**: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
    The first condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), matches XZ1, which we derived. The second condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), is impossible as shown for N. So, x NE z is impossible.

-   **x E z**: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
    These are exactly the three conditions (XZ1, XZ2, XZ3) that we derived from the premises x B y and y E z.
    Since these conditions are necessary consequences of the premises, x E z must hold whenever x B y and y E z hold.
    We can construct an example: Let z be the unit disk centered at (0,0), y be a disk centered at (3,0) with radius 0.5, and x be a disk centered at (3,0) with radius 0.2. As shown in the thoughts, x B y and y E z hold, and x E z also holds.

-   **x SE z**: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
    The first condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), matches XZ1. The second condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), is impossible as shown for S. So, x SE z is impossible.

Based on this analysis, for any regions x, y, z in REG such that x B y and y E z, the relation x E z must hold, and no other single-tile cardinal relation (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, SE) can hold between x and z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is E.

E

The final answer is $\boxed{E}$.
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Let x, y, and z be regions in REG.
The given information is:
1. x B y
2. y SE z

Let's write down the definitions of these relations in terms of the bounds of the bounding boxes:
1. x B y iff infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
2. y SE z iff supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's derive constraints on the bounding boxes of x and z from the given relations.

From supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x B y), we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x). (A)

From supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z), we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z). (B)

These two inequalities, supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), must hold for any regions x, y, z that satisfy the premises x B y and y SE z.

Now let's check which of the possible cardinal relations between x and z are compatible with these derived constraints (A) and (B). Recall that regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies that for any region r, infx(r) < supx(r) and infy(r) < supy(r).

Let's examine each possible relation for x relative to z:

- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  - From (A), supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= supx(z) (required for B), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) < supx(x). So B is impossible.

- x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  - supy(x) <= infy(z) is true from (B).
  - supx(x) <= supx(z) is required for S. From (A), supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) < supx(x). So S is impossible.

- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  - supy(x) <= infy(z) is true from (B).
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) is required for SW. From (A), supx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) hold simultaneously, along with strict inequalities for widths (infx < supx), we get infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) < supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies infx(x) < infx(x), a contradiction. So SW is impossible.

- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) is required for W. This is impossible, as shown for SW. So W is impossible.

- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) is required for NW. This is impossible, as shown for SW. So NW is impossible.

- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
  - supy(z) <= infy(x) is required for N. From (B), supy(x) <= infy(z). We also know infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z). If supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x). This implies infy(x) < infy(x), a contradiction. So supy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible. Thus N is impossible.

- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x).
  - supx(z) <= infx(x) is true from (A).
  - supy(z) <= infy(x) is required for NE. This is impossible, as shown for N. So NE is impossible.

- x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
  - supx(z) <= infx(x) is true from (A).
  - supy(x) <= supy(z) is implied by (B) (supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) < supy(z) => supy(x) < supy(z)).
  - infy(z) <= infy(x) is required for E. From (B), supy(x) <= infy(z). We also know infy(x) < supy(x). If infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This implies supy(x) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(x) < supy(x). So infy(z) <= infy(x) is impossible. Thus E is impossible.

- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
  - These are exactly the inequalities (A) and (B) that we derived from the premises. Since (A) and (B) must be true whenever x B y and y SE z are true for some y, the relation x SE z must necessarily hold between x and z.
  - This means x SE z is always a possible relation.

Since all other relations have been shown to be impossible based on the necessary consequences of the premises (supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)) and the properties of regions in REG (positive width and height), only SE is a possible relation.

The final answer is $\boxed{SE}$.
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: NE
