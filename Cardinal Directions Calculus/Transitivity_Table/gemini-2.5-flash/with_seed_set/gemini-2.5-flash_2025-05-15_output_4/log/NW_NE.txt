PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let `MBB(a)` denote the minimum bounding box of a region `a`, defined by the interval `[infx(a), supx(a)]` on the x-axis and `[infy(a), supy(a)]` on the y-axis.

The given relations are:
1.  `x NW y`: `supx(x) <= infx(y)` and `supy(y) <= infy(x)`
2.  `y NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(y)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`

We want to find the possible relations `x R z` between region x and region z. Let's analyze the relative positions of their bounding boxes based on the given conditions.

From `supy(y) <= infy(x)` (from x NW y) and `supy(z) <= infy(y)` (from y NE z), we can combine these inequalities:
`supy(z) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`
Thus, we have the inequality `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.

This inequality relates the y-coordinates of the bounding boxes of x and z. Specifically, the supremum (top edge) of `MBB(z)` is less than or equal to the infimum (bottom edge) of `MBB(x)`. This means `MBB(z)` is entirely below or touching the bottom edge of `MBB(x)`.

Let's examine the definitions of the single-tile cardinal direction relations `x R z` and see which ones are consistent with `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
-   `x S z`: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. This contradicts `supy(z) <= infy(x)` for regions in REG (which are non-degenerate, meaning `infy < supy`), unless `infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z)`, which is not possible for regions homeomorphic to a disk.
-   `x SW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Ruled out by the y-condition.
-   `x W z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. The condition `supy(x) <= supy(z)` combined with `supy(z) <= infy(x)` implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`, which is only possible for degenerate regions (not in REG). Ruled out.
-   `x NW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is consistent with our derived y-condition.
-   `x N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. This is consistent with our derived y-condition.
-   `x NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is consistent with our derived y-condition.
-   `x E z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. Ruled out by the y-condition implying degeneracy.
-   `x SE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Ruled out by the y-condition.
-   `x B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. Ruled out by the y-condition implying degeneracy.

So, the only possible relations `x R z` for non-degenerate regions are N, NE, and NW, as these are the only ones whose y-condition (`supy(z) <= infy(x)` or equivalent) is consistent with our derivation.

Now we need to check if the x-conditions for N, NE, and NW are possible given the initial x-conditions:
`supx(x) <= infx(y)`
`supx(z) <= infx(y)`

Let `I_x = [infx(x), supx(x)]` and `I_z = [infx(z), supx(z)]`. Let `I_y = [infx(y), supx(y)]`.
The conditions are `sup(I_x) <= inf(I_y)` and `sup(I_z) <= inf(I_y)`. This means both `I_x` and `I_z` are entirely to the left of or touching the left edge of `I_y`.

Let's check the x-conditions for N, NE, NW:
-   `x NW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. Is it possible that `supx(x) <= infx(z)` given `supx(x) <= infx(y)` and `supx(z) <= infx(y)`? Yes. For example, let `infx(y) = 10`. Let `MBB(x)` be `[-3, -2] x [...]` and `MBB(z)` be `[-1, 0] x [...]`. Then `supx(x) = -2 <= 10` and `supx(z) = 0 <= 10`. Also, `supx(x) = -2 <= infx(z) = -1`. This is possible.
-   `x NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Is it possible that `supx(z) <= infx(x)` given the initial conditions? Yes. For example, let `infx(y) = 10`. Let `MBB(x)` be `[-1, 0] x [...]` and `MBB(z)` be `[-3, -2] x [...]`. Then `supx(x) = 0 <= 10` and `supx(z) = -2 <= 10`. Also, `supx(z) = -2 <= infx(x) = -1`. This is possible.
-   `x N z`: `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. Is it possible that `MBB(z)`'s x-interval contains `MBB(x)`'s x-interval given the initial conditions? Yes. For example, let `infx(y) = 10`. Let `MBB(x)` be `[-2, -1] x [...]` and `MBB(z)` be `[-3, 0] x [...]`. Then `supx(x) = -1 <= 10` and `supx(z) = 0 <= 10`. Also, `infx(z) = -3 <= infx(x) = -2` and `supx(x) = -1 <= supx(z) = 0`. This is possible.

Since the y-condition `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is always true, and the x-conditions for N, NE, and NW are all possible given the initial constraints, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, NW}$.
