PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by `[infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
The given relations are:
1.  `x W y`: `supx(x) <= infx(y)`, `infy(y) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(y)`
2.  `y N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(y)`, `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, `supx(y) <= supx(z)`

We want to find the possible relations between `x` and `z`. Let's analyze the relative positions of their bounding boxes based on the given conditions.

From the given inequalities, we can derive relations between the bounds of `x` and `z`:

Y-axis relations:
- From `y N z`, we have `supy(z) <= infy(y)`.
- From `x W y`, we have `infy(y) <= infy(x)`.
- Combining these, we get `supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)`. Thus, `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is always true.
- From `y N z`, we have `supy(z) <= infy(y)`.
- From `x W y`, we have `supy(x) <= supy(y)`.
- We know that for any region in REG (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk), the projection on an axis is a non-degenerate interval, so `infy(y) < supy(y)`.
- Thus, `supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y)`. So, `supy(z) < supy(y)`.
- We have `supy(x) <= supy(y)`.
- Can `supy(x) <= supy(z)`? If this were true, then `supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)`. This would imply `infy(x) = supy(x)`, which is not possible for a region in REG. Therefore, `supy(x) <= supy(z)` is impossible.
- Can `supy(x) <= infy(z)`? If this were true, then `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)`. This would imply `infy(x) = supy(x)`, which is not possible. Therefore, `supy(x) <= infy(z)` is impossible.
- We also have `infy(z) <= supy(z)`. Since `supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)`, we have `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is always true.

X-axis relations:
- From `x W y`, we have `supx(x) <= infx(y)`.
- From `y N z`, we have `infx(z) <= infx(y)`.
- These two inequalities imply that both `supx(x)` and `infx(z)` are less than or equal to `infx(y)`. We cannot determine the relation between `supx(x)` and `infx(z)` from this alone. `supx(x)` can be less than, equal to, or greater than `infx(z)`.
- From `x W y`, we have `supx(x) <= infx(y)`.
- From `y N z`, we have `supx(y) <= supx(z)`.
- We know `infx(y) <= supx(y)`.
- Combining these, `supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`. Thus, `supx(x) <= supx(z)` is always true.
- Can `supx(z) <= infx(x)`? If this were true, then `supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`. This would imply `infx(x) = supx(x)`, which is not possible for a region in REG. Therefore, `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is impossible.
- Can `infx(z) <= infx(x)`? Yes, this is possible. Example: MBB(y)=[0,1]x[0,1], MBB(x)=[-0.5,-0.1]x[0.1,0.9], MBB(z)=[-0.8,1.5]x[-2,-1]. Here `infx(z)=-0.8 <= infx(x)=-0.5`.
- Can `supx(x) <= infx(z)`? Yes, this is possible. Example: MBB(y)=[0,1]x[0,1], MBB(x)=[-2,-1]x[0.1,0.9], MBB(z)=[-0.5,1.5]x[-2,-1]. Here `supx(x)=-1 <= infx(z)=-0.5`.

Summary of relations between x and z bounds:
- `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (Always true)
- `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (Always true)
- `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (Impossible)
- `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Impossible)
- `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (Always true)
- `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible)
- `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Possible)
- `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (Possible)

Now let's check which single-tile cardinal relations `x R z` are possible based on their definitions:
- `a S b`: `supy(a) <= infy(b)`, `infx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supx(a) <= supx(b)`. For `x S z`: `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (Impossible). S is impossible.
- `a SW b`: `supx(a) <= infx(b)`, `supy(a) <= infy(b)`. For `x SW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (Possible), `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (Impossible). SW is impossible.
- `a W b`: `supx(a) <= infx(b)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`. For `x W z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (Possible), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (True), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Impossible). W is impossible.
- `a NW b`: `supx(a) <= infx(b)`, `supy(b) <= infy(a)`. For `x NW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (Possible), `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (True). NW is possible.
- `a N b`: `supy(b) <= infy(a)`, `infx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supx(a) <= supx(b)`. For `x N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (True), `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Possible), `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (True). N is possible.
- `a NE b`: `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supy(b) <= infy(a)`. For `x NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible). NE is impossible.
- `a E b`: `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`. For `x E z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible). E is impossible.
- `a SE b`: `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supy(a) <= infy(b)`. For `x SE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible). SE is impossible.
- `a B b`: `infx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supx(a) <= supx(b)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`. For `x B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Possible), `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (True), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (True), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Impossible). B is impossible.

The possible relations are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.
