PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by BB(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)].
The given conditions are:
1.  x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y).
    This means BB(x) is contained within BB(y).
2.  y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z).
    This means BB(y) is North of or touching BB(z), and their x-projections overlap.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's derive the constraints on BB(x) and BB(z).

From the vertical conditions:
supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z)
infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(x).
This means the top of BB(z) is below or aligned with the bottom of BB(x). This is the vertical condition for x being North of z (or touching).

From the horizontal conditions:
infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x B y)
Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(x).
This means the left of BB(z) is to the left of or aligned with the left of BB(x).

supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x B y)
supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)
Combining these, we get supx(x) <= supx(z).
This means the right of BB(x) is to the left of or aligned with the right of BB(z).

So, the derived conditions for x and z are:
(A) supy(z) <= infy(x)
(B) infx(z) <= infx(x)
(C) supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now let's check which cardinal relations R from {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} are possible for x R z based on these conditions. Recall that regions in REG are homeomorphic to a disk, implying their projections are non-point intervals, i.e., infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

-   x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    These are exactly conditions (A), (B), and (C). So N is a possible relation.

-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition (A) supy(z) <= infy(x) matches.
    Condition supx(x) <= infx(z) must be checked against (B) infx(z) <= infx(x) and (C) supx(x) <= supx(z).
    If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= infx(x). This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x) for a region in REG. Thus, supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible. NW is not possible.

-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition (A) supy(z) <= infy(x) matches.
    Condition supx(z) <= infx(x) must be checked against (B) infx(z) <= infx(x) and (C) supx(x) <= supx(z).
    If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). So supx(x) <= infx(x). This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x) for a region in REG. Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. NE is not possible.

-   x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Conditions (B) and (C) match.
    Condition supy(x) <= infy(z) must be checked against (A) supy(z) <= infy(x).
    We know infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z).
    If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This implies supy(x) < supy(x), a contradiction. Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible. S is not possible.

-   x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible (shown for NW). SW is not possible.

-   x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible (shown for NE). SE is not possible.

-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible (shown for NW). W is not possible.

-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible (shown for NE). E is not possible.

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Conditions (B) infx(z) <= infx(x) and (C) supx(x) <= supx(z) match.
    Condition infy(z) <= infy(x) is true since supy(z) <= infy(x) (from A) and infy(z) < supy(z). So infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition supy(x) <= supy(z) must be checked against (A) supy(z) <= infy(x).
    We have supy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) < supy(x). So supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), which implies supy(z) < supy(x).
    This contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). B is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the properties of regions in REG (non-point projections), the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.
