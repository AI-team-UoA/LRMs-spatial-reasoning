PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by the intervals `[infx(a), supx(a)]` and `[infy(a), supy(a)]`.

The given relations are:
1.  x NE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(y) <= infy(x)`
2.  y W z: `supx(z) <= infx(y)`, `infy(z) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. These relations are defined based on the relative positions of the minimum bounding boxes.

Let's analyze the x-coordinates:
From (1), `supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
From (2), `supx(z) <= infx(y)`.
By the properties of bounding boxes, `infx(y) <= supx(y)`.
Combining these inequalities: `supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
This implies `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
This condition means the right edge of z's bounding box is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of x's bounding box. In terms of cardinal directions, this means x is located to the East of z, or they overlap on their right/left edges, or z is contained within x on the x-axis.
This condition `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is part of the definitions for N, NE, E, SE, S.
It contradicts the definitions for W, NW, SW, which require `supx(a) <= infx(b)` (for x W z, `supx(x) <= infx(z)`). If `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= infx(z)` were both true for non-degenerate regions, it would imply `infx(z) = supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x)`, meaning both regions are degenerate (lines or points) on the x-axis, which is not allowed for regions homeomorphic to a disk. Thus, W, NW, SW are not possible.

Let's analyze the y-coordinates:
From (1), `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
From (2), `infy(z) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.

Consider the relationship between `infy(x)` and `infy(z)`:
We have `infy(x) >= supy(y)` and `infy(y) >= infy(z)`.
If `supy(y) < infy(z)`, then `infy(x) >= supy(y)` could be less than `infy(z)`.
However, if `supy(y) < infy(z)`, then from `infy(z) <= infy(y)`, we get `supy(y) < infy(z) <= infy(y)`. This implies `supy(y) < infy(y)`, which is impossible for a non-degenerate region.
Therefore, we must have `supy(y) >= infy(z)`.
Since `infy(x) >= supy(y)`, we have `infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(z)`.
This implies `infy(x) >= infy(z)`.
The lower bound of x's y-projection is at or above the lower bound of z's y-projection.

Consider the relationship between `infy(x)` and `supy(z)`:
We have `infy(x) >= supy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
This implies `infy(x)` can be greater than, equal to, or less than `supy(z)`.

Consider the relationship between `supy(x)` and `infy(z)`:
We know `infy(x) <= supy(x)`.
We know `infy(x) >= infy(z)`.
So `supy(x) >= infy(x) >= infy(z)`.
This implies `supy(x) >= infy(z)`.
The upper bound of x's y-projection is at or above the lower bound of z's y-projection.
This rules out S and SE, which require `supy(a) <= infy(b)` (for x S z or x SE z, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`). If `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and `supy(x) >= infy(z)` were both true, it would imply `supy(x) = infy(z)`. Combined with `infy(x) >= infy(z)`, this gives `infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) = infy(z)`, which implies `infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z)`. This means x is a degenerate region (line or point) whose y-interval is equal to the lower bound of z's y-interval, which is not allowed.

Consider the relationship between `supy(x)` and `supy(z)`:
We know `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
We know `infy(x) >= supy(y)`.
We know `infy(x) <= supy(x)`.
There is no direct constraint forcing `supy(x)` to be <= or >= `supy(z)`.

Summary of constraints on x relative to z:
- `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (x is to the East of z or overlapping on the right)
- `infy(x) >= infy(z)` (x starts at or above z)
- `supy(x) >= infy(z)` (x ends at or above z)

Let's check the remaining possible relations: N, NE, E, B.
We already ruled out B based on the x-axis condition.
We already ruled out N based on the x-axis condition (`supx(x) <= supx(z)` is required for N, but we have `supx(z) <= infx(x)`).

Remaining possibilities: NE, E.

Check NE: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
We know `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is always true.
We need to check if `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is possible.
We know `infy(x) >= supy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
It is possible for `infy(x)` to be greater than or equal to `supy(z)`. For example, if `supy(y)` is close to `supy(z)` and `infy(x)` is significantly larger than `supy(y)`.
Example: z=[0,1]x[0,1], y=[2,3]x[0.8,0.9], x=[4,5]x[1.5,2.5].
x NE y: supx(y)=3 <= infx(x)=4 (ok), supy(y)=0.9 <= infy(x)=1.5 (ok).
y W z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok), infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=0.8 (ok), supy(y)=0.9 <= supy(z)=1 (ok).
x NE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=4 (ok), supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1.5 (ok).
NE is possible.

Check E: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
We know `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is always true.
We know `infy(z) <= infy(x)` is always true.
We need to check if `supy(x) <= supy(z)` is possible.
We know `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
We know `infy(x) >= supy(y)`.
We know `infy(x) <= supy(x)`.
It is possible for `supy(x)` to be less than or equal to `supy(z)`. For example, if `supy(y)` is significantly less than `supy(z)` and `infy(x)` and `supy(x)` are between `infy(z)` and `supy(z)`.
Example: z=[0,1]x[0,10], y=[2,3]x[1,4], x=[4,5]x[5,8].
x NE y: supx(y)=3 <= infx(x)=4 (ok), supy(y)=4 <= infy(x)=5 (ok).
y W z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok), infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=1 (ok), supy(y)=4 <= supy(z)=10 (ok).
x E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=4 (ok), infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=5 (ok), supy(x)=8 <= supy(z)=10 (ok).
E is possible.

We have ruled out B, S, SW, W, NW, N, SE.
We have shown NE and E are possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z are NE and E.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, E}$.
