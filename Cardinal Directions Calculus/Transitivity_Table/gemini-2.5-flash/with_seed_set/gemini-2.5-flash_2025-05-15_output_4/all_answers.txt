For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by `[infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)]`.
The given relations are:
1.  `x W y`: `supx(x) <= infx(y)`, `infy(y) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(y)`
2.  `y N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(y)`, `infx(z) <= infx(y)`, `supx(y) <= supx(z)`

We want to find the possible relations between `x` and `z`. Let's analyze the relative positions of their bounding boxes based on the given conditions.

From the given inequalities, we can derive relations between the bounds of `x` and `z`:

Y-axis relations:
- From `y N z`, we have `supy(z) <= infy(y)`.
- From `x W y`, we have `infy(y) <= infy(x)`.
- Combining these, we get `supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)`. Thus, `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is always true.
- From `y N z`, we have `supy(z) <= infy(y)`.
- From `x W y`, we have `supy(x) <= supy(y)`.
- We know that for any region in REG (homeomorphic to a closed unit disk), the projection on an axis is a non-degenerate interval, so `infy(y) < supy(y)`.
- Thus, `supy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y)`. So, `supy(z) < supy(y)`.
- We have `supy(x) <= supy(y)`.
- Can `supy(x) <= supy(z)`? If this were true, then `supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)`. This would imply `infy(x) = supy(x)`, which is not possible for a region in REG. Therefore, `supy(x) <= supy(z)` is impossible.
- Can `supy(x) <= infy(z)`? If this were true, then `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)`. This would imply `infy(x) = supy(x)`, which is not possible. Therefore, `supy(x) <= infy(z)` is impossible.
- We also have `infy(z) <= supy(z)`. Since `supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)`, we have `infy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is always true.

X-axis relations:
- From `x W y`, we have `supx(x) <= infx(y)`.
- From `y N z`, we have `infx(z) <= infx(y)`.
- These two inequalities imply that both `supx(x)` and `infx(z)` are less than or equal to `infx(y)`. We cannot determine the relation between `supx(x)` and `infx(z)` from this alone. `supx(x)` can be less than, equal to, or greater than `infx(z)`.
- From `x W y`, we have `supx(x) <= infx(y)`.
- From `y N z`, we have `supx(y) <= supx(z)`.
- We know `infx(y) <= supx(y)`.
- Combining these, `supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`. Thus, `supx(x) <= supx(z)` is always true.
- Can `supx(z) <= infx(x)`? If this were true, then `supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)`. This would imply `infx(x) = supx(x)`, which is not possible for a region in REG. Therefore, `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is impossible.
- Can `infx(z) <= infx(x)`? Yes, this is possible. Example: MBB(y)=[0,1]x[0,1], MBB(x)=[-0.5,-0.1]x[0.1,0.9], MBB(z)=[-0.8,1.5]x[-2,-1]. Here `infx(z)=-0.8 <= infx(x)=-0.5`.
- Can `supx(x) <= infx(z)`? Yes, this is possible. Example: MBB(y)=[0,1]x[0,1], MBB(x)=[-2,-1]x[0.1,0.9], MBB(z)=[-0.5,1.5]x[-2,-1]. Here `supx(x)=-1 <= infx(z)=-0.5`.

Summary of relations between x and z bounds:
- `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (Always true)
- `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (Always true)
- `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (Impossible)
- `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Impossible)
- `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (Always true)
- `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible)
- `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Possible)
- `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (Possible)

Now let's check which single-tile cardinal relations `x R z` are possible based on their definitions:
- `a S b`: `supy(a) <= infy(b)`, `infx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supx(a) <= supx(b)`. For `x S z`: `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (Impossible). S is impossible.
- `a SW b`: `supx(a) <= infx(b)`, `supy(a) <= infy(b)`. For `x SW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (Possible), `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (Impossible). SW is impossible.
- `a W b`: `supx(a) <= infx(b)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`. For `x W z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (Possible), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (True), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Impossible). W is impossible.
- `a NW b`: `supx(a) <= infx(b)`, `supy(b) <= infy(a)`. For `x NW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (Possible), `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (True). NW is possible.
- `a N b`: `supy(b) <= infy(a)`, `infx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supx(a) <= supx(b)`. For `x N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (True), `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Possible), `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (True). N is possible.
- `a NE b`: `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supy(b) <= infy(a)`. For `x NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible). NE is impossible.
- `a E b`: `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`. For `x E z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible). E is impossible.
- `a SE b`: `supx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supy(a) <= infy(b)`. For `x SE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (Impossible). SE is impossible.
- `a B b`: `infx(b) <= infx(a)`, `supx(a) <= supx(b)`, `infy(b) <= infy(a)`, `supy(a) <= supy(b)`. For `x B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(x)` (Possible), `supx(x) <= supx(z)` (True), `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (True), `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (Impossible). B is impossible.

The possible relations are N and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NW}$.

For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Let the bounding box of a region $a$ be denoted by $MBB(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] \times [infy(a), supy(a)]$.
Regions in REG are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, which implies that for any region $a \in REG$, $infx(a) < supx(a)$ and $infy(a) < supy(a)$.

The given information is:
1.  $x$ E $y$: $supx(y) \le infx(x)$, $infy(y) \le infy(x)$, and $supy(x) \le supy(y)$.
2.  $y$ NW $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(y)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(y)$.

We want to find the possible relations between $x$ and $z$. Let's analyze the constraints on their bounding box coordinates.

From (1), we have:
$infx(x) \ge supx(y)$
$infy(x) \ge infy(y)$
$supy(x) \le supy(y)$

From (2), we have:
$infx(y) \ge supx(z)$
$infy(y) \ge supy(z)$

Combining the inequalities for the x-coordinates:
$infx(x) \ge supx(y)$. Since $y \in REG$, $supx(y) > infx(y)$. So, $infx(x) > infx(y)$.
$infx(y) \ge supx(z)$. Since $z \in REG$, $supx(z) > infx(z)$. So, $infx(y) > infx(z)$.
Combining these, $infx(x) > infx(y) \ge supx(z) > infx(z)$.
This gives us $infx(x) > supx(z)$ and $infx(x) > infx(z)$.

Combining the inequalities for the y-coordinates:
$infy(x) \ge infy(y)$
$infy(y) \ge supy(z)$. Since $z \in REG$, $supy(z) > infy(z)$. So, $infy(y) > infy(z)$.
Combining these, $infy(x) \ge infy(y) \ge supy(z) > infy(z)$.
This gives us $infy(x) \ge supy(z)$ and $infy(x) > infy(z)$.

Now let's consider the upper bounds.
$supx(x) > infx(x)$. We know $infx(x) > supx(z)$. So, $supx(x) > infx(x) > supx(z)$.
This gives us $supx(x) > supx(z)$.

$supy(x) \le supy(y)$.
$supy(y) > infy(y)$.
$infy(y) \ge supy(z)$.
So, $supy(x) \le supy(y) > infy(y) \ge supy(z)$.
This implies $supy(x) \le supy(y)$ and $supy(y) > supy(z)$. This does not directly constrain $supy(x)$ relative to $supy(z)$.

Let's use the vertical containment from $x$ E $y$: $infy(y) \le infy(x)$ and $supy(x) \le supy(y)$.
Combined with $supy(z) \le infy(y)$, we get the chain:
$supy(z) \le infy(y) \le infy(x) \le supy(x) \le supy(y)$.

From this chain, we have:
$supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (This is one of the conditions for NE).
$supy(z) \le supy(x)$.

Can $supy(z) = supy(x)$? If $supy(z) = supy(x)$, then from the chain, $supy(z) = infy(y) = infy(x) = supy(x)$.
If $infy(x) = supy(x)$, then the region $x$ is a horizontal line segment, which is not in REG.
Therefore, $infy(x) < supy(x)$, which implies $supy(z) < supy(x)$.
So, $supy(x) > supy(z)$.

Summarizing the derived necessary conditions on the bounding boxes of $x$ and $z$:
$infx(x) > supx(z)$
$infy(x) \ge supy(z)$ (Equality is possible if $infy(x) = infy(y) = supy(z)$)
$supx(x) > supx(z)$
$supy(x) > supy(z)$

Let's check which cardinal direction relations between $x$ and $z$ are consistent with these necessary conditions.
The definition of $a$ NE $b$ is $supx(b) \le infx(a)$ and $supy(b) \le infy(a)$.
For $x$ NE $z$: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ and $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
Our derived conditions $infx(x) > supx(z)$ and $infy(x) \ge supy(z)$ satisfy these inequalities.
Thus, NE is a possible relation.

Let's check other relations:
N: $supy(z) \le infy(x)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
We have $supy(z) \le infy(x)$ (True) and $infx(z) \le infx(x)$ (True, since $infx(x) > infx(z)$).
However, we derived $supx(x) > supx(z)$. So $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ is false. N is not possible.

E: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
We have $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ (True) and $infy(z) \le infy(x)$ (True, since $infy(x) > infy(z)$).
However, we derived $supy(x) > supy(z)$. So $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ is false. E is not possible.

SE: $supx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
We have $supx(z) \le infx(x)$ (True).
However, we derived $supy(x) > supy(z)$ and we know $supy(z) \ge infy(z)$. So $supy(x) > infy(z)$. Thus $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ is false. SE is not possible.

S: $supy(x) \le infy(z)$, $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$.
We have $supy(x) \le infy(z)$ (False). S is not possible.

SW: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $supy(x) \le infy(z)$.
We have $supx(x) > supx(z) > infx(z)$. So $supx(x) > infx(z)$. Thus $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ is false. SW is not possible.

W: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
We have $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (False). W is not possible.

NW: $supx(x) \le infx(z)$, $supy(z) \le infy(x)$.
We have $supx(x) \le infx(z)$ (False). NW is not possible.

B: $infx(z) \le infx(x)$, $supx(x) \le supx(z)$, $infy(z) \le infy(x)$, $supy(x) \le supy(z)$.
We have $supx(x) \le supx(z)$ (False) and $supy(x) \le supy(z)$ (False). B is not possible.

The only possible relation is NE. We have shown that for any regions x, y, z in REG satisfying the given conditions, x NE z holds. We can also construct an example of such regions (e.g., three disks positioned appropriately) to show that the configuration is possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE}$.

For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Let `MBB(a)` denote the minimum bounding box of a region `a`, defined by the interval `[infx(a), supx(a)]` on the x-axis and `[infy(a), supy(a)]` on the y-axis.

The given relations are:
1.  `x NW y`: `supx(x) <= infx(y)` and `supy(y) <= infy(x)`
2.  `y NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(y)` and `supy(z) <= infy(y)`

We want to find the possible relations `x R z` between region x and region z. Let's analyze the relative positions of their bounding boxes based on the given conditions.

From `supy(y) <= infy(x)` (from x NW y) and `supy(z) <= infy(y)` (from y NE z), we can combine these inequalities:
`supy(z) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)`
Thus, we have the inequality `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.

This inequality relates the y-coordinates of the bounding boxes of x and z. Specifically, the supremum (top edge) of `MBB(z)` is less than or equal to the infimum (bottom edge) of `MBB(x)`. This means `MBB(z)` is entirely below or touching the bottom edge of `MBB(x)`.

Let's examine the definitions of the single-tile cardinal direction relations `x R z` and see which ones are consistent with `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
-   `x S z`: `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. This contradicts `supy(z) <= infy(x)` for regions in REG (which are non-degenerate, meaning `infy < supy`), unless `infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z)`, which is not possible for regions homeomorphic to a disk.
-   `x SW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Ruled out by the y-condition.
-   `x W z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. The condition `supy(x) <= supy(z)` combined with `supy(z) <= infy(x)` implies `supy(x) <= infy(x)`, which is only possible for degenerate regions (not in REG). Ruled out.
-   `x NW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is consistent with our derived y-condition.
-   `x N z`: `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. This is consistent with our derived y-condition.
-   `x NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. This is consistent with our derived y-condition.
-   `x E z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. Ruled out by the y-condition implying degeneracy.
-   `x SE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Ruled out by the y-condition.
-   `x B z`: `infx(z) <= infx(x)`, `supx(x) <= supx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. Ruled out by the y-condition implying degeneracy.

So, the only possible relations `x R z` for non-degenerate regions are N, NE, and NW, as these are the only ones whose y-condition (`supy(z) <= infy(x)` or equivalent) is consistent with our derivation.

Now we need to check if the x-conditions for N, NE, and NW are possible given the initial x-conditions:
`supx(x) <= infx(y)`
`supx(z) <= infx(y)`

Let `I_x = [infx(x), supx(x)]` and `I_z = [infx(z), supx(z)]`. Let `I_y = [infx(y), supx(y)]`.
The conditions are `sup(I_x) <= inf(I_y)` and `sup(I_z) <= inf(I_y)`. This means both `I_x` and `I_z` are entirely to the left of or touching the left edge of `I_y`.

Let's check the x-conditions for N, NE, NW:
-   `x NW z`: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`. Is it possible that `supx(x) <= infx(z)` given `supx(x) <= infx(y)` and `supx(z) <= infx(y)`? Yes. For example, let `infx(y) = 10`. Let `MBB(x)` be `[-3, -2] x [...]` and `MBB(z)` be `[-1, 0] x [...]`. Then `supx(x) = -2 <= 10` and `supx(z) = 0 <= 10`. Also, `supx(x) = -2 <= infx(z) = -1`. This is possible.
-   `x NE z`: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`. Is it possible that `supx(z) <= infx(x)` given the initial conditions? Yes. For example, let `infx(y) = 10`. Let `MBB(x)` be `[-1, 0] x [...]` and `MBB(z)` be `[-3, -2] x [...]`. Then `supx(x) = 0 <= 10` and `supx(z) = -2 <= 10`. Also, `supx(z) = -2 <= infx(x) = -1`. This is possible.
-   `x N z`: `infx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= supx(z)`. Is it possible that `MBB(z)`'s x-interval contains `MBB(x)`'s x-interval given the initial conditions? Yes. For example, let `infx(y) = 10`. Let `MBB(x)` be `[-2, -1] x [...]` and `MBB(z)` be `[-3, 0] x [...]`. Then `supx(x) = -1 <= 10` and `supx(z) = 0 <= 10`. Also, `infx(z) = -3 <= infx(x) = -2` and `supx(x) = -1 <= supx(z) = 0`. This is possible.

Since the y-condition `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is always true, and the x-conditions for N, NE, and NW are all possible given the initial constraints, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW.

The final answer is $\boxed{N, NE, NW}$.

For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by the intervals `[infx(a), supx(a)]` and `[infy(a), supy(a)]`. Let's denote these bounds as `a_ix`, `a_sx`, `a_iy`, `a_sy` respectively. Regions in REG are non-degenerate, meaning `a_ix < a_sx` and `a_iy < a_sy` for any region `a`.

Given:
1. x SE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
   In terms of notation: `y_sx <= x_ix` and `x_sy <= y_iy`
2. y W z: `supx(z) <= infx(y)` and `infy(z) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`
   In terms of notation: `z_sx <= y_ix` and `z_iy <= y_iy` and `y_sy <= z_sy`

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's derive the constraints on the bounds of x and z.

From `y_sx <= x_ix` and `z_sx <= y_ix`:
We know `y_ix < y_sx` (since y is non-degenerate).
So, `z_sx <= y_ix < y_sx <= x_ix`.
This implies `z_sx < x_ix`. (Strict inequality)

From `x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`:
We have `x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`.
This does not give a direct relation between `x_sy` and `z_iy`.

From `x_sy <= y_iy` and `y_sy <= z_sy`:
We know `y_iy < y_sy` (since y is non-degenerate).
So, `x_sy <= y_iy < y_sy <= z_sy`.
This implies `x_sy < z_sy`. (Strict inequality)

From `z_iy <= y_iy` and `y_iy < y_sy`:
We get `z_iy < y_sy`.

From `z_iy <= y_iy` and `x_sy <= y_iy`:
We cannot determine the relation between `z_iy` and `x_sy`.

From `x_iy < x_sy` (non-degenerate x) and `x_sy <= y_iy`:
We get `x_iy < y_iy`.

From `z_iy <= y_iy` and `x_iy < y_iy`:
We cannot determine the relation between `z_iy` and `x_iy`.

Let's use the derived strict inequality `z_sx < x_ix`.
This means the right edge of z's bounding box is strictly to the left of the left edge of x's bounding box.
This implies x is always to the East of the right edge of z.
Let's check which cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with `z_sx <= x_ix`.

The relations are defined as follows (a R b):
B: `b_ix <= a_ix`, `a_sx <= b_sx`, `b_iy <= a_iy`, `a_sy <= b_sy`
S: `a_sy <= b_iy`, `b_ix <= a_ix`, `a_sx <= b_sx`
SW: `a_sx <= b_ix`, `a_sy <= b_iy`
W: `a_sx <= b_ix`, `b_iy <= a_iy`, `a_sy <= b_sy`
NW: `a_sx <= b_ix`, `b_sy <= a_iy`
N: `b_sy <= a_iy`, `b_ix <= a_ix`, `a_sx <= b_sx`
NE: `b_sx <= a_ix`, `b_sy <= a_iy`
E: `b_sx <= a_ix`, `b_iy <= a_iy`, `a_sy <= b_sy`
SE: `b_sx <= a_ix`, `a_sy <= b_iy`

Let a = x and b = z. The condition `z_sx <= x_ix` is met (strictly).
Let's check the relations that require `x_sx <= z_sx` or `x_sx <= z_ix`.
We know `x_ix < x_sx` (non-degenerate x) and `z_ix < z_sx` (non-degenerate z).
Since `z_sx < x_ix`, we have `z_ix < z_sx < x_ix < x_sx`.
This implies `x_sx > z_sx` and `x_sx > z_ix`.
Any relation requiring `x_sx <= z_sx` or `x_sx <= z_ix` is impossible.
These relations are: S (`a_sx <= b_sx`), N (`a_sx <= b_sx`), W (`a_sx <= b_ix`), NW (`a_sx <= b_ix`), SW (`a_sx <= b_ix`), B (`a_sx <= b_sx`).
So, S, N, W, NW, SW, B are not possible relations between x and z.

The possible relations must be among NE, E, SE. These are the relations consistent with `z_sx <= x_ix`.

Let's check the remaining relations:
- NE (x NE z): `z_sx <= x_ix` and `z_sy <= x_iy`.
  We know `z_sx <= x_ix` is true.
  We need to check if `z_sy <= x_iy` is possible.
  We know `x_iy < x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy < y_sy <= z_sy`.
  So `x_iy < y_iy` and `z_iy < z_sy`.
  Also `x_iy < x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`.
  And `x_iy < x_sy <= y_iy < y_sy <= z_sy`.
  This implies `x_iy < z_sy`.
  The condition `z_sy <= x_iy` contradicts `x_iy < z_sy`.
  So NE is not possible.

- E (x E z): `z_sx <= x_ix`, `z_iy <= x_iy`, `x_sy <= z_sy`.
  We know `z_sx <= x_ix` is true.
  We know `x_sy <= z_sy` is true (strictly).
  We need to check if `z_iy <= x_iy` is possible.
  We know `x_iy < x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`.
  Can we have `z_iy <= x_iy`?
  Example: Let `y_iy = 10`. Let `x_sy = 8`. Then `x_iy < 8`. Let `x_iy = 7`. `x_iy < x_sy` is true, `x_sy <= y_iy` is true.
  Let `z_iy = 6`. Then `z_iy <= y_iy` is true.
  Is `z_iy <= x_iy` true? 6 <= 7. Yes.
  So E is possible.

- SE (x SE z): `z_sx <= x_ix` and `x_sy <= z_iy`.
  We know `z_sx <= x_ix` is true.
  We need to check if `x_sy <= z_iy` is possible.
  We know `x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`.
  Can we have `x_sy <= z_iy`?
  Example: Let `y_iy = 10`. Let `x_sy = 8`. Then `x_sy <= y_iy` is true.
  Let `z_iy = 9`. Then `z_iy <= y_iy` is true.
  Is `x_sy <= z_iy` true? 8 <= 9. Yes.
  So SE is possible.

We have shown that E and SE are possible relations, and all other relations are not possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, SE}$.

For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: SE

For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: SE, S, E, B
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: N, NE
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by the intervals `[infx(a), supx(a)]` and `[infy(a), supy(a)]`.

The given relations are:
1.  x NE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(y) <= infy(x)`
2.  y W z: `supx(z) <= infx(y)`, `infy(z) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`

We want to find the possible relations between x and z from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. These relations are defined based on the relative positions of the minimum bounding boxes.

Let's analyze the x-coordinates:
From (1), `supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
From (2), `supx(z) <= infx(y)`.
By the properties of bounding boxes, `infx(y) <= supx(y)`.
Combining these inequalities: `supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)`.
This implies `supx(z) <= infx(x)`.
This condition means the right edge of z's bounding box is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of x's bounding box. In terms of cardinal directions, this means x is located to the East of z, or they overlap on their right/left edges, or z is contained within x on the x-axis.
This condition `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is part of the definitions for N, NE, E, SE, S.
It contradicts the definitions for W, NW, SW, which require `supx(a) <= infx(b)` (for x W z, `supx(x) <= infx(z)`). If `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supx(x) <= infx(z)` were both true for non-degenerate regions, it would imply `infx(z) = supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x)`, meaning both regions are degenerate (lines or points) on the x-axis, which is not allowed for regions homeomorphic to a disk. Thus, W, NW, SW are not possible.

Let's analyze the y-coordinates:
From (1), `supy(y) <= infy(x)`.
From (2), `infy(z) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.

Consider the relationship between `infy(x)` and `infy(z)`:
We have `infy(x) >= supy(y)` and `infy(y) >= infy(z)`.
If `supy(y) < infy(z)`, then `infy(x) >= supy(y)` could be less than `infy(z)`.
However, if `supy(y) < infy(z)`, then from `infy(z) <= infy(y)`, we get `supy(y) < infy(z) <= infy(y)`. This implies `supy(y) < infy(y)`, which is impossible for a non-degenerate region.
Therefore, we must have `supy(y) >= infy(z)`.
Since `infy(x) >= supy(y)`, we have `infy(x) >= supy(y) >= infy(z)`.
This implies `infy(x) >= infy(z)`.
The lower bound of x's y-projection is at or above the lower bound of z's y-projection.

Consider the relationship between `infy(x)` and `supy(z)`:
We have `infy(x) >= supy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
This implies `infy(x)` can be greater than, equal to, or less than `supy(z)`.

Consider the relationship between `supy(x)` and `infy(z)`:
We know `infy(x) <= supy(x)`.
We know `infy(x) >= infy(z)`.
So `supy(x) >= infy(x) >= infy(z)`.
This implies `supy(x) >= infy(z)`.
The upper bound of x's y-projection is at or above the lower bound of z's y-projection.
This rules out S and SE, which require `supy(a) <= infy(b)` (for x S z or x SE z, `supy(x) <= infy(z)`). If `supy(x) <= infy(z)` and `supy(x) >= infy(z)` were both true, it would imply `supy(x) = infy(z)`. Combined with `infy(x) >= infy(z)`, this gives `infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) = infy(z)`, which implies `infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z)`. This means x is a degenerate region (line or point) whose y-interval is equal to the lower bound of z's y-interval, which is not allowed.

Consider the relationship between `supy(x)` and `supy(z)`:
We know `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
We know `infy(x) >= supy(y)`.
We know `infy(x) <= supy(x)`.
There is no direct constraint forcing `supy(x)` to be <= or >= `supy(z)`.

Summary of constraints on x relative to z:
- `supx(z) <= infx(x)` (x is to the East of z or overlapping on the right)
- `infy(x) >= infy(z)` (x starts at or above z)
- `supy(x) >= infy(z)` (x ends at or above z)

Let's check the remaining possible relations: N, NE, E, B.
We already ruled out B based on the x-axis condition.
We already ruled out N based on the x-axis condition (`supx(x) <= supx(z)` is required for N, but we have `supx(z) <= infx(x)`).

Remaining possibilities: NE, E.

Check NE: `supx(z) <= infx(x)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
We know `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is always true.
We need to check if `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is possible.
We know `infy(x) >= supy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
It is possible for `infy(x)` to be greater than or equal to `supy(z)`. For example, if `supy(y)` is close to `supy(z)` and `infy(x)` is significantly larger than `supy(y)`.
Example: z=[0,1]x[0,1], y=[2,3]x[0.8,0.9], x=[4,5]x[1.5,2.5].
x NE y: supx(y)=3 <= infx(x)=4 (ok), supy(y)=0.9 <= infy(x)=1.5 (ok).
y W z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok), infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=0.8 (ok), supy(y)=0.9 <= supy(z)=1 (ok).
x NE z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=4 (ok), supy(z)=1 <= infy(x)=1.5 (ok).
NE is possible.

Check E: `supx(z) <= infx(x)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.
We know `supx(z) <= infx(x)` is always true.
We know `infy(z) <= infy(x)` is always true.
We need to check if `supy(x) <= supy(z)` is possible.
We know `supy(y) <= supy(z)`.
We know `infy(x) >= supy(y)`.
We know `infy(x) <= supy(x)`.
It is possible for `supy(x)` to be less than or equal to `supy(z)`. For example, if `supy(y)` is significantly less than `supy(z)` and `infy(x)` and `supy(x)` are between `infy(z)` and `supy(z)`.
Example: z=[0,1]x[0,10], y=[2,3]x[1,4], x=[4,5]x[5,8].
x NE y: supx(y)=3 <= infx(x)=4 (ok), supy(y)=4 <= infy(x)=5 (ok).
y W z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(y)=2 (ok), infy(z)=0 <= infy(y)=1 (ok), supy(y)=4 <= supy(z)=10 (ok).
x E z: supx(z)=1 <= infx(x)=4 (ok), infy(z)=0 <= infy(x)=5 (ok), supy(x)=8 <= supy(z)=10 (ok).
E is possible.

We have ruled out B, S, SW, W, NW, N, SE.
We have shown NE and E are possible.

The possible relations between region x and region z are NE and E.

The final answer is $\boxed{NE, E}$.
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: NE, E
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: N NE SE S E B
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: N, NE, NW
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: 
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: N, NE, E, B
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: Let the bounding box of a region `a` be denoted by BB(a) = [infx(a), supx(a)] x [infy(a), supy(a)].
The given conditions are:
1.  x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y).
    This means BB(x) is contained within BB(y).
2.  y N z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z).
    This means BB(y) is North of or touching BB(z), and their x-projections overlap.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's derive the constraints on BB(x) and BB(z).

From the vertical conditions:
supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y N z)
infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(x).
This means the top of BB(z) is below or aligned with the bottom of BB(x). This is the vertical condition for x being North of z (or touching).

From the horizontal conditions:
infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y N z)
infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x B y)
Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(x).
This means the left of BB(z) is to the left of or aligned with the left of BB(x).

supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x B y)
supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y N z)
Combining these, we get supx(x) <= supx(z).
This means the right of BB(x) is to the left of or aligned with the right of BB(z).

So, the derived conditions for x and z are:
(A) supy(z) <= infy(x)
(B) infx(z) <= infx(x)
(C) supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now let's check which cardinal relations R from {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} are possible for x R z based on these conditions. Recall that regions in REG are homeomorphic to a disk, implying their projections are non-point intervals, i.e., infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a) for any region a in REG.

-   x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    These are exactly conditions (A), (B), and (C). So N is a possible relation.

-   x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition (A) supy(z) <= infy(x) matches.
    Condition supx(x) <= infx(z) must be checked against (B) infx(z) <= infx(x) and (C) supx(x) <= supx(z).
    If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(x) <= infx(x). This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x) for a region in REG. Thus, supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible. NW is not possible.

-   x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition (A) supy(z) <= infy(x) matches.
    Condition supx(z) <= infx(x) must be checked against (B) infx(z) <= infx(x) and (C) supx(x) <= supx(z).
    If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). So supx(x) <= infx(x). This contradicts infx(x) < supx(x) for a region in REG. Thus, supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible. NE is not possible.

-   x S z: supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z).
    Conditions (B) and (C) match.
    Condition supy(x) <= infy(z) must be checked against (A) supy(z) <= infy(x).
    We know infy(x) < supy(x) and infy(z) < supy(z).
    If supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This implies supy(x) < supy(x), a contradiction. Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z) is impossible. S is not possible.

-   x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible (shown for NW). SW is not possible.

-   x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible (shown for NE). SE is not possible.

-   x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(x) <= infx(z) is impossible (shown for NW). W is not possible.

-   x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
    supx(z) <= infx(x) is impossible (shown for NE). E is not possible.

-   x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z).
    Conditions (B) infx(z) <= infx(x) and (C) supx(x) <= supx(z) match.
    Condition infy(z) <= infy(x) is true since supy(z) <= infy(x) (from A) and infy(z) < supy(z). So infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= infy(x).
    Condition supy(x) <= supy(z) must be checked against (A) supy(z) <= infy(x).
    We have supy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) < supy(x). So supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x), which implies supy(z) < supy(x).
    This contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). B is not possible.

Based on the definitions and the properties of regions in REG (non-point projections), the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.
