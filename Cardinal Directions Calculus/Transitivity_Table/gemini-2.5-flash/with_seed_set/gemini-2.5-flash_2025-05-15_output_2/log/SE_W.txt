PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Let the bounding box of a region `a` be defined by the intervals `[infx(a), supx(a)]` and `[infy(a), supy(a)]`. Let's denote these bounds as `a_ix`, `a_sx`, `a_iy`, `a_sy` respectively. Regions in REG are non-degenerate, meaning `a_ix < a_sx` and `a_iy < a_sy` for any region `a`.

Given:
1. x SE y: `supx(y) <= infx(x)` and `supy(x) <= infy(y)`
   In terms of notation: `y_sx <= x_ix` and `x_sy <= y_iy`
2. y W z: `supx(z) <= infx(y)` and `infy(z) <= infy(y)` and `supy(y) <= supy(z)`
   In terms of notation: `z_sx <= y_ix` and `z_iy <= y_iy` and `y_sy <= z_sy`

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's derive the constraints on the bounds of x and z.

From `y_sx <= x_ix` and `z_sx <= y_ix`:
We know `y_ix < y_sx` (since y is non-degenerate).
So, `z_sx <= y_ix < y_sx <= x_ix`.
This implies `z_sx < x_ix`. (Strict inequality)

From `x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`:
We have `x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`.
This does not give a direct relation between `x_sy` and `z_iy`.

From `x_sy <= y_iy` and `y_sy <= z_sy`:
We know `y_iy < y_sy` (since y is non-degenerate).
So, `x_sy <= y_iy < y_sy <= z_sy`.
This implies `x_sy < z_sy`. (Strict inequality)

From `z_iy <= y_iy` and `y_iy < y_sy`:
We get `z_iy < y_sy`.

From `z_iy <= y_iy` and `x_sy <= y_iy`:
We cannot determine the relation between `z_iy` and `x_sy`.

From `x_iy < x_sy` (non-degenerate x) and `x_sy <= y_iy`:
We get `x_iy < y_iy`.

From `z_iy <= y_iy` and `x_iy < y_iy`:
We cannot determine the relation between `z_iy` and `x_iy`.

Let's use the derived strict inequality `z_sx < x_ix`.
This means the right edge of z's bounding box is strictly to the left of the left edge of x's bounding box.
This implies x is always to the East of the right edge of z.
Let's check which cardinal direction relations between x and z are consistent with `z_sx <= x_ix`.

The relations are defined as follows (a R b):
B: `b_ix <= a_ix`, `a_sx <= b_sx`, `b_iy <= a_iy`, `a_sy <= b_sy`
S: `a_sy <= b_iy`, `b_ix <= a_ix`, `a_sx <= b_sx`
SW: `a_sx <= b_ix`, `a_sy <= b_iy`
W: `a_sx <= b_ix`, `b_iy <= a_iy`, `a_sy <= b_sy`
NW: `a_sx <= b_ix`, `b_sy <= a_iy`
N: `b_sy <= a_iy`, `b_ix <= a_ix`, `a_sx <= b_sx`
NE: `b_sx <= a_ix`, `b_sy <= a_iy`
E: `b_sx <= a_ix`, `b_iy <= a_iy`, `a_sy <= b_sy`
SE: `b_sx <= a_ix`, `a_sy <= b_iy`

Let a = x and b = z. The condition `z_sx <= x_ix` is met (strictly).
Let's check the relations that require `x_sx <= z_sx` or `x_sx <= z_ix`.
We know `x_ix < x_sx` (non-degenerate x) and `z_ix < z_sx` (non-degenerate z).
Since `z_sx < x_ix`, we have `z_ix < z_sx < x_ix < x_sx`.
This implies `x_sx > z_sx` and `x_sx > z_ix`.
Any relation requiring `x_sx <= z_sx` or `x_sx <= z_ix` is impossible.
These relations are: S (`a_sx <= b_sx`), N (`a_sx <= b_sx`), W (`a_sx <= b_ix`), NW (`a_sx <= b_ix`), SW (`a_sx <= b_ix`), B (`a_sx <= b_sx`).
So, S, N, W, NW, SW, B are not possible relations between x and z.

The possible relations must be among NE, E, SE. These are the relations consistent with `z_sx <= x_ix`.

Let's check the remaining relations:
- NE (x NE z): `z_sx <= x_ix` and `z_sy <= x_iy`.
  We know `z_sx <= x_ix` is true.
  We need to check if `z_sy <= x_iy` is possible.
  We know `x_iy < x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy < y_sy <= z_sy`.
  So `x_iy < y_iy` and `z_iy < z_sy`.
  Also `x_iy < x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`.
  And `x_iy < x_sy <= y_iy < y_sy <= z_sy`.
  This implies `x_iy < z_sy`.
  The condition `z_sy <= x_iy` contradicts `x_iy < z_sy`.
  So NE is not possible.

- E (x E z): `z_sx <= x_ix`, `z_iy <= x_iy`, `x_sy <= z_sy`.
  We know `z_sx <= x_ix` is true.
  We know `x_sy <= z_sy` is true (strictly).
  We need to check if `z_iy <= x_iy` is possible.
  We know `x_iy < x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`.
  Can we have `z_iy <= x_iy`?
  Example: Let `y_iy = 10`. Let `x_sy = 8`. Then `x_iy < 8`. Let `x_iy = 7`. `x_iy < x_sy` is true, `x_sy <= y_iy` is true.
  Let `z_iy = 6`. Then `z_iy <= y_iy` is true.
  Is `z_iy <= x_iy` true? 6 <= 7. Yes.
  So E is possible.

- SE (x SE z): `z_sx <= x_ix` and `x_sy <= z_iy`.
  We know `z_sx <= x_ix` is true.
  We need to check if `x_sy <= z_iy` is possible.
  We know `x_sy <= y_iy` and `z_iy <= y_iy`.
  Can we have `x_sy <= z_iy`?
  Example: Let `y_iy = 10`. Let `x_sy = 8`. Then `x_sy <= y_iy` is true.
  Let `z_iy = 9`. Then `z_iy <= y_iy` is true.
  Is `x_sy <= z_iy` true? 8 <= 9. Yes.
  So SE is possible.

We have shown that E and SE are possible relations, and all other relations are not possible.

The final answer is $\boxed{E, SE}$.
