PROMPT: Let B and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- **x B y**: The bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y.  
  This implies:  
  - `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (x is horizontally within y).  
  - `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)` and `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (x is vertically within y).  

- **y S z**: y is directly below z.  
  This implies:  
  - `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y is entirely below z).  
  - `infx(z) ≤ infx(y)` and `supx(y) ≤ supx(z)` (y is horizontally within z).  

### Analysis of x relative to z:
1. **Horizontal alignment**:  
   - From `x B y`: `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`.  
   - From `y S z`: `infx(z) ≤ infx(y)` and `supx(y) ≤ supx(z)`.  
   Combining these:  
   - `infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` → `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)`.  
   - `supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)` → `supx(x) ≤ supx(z)`.  
   Thus, x is horizontally within z.  

2. **Vertical alignment**:  
   - From `x B y`: `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)`.  
   - From `y S z`: `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)`.  
   Combining these: `supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` → `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`.  
   Thus, x is entirely below z.  

### Conclusion:
The conditions `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`, `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)`, and `supx(x) ≤ supx(z)` satisfy the definition of **S** (South) for x relative to z.  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, SW, B) is possible because:  
- **B** requires `infy(z) ≤ infy(x)`, but `infy(z) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(x)` (from `y S z` and `x B y`), and equality cannot hold for non-degenerate regions (as regions are homeomorphic to a disk with positive extent).  
- **SW**, **W**, **NW** require `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`, but we have `infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x)`, making this impossible.  
- **E**, **SE**, **NE** require `supx(z) ≤ infx(x)`, but we have `infx(x) ≥ infx(z)`, making this impossible.  
- **N**, **NE**, **NW** require `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`, but `supy(z) ≥ infy(z) ≥ supy(y) ≥ supy(x) ≥ infy(x)`, and strict inequality holds for non-degenerate regions.  

Thus, the only possible relation between region x and region z is **S**.
