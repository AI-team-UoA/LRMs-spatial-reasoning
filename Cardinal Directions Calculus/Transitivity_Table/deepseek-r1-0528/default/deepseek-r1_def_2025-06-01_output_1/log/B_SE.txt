PROMPT: Let B and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is SE (South East).

### Reasoning:
- **x B y** means the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y. Specifically:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
  
- **y SE z** means region y is southeast of region z. Specifically:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these:
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- From x B y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- From y SE z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- From x B y: supy(x) ≤ supy(y), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) satisfy the definition of x SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) implies x is east of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies x is south of z.

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, S, NW, W, SW, B) are possible, as they require additional conditions that may not hold (e.g., for S, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is not necessarily true; for E, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not necessarily true).

Thus, the only possible relation is SE.
