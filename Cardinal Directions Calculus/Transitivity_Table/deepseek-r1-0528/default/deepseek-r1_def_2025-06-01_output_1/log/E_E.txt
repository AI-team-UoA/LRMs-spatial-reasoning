PROMPT: Let E and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is E (East) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is E (East).

### Explanation:
- **E relation definition**: For any regions \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) E \(b\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(b) \leq \inf_x(a)\) (region \(b\) is entirely to the west of \(a\)),
  - \(\inf_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\) (the bottom of \(b\) is at or below the bottom of \(a\)),
  - \(\sup_y(a) \leq \sup_y(b)\) (the top of \(a\) is at or below the top of \(b\)).

- **Given conditions**:
  - \(x\) E \(y\):  
    - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
    - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
    - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
  - \(y\) E \(z\):  
    - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
    - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
    - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

- **Deriving \(x\) E \(z\)**:
  - **x-axis**:  
    \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
    Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - **y-axis**:  
    \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)),  
    and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\)).  
    Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

- **Conclusion**:  
  The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of \(x\) E \(z\).

### Why other relations are not possible:
- **NE, SE**: Require vertical misalignment (e.g., \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) for NE or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for SE), but the derived vertical conditions show nested intervals (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), making these impossible.
- **N, S**: Require horizontal containment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\), violating containment.
- **W, NW, SW**: Require \(x\) to be west of \(z\) (e.g., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) forces \(x\) east of \(z\).
- **B**: Requires full bounding box containment, but the horizontal condition (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) prevents \(x\) from being horizontally inside \(z\)'s bounding box.

Thus, the only possible relation is **E**.
