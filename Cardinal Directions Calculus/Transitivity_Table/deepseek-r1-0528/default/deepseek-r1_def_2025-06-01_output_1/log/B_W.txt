PROMPT: Let B and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is \(B\) (bounding box) of \(y\):  
  This implies:  
  \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) is \(W\) (West) of \(z\):  
  This implies:  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraint for \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x \ B \ y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y \ W \ z\)), so:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   This means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraints for \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(x \ B \ y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y \ W \ z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Chaining these:  
   \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   This means the vertical span of \(x\) is contained within the vertical span of \(z\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) match the definition of the \(W\) (West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\).  

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:  
- \(SW\) or \(NW\) would require \(x\) to be entirely below or above \(z\) vertically, but the vertical constraints show \(x\) is within \(z\)'s vertical span.  
- \(S\), \(N\), \(E\), \(NE\), \(SE\), or \(B\) are inconsistent with the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the vertical containment.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is \(W\).
