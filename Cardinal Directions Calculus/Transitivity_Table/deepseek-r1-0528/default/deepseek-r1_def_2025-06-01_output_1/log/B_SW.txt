PROMPT: Let B and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies the bounding box of \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\):
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)

- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies \(y\) is southwest of \(z\):
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal position**:
   - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
   - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) SW \(z\))
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical position**:
   - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
   - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SW \(z\))
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

The conditions \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of the **SW (South West)** relation between \(x\) and \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, B) is possible under these constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **SW**.

**Final Answer**  
SW
