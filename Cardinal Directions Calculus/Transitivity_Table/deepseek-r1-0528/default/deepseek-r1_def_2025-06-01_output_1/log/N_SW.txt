PROMPT: Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entirely above vertically)  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally within \(y\)'s extent)  

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (entirely left horizontally)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entirely below vertically)  

From these:  
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).  
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) start above \(\sup_y(y)\), but their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed.  

Possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
1. **Entirely below**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).  
2. **Entirely above**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).  
3. **Vertically contained in \(z\)**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).  

These are the only relations consistent with the horizontal separation and given constraints. Other relations (e.g., N, S, E, SE, NE, B) are excluded by the leftward horizontal alignment.  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
- **SW**  
- **W**  
- **NW**  

**Final Answer**  
**SW, W, NW**
