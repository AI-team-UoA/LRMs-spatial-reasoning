PROMPT: Let NW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This implies \(x\) is west of \(y\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)) and \(y\) is below \(x\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This implies \(z\) is west of \(y\) (since \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)) and \(z\) is below \(y\) (since \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)).

From the vertical constraints:  
\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is below \(x\), so vertically, \(x\) is north of \(z\).

Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are west of \(y\):  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\). The horizontal relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:  
   \(x\) is west of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being north of \(z\), the relation is **NW** (\(x\) is northwest of \(z\)).

2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   \(z\) is west of \(x\), so \(x\) is east of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being north of \(z\), the relation is **NE** (\(x\) is northeast of \(z\)).

3. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   The bounding box of \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being north of \(z\), the relation is **N** (\(x\) is north of \(z\)).

These are the only cases that fit the given constraints and the defined relations. Overlap without horizontal containment does not correspond to any defined relation in the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **N**, **NE**, and **NW**.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
