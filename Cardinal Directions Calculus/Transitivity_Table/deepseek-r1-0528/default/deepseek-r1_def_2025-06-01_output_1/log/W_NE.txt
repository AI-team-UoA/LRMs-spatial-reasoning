PROMPT: Let W and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From \(y\) NE \(z\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). From \(x\) W \(y\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically. Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Horizontally, \(x\) is left of \(z\) (no overlap)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **Horizontally, \(z\) is left of \(x\) (no overlap)**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).

3. **Horizontally, \(x\) is contained in \(z\)**:  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) N \(z\).

4. **Horizontally, \(z\) is contained in \(x\)**:  
   \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\).  
   Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this does not fit any direct relation from \(x\) to \(z\). However, for the pair \((z, x)\), it satisfies \(z\) S \(x\) (since \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)). Thus, the relation S is possible between \(z\) and \(x\), and since the query is for relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (without specified order), S is included.

### Conclusion:
The possible relations that could hold between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:  
- **N** (if \(x\) is north of \(z\)),  
- **NE** (if \(x\) is northeast of \(z\)),  
- **NW** (if \(x\) is northwest of \(z\)),  
- **S** (if \(z\) is south of \(x\)).

Thus, the possible relations are N, NE, NW, and S.

**Final Answer: N, NE, NW, S**
