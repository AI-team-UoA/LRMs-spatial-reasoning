PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- From \(x\) SW \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) S \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), leading to two cases for the relative positions of \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
   Then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which satisfies the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\).

2. **Case 2: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)**  
   This implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\). Within this, the relation between \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) determines:
   - **Subcase 2a: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
     Then \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) from the chain). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) S \(z\).
   - **Subcase 2b: \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
     Here, \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). However, no cardinal direction relation from the defined set (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) holds, as the horizontal overlap and vertical alignment do not match any definition.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **SW** (from Case 1)
- **S** (from Subcase 2a)

No other relations are possible under the given constraints and definitions.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S
