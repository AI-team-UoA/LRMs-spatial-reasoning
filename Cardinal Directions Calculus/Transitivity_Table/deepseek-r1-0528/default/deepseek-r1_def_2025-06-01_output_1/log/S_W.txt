PROMPT: Let S and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are SW and W.

### Explanation:
- The relation \(x\) S \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- The relation \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is west of \(z\) in terms of the x-axis, ruling out relations E, NE, SE, B, N, and S, as they require conditions like \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which contradict \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) for regions with positive area.

The y-coordinate conditions allow for two possibilities:
1. **SW (South West)**: This holds if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This can occur when \(\inf_y(z)\) is sufficiently large relative to \(\sup_y(x)\), which is possible given the constraints \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
2. **W (West)**: This holds if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The latter is always true due to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The condition \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) can be satisfied when \(\inf_y(z)\) is small relative to \(\inf_y(x)\), which is possible given \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The relation NW is impossible because it requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z)\) for regions with positive area, contradicting the requirement.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and W.
