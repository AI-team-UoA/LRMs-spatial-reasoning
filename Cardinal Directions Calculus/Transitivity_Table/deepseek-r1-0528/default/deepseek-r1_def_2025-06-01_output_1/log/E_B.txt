PROMPT: Let E and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\):  
  \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\):  
  \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

From \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\), we derive:
- \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (chain in x-dimension).
- \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (y-containment).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **B (bounding box)**:  
   Requires \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
   - The y-conditions hold from above.  
   - For x: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) holds, and if additionally \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), then \(x\) B \(z\) is possible.  
   *Example*:  
   - \(z\): [0, 10] in x, [0, 10] in y.  
   - \(y\): [2, 8] in x, [2, 8] in y (so \(y\) B \(z\)).  
   - \(x\): [8, 9] in x, [3, 7] in y (so \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   Here, \(x\) is inside \(z\)'s bounding box: \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **E (east)**:  
   Requires \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
   - The y-conditions hold.  
   - If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), then \(x\) E \(z\) is possible.  
   *Example*:  
   - \(z\): [0, 8] in x, [0, 10] in y.  
   - \(y\): [2, 8] in x, [2, 8] in y (so \(y\) B \(z\)).  
   - \(x\): [9, 12] in x, [3, 7] in y (so \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   Here, \(x\) is east of \(z\): \(x\) E \(z\).

### Other relations are not possible:
- **W, NW, SW**: Require \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), but \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) implies \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\), so this fails.
- **N, NE**: Require \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but we have \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{inf}_y(y) \geq \text{inf}_y(z)\), so \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{inf}_y(z)\), and typically \(\text{sup}_y(z) > \text{inf}_y(z)\), making this impossible.
- **S, SE**: Require \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), but we have \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(x) \geq \text{inf}_y(z)\), and typically strict inequality holds, making this impossible.

Thus, the only possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **E**.

**Final Answer: B, E**
