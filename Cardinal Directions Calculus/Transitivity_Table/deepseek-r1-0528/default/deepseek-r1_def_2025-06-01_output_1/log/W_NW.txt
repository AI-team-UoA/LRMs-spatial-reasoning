PROMPT: Let W and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(x\) W \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) W \(y\)) imply \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), meaning \(x\) is entirely above \(z\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of the NW relation:  
\(x\) is NW of \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously, as verified by the constraints:
- Other relations either conflict with the horizontal requirement (e.g., E, NE require \(x\) east of \(z\)) or the vertical requirement (e.g., S, SW require \(x\) below \(z\)).
- Specific conditions for W, N, B, etc., are not met due to mismatched vertical or horizontal bounds.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **NW**.
