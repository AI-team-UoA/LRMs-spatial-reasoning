PROMPT: Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, the given conditions are that region \(x\) is W of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\). Analyzing the inequalities derived from these relations:

- From \(x\) W \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- From \(y\) N \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these, key inequalities include:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), leading to \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the x-axis alignment:

1. **Case where \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   This satisfies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), along with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). These conditions match the definition of \(x\) N \(z\) (north relation).

2. **Case where \(\inf_x(z) > \sup_x(x)\)**:  
   This gives \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it matches the definition of \(x\) NW \(z\) (northwest relation).

The case where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\) does not satisfy any atomic relation based on the given definitions, as no single relation (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) fits the inequalities. However, the possible relations observed in the valid cases are N and NW.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are N and NW.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
