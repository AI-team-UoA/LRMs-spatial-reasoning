PROMPT: Let SE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Given \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- Given \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

The constraints are:
1. \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (horizontal: both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(y\)).
2. \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (vertical: both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\)).

No further constraints directly relate \(x\) and \(z\), so their relative positions can vary within these bounds. All nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible, as verified by constructing valid examples for each:

- **B (bounding box)**: Arrange \(x\) within the bounding box of \(z\) horizontally and vertically.
- **S (South)**: Place \(x\) below \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **SW (South West)**: Place \(x\) below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: Place \(x\) to the left of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **NW (North West)**: Place \(x\) above and to the left of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: Place \(x\) above \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **NE (North East)**: Place \(x\) above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: Place \(x\) to the right of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **SE (South East)**: Place \(x\) below and to the right of \(z\).

Thus, every relation is achievable by adjusting the positions of \(x\) and \(z\) while respecting the given constraints.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
