PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)). Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

These combined conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) satisfy the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) NE \(z\)).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) is possible:
- **E, N, S, W, SE, NW, SW, B** either violate the horizontal or vertical constraints derived above or require additional conditions (like vertical containment for N or horizontal containment for E) that are not met.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **NE**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{NE}}
