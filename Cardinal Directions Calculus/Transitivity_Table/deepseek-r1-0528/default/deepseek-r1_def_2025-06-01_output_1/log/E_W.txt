PROMPT: Let E and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **B (bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\). This is possible when \(z\)'s bounding box horizontally and vertically encompasses \(x\)'s bounding box, satisfying the vertical constraints derived from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\) (i.e., \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), and the horizontal containment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).

- **E (East)**: \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\). This occurs when \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), combined with the vertical constraints. For example, if \(z\) is positioned east of \(y\) and \(x\) is further east than \(z\).

- **W (West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\). This occurs when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), combined with the vertical constraints. For example, if \(x\) is east of \(y\) but west of \(z\).

These relations are consistent with the vertical constraints derived:
- From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- Chaining these: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The diagonal relations (NE, NW, SE, SW) and the other axial relations (N, S) are not possible because they require additional vertical conditions (e.g., \(x\) entirely above or below \(z\)) that conflict with the derived vertical containment. The relations B, E, and W are the only ones compatible with the given constraints and vertical alignment.

**Possible relations: B, E, W**
