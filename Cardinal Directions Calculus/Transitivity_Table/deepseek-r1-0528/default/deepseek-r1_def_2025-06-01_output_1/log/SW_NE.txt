PROMPT: Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B. This is because the constraints only require both \(x\) and \(z\) to be entirely to the left and below \(y\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), but do not impose any restrictions on the relative positions between \(x\) and \(z\). Examples can be constructed for each relation:

- **SW**: \(x\) left and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\), \(z\): \([6, 10] \times [6, 10]\)).
- **S**: \(x\) below \(z\) with aligned horizontal bounds (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [6, 10]\)).
- **SE**: \(x\) below and to the right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6, 10] \times [0, 5]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [6, 10]\)).
- **W**: \(x\) left of \(z\) with aligned vertical bounds (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 10]\), \(z\): \([6, 10] \times [0, 10]\)).
- **B**: Bounding box of \(x\) contained in \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([2, 3] \times [2, 3]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\)).
- **E**: \(x\) right of \(z\) with aligned vertical bounds (e.g., \(x\): \([6, 10] \times [0, 10]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 10]\)).
- **N**: \(x\) above \(z\) with aligned horizontal bounds (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [6, 10]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\)).
- **NE**: \(x\) above and to the right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6, 10] \times [6, 10]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\)).
- **NW**: \(x\) above and to the left of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [6, 10]\), \(z\): \([6, 10] \times [0, 5]\)).

Thus, any relation is possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Answer:** N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
