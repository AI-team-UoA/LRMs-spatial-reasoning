PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): This implies:
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (the entire region \(y\) is below \(x\)),
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is B of \(z\): This implies:
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\), \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\),
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) (the bounding box of \(y\) is contained within that of \(z\)).

From these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **X-coordinate constraints**:
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).
   - Combining: \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\), so the x-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

2. **Y-coordinate constraints**:
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).
   - This gives \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{supy}(z)\) relative to \(\text{infy}(x)\):

- **Case 1: \(\text{supy}(z) < \text{infy}(x)\)**:
  - The entire region \(z\) is below \(x\) vertically.
  - Combined with the x-containment, this satisfies the definition of \(x\) N \(z\):
    - \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\),
    - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).

- **Case 2: \(\text{supy}(z) \geq \text{infy}(x)\)**:
  - Here, \(z\) extends vertically to at least the bottom of \(x\).
  - For \(x\) B \(z\) to hold, we additionally need \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) (the top of \(x\) is below or at the top of \(z\)).
  - If this condition is met, \(x\) B \(z\) is satisfied due to x-containment and \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).

Configurations exist for both cases:
- **Example for N**: \(y\) is a disk centered at \((0, 0)\) with bounding box \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\), \(z\) has bounding box \([-2, 2] \times [-2, 0.5]\) (so \(\text{supy}(z) = 0.5 < 1 = \text{infy}(x)\) if \(x\) is placed at \([-0.5, 1.5] \times [1, 2]\)), yielding \(x\) N \(z\).
- **Example for B**: \(y\) as above, \(z\) has bounding box \([-2, 2] \times [-2, 2]\), and \(x\) is at \([-0.5, 0.5] \times [1, 1.5]\) (so \(\text{supy}(x) = 1.5 \leq 2 = \text{supy}(z)\)), yielding \(x\) B \(z\).

No other cardinal relations (e.g., S, E, NE) are possible due to the x-containment and vertical constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N and B**.
