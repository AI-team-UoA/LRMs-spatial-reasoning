PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): This means:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (the top of \(x\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): This means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (the right of \(y\) is at or left of the left of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (the top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)).

From these:
1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Combining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\) (no horizontal overlap).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) have vertical bounds at or below \(\inf_y(y)\) (bottom of \(y\)), but their relative vertical positions (above, below, or overlapping) are not constrained further.

Given the horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are those where \(x\) is west of \(z\), and the vertical alignment can vary:
- **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).
- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).

These are the only possible relations consistent with the constraints. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) do not satisfy the horizontal separation or the vertical constraints derived.

**Possible relations: NW, W, SW**
