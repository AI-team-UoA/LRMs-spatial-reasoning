PROMPT: Let SW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\): \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the constraints:

1. **SW (South West)**:  
   If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) entirely left and below \(z\)'s bounding box.

2. **S (South)**:  
   If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is S of \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s x-bounds.

3. **W (West)**:  
   If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) left of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s y-bounds.

4. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).  
   Example: Bounding box of \(x\) contained within bounding box of \(z\).

These relations are possible under the given constraints, as verified through examples and bounds analysis. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW) are not possible due to contradictions with the initial conditions (e.g., \(x\) cannot be above or right of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, S, SW, W**.
