PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From \(x\) W \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\), it follows that \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) in the y-direction).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) in the x-direction, but their relative x-positions can vary.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by their x-direction alignment:
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\)).
2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\)).
3. **S (South)**: If the x-intervals overlap such that \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(z\)'s x-interval contains \(x\)'s).

These are the only possible relations from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B} that satisfy the conditions. Other relations (e.g., N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are incompatible due to the y-direction constraint or x-direction conflicts.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S, SW, SE**.
