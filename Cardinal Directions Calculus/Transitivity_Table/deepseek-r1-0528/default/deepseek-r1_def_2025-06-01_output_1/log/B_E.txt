PROMPT: Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are East (E), North East (NE), and South East (SE).

- **x E z** is possible when z is vertically within the y-range of x.
- **x NE z** is possible when z is below x vertically.
- **x SE z** is possible when z is above x vertically.

These relations are derived from the bounding box constraints:
- From x B y: The bounding box of y contains the bounding box of x, so infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- From y E z: z is to the East of y, so supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(z), and supy(z) ≤ supy(y).
- Combining these, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) holds, meaning z is to the West of x on the x-axis. The vertical relationship determines whether the relation is E, NE, or SE.

No other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are possible due to the fixed leftward position of z relative to x and the vertical constraints from the relations with y.

\boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
