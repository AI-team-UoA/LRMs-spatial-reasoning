PROMPT: Let NE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (the entire \(y\) is to the left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (the entire \(y\) is below \(x\))
- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (the entire \(y\) is to the left of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (the entire \(y\) is below \(z\))

These constraints imply:
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(y\).
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) start above \(y\).

The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary. Through specific examples, all nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:

- **NE**: \(x\) can be northeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) far right and up, \(z\) centered).
- **E**: \(x\) can be east of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right of \(z\), vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounds).
- **SE**: \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right and below \(z\)).
- **S**: \(x\) can be south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) below \(z\), horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s bounds).
- **SW**: \(x\) can be southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left and below \(z\)).
- **W**: \(x\) can be west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\), vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounds).
- **NW**: \(x\) can be northwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left and above \(z\)).
- **N**: \(x\) can be north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\), horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s bounds).
- **B**: \(x\) can be within the bounding box of \(z\) (e.g., both aligned such that \(z\)'s box contains \(x\)'s box).

Thus, every relation is possible under the given constraints.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
