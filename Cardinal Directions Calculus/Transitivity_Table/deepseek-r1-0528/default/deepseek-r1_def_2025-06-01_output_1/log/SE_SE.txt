PROMPT: Let SE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the relations impose specific constraints on the bounding boxes:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(y\)),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\)).
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the right of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(z\)).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being SE of \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) holds simultaneously under these constraints, as they would require conflicting horizontal or vertical alignments (e.g., \(x\) cannot be east of \(z\) without vertical containment, which is not met, nor south without horizontal containment, which also fails).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SE.
