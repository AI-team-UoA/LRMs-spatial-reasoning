PROMPT: Let B and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- **x B y**: This means the bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of y. Specifically:
  - Horizontally: `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`
  - Vertically: `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)` and `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)`

- **y NW z**: This means y is northwest of z. Specifically:
  - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y is entirely to the west of z)
  - `supy(z) ≤ infy(y)` (y is entirely to the north of z)

### Deriving the relation between x and z:
1. **Horizontal position (x-axis)**:
   - From x B y: `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`
   - From y NW z: `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`
   - Combining: `supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` → `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`
   - Thus, x is entirely to the west of z.

2. **Vertical position (y-axis)**:
   - From x B y: `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)`
   - From y NW z: `supy(z) ≤ infy(y)`
   - Combining: `supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)` → `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`
   - Thus, x is entirely to the north of z.

The conditions `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)` satisfy the definition of **NW** (x is northwest of z).

### Conclusion:
The only possible relation between x and z is **NW**.
