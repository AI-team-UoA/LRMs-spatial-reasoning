PROMPT: Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **NE (North East)**:  
   Occurs when \(x\) is entirely east and north of \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This is possible if the bounds align such that \(x\) lies strictly northeast of \(z\).

2. **E (East)**:  
   Occurs when \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) and within the north-south bounds of \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   This requires \(x\) to be east of \(z\) but vertically contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.

3. **N (North)**:  
   Occurs when \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) and within the east-west bounds of \(z\):  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   This requires \(x\) to be north of \(z\) but horizontally contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.

4. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   Occurs when \(x\) is entirely contained within the bounding box of \(z\):  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
   \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   This is possible if \(z\)'s bounding box is large enough to include \(x\).

These relations are mutually exclusive and cover all possible configurations under the given constraints. Other relations (S, SE, SW, W, NW) are not possible due to the northeast positioning of \(x\) relative to \(y\) and the containment of \(y\) in \(z\), which prevent \(x\) from being south, southwest, west, or northwest of \(z\).

**Possible relations: NE, E, N, B**
