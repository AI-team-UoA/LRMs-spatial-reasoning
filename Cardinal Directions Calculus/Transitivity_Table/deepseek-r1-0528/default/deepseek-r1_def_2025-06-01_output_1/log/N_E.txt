PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- Region \(x\) is \(N\) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is \(E\) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Horizontal Constraint (x-axis)**:  
   From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This satisfies the horizontal condition for relations where \(x\) is east of \(z\): \(E\), \(NE\), or \(SE\).

2. **Vertical Constraint (y-axis)**:  
   From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but the relative position of \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) (or \(\sup_y(x)\)) varies.

- **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)** (entire \(z\) is below \(x\)):  
  Satisfies \(NE\) relation: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

- **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\)** (vertical span of \(z\) contains \(x\)):  
  Satisfies \(E\) relation: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

- **Other cases (e.g., \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\))** do not fit \(NE\), \(E\), or \(SE\) due to vertical misalignment (e.g., \(SE\) requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which contradicts \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\)). No other relations (like \(N\), \(S\), \(B\), etc.) are possible due to the fixed horizontal constraint and vertical inconsistencies.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are \(NE\) and \(E\).
