PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is N (North) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are NW (North West) and W (West).

- **NW (North West)**: This occurs when there is no vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\), specifically when \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\). In this case, \(x\) is strictly to the northwest of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: This occurs when there is vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\) and \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\), specifically when \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\). In this case, \(x\) is to the west of \(z\) with vertical containment.

These are the only possible relations based on the given constraints. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, B) are not possible due to the relative positions derived from \(x\) N \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\).

**Summary of possible relations: NW, W**
