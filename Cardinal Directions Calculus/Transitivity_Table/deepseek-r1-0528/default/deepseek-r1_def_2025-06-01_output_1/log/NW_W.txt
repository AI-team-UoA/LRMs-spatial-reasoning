PROMPT: Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the left and above \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\), and \(z\) vertically contains \(y\).

From \(x\) NW \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\), the following constraints arise for \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal constraint**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(x\) is always to the left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraints**:  
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the vertical extent of \(z\) relative to \(x\):

- **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
  - Then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), satisfying NW.  
  - Example: \(z\)'s bounding box does not extend above the bottom of \(x\).

- **Case 2: Vertical containment of \(x\) in \(z\)**  
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), the relation W holds.  
  - Example: \(z\)'s bounding box vertically contains \(x\) while \(x\) is left of \(z\).

Other relations (N, S, E, etc.) are not possible:
- N requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and horizontal containment, but the horizontal condition conflicts due to \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the requirement for positive area regions (preventing degenerate horizontal alignment).
- S, SW require \(x\) below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(z\) contains \(y\), making \(x\) above parts of \(z\).
- E, NE, SE require \(x\) to the east of \(z\), but \(x\) is always west.
- B requires full containment, which is impossible horizontally since \(x\) is left of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW** and **W**.
