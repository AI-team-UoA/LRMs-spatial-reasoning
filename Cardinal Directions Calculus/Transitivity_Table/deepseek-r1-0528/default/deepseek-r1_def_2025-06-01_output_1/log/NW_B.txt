PROMPT: Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the left and above \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(y\)'s bounding box.

### Analysis of \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relation** (along the x-axis):  
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   This allows two possibilities:  
     - **H1**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) → \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  
     - **H2**: \(\sup_x(x) > \inf_x(z)\) → horizontal overlap occurs.  

2. **Vertical relation** (along the y-axis):  
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). The relation between \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) is:  
     - **V1**: \(\sup_y(z) < \inf_y(x)\) → \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  
     - **V2**: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\) → vertical overlap occurs.  

### Possible Relations:
- **Case H1 and V1** (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) < \inf_y(x)\)):  
  This satisfies the conditions for \(x\) NW \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical, since strict inequality implies \(\leq\)).  

- **Case H1 and V2** (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\)):  
  This allows two subcases:  
  - If \(\sup_y(z) = \inf_y(x)\), it satisfies \(x\) NW \(z\) (as above).  
  - If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and additionally \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), it satisfies \(x\) W \(z\):  
    \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from chain), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment).  

- Other combinations (H2 with V1 or V2) do not yield any of the atomic relations \(N\), \(NE\), \(E\), \(SE\), \(S\), \(SW\), \(B\), or \(NW\) under the constraints, based on the defined conditions and the requirement that regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk (non-degenerate).  

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
- **NW** (from H1+V1 and H1+V2 with \(\sup_y(z) = \inf_y(x)\)).  
- **W** (from H1+V2 with \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  

Thus, the possible relations are **NW** and **W**.  

**Answer: NW, W**
