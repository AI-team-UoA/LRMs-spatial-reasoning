PROMPT: Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ B } z\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. For the x-axis:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) → \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

2. For the y-axis:
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x \text{ B } z\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW) is possible because:

- Relations like N, S, E, W require strict directional constraints (e.g., for \(x \text{ N } z\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) must hold, but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which does not force \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- Diagonal relations (NE, SE, NW, SW) require additional positional constraints (e.g., for \(x \text{ SW } z\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), but we have \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which cannot satisfy \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) without degeneracy, which is excluded since regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk.

Thus, the only possible relation is **B**.
