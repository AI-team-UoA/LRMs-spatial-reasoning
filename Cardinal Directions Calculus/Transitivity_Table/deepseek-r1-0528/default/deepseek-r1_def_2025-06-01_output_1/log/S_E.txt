PROMPT: Let S and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) and horizontally aligned within \(y\)'s bounding box.

- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely east of \(z\) and vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounding box.

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal relation**:  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This implies \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) horizontally, satisfying part of E, SE, or NE.

2. **Vertical relation**:  
   From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \geq \inf_y(z)\).  

   - **Case 1: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**  
     Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), this satisfies the definition of **SE** (South East):  
     \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

   - **Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
     Since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
     Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), this satisfies the definition of **E** (East):  
     \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

   Other relations (N, NE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are not possible:  
   - N, NE, NW require \(x\) north of \(z\), but \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is within \(z\) vertically, so \(x\) cannot be north.  
   - S, SW require \(x\) south of \(z\), but if \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) may be above or below \(\inf_y(z)\), it does not consistently satisfy S/SW.  
   - W, NW require \(x\) west of \(z\), but \(x\) is east due to horizontal constraints.  
   - B requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box, but \(x\) is east of \(z\) horizontally.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SE** and **E**.

**Final Answer: SE, E**
