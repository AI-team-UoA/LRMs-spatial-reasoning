PROMPT: Let NE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are N (North) and NE (North East).

- **N (North)**: This can occur if the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z, and x is above z.
- **NE (North East)**: This can occur if x is strictly to the right and above z, with no overlap in the x-projections.

No other relations (such as E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) are possible due to the relative positions derived from the given relations (x NE y and y N z), which imply that x must be above z and cannot be south, west, or overlapping in a way that allows other directions.

Thus, the possible relations are N and NE.
