PROMPT: Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (with \(x\) as the subject and \(z\) as the reference) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) NE \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is west of \(x\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(x\)).
  
- From \(y\) SE \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is west of \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(z\)).

Chaining the \(x\)-constraints:  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\).

For the \(y\)-direction:  
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning both \(x\) and \(z\) are north of \(y\), but their vertical alignment relative to each other is unconstrained. Possible cases:
  1. \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\): \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) → \(x\) NE \(z\).
  2. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\): \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) → \(x\) SE \(z\).
  3. Vertical containment: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(x\) E \(z\).

Examples confirm all three are feasible:
- **NE**: \(z\) at \(x:[-1, -0.5]\), \(y:[1.5, 2]\); \(y\) at \(x:[0,1]\), \(y:[0,1]\); \(x\) at \(x:[1.5,2]\), \(y:[2.5,3]\).  
  \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) hold; \(x\) NE \(z\).
- **SE**: \(z\) at \(x:[-1, -0.5]\), \(y:[2.5,3]\); \(y\) at \(x:[0,1]\), \(y:[0,1]\); \(x\) at \(x:[1.5,2]\), \(y:[1.5,2]\).  
  \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) hold; \(x\) SE \(z\).
- **E**: \(z\) at \(x:[-1, -0.5]\), \(y:[1.5,3]\); \(y\) at \(x:[0,1]\), \(y:[0,1]\); \(x\) at \(x:[1.5,2]\), \(y:[2,2.5]\).  
  \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) hold; \(x\) E \(z\).

Other relations (N, S, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the east constraint \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations are NE, SE, and E.
