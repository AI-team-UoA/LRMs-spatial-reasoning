PROMPT: Let S and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(y\) NE \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(z\) is left of \(x\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
1. **If \(z\) is below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\))**:  
   Then \(z\) is left and below \(x\), so \(x\) is NE of \(z\) (since \(x\) is right and above \(z\)).
2. **If \(z\) is above \(x\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\))**:  
   Then \(z\) is left and above \(x\), so \(x\) is SE of \(z\) (since \(x\) is right and below \(z\)).
3. **If \(x\) and \(z\) share the same vertical bounds (\(\inf_y(x) = \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) = \sup_y(z)\))**:  
   Then \(z\) is left of \(x\) with vertical alignment, so \(x\) is E of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are:
- NE (if \(z\) is below \(x\))
- SE (if \(z\) is above \(x\))
- E (if vertical bounds are equal)

**Answer: NE, SE, E**
