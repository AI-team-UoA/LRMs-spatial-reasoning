PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S (South) or B (bounding box). This is determined by the constraints on their bounding boxes:

- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Chaining these inequalities:
- For the x-coordinates: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be west (W), east (E), or in any diagonal direction (SW, NW, SE, NE) relative to \(z\).
- For the y-coordinates: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\):
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) S \(z\) holds because \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  - Otherwise, if \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) B \(z\) may hold if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (in addition to the x-conditions and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which are satisfied). However, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is not always true, but when it is, \(x\) B \(z\) applies. Given the constraints, \(x\) cannot be north (N) of \(z\) because \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is impossible due to the regions having area and the inequalities.

Thus, the possible relations are S and B.
