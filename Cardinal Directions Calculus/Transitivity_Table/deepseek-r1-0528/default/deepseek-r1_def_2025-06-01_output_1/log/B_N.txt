PROMPT: Let B and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- **x B y**: The bounding box of y contains the bounding box of x. This implies:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (x-projection within y).
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (y-projection within y).

- **y N z**: Region y is North of region z. This implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (z is entirely below y).
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (x-projection of y within z).

### Analysis for x and z:
1. **x-projection**:
   - From x B y: \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).
   - From y N z: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
   - Combining: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), meaning the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.

2. **y-projection**:
   - From x B y: \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
   - From y N z: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
   - Combining: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

### Conclusion:
- The conditions \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) satisfy the definition of **x N z** (North relation).
- Other relations (NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are not possible due to:
  - The strict vertical separation (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)) rules out S, SE, SW, E, W, B, and NE.
  - The x-containment rules out E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.

Thus, the only possible relation between region x and region z is **N**.
