PROMPT: Let S and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\))

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is to the left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:

1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

2. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Chaining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Thus, \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\).

These conditions match the definition of \(x\) being **SE (South East)** of \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal: \(x\) is east of \(z\))
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertical: \(x\) is south of \(z\))

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) satisfies both constraints simultaneously. For example:
- **E (East)** requires vertical containment (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z)\), violating \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **S (South)** requires horizontal containment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), a contradiction since regions have positive extent.

Thus, the only possible relation is **SE**.
