PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. This is determined by the constraints from the relations:

- From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). This means x is directly north of y, sharing some x-overlap in their bounding boxes.
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). This means z is northwest of y, with y southeast of z.

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning x is east of z (no x-overlap).
- The y-positions of x and z are both north of y but have no direct constraints, allowing for different relative y-configurations.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **NE (North East)**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning z is below or at the same height as the bottom of x.
- **E (East)**: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), meaning x's y-range is contained within z's y-range.
- **SE (South East)**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is below or at the same height as the bottom of z.

Thus, depending on the specific positions, x can be NE, E, or SE of z. Other relations (N, S, SW, W, NW, B) are impossible due to the x-position constraint (x must be east of z) and region area properties.

\boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
