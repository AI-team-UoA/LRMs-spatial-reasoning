PROMPT: Let NE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The cardinal direction relations are defined based on the minimum bounding boxes of regions. Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints imposed by these relations.

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\))
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(z\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is contained in \(z\))

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

1. **B (Bounding box)**: If the bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\):
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

2. **N (North)**: If \(x\) is directly above \(z\) with horizontal containment:
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

3. **NE (North East)**: If \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

4. **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

5. **W (West)**: If \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) with vertical containment:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

6. **E (East)**: If \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) with vertical containment:
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

The relations S, SE, and SW are not possible due to the vertical constraints from \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\), ensuring \(x\) cannot be below \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are: **B, N, NE, NW, W, E**.
