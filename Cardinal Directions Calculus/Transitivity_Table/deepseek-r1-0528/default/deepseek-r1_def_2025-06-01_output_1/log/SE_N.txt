PROMPT: Let SE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. The regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, ensuring non-empty interiors and strict inequalities for bounding box bounds (i.e., \(\inf_x < \sup_x\) and \(\inf_y < \sup_y\)).

### Constraints from the relations:
- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y)
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is south of y)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z starts at or left of y horizontally)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z ends at or right of y horizontally)

### Key implications:
- **Horizontal**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z starts left of or at x), and \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\) (z ends right of or at y's right). Since \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\), \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z)\) can vary such that:
  - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), x is east of z.
  - Otherwise, horizontal overlap may occur, but x cannot be west of z due to \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **Vertical**: Both \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x and z are both south of y). The vertical positions can vary such that:
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), x is south of z.
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), x is north of z.
  - Otherwise, vertical overlap may occur.

### Possible relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- **S (South)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and horizontal conditions allow (e.g., if x is within or east of z horizontally).
- **SE (Southeast)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x south and east of z).
- **E (East)**: Possible if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x east of z with vertical containment).
- **NE (Northeast)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x north and east of z).
- **N (North)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and horizontal conditions allow (e.g., if x is within or east of z horizontally).

### Relations that are impossible:
- **W, NW, SW**: Impossible because \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies x cannot be west of z.
- **B**: Impossible because the constraints prevent z from containing x (e.g., vertically, both are south of y, and x is east of y, so z cannot contain x).

### Conclusion:
The possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S, SE, E, NE, and N. These account for the variations in horizontal and vertical positioning allowed by the constraints.

**Possible relations: S, SE, E, NE, N**
