PROMPT: Let E and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) E \(y\): 
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (vertically, \(x\) is within the vertical span of \(y\))

- From \(y\) SW \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is entirely to the south of \(z\))

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This implies that \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) start east of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

Possible horizontal scenarios:
1. \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
3. \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) S \(z\).

Other relations are impossible because:
- \(x\) is below \(z\), ruling out N, NE, NW, E, W, B (which require vertical overlap or \(x\) above \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S, SE, and SW.
