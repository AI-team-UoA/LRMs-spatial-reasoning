PROMPT: Let W and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Vertical constraints** (y-axis):
   - From \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - From \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) vertically.

2. **Horizontal constraints** (x-axis):
   - From \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) horizontally can vary, but are constrained by \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must have \(x\) below \(z\) (due to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), so only **S**, **SW**, and **SE** are candidates. However:

- **SE** requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but combining constraints leads to \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), with \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\). If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y)\), contradicting \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) unless intervals degenerate, which is not allowed for regions homeomorphic to a closed disk. Thus, **SE** is impossible.

- **SW** is possible when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Example:
  - \(x: [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y: [2,3] \times [0,3]\), \(z: [1.5,3.5] \times [2,4]\).
  - \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\): \(\sup_x(x)=1 \leq \inf_x(y)=2\), \(\inf_y(y)=0 \leq \inf_y(x)=0\), \(\sup_y(x)=1 \leq \sup_y(y)=3\).
  - \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\sup_y(y)=3 \leq \inf_y(z)=2\)? Adjust \(y\) to \([2,3] \times [0,1]\), then \(\sup_y(y)=1 \leq 2\), \(\inf_x(z)=1.5 \leq \inf_x(y)=2\), \(\sup_x(y)=3 \leq \sup_x(z)=3.5\).
  - \(x \mathbin{\text{SW}} z\): \(\sup_x(x)=1 \leq \inf_x(z)=1.5\), \(\sup_y(x)=1 \leq \inf_y(z)=2\).

- **S** is possible when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Example:
  - \(x: [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y: [2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(z: [0,4] \times [2,4]\).
  - \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\): \(\sup_x(x)=1 \leq \inf_x(y)=2\), \(\inf_y(y)=0 \leq \inf_y(x)=0\), \(\sup_y(x)=1 \leq \sup_y(y)=1\).
  - \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\sup_y(y)=1 \leq \inf_y(z)=2\), \(\inf_x(z)=0 \leq \inf_x(y)=2\), \(\sup_x(y)=3 \leq \sup_x(z)=4\).
  - \(x \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\sup_y(x)=1 \leq \inf_y(z)=2\), \(\inf_x(z)=0 \leq \inf_x(x)=0\), \(\sup_x(x)=1 \leq \sup_x(z)=4\).

Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are incompatible with the vertical constraint \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, the possible relations are **SW** and **S**.
