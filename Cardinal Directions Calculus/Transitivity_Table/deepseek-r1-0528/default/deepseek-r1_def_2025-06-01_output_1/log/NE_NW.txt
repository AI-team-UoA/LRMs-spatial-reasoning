PROMPT: Let NE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(y\) is west of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is south of \(x\))

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(z\) is south of \(y\))

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), transitivity gives \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) is west of \(x\)).
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), transitivity gives \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(z\) is south of \(x\)).

Thus, relative to \(x\), \(z\) is to the west and south, which corresponds to \(z\) being SW of \(x\). Conversely, relative to \(z\), \(x\) is to the east and north, which corresponds to \(x\) being NE of \(z\). Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- \(x\) NE \(z\)
- \(z\) SW \(x\)

In terms of the base relations, this corresponds to **NE** and **SW**.

**Answer:** NE, SW
