PROMPT: Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NW.  

### Explanation:  
- **\(x\) N \(y\) implies**:  
  - \(x\) is entirely above \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
  - The horizontal extent of \(x\) is within that of \(y\): \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).  

- **\(y\) NW \(z\) implies**:  
  - \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\): \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).  
  - \(z\) is entirely below \(y\): \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).  

### Combining the relations:  
1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).  
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
   - Thus, \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), leading to \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\). This means \(x\) is entirely above \(z\).  

2. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).  
   - Thus, \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  

The conditions \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) being **NW** of \(z\).  

### Why other relations are impossible:  
- **N, S, E, W, NE, SE, SW, B**: These require additional conditions (e.g., horizontal containment, vertical overlap, or opposite directional alignments) that are not satisfied here. For example:  
  - **N** would require the horizontal extent of \(x\) to be within \(z\), but \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\).  
  - **W** would require vertical containment, but \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  
  - **NE** would require \(z\) to be left of \(x\), but \(x\) is left of \(z\).  

Thus, the only possible relation is **NW**.
