PROMPT: Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the conditions are:

- For \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- For \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

Chaining the inequalities:
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

These satisfy the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) is possible because:
- The \(x\)-coordinate condition (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) requires \(x\) to be strictly east of \(z\), ruling out W, NW, SW, and B.
- The \(y\)-coordinate condition (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)) requires \(x\) to be strictly north of \(z\), ruling out S, SE, and B.
- Relations like N or E require additional constraints (e.g., horizontal alignment for N or vertical alignment for E) that are violated due to the strict displacement in both axes.

Thus, the only possible relation is **NE**.
