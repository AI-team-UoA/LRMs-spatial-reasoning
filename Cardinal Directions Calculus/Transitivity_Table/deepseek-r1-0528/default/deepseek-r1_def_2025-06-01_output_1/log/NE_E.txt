PROMPT: Let NE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is vertically contained within \(z\))

From \(y\) E \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\). From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combining these, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\), meaning the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must involve an eastern component (E, NE, or SE).

Now, consider the vertical direction:
- From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- From \(y\) E \(z\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

This gives \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
   Here, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\). With \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this matches the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\):  
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

2. **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\)**  
   Here, the vertical extent of \(z\) overlaps or extends above the bottom of \(x\). However, from \(y\) E \(z\), \(y\) is vertically contained in \(z\), and from \(x\) NE \(y\), \(y\) is below \(x\). This can lead to \(x\) E \(z\) if \(x\) is vertically contained in \(z\):  
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (already satisfied)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied from above)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (requires the top of \(x\) to be below or at the top of \(z\))  

   Example:  
   - \(z\): bounding box \([0, 1] \times [0, 3]\)  
   - \(y\): bounding box \([1.5, 2.5] \times [0.5, 1.5]\) (satisfies \(y\) E \(z\))  
   - \(x\): bounding box \([3, 4] \times [2, 3]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))  
   Then \(x\) E \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(z) = 1 \leq \inf_x(x) = 3\)
     - \(\inf_y(z) = 0 \leq \inf_y(x) = 2\)
     - \(\sup_y(x) = 3 \leq \sup_y(z) = 3\)

The relation SE (\(x\) SE \(z\)) would require \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but from \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), this implies \(\inf_y(z) = \inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x)\), which is impossible for regions homeomorphic to a disk (having area). Thus, SE is not possible.

Other relations (N, S, NW, SW, W, B) do not satisfy \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or the vertical conditions.

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE and E.
