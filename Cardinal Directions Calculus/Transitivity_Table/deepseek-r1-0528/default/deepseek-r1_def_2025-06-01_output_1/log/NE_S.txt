PROMPT: Let NE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the bounding box constraints. The relations that are possible include:

- **N (North)**: x can be north of z if z is below x and the horizontal projection of x is within the horizontal projection of z.
- **NE (North East)**: x can be northeast of z if z is below and to the left of x.
- **E (East)**: x can be east of z if z is to the left of x and the vertical projections align such that z is not above or below x.
- **SE (South East)**: x can be southeast of z if z is above and to the left of x.
- **S (South)**: x can be south of z if z is above x and the horizontal projection of x is within the horizontal projection of z.
- **B (Bounding box)**: x can have its bounding box contained within the bounding box of z under specific alignment conditions.

The relations NW, W, and SW are impossible because x is east of y (from x NE y), and thus cannot be west of z relative to the bounding boxes.
