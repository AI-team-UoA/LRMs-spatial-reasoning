PROMPT: Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:  
- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): This means the entire region \(x\) is to the southeast of \(y\). Specifically:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\)),  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the south of \(y\)).  

- \(y\) is W of \(z\): This means the entire region \(y\) is to the west of \(z\). Specifically:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\)),  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(z\) vertically spans at least the same as \(y\)).  

To find possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the constraints:  
- **Horizontal relations** (x-coordinates):  
  - From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the east of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their relative positions can vary:  
  - \(x\) may be east, west, or horizontally overlapping with \(z\).  

- **Vertical relations** (y-coordinates):  
  - From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This implies \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(z\) extends at least from \(\inf_y(y)\) upward. However, \(z\) may extend downward below \(\inf_y(y)\), and \(x\)'s bottom \(\inf_y(x)\) is unconstrained below \(\sup_y(x)\).  

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by satisfying specific bounding box conditions. Through configuration examples:  
- **SE**: If \(z\) is northwest of \(x\) (e.g., \(z\) starts east of \(y\) but \(x\) is southeast of \(z\)).  
- **E**: If \(x\) is east of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s span.  
- **B**: If \(x\) is inside \(z\)'s bounding box (e.g., \(z\) expands to cover \(x\)).  
- **S**: If \(x\) is south of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s span.  
- **SW**: If \(x\) is southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) starts east of \(y\) but ends west of \(z\)).  
- **W**: If \(x\) is west of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s span.  

Impossible relations:  
- **N**, **NE**, **NW**: Require \(z\) to be entirely below \(x\), but constraints force \(z\) to be at or above \(y\)'s bottom, while \(x\) is below \(y\)'s bottom, making \(z\) higher than \(x\).  

Thus, the possible relations are:  
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **W**, **E**, **SE**.  

**Final Answer**  
B, S, SW, W, E, SE
