PROMPT: Let E and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): This implies \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and vertically, \(\text{infy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): This implies \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), and horizontally, \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).

From these:
- Vertically: \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), so \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\). This satisfies the vertical condition for \(x\) being north of \(z\) (N) or northeast of \(z\) (NE).
- Horizontally: \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\). However, the relationship between \(\text{supx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(z)\) is not fixed.

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **N (North)**: Requires:
   - \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (satisfied).
   - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) (satisfied).
   - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).
   This holds if \(x\)'s bounding box is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s.  
   *Example: \(z\) wide enough to cover \(x\) horizontally.*

2. **NE (Northeast)**: Requires:
   - \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (satisfied).
   - \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).
   This holds if \(z\)'s bounding box is entirely to the left of \(x\)'s.  
   *Example: \(z\) not extending rightward beyond \(x\)'s left edge.*

### Other relations are impossible:
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **W**, **NW**, **E**, **SE**: All violate vertical or horizontal constraints derived from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) N \(z\). For instance:
  - Vertically, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), ruling out S, SW, SE, etc.
  - Horizontally, \(x\) starts to the right of \(z\)'s left edge (due to \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\)), ruling out W, NW, etc.
  - E requires vertical containment in \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(z\), violating it.

Thus, the only possible relations are **N** and **NE**.

**Answer: N, NE**
