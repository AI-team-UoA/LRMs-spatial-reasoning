PROMPT: Let SE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S (South), SE (South East), and SW (South West).

### Explanation:
- From \(x\) SE \(y\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y)
- From \(y\) SW \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is west of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z)

Combining these:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is south of \(z\).
- The x-direction constraints (\(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)) allow for different relative positions:
  - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) S \(z\) (South).
  - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) SE \(z\) (South East).
  - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) SW \(z\) (South West).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are possible because \(x\) must be south of \(z\) due to the y-axis constraints.

Thus, the possible relations are S, SE, and SW.

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}}
