PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Constraints from \(y\) B \(z\) in the y-axis**:
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) W \(y\)) imply \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Thus, the y-axis bounds of \(x\) are contained within those of \(z\).

2. **Constraints from \(x\) W \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\) in the x-axis**:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \geq \inf_x(z)\).
   - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - The x-axis position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\):
     - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\) (satisfying the W relation for \(x\) and \(z\)).
     - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(z\) (satisfying the B relation for \(x\) and \(z\)).

3. **Analysis of other relations**:
   - **S, SW, W (re-checked), NW, N, NE, E, SE**: Only W and B are feasible.
     - W is possible when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (along with y-axis containment).
     - B is possible when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (along with y-axis containment).
     - Other relations (e.g., S, SW, NW, N, NE, E, SE) violate the derived y-axis containment or x-axis bounds in all non-degenerate cases.

**Possible relations**: W (if \(x\) is west of \(z\)) and B (if \(x\) is inside the bounding box of \(z\)).

**Answer**: B, W
