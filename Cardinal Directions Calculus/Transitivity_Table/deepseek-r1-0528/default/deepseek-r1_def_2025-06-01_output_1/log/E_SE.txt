PROMPT: Let E and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is E (East) of region y and region y is SE (Southeast) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is SE (Southeast).

### Explanation:
- From the definition of E:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)  
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the south edge of y is not north of the south edge of x)  
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (the north edge of x is not north of the north edge of y)  

- From the definition of SE:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)  

Combining these:  
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z) and infx(y) ≤ supx(y) (always true for regions) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y) implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SE z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x E y) implies supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Thus, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which satisfies the definition of x being SE of z (x SE z).  

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible, as the inequalities derived from the given relations force x to be strictly southeast of z, with no overlap or other positional ambiguities.
