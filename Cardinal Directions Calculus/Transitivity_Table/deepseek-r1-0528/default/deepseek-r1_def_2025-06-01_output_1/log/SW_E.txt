PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the definitions and constraints. The analysis shows that \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\) (i.e., N, NE, NW are impossible) due to the vertical positioning from the given relations. The possible relations are:

- **SW (South West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is strictly left and below \(z\), satisfying \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **S (South)**: This occurs when \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally within the x-bounds of \(z\), satisfying \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- **SE (South East)**: This occurs when \(x\) is strictly right and below \(z\), satisfying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **W (West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is strictly left of \(z\) with vertical overlap and containment, satisfying \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **E (East)**: This occurs when \(x\) is strictly right of \(z\) with vertical overlap and containment, satisfying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs when the bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\), satisfying \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The relations N, NE, and NW are impossible because \(x\) cannot be above \(z\) vertically, as derived from the constraints \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which imply \(x\) is always below or overlapping with \(z\) but never above.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, SE, W, E, and B.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S, SE, W, E, B
