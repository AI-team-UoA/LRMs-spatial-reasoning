PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the cardinal direction relations:
- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This means \(x\) is below \(z\) vertically.
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible horizontal relationships between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **\(x\) entirely left of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. **\(z\) entirely left of \(x\)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
3. **\(x\) horizontally contained in \(z\)**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) S \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- \(B\), \(N\), \(NE\), \(E\), \(NW\), \(W\) require vertical containment, overlap, or specific horizontal alignments not satisfied here.
- The vertical separation (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) and horizontal constraints exclude these.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer: SW, S, SE**
