PROMPT: Let S and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is S of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Vertical relation**:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

2. **Horizontal relation**:  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Thus, \(x\) and \(z\) satisfy:  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertical condition for S),  
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal conditions for S).

This matches the definition of \(x\) being S of \(z\). Other relations (N, NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW, B) are incompatible with these constraints due to conflicts in vertical positioning or horizontal bounds. Therefore, the only possible relation is **S**.
