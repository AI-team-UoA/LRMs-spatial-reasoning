PROMPT: Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the constraints on their bounding boxes. The horizontal and vertical bounds from the given relations lead to the following possibilities:

1. **SW (South West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   - Example: \(x\) is entirely left and below \(z\).

2. **NW (North West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - Example: \(x\) is entirely left and above \(z\).

3. **W (West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and vertically \(z\) contains \(x\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  
   - Example: \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounds.

4. **S (South)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and horizontally \(z\) contains \(x\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
   - Example: \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds.

5. **N (North)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and horizontally \(z\) contains \(x\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
   - Example: \(x\) is above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds.

6. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   - Occurs when \(z\) contains \(x\) both horizontally and vertically:  
     \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   - Example: \(x\) is completely inside \(z\)'s bounding box.

Other relations (NE, E, SE) are not possible due to the constraints:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) imply \(x\) cannot be east of \(z\).
- Vertical bounds \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) prevent eastern or northeastern alignments.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, NW, S, SW, W**.
