PROMPT: Let S and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions and constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\): \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \), and \( \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \).
- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\): \( \text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \), and \( \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z) \leq \text{supx}(z) \leq \text{supx}(y) \).

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) vertically, and their horizontal projections are contained within the horizontal bounds of \(y\). The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary arbitrarily within these constraints, allowing any cardinal direction relation between them:

- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\).
- **NE**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) is east of \(z\).
- **SE**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
- **B**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\).

Each relation is possible under specific configurations of the bounding boxes of \(x\) and \(z\) that satisfy the given constraints. Thus, all nine cardinal direction relations are possible.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
