PROMPT: Let SE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y)

- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is east of z)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (y is north of z, so z is south of y)

Combining the horizontal bounds:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning x is east of z.

For the vertical relation between x and z:
1. **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:
   - x is south of z.
   - Combined with east, this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
2. **If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**:
   - z is south of x, so x is north of z.
   - Combined with east, this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).
3. **If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**:
   - The vertical span of x is contained within z.
   - Combined with east, this gives \(x\) E \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as the horizontal east constraint limits the possibilities to SE, NE, or E. Examples exist for each case, confirming they are achievable under the given relations.

**Possible relations between x and z: NE, SE, E**
