PROMPT: Let N and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

- **S (South)**: This occurs if the supremum of the y-coordinates of x is less than or equal to the infimum of the y-coordinates of z, with the x-projection of x contained within that of z (which is satisfied due to the transitivity of the x-containment from the given relations).
- **N (North)**: This occurs if the supremum of the y-coordinates of z is less than or equal to the infimum of the y-coordinates of x, with the x-projection of x contained within that of z.
- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs if the bounding box of z contains the bounding box of x in both x and y coordinates, which is possible when there is vertical overlap or containment, and the x-containment holds.

No other cardinal direction relations (NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW) are possible because the x-projection of x is always contained within the x-projection of z, preventing the horizontal disjointness required for those relations.

Thus, the possible relations are S, N, and B.
