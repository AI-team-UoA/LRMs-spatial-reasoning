PROMPT: Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), we analyze the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\).

- **\(x\) N \(y\) implies**:
  - \(y\) is below \(x\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - The \(x\)-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- **\(y\) NE \(z\) implies**:
  - \(z\) is to the left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
  - \(z\) is below \(y\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- **Horizontal relation (\(x\) relative to \(z\))**:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\). This satisfies the first condition for \(x\) being E of \(z\), but we must check vertical constraints.

- **Vertical relation (\(x\) relative to \(z\))**:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)).
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\):
- \(x\) NE \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

No other relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) holds:
- **N, S**: Require vertical alignment without horizontal shift; here, \(x\) is strictly to the right of \(z\).
- **E, W**: Require horizontal alignment without vertical shift; here, \(x\) is strictly above \(z\).
- **NW, SW, SE**: Require \(x\) to be left of \(z\) (NW, SW) or below \(z\) (SE), but \(x\) is right and above.
- **B**: Requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s, but \(z\) is left and below \(x\).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **NE**.
