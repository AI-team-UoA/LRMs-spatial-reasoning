PROMPT: Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely to the west (left) of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\). Combined with the horizontal, \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. **NW (North West)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), meaning \(x\) is above \(z\). Combined with the horizontal, \(x\) NW \(z\).
3. **W (West)**: If the vertical interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\), i.e., \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is west of \(z\) with vertical containment. Thus, \(x\) W \(z\).

The relations S, N, E, SE, NE, B are not possible because:
- \(x\) is west of \(z\) (not east, so E, SE, NE excluded).
- Horizontal containment (required for S, N, B) does not hold since \(x\) is strictly left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies no horizontal overlap).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

**Answer: SW, W, NW**
