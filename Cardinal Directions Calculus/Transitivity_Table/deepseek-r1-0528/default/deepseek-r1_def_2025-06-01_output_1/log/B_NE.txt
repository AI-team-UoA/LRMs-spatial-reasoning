PROMPT: Let B and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is NE (North East) of region \(z\), we analyze the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\).

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), we get \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), we get \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

These combined conditions, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), match the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\):
- \(x\) NE \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be NE. No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SE, SW, B) satisfies these conditions simultaneously.
