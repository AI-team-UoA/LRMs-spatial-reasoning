PROMPT: Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the relations imply:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) means \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SW \(z\) means \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) define \(x\) SW \(z\). 

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) can hold simultaneously with the given constraints, as they require additional or conflicting conditions (e.g., horizontal or vertical containment, or opposite directional alignments that contradict the derived inequalities). 

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.
