PROMPT: Let SE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (y is entirely to the west of x)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely to the south of y)
- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely to the south of z)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is horizontally within the bounding box of z)

From \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) S \(z\):
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, x is entirely to the south of z.
- Horizontally: 
  - From \(x\) SE \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  - Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so the left edge of z is left of or equal to the left edge of x.

The possible horizontal relations between x and z:
1. If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\):
   - z is entirely to the west of x.
   - Combined with x being south of z, this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
2. If \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\):
   - The horizontal span of x is within z's bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
   - Combined with x being south of z, this gives \(x\) S \(z\).
3. If \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\):
   - x extends east beyond z's bounding box.
   - However, no base relation (S, SE, etc.) fits, as S requires full horizontal containment, and SE requires z entirely west of x. Thus, this case does not yield a base relation.

Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the vertical constraint (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) and horizontal constraints derived.

Thus, the possible base relations between x and z are S and SE.
