PROMPT: Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the bounding box constraints and spatial arrangements. The analysis considers horizontal and vertical positioning based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ NW } y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x).
- \(y \text{ E } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is left of y),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is vertically within z).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **N (North)**: Possible when \(x\) and \(z\) horizontally overlap (bounding boxes overlap horizontally), and \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). Example: Horizontal projections overlap, and \(z\)'s top is at or below \(x\)'s bottom.
- **NE (Northeast)**: Possible when \(z\) is entirely left and below \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). This corresponds to \(x\) being northeast of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: Possible when \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). The vertical containment can be satisfied by appropriate region scaling.
- **NW (Northwest)**: Possible when \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), and \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). This matches \(x\) being northwest of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: Possible when \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). Vertical containment can be satisfied.
- **B (Bounding box)**: Possible when \(x\)'s bounding box is contained within \(z\)'s (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). Achievable with horizontal overlap and vertical containment.

Excluded relations:
- **SE**, **S**, **SW** are impossible due to \(y\) being below \(x\) and vertically within \(z\), forcing \(x\) above \(z\) in all cases. Specifically:
  - For \(x \text{ S } z\) or \(x \text{ SW } z\), \(x\) would need to be below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(y\) is within \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be below \(z\).
  - For \(x \text{ SE } z\), \(x\) would need to be below \(z\), which is similarly impossible.

Thus, the possible relations are N, NE, E, NW, W, and B.

**Final Answer: N, NE, E, NW, W, B**
