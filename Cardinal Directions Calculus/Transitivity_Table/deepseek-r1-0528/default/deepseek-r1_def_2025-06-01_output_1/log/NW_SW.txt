PROMPT: Let NW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\))
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\), limiting possible relations to W, NW, or SW.
- Vertically: The relations depend on the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\):
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\) (vertically, \(x\) is contained within \(z\)).

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are excluded because:
- N, S require horizontal alignment (e.g., \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), which conflicts with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the requirement that regions have positive area (being homeomorphic to a disk).
- NE, E, SE would require \(x\) to be right of \(z\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) ensures \(x\) is left.
- B requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s horizontally and vertically, but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) violates horizontal containment.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, W, SW**.
