PROMPT: Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entirely to the west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entirely to the north of \(y\))

- \(y\) is N of \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entirely to the south of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally within the x-range of \(y\))

Combining these:

- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).

- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely to the south of \(x\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) define the NW relation. Therefore, \(x\) must be NW of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) are possible, as they violate the combined constraints from the given relations. For example:
- N would require \(z\) to be south of \(x\) (which holds) but also \(z\)'s x-range to contain \(x\)'s, which fails because \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- W would require vertical containment that does not hold due to the north-south separation.

Thus, the only possible relation is **NW**.
