PROMPT: Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, the cardinal direction relation between x and z must be NW. This is derived from the definition of the NW relation and the transitive property of the inequalities involved.

- x NW y implies:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is west of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is south of x, so x is north of y)  

- y NW z implies:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is west of z)  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is south of y, so y is north of z)  

Combining these:  
- From \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of x NW z:  
- \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\) for a = x and b = z.  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible, as they require additional conditions not guaranteed by the given inequalities. For example:  
- N requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which may not hold.  
- W requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which may not hold.  
- B requires containment in both dimensions, which is not implied.  

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
