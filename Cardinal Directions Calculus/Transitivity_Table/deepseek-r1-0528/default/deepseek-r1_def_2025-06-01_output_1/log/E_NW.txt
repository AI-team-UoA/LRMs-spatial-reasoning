PROMPT: Let E and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely east of y),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y's bounds).
- \(y\) NW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely west of z),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is entirely south of y).

From these, we derive:
- Vertical relation: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, z is entirely south of x.
- Horizontal constraints: \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but no direct relation between \(\inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_x(x)\) or \(\sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x)\).

Given the vertical separation (z south of x), possible relations between x and z must have z south of x. Considering horizontal alignment:
- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  Example: y: \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\), x: \([12, 20] \times [5, 10]\), z: \([10, 11] \times [-10, 0]\).  
  Here, z is west and south of x.
- **S (South)**: Possible if \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\).  
  Example: y: \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\), x: \([10, 20] \times [5, 10]\), z: \([10, 15] \times [-10, 0]\).  
  Here, z is directly south of x and horizontally within x's span.
- **SE (South East)**: Possible if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Example: y: \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\), x: \([10, 15] \times [5, 10]\), z: \([16, 20] \times [-10, 0]\).  
  Here, z is east and south of x.

Other relations (N, NE, NW, E, W, B) are impossible due to the vertical constraint \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **SW, S, SE**.
