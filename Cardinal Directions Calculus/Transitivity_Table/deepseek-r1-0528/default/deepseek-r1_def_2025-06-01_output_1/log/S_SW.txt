PROMPT: Let S and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
1. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
2. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

These conditions exactly match the definition of SW:  
\(x\) is SW of \(z\) if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Now, consider other relations:
- **S**: Requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but we have \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), and equality does not necessarily hold. Thus, S is not guaranteed.
- **W**: Requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\), and equality fails. Thus, W is impossible.
- **NW**: Requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\), and the condition fails.
- **SE**: Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) > \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), making \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) impossible.
- **E, NE, N, B**: Similarly, the derived conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) conflict with the requirements of these relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.
