PROMPT: Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is W.

This is derived from the definitions:
- x W y implies: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- y W z implies: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combining these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) imply infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) imply supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

These conditions satisfy the definition of x W z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) are possible under these constraints due to the specific inequalities derived from the two W relations.
