PROMPT: Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x starts right of y's right edge)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y's bounds)

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z's bottom edge)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is horizontally within z's bounds)

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\))
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the horizontal extent of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds. With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies the definition of **S** (South).
2. If \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) starts right of \(z\)'s right edge. With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies the definition of **SE** (South East).

Other relations are impossible:
- **SW**, **W**, **NW**: Require \(x\) left of \(z\), but \(\inf_x(x) \geq \inf_x(z)\).
- **N**, **NE**: Require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **E**: Requires \(x\) vertically within \(z\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) prevents this.
- **B**: Requires full containment, incompatible with vertical separation.

Thus, the possible relations are **S** and **SE**.
