PROMPT: Let W and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely to the west of y),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (y's y-interval contains x's y-interval).

- \(y\) is SW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely to the west of z),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely to the south of z).

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- From \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) exactly match the definition of the SW relation between \(x\) and \(z\). 

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously:
- S requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which may not hold (e.g., \(\inf_x(x) = 0\), \(\sup_x(x) = 5\), \(\inf_x(z) = 10\) violates it).
- W requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which may not hold (e.g., \(\inf_y(y) = 0\), \(\sup_y(y) = 1\), \(\inf_y(z) = 2\), \(\inf_y(x) = 0.5\) violates it).
- Other relations (N, NE, SE, E, NW, B) fail due to mismatched directional constraints (e.g., NE requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.
