For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the scenario where region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be analyzed using the definitions:

- \(x\) N \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is entirely below \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-bounds of \(y\)).

- \(y\) N \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertically, \(z\) is entirely below \(y\)),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is contained within the \(x\)-bounds of \(z\)).

Combining the vertical conditions:
\[
\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \quad \text{and} \quad \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \implies \sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x).
\]

Combining the horizontal conditions:
\[
\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x) \quad \text{and} \quad \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z) \implies \inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \quad \text{and} \quad \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z).
\]

These combined conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) N \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\)),
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-bounds of \(z\)).

All other relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, NE, E, SE) lead to contradictions due to the vertical and horizontal constraints derived:
- Vertical: \(z\) is below \(y\), which is below \(x\), so \(x\) cannot be below, southwest, west, northwest, northeast, east, or southeast of \(z\), and the bounding box relation is impossible.
- Horizontal: The \(x\)-bounds of \(x\) are contained within \(z\)'s bounds, preventing relations like SW, W, NW, NE, E, SE that require specific horizontal misalignments.

Thus, the only possible relation is N.

**Answer: N**
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is N (North) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are NW (North West) and W (West).

- **NW (North West)**: This occurs when there is no vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\), specifically when \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\). In this case, \(x\) is strictly to the northwest of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: This occurs when there is vertical overlap between \(x\) and \(z\) and \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\), specifically when \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\). In this case, \(x\) is to the west of \(z\) with vertical containment.

These are the only possible relations based on the given constraints. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, B) are not possible due to the relative positions derived from \(x\) N \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\).

**Summary of possible relations: NW, W**
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- Region \(x\) is \(N\) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is \(E\) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Horizontal Constraint (x-axis)**:  
   From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This satisfies the horizontal condition for relations where \(x\) is east of \(z\): \(E\), \(NE\), or \(SE\).

2. **Vertical Constraint (y-axis)**:  
   From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but the relative position of \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) (or \(\sup_y(x)\)) varies.

- **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)** (entire \(z\) is below \(x\)):  
  Satisfies \(NE\) relation: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

- **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\)** (vertical span of \(z\) contains \(x\)):  
  Satisfies \(E\) relation: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

- **Other cases (e.g., \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\))** do not fit \(NE\), \(E\), or \(SE\) due to vertical misalignment (e.g., \(SE\) requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which contradicts \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\)). No other relations (like \(N\), \(S\), \(B\), etc.) are possible due to the fixed horizontal constraint and vertical inconsistencies.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are \(NE\) and \(E\).

**Answer: NE, E**
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

- **S (South)**: This occurs if the supremum of the y-coordinates of x is less than or equal to the infimum of the y-coordinates of z, with the x-projection of x contained within that of z (which is satisfied due to the transitivity of the x-containment from the given relations).
- **N (North)**: This occurs if the supremum of the y-coordinates of z is less than or equal to the infimum of the y-coordinates of x, with the x-projection of x contained within that of z.
- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs if the bounding box of z contains the bounding box of x in both x and y coordinates, which is possible when there is vertical overlap or containment, and the x-containment holds.

No other cardinal direction relations (NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW) are possible because the x-projection of x is always contained within the x-projection of z, preventing the horizontal disjointness required for those relations.

Thus, the possible relations are S, N, and B.

S, N, B
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NW.  

### Explanation:  
- **\(x\) N \(y\) implies**:  
  - \(x\) is entirely above \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
  - The horizontal extent of \(x\) is within that of \(y\): \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).  

- **\(y\) NW \(z\) implies**:  
  - \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\): \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).  
  - \(z\) is entirely below \(y\): \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).  

### Combining the relations:  
1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).  
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
   - Thus, \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), leading to \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\). This means \(x\) is entirely above \(z\).  

2. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).  
   - Thus, \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  

The conditions \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) being **NW** of \(z\).  

### Why other relations are impossible:  
- **N, S, E, W, NE, SE, SW, B**: These require additional conditions (e.g., horizontal containment, vertical overlap, or opposite directional alignments) that are not satisfied here. For example:  
  - **N** would require the horizontal extent of \(x\) to be within \(z\), but \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\).  
  - **W** would require vertical containment, but \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  
  - **NE** would require \(z\) to be left of \(x\), but \(x\) is left of \(z\).  

Thus, the only possible relation is **NW**.  

**Answer: NW**
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entirely above vertically)  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally within \(y\)'s extent)  

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (entirely left horizontally)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entirely below vertically)  

From these:  
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).  
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) start above \(\sup_y(y)\), but their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed.  

Possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
1. **Entirely below**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).  
2. **Entirely above**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).  
3. **Vertically contained in \(z\)**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).  

These are the only relations consistent with the horizontal separation and given constraints. Other relations (e.g., N, S, E, SE, NE, B) are excluded by the leftward horizontal alignment.  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
- **SW**  
- **W**  
- **NW**  

**Final Answer**  
**SW, W, NW**
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. This is determined by the constraints from the relations:

- From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). This means x is directly north of y, sharing some x-overlap in their bounding boxes.
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). This means z is northwest of y, with y southeast of z.

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning x is east of z (no x-overlap).
- The y-positions of x and z are both north of y but have no direct constraints, allowing for different relative y-configurations.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **NE (North East)**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning z is below or at the same height as the bottom of x.
- **E (East)**: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), meaning x's y-range is contained within z's y-range.
- **SE (South East)**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is below or at the same height as the bottom of z.

Thus, depending on the specific positions, x can be NE, E, or SE of z. Other relations (N, S, SW, W, NW, B) are impossible due to the x-position constraint (x must be east of z) and region area properties.

\boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), we analyze the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\).

- **\(x\) N \(y\) implies**:
  - \(y\) is below \(x\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - The \(x\)-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- **\(y\) NE \(z\) implies**:
  - \(z\) is to the left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
  - \(z\) is below \(y\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- **Horizontal relation (\(x\) relative to \(z\))**:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\). This satisfies the first condition for \(x\) being E of \(z\), but we must check vertical constraints.

- **Vertical relation (\(x\) relative to \(z\))**:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)).
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\):
- \(x\) NE \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

No other relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) holds:
- **N, S**: Require vertical alignment without horizontal shift; here, \(x\) is strictly to the right of \(z\).
- **E, W**: Require horizontal alignment without vertical shift; here, \(x\) is strictly above \(z\).
- **NW, SW, SE**: Require \(x\) to be left of \(z\) (NW, SW) or below \(z\) (SE), but \(x\) is right and above.
- **B**: Requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s, but \(z\) is left and below \(x\).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **NE**.

**Answer: NE**
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): This implies:
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (the entire region \(y\) is below \(x\)),
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is B of \(z\): This implies:
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\), \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\),
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) (the bounding box of \(y\) is contained within that of \(z\)).

From these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **X-coordinate constraints**:
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).
   - Combining: \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\), so the x-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

2. **Y-coordinate constraints**:
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).
   - This gives \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{supy}(z)\) relative to \(\text{infy}(x)\):

- **Case 1: \(\text{supy}(z) < \text{infy}(x)\)**:
  - The entire region \(z\) is below \(x\) vertically.
  - Combined with the x-containment, this satisfies the definition of \(x\) N \(z\):
    - \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\),
    - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).

- **Case 2: \(\text{supy}(z) \geq \text{infy}(x)\)**:
  - Here, \(z\) extends vertically to at least the bottom of \(x\).
  - For \(x\) B \(z\) to hold, we additionally need \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) (the top of \(x\) is below or at the top of \(z\)).
  - If this condition is met, \(x\) B \(z\) is satisfied due to x-containment and \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).

Configurations exist for both cases:
- **Example for N**: \(y\) is a disk centered at \((0, 0)\) with bounding box \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\), \(z\) has bounding box \([-2, 2] \times [-2, 0.5]\) (so \(\text{supy}(z) = 0.5 < 1 = \text{infy}(x)\) if \(x\) is placed at \([-0.5, 1.5] \times [1, 2]\)), yielding \(x\) N \(z\).
- **Example for B**: \(y\) as above, \(z\) has bounding box \([-2, 2] \times [-2, 2]\), and \(x\) is at \([-0.5, 0.5] \times [1, 1.5]\) (so \(\text{supy}(x) = 1.5 \leq 2 = \text{supy}(z)\)), yielding \(x\) B \(z\).

No other cardinal relations (e.g., S, E, NE) are possible due to the x-containment and vertical constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N and B**.
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, the given conditions are that region \(x\) is W of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\). Analyzing the inequalities derived from these relations:

- From \(x\) W \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- From \(y\) N \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these, key inequalities include:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), leading to \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the x-axis alignment:

1. **Case where \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   This satisfies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), along with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). These conditions match the definition of \(x\) N \(z\) (north relation).

2. **Case where \(\inf_x(z) > \sup_x(x)\)**:  
   This gives \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it matches the definition of \(x\) NW \(z\) (northwest relation).

The case where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\) does not satisfy any atomic relation based on the given definitions, as no single relation (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) fits the inequalities. However, the possible relations observed in the valid cases are N and NW.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are N and NW.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Given that region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is W.

This is derived from the definitions:
- x W y implies: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- y W z implies: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combining these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) imply infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) imply supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

These conditions satisfy the definition of x W z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) are possible under these constraints due to the specific inequalities derived from the two W relations.

**Possible relation: W**
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: Based on the definitions of the cardinal direction relations and the given conditions that region \(x\) is W of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal directions. This is because the constraints allow configurations where \(x\) and \(z\) can be arranged in all possible relative positions (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, or bounding box) while satisfying the initial relations with \(y\).

- **N (North)**: \(x\) is north of \(z\) if \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) and \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).
- **NE (Northeast)**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) if \(z\) is left and below \(x\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) is east of \(z\) if \(z\) is left of \(x\) and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\).
- **SE (Southeast)**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\) if \(z\) is left and above \(x\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) is south of \(z\) if \(z\) is entirely above \(x\) and \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).
- **SW (Southwest)**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\) if \(z\) is right and above \(x\).
- **W (West)**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) if \(z\) is right of \(x\) and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\).
- **NW (Northwest)**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) if \(z\) is right and below \(x\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: \(x\) is inside the bounding box of \(z\) (or vice versa in some interpretations, but the relation holds as defined).

Examples for each relation can be constructed while adhering to \(x \text{ W } y\) and \(y \text{ E } z\). For instance:
- **NW**: \(x\) left and above \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) left and below \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) left of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **SE**: \(x\) right and below \(z\).
- **NE**: \(x\) right and above \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) right of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **B**: \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box.
- **N**: \(z\) below \(x\) with horizontal containment.
- **S**: \(z\) above \(x\) with horizontal containment.

Thus, all nine relations are possible.

**Answer**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Vertical constraints** (y-axis):
   - From \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - From \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) vertically.

2. **Horizontal constraints** (x-axis):
   - From \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) horizontally can vary, but are constrained by \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must have \(x\) below \(z\) (due to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), so only **S**, **SW**, and **SE** are candidates. However:

- **SE** requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but combining constraints leads to \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), with \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\). If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y)\), contradicting \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) unless intervals degenerate, which is not allowed for regions homeomorphic to a closed disk. Thus, **SE** is impossible.

- **SW** is possible when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Example:
  - \(x: [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y: [2,3] \times [0,3]\), \(z: [1.5,3.5] \times [2,4]\).
  - \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\): \(\sup_x(x)=1 \leq \inf_x(y)=2\), \(\inf_y(y)=0 \leq \inf_y(x)=0\), \(\sup_y(x)=1 \leq \sup_y(y)=3\).
  - \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\sup_y(y)=3 \leq \inf_y(z)=2\)? Adjust \(y\) to \([2,3] \times [0,1]\), then \(\sup_y(y)=1 \leq 2\), \(\inf_x(z)=1.5 \leq \inf_x(y)=2\), \(\sup_x(y)=3 \leq \sup_x(z)=3.5\).
  - \(x \mathbin{\text{SW}} z\): \(\sup_x(x)=1 \leq \inf_x(z)=1.5\), \(\sup_y(x)=1 \leq \inf_y(z)=2\).

- **S** is possible when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Example:
  - \(x: [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y: [2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(z: [0,4] \times [2,4]\).
  - \(x \mathbin{\text{W}} y\): \(\sup_x(x)=1 \leq \inf_x(y)=2\), \(\inf_y(y)=0 \leq \inf_y(x)=0\), \(\sup_y(x)=1 \leq \sup_y(y)=1\).
  - \(y \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\sup_y(y)=1 \leq \inf_y(z)=2\), \(\inf_x(z)=0 \leq \inf_x(y)=2\), \(\sup_x(y)=3 \leq \sup_x(z)=4\).
  - \(x \mathbin{\text{S}} z\): \(\sup_y(x)=1 \leq \inf_y(z)=2\), \(\inf_x(z)=0 \leq \inf_x(x)=0\), \(\sup_x(x)=1 \leq \sup_x(z)=4\).

Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are incompatible with the vertical constraint \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, the possible relations are **SW** and **S**.

**Answer: SW, S**
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(x\) W \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) W \(y\)) imply \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), meaning \(x\) is entirely above \(z\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of the NW relation:  
\(x\) is NW of \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously, as verified by the constraints:
- Other relations either conflict with the horizontal requirement (e.g., E, NE require \(x\) east of \(z\)) or the vertical requirement (e.g., S, SW require \(x\) below \(z\)).
- Specific conditions for W, N, B, etc., are not met due to mismatched vertical or horizontal bounds.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **NW**.  

**Answer: NW**
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely to the west of y),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (y's y-interval contains x's y-interval).

- \(y\) is SW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely to the west of z),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely to the south of z).

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- From \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) exactly match the definition of the SW relation between \(x\) and \(z\). 

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously:
- S requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which may not hold (e.g., \(\inf_x(x) = 0\), \(\sup_x(x) = 5\), \(\inf_x(z) = 10\) violates it).
- W requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which may not hold (e.g., \(\inf_y(y) = 0\), \(\sup_y(y) = 1\), \(\inf_y(z) = 2\), \(\inf_y(x) = 0.5\) violates it).
- Other relations (N, NE, SE, E, NW, B) fail due to mismatched directional constraints (e.g., NE requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.

**Answer: SW**
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From \(x\) W \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\), it follows that \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) in the y-direction).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) in the x-direction, but their relative x-positions can vary.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by their x-direction alignment:
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\)).
2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\)).
3. **S (South)**: If the x-intervals overlap such that \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(z\)'s x-interval contains \(x\)'s).

These are the only possible relations from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B} that satisfy the conditions. Other relations (e.g., N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are incompatible due to the y-direction constraint or x-direction conflicts.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S, SW, SE**.
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From \(y\) NE \(z\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). From \(x\) W \(y\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically. Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Horizontally, \(x\) is left of \(z\) (no overlap)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **Horizontally, \(z\) is left of \(x\) (no overlap)**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).

3. **Horizontally, \(x\) is contained in \(z\)**:  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) N \(z\).

4. **Horizontally, \(z\) is contained in \(x\)**:  
   \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\).  
   Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this does not fit any direct relation from \(x\) to \(z\). However, for the pair \((z, x)\), it satisfies \(z\) S \(x\) (since \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)). Thus, the relation S is possible between \(z\) and \(x\), and since the query is for relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (without specified order), S is included.

### Conclusion:
The possible relations that could hold between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:  
- **N** (if \(x\) is north of \(z\)),  
- **NE** (if \(x\) is northeast of \(z\)),  
- **NW** (if \(x\) is northwest of \(z\)),  
- **S** (if \(z\) is south of \(x\)).

Thus, the possible relations are N, NE, NW, and S.

**Final Answer: N, NE, NW, S**
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Constraints from \(y\) B \(z\) in the y-axis**:
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) W \(y\)) imply \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Thus, the y-axis bounds of \(x\) are contained within those of \(z\).

2. **Constraints from \(x\) W \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\) in the x-axis**:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \geq \inf_x(z)\).
   - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - The x-axis position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) depends on \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\):
     - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\) (satisfying the W relation for \(x\) and \(z\)).
     - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(z\) (satisfying the B relation for \(x\) and \(z\)).

3. **Analysis of other relations**:
   - **S, SW, W (re-checked), NW, N, NE, E, SE**: Only W and B are feasible.
     - W is possible when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (along with y-axis containment).
     - B is possible when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (along with y-axis containment).
     - Other relations (e.g., S, SW, NW, N, NE, E, SE) violate the derived y-axis containment or x-axis bounds in all non-degenerate cases.

**Possible relations**: W (if \(x\) is west of \(z\)) and B (if \(x\) is inside the bounding box of \(z\)).

**Answer**: B, W
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): This implies \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and vertically, \(\text{infy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): This implies \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), and horizontally, \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).

From these:
- Vertically: \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), so \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\). This satisfies the vertical condition for \(x\) being north of \(z\) (N) or northeast of \(z\) (NE).
- Horizontally: \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\). However, the relationship between \(\text{supx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(z)\) is not fixed.

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **N (North)**: Requires:
   - \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (satisfied).
   - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) (satisfied).
   - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).
   This holds if \(x\)'s bounding box is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s.  
   *Example: \(z\) wide enough to cover \(x\) horizontally.*

2. **NE (Northeast)**: Requires:
   - \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (satisfied).
   - \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).
   This holds if \(z\)'s bounding box is entirely to the left of \(x\)'s.  
   *Example: \(z\) not extending rightward beyond \(x\)'s left edge.*

### Other relations are impossible:
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **W**, **NW**, **E**, **SE**: All violate vertical or horizontal constraints derived from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) N \(z\). For instance:
  - Vertically, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), ruling out S, SW, SE, etc.
  - Horizontally, \(x\) starts to the right of \(z\)'s left edge (due to \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\)), ruling out W, NW, etc.
  - E requires vertical containment in \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(z\), violating it.

Thus, the only possible relations are **N** and **NE**.

**Answer: N, NE**
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **B (bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\). This is possible when \(z\)'s bounding box horizontally and vertically encompasses \(x\)'s bounding box, satisfying the vertical constraints derived from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\) (i.e., \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), and the horizontal containment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).

- **E (East)**: \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\). This occurs when \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), combined with the vertical constraints. For example, if \(z\) is positioned east of \(y\) and \(x\) is further east than \(z\).

- **W (West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\). This occurs when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), combined with the vertical constraints. For example, if \(x\) is east of \(y\) but west of \(z\).

These relations are consistent with the vertical constraints derived:
- From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- Chaining these: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The diagonal relations (NE, NW, SE, SW) and the other axial relations (N, S) are not possible because they require additional vertical conditions (e.g., \(x\) entirely above or below \(z\)) that conflict with the derived vertical containment. The relations B, E, and W are the only ones compatible with the given constraints and vertical alignment.

**Possible relations: B, E, W**
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is E (East) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is E (East).

### Explanation:
- **E relation definition**: For any regions \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) E \(b\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(b) \leq \inf_x(a)\) (region \(b\) is entirely to the west of \(a\)),
  - \(\inf_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\) (the bottom of \(b\) is at or below the bottom of \(a\)),
  - \(\sup_y(a) \leq \sup_y(b)\) (the top of \(a\) is at or below the top of \(b\)).

- **Given conditions**:
  - \(x\) E \(y\):  
    - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
    - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
    - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
  - \(y\) E \(z\):  
    - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
    - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
    - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

- **Deriving \(x\) E \(z\)**:
  - **x-axis**:  
    \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
    Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - **y-axis**:  
    \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)),  
    and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\)).  
    Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

- **Conclusion**:  
  The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of \(x\) E \(z\).

### Why other relations are not possible:
- **NE, SE**: Require vertical misalignment (e.g., \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) for NE or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for SE), but the derived vertical conditions show nested intervals (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), making these impossible.
- **N, S**: Require horizontal containment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\), violating containment.
- **W, NW, SW**: Require \(x\) to be west of \(z\) (e.g., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) forces \(x\) east of \(z\).
- **B**: Requires full bounding box containment, but the horizontal condition (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) prevents \(x\) from being horizontally inside \(z\)'s bounding box.

Thus, the only possible relation is **E**.
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x starts right of y's right edge)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y's bounds)

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z's bottom edge)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is horizontally within z's bounds)

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\))
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the horizontal extent of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds. With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies the definition of **S** (South).
2. If \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) starts right of \(z\)'s right edge. With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies the definition of **SE** (South East).

Other relations are impossible:
- **SW**, **W**, **NW**: Require \(x\) left of \(z\), but \(\inf_x(x) \geq \inf_x(z)\).
- **N**, **NE**: Require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **E**: Requires \(x\) vertically within \(z\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) prevents this.
- **B**: Requires full containment, incompatible with vertical separation.

Thus, the possible relations are **S** and **SE**.
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely east of y),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y's bounds).
- \(y\) NW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely west of z),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is entirely south of y).

From these, we derive:
- Vertical relation: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, z is entirely south of x.
- Horizontal constraints: \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but no direct relation between \(\inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_x(x)\) or \(\sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x)\).

Given the vertical separation (z south of x), possible relations between x and z must have z south of x. Considering horizontal alignment:
- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  Example: y: \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\), x: \([12, 20] \times [5, 10]\), z: \([10, 11] \times [-10, 0]\).  
  Here, z is west and south of x.
- **S (South)**: Possible if \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\).  
  Example: y: \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\), x: \([10, 20] \times [5, 10]\), z: \([10, 15] \times [-10, 0]\).  
  Here, z is directly south of x and horizontally within x's span.
- **SE (South East)**: Possible if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Example: y: \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\), x: \([10, 15] \times [5, 10]\), z: \([16, 20] \times [-10, 0]\).  
  Here, z is east and south of x.

Other relations (N, NE, NW, E, W, B) are impossible due to the vertical constraint \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **SW, S, SE**.
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) E \(y\): 
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (vertically, \(x\) is within the vertical span of \(y\))

- From \(y\) SW \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is entirely to the south of \(z\))

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This implies that \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) start east of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

Possible horizontal scenarios:
1. \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
3. \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) S \(z\).

Other relations are impossible because:
- \(x\) is below \(z\), ruling out N, NE, NW, E, W, B (which require vertical overlap or \(x\) above \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S, SE, and SW.

S SE SW
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is E (East) of region y and region y is SE (Southeast) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is SE (Southeast).

### Explanation:
- From the definition of E:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)  
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the south edge of y is not north of the south edge of x)  
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (the north edge of x is not north of the north edge of y)  

- From the definition of SE:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)  

Combining these:  
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z) and infx(y) ≤ supx(y) (always true for regions) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y) implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SE z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x E y) implies supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Thus, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which satisfies the definition of x being SE of z (x SE z).  

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible, as the inequalities derived from the given relations force x to be strictly southeast of z, with no overlap or other positional ambiguities.

**Possible relation: SE**
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)). Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

These combined conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) satisfy the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) NE \(z\)).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) is possible:
- **E, N, S, W, SE, NW, SW, B** either violate the horizontal or vertical constraints derived above or require additional conditions (like vertical containment for N or horizontal containment for E) that are not met.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **NE**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{NE}}
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\):  
  \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\):  
  \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

From \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\), we derive:
- \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (chain in x-dimension).
- \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (y-containment).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **B (bounding box)**:  
   Requires \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
   - The y-conditions hold from above.  
   - For x: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) holds, and if additionally \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), then \(x\) B \(z\) is possible.  
   *Example*:  
   - \(z\): [0, 10] in x, [0, 10] in y.  
   - \(y\): [2, 8] in x, [2, 8] in y (so \(y\) B \(z\)).  
   - \(x\): [8, 9] in x, [3, 7] in y (so \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   Here, \(x\) is inside \(z\)'s bounding box: \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **E (east)**:  
   Requires \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
   - The y-conditions hold.  
   - If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), then \(x\) E \(z\) is possible.  
   *Example*:  
   - \(z\): [0, 8] in x, [0, 10] in y.  
   - \(y\): [2, 8] in x, [2, 8] in y (so \(y\) B \(z\)).  
   - \(x\): [9, 12] in x, [3, 7] in y (so \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   Here, \(x\) is east of \(z\): \(x\) E \(z\).

### Other relations are not possible:
- **W, NW, SW**: Require \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), but \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) implies \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\), so this fails.
- **N, NE**: Require \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but we have \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{inf}_y(y) \geq \text{inf}_y(z)\), so \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{inf}_y(z)\), and typically \(\text{sup}_y(z) > \text{inf}_y(z)\), making this impossible.
- **S, SE**: Require \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), but we have \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(x) \geq \text{inf}_y(z)\), and typically strict inequality holds, making this impossible.

Thus, the only possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **E**.

**Final Answer: B, E**
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Based on the definitions and constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\): \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \), and \( \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \).
- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\): \( \text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \), and \( \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z) \leq \text{supx}(z) \leq \text{supx}(y) \).

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) vertically, and their horizontal projections are contained within the horizontal bounds of \(y\). The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary arbitrarily within these constraints, allowing any cardinal direction relation between them:

- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\).
- **NE**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) is east of \(z\).
- **SE**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
- **B**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\).

Each relation is possible under specific configurations of the bounding boxes of \(x\) and \(z\) that satisfy the given constraints. Thus, all nine cardinal direction relations are possible.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are SW and W.

### Explanation:
- The relation \(x\) S \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- The relation \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is west of \(z\) in terms of the x-axis, ruling out relations E, NE, SE, B, N, and S, as they require conditions like \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which contradict \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) for regions with positive area.

The y-coordinate conditions allow for two possibilities:
1. **SW (South West)**: This holds if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This can occur when \(\inf_y(z)\) is sufficiently large relative to \(\sup_y(x)\), which is possible given the constraints \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
2. **W (West)**: This holds if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The latter is always true due to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The condition \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) can be satisfied when \(\inf_y(z)\) is small relative to \(\inf_y(x)\), which is possible given \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The relation NW is impossible because it requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z)\) for regions with positive area, contradicting the requirement.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and W.
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) and horizontally aligned within \(y\)'s bounding box.

- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely east of \(z\) and vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounding box.

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal relation**:  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This implies \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) horizontally, satisfying part of E, SE, or NE.

2. **Vertical relation**:  
   From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \geq \inf_y(z)\).  

   - **Case 1: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**  
     Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), this satisfies the definition of **SE** (South East):  
     \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

   - **Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
     Since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
     Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), this satisfies the definition of **E** (East):  
     \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

   Other relations (N, NE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are not possible:  
   - N, NE, NW require \(x\) north of \(z\), but \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is within \(z\) vertically, so \(x\) cannot be north.  
   - S, SW require \(x\) south of \(z\), but if \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) may be above or below \(\inf_y(z)\), it does not consistently satisfy S/SW.  
   - W, NW require \(x\) west of \(z\), but \(x\) is east due to horizontal constraints.  
   - B requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box, but \(x\) is east of \(z\) horizontally.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SE** and **E**.

**Final Answer: SE, E**
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is S of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Vertical relation**:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

2. **Horizontal relation**:  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Thus, \(x\) and \(z\) satisfy:  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertical condition for S),  
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal conditions for S).

This matches the definition of \(x\) being S of \(z\). Other relations (N, NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW, B) are incompatible with these constraints due to conflicts in vertical positioning or horizontal bounds. Therefore, the only possible relation is **S**.
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): This means:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (the top of \(x\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): This means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (the right of \(y\) is at or left of the left of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (the top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)).

From these:
1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Combining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\) (no horizontal overlap).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) have vertical bounds at or below \(\inf_y(y)\) (bottom of \(y\)), but their relative vertical positions (above, below, or overlapping) are not constrained further.

Given the horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are those where \(x\) is west of \(z\), and the vertical alignment can vary:
- **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).
- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).

These are the only possible relations consistent with the constraints. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) do not satisfy the horizontal separation or the vertical constraints derived.

**Possible relations: NW, W, SW**
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
1. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
2. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

These conditions exactly match the definition of SW:  
\(x\) is SW of \(z\) if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Now, consider other relations:
- **S**: Requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but we have \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), and equality does not necessarily hold. Thus, S is not guaranteed.
- **W**: Requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\), and equality fails. Thus, W is impossible.
- **NW**: Requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\), and the condition fails.
- **SE**: Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) > \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), making \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) impossible.
- **E, NE, N, B**: Similarly, the derived conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) conflict with the requirements of these relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.

**Answer: SW**
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\))

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is to the left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:

1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

2. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Chaining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Thus, \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\).

These conditions match the definition of \(x\) being **SE (South East)** of \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal: \(x\) is east of \(z\))
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertical: \(x\) is south of \(z\))

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) satisfies both constraints simultaneously. For example:
- **E (East)** requires vertical containment (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z)\), violating \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **S (South)** requires horizontal containment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), a contradiction since regions have positive extent.

Thus, the only possible relation is **SE**.

**Answer**: SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(y\) NE \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(z\) is left of \(x\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
1. **If \(z\) is below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\))**:  
   Then \(z\) is left and below \(x\), so \(x\) is NE of \(z\) (since \(x\) is right and above \(z\)).
2. **If \(z\) is above \(x\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\))**:  
   Then \(z\) is left and above \(x\), so \(x\) is SE of \(z\) (since \(x\) is right and below \(z\)).
3. **If \(x\) and \(z\) share the same vertical bounds (\(\inf_y(x) = \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) = \sup_y(z)\))**:  
   Then \(z\) is left of \(x\) with vertical alignment, so \(x\) is E of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are:
- NE (if \(z\) is below \(x\))
- SE (if \(z\) is above \(x\))
- E (if vertical bounds are equal)

**Answer: NE, SE, E**
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S (South) or B (bounding box). This is determined by the constraints on their bounding boxes:

- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Chaining these inequalities:
- For the x-coordinates: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be west (W), east (E), or in any diagonal direction (SW, NW, SE, NE) relative to \(z\).
- For the y-coordinates: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\):
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) S \(z\) holds because \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  - Otherwise, if \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) B \(z\) may hold if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (in addition to the x-conditions and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which are satisfied). However, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is not always true, but when it is, \(x\) B \(z\) applies. Given the constraints, \(x\) cannot be north (N) of \(z\) because \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is impossible due to the regions having area and the inequalities.

Thus, the possible relations are S and B.

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entirely to the west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entirely to the north of \(y\))

- \(y\) is N of \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entirely to the south of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally within the x-range of \(y\))

Combining these:

- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).

- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely to the south of \(x\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) define the NW relation. Therefore, \(x\) must be NW of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) are possible, as they violate the combined constraints from the given relations. For example:
- N would require \(z\) to be south of \(x\) (which holds) but also \(z\)'s x-range to contain \(x\)'s, which fails because \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- W would require vertical containment that does not hold due to the north-south separation.

Thus, the only possible relation is **NW**.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the left and above \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\), and \(z\) vertically contains \(y\).

From \(x\) NW \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\), the following constraints arise for \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal constraint**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(x\) is always to the left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraints**:  
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the vertical extent of \(z\) relative to \(x\):

- **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
  - Then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), satisfying NW.  
  - Example: \(z\)'s bounding box does not extend above the bottom of \(x\).

- **Case 2: Vertical containment of \(x\) in \(z\)**  
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), the relation W holds.  
  - Example: \(z\)'s bounding box vertically contains \(x\) while \(x\) is left of \(z\).

Other relations (N, S, E, etc.) are not possible:
- N requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and horizontal containment, but the horizontal condition conflicts due to \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the requirement for positive area regions (preventing degenerate horizontal alignment).
- S, SW require \(x\) below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(z\) contains \(y\), making \(x\) above parts of \(z\).
- E, NE, SE require \(x\) to the east of \(z\), but \(x\) is always west.
- B requires full containment, which is impossible horizontally since \(x\) is left of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW** and **W**.

**Answer: NW, W**
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the bounding box constraints and spatial arrangements. The analysis considers horizontal and vertical positioning based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ NW } y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x).
- \(y \text{ E } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is left of y),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is vertically within z).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **N (North)**: Possible when \(x\) and \(z\) horizontally overlap (bounding boxes overlap horizontally), and \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). Example: Horizontal projections overlap, and \(z\)'s top is at or below \(x\)'s bottom.
- **NE (Northeast)**: Possible when \(z\) is entirely left and below \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). This corresponds to \(x\) being northeast of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: Possible when \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). The vertical containment can be satisfied by appropriate region scaling.
- **NW (Northwest)**: Possible when \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), and \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). This matches \(x\) being northwest of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: Possible when \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). Vertical containment can be satisfied.
- **B (Bounding box)**: Possible when \(x\)'s bounding box is contained within \(z\)'s (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). Achievable with horizontal overlap and vertical containment.

Excluded relations:
- **SE**, **S**, **SW** are impossible due to \(y\) being below \(x\) and vertically within \(z\), forcing \(x\) above \(z\) in all cases. Specifically:
  - For \(x \text{ S } z\) or \(x \text{ SW } z\), \(x\) would need to be below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(y\) is within \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be below \(z\).
  - For \(x \text{ SE } z\), \(x\) would need to be below \(z\), which is similarly impossible.

Thus, the possible relations are N, NE, E, NW, W, and B.

**Final Answer: N, NE, E, NW, W, B**
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Based on the definitions of the cardinal direction relations and the given constraints:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- Region \(y\) is S of region \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

From these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the positional constraints along the x and y axes. The relations that satisfy all constraints for some configuration of regions (with bounding boxes having positive area, as regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk) are:

- **NW**: \(x\) can be NW of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- **W**: \(x\) can be W of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).
- **N**: \(x\) can be N of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
- **B**: \(x\) can be B of \(z\) (bounding box) if \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).
- **S**: \(x\) can be S of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
- **SW**: \(x\) can be SW of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

The relations **NE**, **E**, and **SE** are impossible due to contradictions in the x-axis constraints: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \geq \text{sup}_x(y) > \text{inf}_x(y) \geq \text{inf}_x(x)\), which violates the requirements for these relations (e.g., \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) for SE, E, and NE).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **NW, W, N, B, S, SW**.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, the cardinal direction relation between x and z must be NW. This is derived from the definition of the NW relation and the transitive property of the inequalities involved.

- x NW y implies:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is west of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is south of x, so x is north of y)  

- y NW z implies:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is west of z)  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is south of y, so y is north of z)  

Combining these:  
- From \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of x NW z:  
- \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\) for a = x and b = z.  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible, as they require additional conditions not guaranteed by the given inequalities. For example:  
- N requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which may not hold.  
- W requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which may not hold.  
- B requires containment in both dimensions, which is not implied.  

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

\boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\))
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\), limiting possible relations to W, NW, or SW.
- Vertically: The relations depend on the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\):
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\) (vertically, \(x\) is contained within \(z\)).

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are excluded because:
- N, S require horizontal alignment (e.g., \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), which conflicts with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the requirement that regions have positive area (being homeomorphic to a disk).
- NE, E, SE would require \(x\) to be right of \(z\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) ensures \(x\) is left.
- B requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s horizontally and vertically, but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) violates horizontal containment.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, W, SW**.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations—region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\)—the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal direction relations. This is because the positional constraints allow configurations that satisfy each relation:

- **N (North)**: \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box.
- **NE (North East)**: \(x\) is entirely northeast of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box.
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) is entirely southeast of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box.
- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is entirely southwest of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box.
- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) is entirely northwest of \(z\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\).

Examples for each relation can be constructed by adjusting the coordinates of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) while satisfying \(x\) NW \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\). Thus, all nine relations are possible.

**Answer:** N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This implies \(x\) is west of \(y\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)) and \(y\) is below \(x\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This implies \(z\) is west of \(y\) (since \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)) and \(z\) is below \(y\) (since \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)).

From the vertical constraints:  
\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is below \(x\), so vertically, \(x\) is north of \(z\).

Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are west of \(y\):  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\). The horizontal relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:  
   \(x\) is west of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being north of \(z\), the relation is **NW** (\(x\) is northwest of \(z\)).

2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   \(z\) is west of \(x\), so \(x\) is east of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being north of \(z\), the relation is **NE** (\(x\) is northeast of \(z\)).

3. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   The bounding box of \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being north of \(z\), the relation is **N** (\(x\) is north of \(z\)).

These are the only cases that fit the given constraints and the defined relations. Overlap without horizontal containment does not correspond to any defined relation in the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **N**, **NE**, and **NW**.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the left and above \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(y\)'s bounding box.

### Analysis of \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relation** (along the x-axis):  
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   This allows two possibilities:  
     - **H1**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) → \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  
     - **H2**: \(\sup_x(x) > \inf_x(z)\) → horizontal overlap occurs.  

2. **Vertical relation** (along the y-axis):  
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). The relation between \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) is:  
     - **V1**: \(\sup_y(z) < \inf_y(x)\) → \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  
     - **V2**: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\) → vertical overlap occurs.  

### Possible Relations:
- **Case H1 and V1** (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) < \inf_y(x)\)):  
  This satisfies the conditions for \(x\) NW \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical, since strict inequality implies \(\leq\)).  

- **Case H1 and V2** (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\)):  
  This allows two subcases:  
  - If \(\sup_y(z) = \inf_y(x)\), it satisfies \(x\) NW \(z\) (as above).  
  - If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and additionally \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), it satisfies \(x\) W \(z\):  
    \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from chain), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment).  

- Other combinations (H2 with V1 or V2) do not yield any of the atomic relations \(N\), \(NE\), \(E\), \(SE\), \(S\), \(SW\), \(B\), or \(NW\) under the constraints, based on the defined conditions and the requirement that regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk (non-degenerate).  

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
- **NW** (from H1+V1 and H1+V2 with \(\sup_y(z) = \inf_y(x)\)).  
- **W** (from H1+V2 with \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  

Thus, the possible relations are **NW** and **W**.  

**Answer: NW, W**
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the constraints on their bounding boxes. The horizontal and vertical bounds from the given relations lead to the following possibilities:

1. **SW (South West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   - Example: \(x\) is entirely left and below \(z\).

2. **NW (North West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - Example: \(x\) is entirely left and above \(z\).

3. **W (West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and vertically \(z\) contains \(x\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  
   - Example: \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounds.

4. **S (South)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and horizontally \(z\) contains \(x\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
   - Example: \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds.

5. **N (North)**:  
   - Occurs when \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and horizontally \(z\) contains \(x\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
   - Example: \(x\) is above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds.

6. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   - Occurs when \(z\) contains \(x\) both horizontally and vertically:  
     \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   - Example: \(x\) is completely inside \(z\)'s bounding box.

Other relations (NE, E, SE) are not possible due to the constraints:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) imply \(x\) cannot be east of \(z\).
- Vertical bounds \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) prevent eastern or northeastern alignments.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, NW, S, SW, W**.
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal west constraint).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) can vary vertically.

### Possible Relations for \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**:  
   Occurs if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   Example:  
   - \(y\): \([-3, -1] \times [1.5, 2]\),  
   - \(x\): \([-5, -4] \times [0.5, 1.0]\) (so \(\sup_y(x) = 1.0 \leq \inf_y(z) = 1.5\)),  
   - \(z\): \([0, 2] \times [1.5, 2.5]\).  
   Then \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\), and \(x\) SW \(z\).

2. **W (West)**:  
   Occurs if \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (so \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds).  
   Example:  
   - \(y\): \([-3, -1] \times [1, 1.5]\),  
   - \(x\): \([-5, -4] \times [0.5, 1.0]\) (so \(\sup_y(x) = 1.0 > \inf_y(z) = 0\) and \(\inf_y(x) = 0.5 \geq \inf_y(z) = 0\)),  
   - \(z\): \([0, 2] \times [0, 2]\).  
   Then \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\), and \(x\) W \(z\).

### Other Relations Ruled Out:
- **NW (North West)**: Requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). But \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), making \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) impossible.
- **B (Bounding Box)**: Requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) only if equal, but horizontal separation typically prevents this.
- **S, SE, E, NE, N**: Require \(x\) not strictly west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) south or east), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) forces west alignment.

Thus, the only possible relations are **SW** and **W**.
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the definitions and constraints. The analysis shows that \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\) (i.e., N, NE, NW are impossible) due to the vertical positioning from the given relations. The possible relations are:

- **SW (South West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is strictly left and below \(z\), satisfying \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **S (South)**: This occurs when \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally within the x-bounds of \(z\), satisfying \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- **SE (South East)**: This occurs when \(x\) is strictly right and below \(z\), satisfying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **W (West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is strictly left of \(z\) with vertical overlap and containment, satisfying \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **E (East)**: This occurs when \(x\) is strictly right of \(z\) with vertical overlap and containment, satisfying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs when the bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\), satisfying \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The relations N, NE, and NW are impossible because \(x\) cannot be above \(z\) vertically, as derived from the constraints \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which imply \(x\) is always below or overlapping with \(z\) but never above.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, SE, W, E, and B.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S, SE, W, E, B
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- From \(x\) SW \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) S \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), leading to two cases for the relative positions of \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
   Then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which satisfies the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\).

2. **Case 2: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)**  
   This implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\). Within this, the relation between \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) determines:
   - **Subcase 2a: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
     Then \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) from the chain). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) S \(z\).
   - **Subcase 2b: \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
     Here, \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). However, no cardinal direction relation from the defined set (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) holds, as the horizontal overlap and vertical alignment do not match any definition.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **SW** (from Case 1)
- **S** (from Subcase 2a)

No other relations are possible under the given constraints and definitions.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: Given the relations:
- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely to the west (left) of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\). Combined with the horizontal, \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. **NW (North West)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), meaning \(x\) is above \(z\). Combined with the horizontal, \(x\) NW \(z\).
3. **W (West)**: If the vertical interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\), i.e., \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is west of \(z\) with vertical containment. Thus, \(x\) W \(z\).

The relations S, N, E, SE, NE, B are not possible because:
- \(x\) is west of \(z\) (not east, so E, SE, NE excluded).
- Horizontal containment (required for S, N, B) does not hold since \(x\) is strictly left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies no horizontal overlap).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

**Answer: SW, W, NW**
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the relations imply:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) means \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SW \(z\) means \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) define \(x\) SW \(z\). 

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) can hold simultaneously with the given constraints, as they require additional or conflicting conditions (e.g., horizontal or vertical containment, or opposite directional alignments that contradict the derived inequalities). 

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.

**Answer: SW**
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Given the cardinal direction relations:
- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This means \(x\) is below \(z\) vertically.
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible horizontal relationships between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **\(x\) entirely left of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. **\(z\) entirely left of \(x\)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
3. **\(x\) horizontally contained in \(z\)**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this gives \(x\) S \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- \(B\), \(N\), \(NE\), \(E\), \(NW\), \(W\) require vertical containment, overlap, or specific horizontal alignments not satisfied here.
- The vertical separation (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) and horizontal constraints exclude these.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer: SW, S, SE**
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B. This is because the constraints only require both \(x\) and \(z\) to be entirely to the left and below \(y\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), but do not impose any restrictions on the relative positions between \(x\) and \(z\). Examples can be constructed for each relation:

- **SW**: \(x\) left and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\), \(z\): \([6, 10] \times [6, 10]\)).
- **S**: \(x\) below \(z\) with aligned horizontal bounds (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [6, 10]\)).
- **SE**: \(x\) below and to the right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6, 10] \times [0, 5]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [6, 10]\)).
- **W**: \(x\) left of \(z\) with aligned vertical bounds (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 10]\), \(z\): \([6, 10] \times [0, 10]\)).
- **B**: Bounding box of \(x\) contained in \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([2, 3] \times [2, 3]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\)).
- **E**: \(x\) right of \(z\) with aligned vertical bounds (e.g., \(x\): \([6, 10] \times [0, 10]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 10]\)).
- **N**: \(x\) above \(z\) with aligned horizontal bounds (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [6, 10]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\)).
- **NE**: \(x\) above and to the right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([6, 10] \times [6, 10]\), \(z\): \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\)).
- **NW**: \(x\) above and to the left of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([0, 5] \times [6, 10]\), \(z\): \([6, 10] \times [0, 5]\)).

Thus, any relation is possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Answer:** N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\): \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the constraints:

1. **SW (South West)**:  
   If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) entirely left and below \(z\)'s bounding box.

2. **S (South)**:  
   If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is S of \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s x-bounds.

3. **W (West)**:  
   If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) left of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s y-bounds.

4. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).  
   Example: Bounding box of \(x\) contained within bounding box of \(z\).

These relations are possible under the given constraints, as verified through examples and bounds analysis. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW) are not possible due to contradictions with the initial conditions (e.g., \(x\) cannot be above or right of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, S, SW, W**.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. The regions are in REG, meaning they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, ensuring non-empty interiors and strict inequalities for bounding box bounds (i.e., \(\inf_x < \sup_x\) and \(\inf_y < \sup_y\)).

### Constraints from the relations:
- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y)
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is south of y)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z starts at or left of y horizontally)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z ends at or right of y horizontally)

### Key implications:
- **Horizontal**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z starts left of or at x), and \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\) (z ends right of or at y's right). Since \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\), \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z)\) can vary such that:
  - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), x is east of z.
  - Otherwise, horizontal overlap may occur, but x cannot be west of z due to \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **Vertical**: Both \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x and z are both south of y). The vertical positions can vary such that:
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), x is south of z.
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), x is north of z.
  - Otherwise, vertical overlap may occur.

### Possible relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- **S (South)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and horizontal conditions allow (e.g., if x is within or east of z horizontally).
- **SE (Southeast)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x south and east of z).
- **E (East)**: Possible if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x east of z with vertical containment).
- **NE (Northeast)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x north and east of z).
- **N (North)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and horizontal conditions allow (e.g., if x is within or east of z horizontally).

### Relations that are impossible:
- **W, NW, SW**: Impossible because \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies x cannot be west of z.
- **B**: Impossible because the constraints prevent z from containing x (e.g., vertically, both are south of y, and x is east of y, so z cannot contain x).

### Conclusion:
The possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S, SE, E, NE, and N. These account for the variations in horizontal and vertical positioning allowed by the constraints.

**Possible relations: S, SE, E, NE, N**
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: Given the relations:  
- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): This means the entire region \(x\) is to the southeast of \(y\). Specifically:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\)),  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the south of \(y\)).  

- \(y\) is W of \(z\): This means the entire region \(y\) is to the west of \(z\). Specifically:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\)),  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(z\) vertically spans at least the same as \(y\)).  

To find possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the constraints:  
- **Horizontal relations** (x-coordinates):  
  - From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the east of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their relative positions can vary:  
  - \(x\) may be east, west, or horizontally overlapping with \(z\).  

- **Vertical relations** (y-coordinates):  
  - From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This implies \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(z\) extends at least from \(\inf_y(y)\) upward. However, \(z\) may extend downward below \(\inf_y(y)\), and \(x\)'s bottom \(\inf_y(x)\) is unconstrained below \(\sup_y(x)\).  

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by satisfying specific bounding box conditions. Through configuration examples:  
- **SE**: If \(z\) is northwest of \(x\) (e.g., \(z\) starts east of \(y\) but \(x\) is southeast of \(z\)).  
- **E**: If \(x\) is east of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s span.  
- **B**: If \(x\) is inside \(z\)'s bounding box (e.g., \(z\) expands to cover \(x\)).  
- **S**: If \(x\) is south of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s span.  
- **SW**: If \(x\) is southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) starts east of \(y\) but ends west of \(z\)).  
- **W**: If \(x\) is west of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s span.  

Impossible relations:  
- **N**, **NE**, **NW**: Require \(z\) to be entirely below \(x\), but constraints force \(z\) to be at or above \(y\)'s bottom, while \(x\) is below \(y\)'s bottom, making \(z\) higher than \(x\).  

Thus, the possible relations are:  
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **W**, **E**, **SE**.  

**Final Answer**  
B, S, SW, W, E, SE
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are E (East) and SE (South-East).

- **SE (South-East)**: This is possible when x is south and east of z with no vertical overlap, i.e., \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This can occur if z is positioned high relative to y, making \(\inf_y(z)\) large, while x is south of y with \(\sup_y(x)\) small.
  
- **E (East)**: This is possible when x is east of z with vertical containment, i.e., \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). This can occur if z and x have overlapping or aligned vertical bounds, with z not higher than x.

The relation NE (North-East) is impossible because it requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which contradicts the given relations since \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), making \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) infeasible for regions with area. Relations such as N, S, W, SW, NW, and B are not possible due to the eastward positioning of x relative to z (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).

Thus, the possible relations are E and SE.

**Possible relations: E, SE**
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (y is entirely to the west of x)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely to the south of y)
- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely to the south of z)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is horizontally within the bounding box of z)

From \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) S \(z\):
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, x is entirely to the south of z.
- Horizontally: 
  - From \(x\) SE \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  - Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so the left edge of z is left of or equal to the left edge of x.

The possible horizontal relations between x and z:
1. If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\):
   - z is entirely to the west of x.
   - Combined with x being south of z, this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
2. If \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\):
   - The horizontal span of x is within z's bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
   - Combined with x being south of z, this gives \(x\) S \(z\).
3. If \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\):
   - x extends east beyond z's bounding box.
   - However, no base relation (S, SE, etc.) fits, as S requires full horizontal containment, and SE requires z entirely west of x. Thus, this case does not yield a base relation.

Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the vertical constraint (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) and horizontal constraints derived.

Thus, the possible base relations between x and z are S and SE.

**Possible relations: S, SE**
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Given \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- Given \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

The constraints are:
1. \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (horizontal: both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(y\)).
2. \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (vertical: both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\)).

No further constraints directly relate \(x\) and \(z\), so their relative positions can vary within these bounds. All nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible, as verified by constructing valid examples for each:

- **B (bounding box)**: Arrange \(x\) within the bounding box of \(z\) horizontally and vertically.
- **S (South)**: Place \(x\) below \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **SW (South West)**: Place \(x\) below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: Place \(x\) to the left of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **NW (North West)**: Place \(x\) above and to the left of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: Place \(x\) above \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **NE (North East)**: Place \(x\) above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: Place \(x\) to the right of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **SE (South East)**: Place \(x\) below and to the right of \(z\).

Thus, every relation is achievable by adjusting the positions of \(x\) and \(z\) while respecting the given constraints.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S (South), SE (South East), and SW (South West).

### Explanation:
- From \(x\) SE \(y\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y)
- From \(y\) SW \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is west of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z)

Combining these:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is south of \(z\).
- The x-direction constraints (\(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)) allow for different relative positions:
  - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) S \(z\) (South).
  - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) SE \(z\) (South East).
  - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) SW \(z\) (South West).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are possible because \(x\) must be south of \(z\) due to the y-axis constraints.

Thus, the possible relations are S, SE, and SW.

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}}
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the relations impose specific constraints on the bounding boxes:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(y\)),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\)).
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the right of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(z\)).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being SE of \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) holds simultaneously under these constraints, as they would require conflicting horizontal or vertical alignments (e.g., \(x\) cannot be east of \(z\) without vertical containment, which is not met, nor south without horizontal containment, which also fails).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SE.

**Answer: SE**
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y)

- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is east of z)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (y is north of z, so z is south of y)

Combining the horizontal bounds:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning x is east of z.

For the vertical relation between x and z:
1. **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:
   - x is south of z.
   - Combined with east, this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
2. **If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**:
   - z is south of x, so x is north of z.
   - Combined with east, this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).
3. **If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**:
   - The vertical span of x is contained within z.
   - Combined with east, this gives \(x\) E \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as the horizontal east constraint limits the possibilities to SE, NE, or E. Examples exist for each case, confirming they are achievable under the given relations.

**Possible relations between x and z: NE, SE, E**
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are SE, S, E, and B. These relations are derived from the constraints imposed by the SE and B relations, considering the relative positions of the bounding boxes.

- **SE (South East)**: This is possible when the supremum of z's x-coordinates is less than or equal to the infimum of x's x-coordinates, and the supremum of x's y-coordinates is less than or equal to the infimum of z's y-coordinates. For example, with appropriate positioning, x can be southeast of z.
- **S (South)**: This is possible when the supremum of x's y-coordinates is less than or equal to the infimum of z's y-coordinates, and the supremum of x's x-coordinates is less than or equal to the supremum of z's x-coordinates (with the infimum of z's x-coordinates always less than or equal to the infimum of x's x-coordinates due to the constraints). For example, x can be directly south of z.
- **E (East)**: This is possible when the supremum of z's x-coordinates is less than or equal to the infimum of x's x-coordinates, and the infimum of z's y-coordinates is less than or equal to the infimum of x's y-coordinates (with the supremum of x's y-coordinates always less than or equal to the supremum of z's y-coordinates). For example, x can be directly east of z.
- **B (Bounding box)**: This is possible when the infimum of z's y-coordinates is less than or equal to the infimum of x's y-coordinates and the supremum of x's x-coordinates is less than or equal to the supremum of z's x-coordinates (with other conditions always satisfied). For example, x can be contained within the bounding box of z.

Relations such as N, NE, NW, W, SW are not possible due to contradictions with the constraints (e.g., they require conditions like the supremum of x's x-coordinates being less than or equal to the infimum of z's x-coordinates, which conflicts with the given SE and B relations).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are SE, S, E, and B.

\boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are N (North) and NE (North East).

- **N (North)**: This can occur if the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z, and x is above z.
- **NE (North East)**: This can occur if x is strictly to the right and above z, with no overlap in the x-projections.

No other relations (such as E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) are possible due to the relative positions derived from the given relations (x NE y and y N z), which imply that x must be above z and cannot be south, west, or overlapping in a way that allows other directions.

Thus, the possible relations are N and NE.
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: The cardinal direction relations are defined based on the minimum bounding boxes of regions. Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints imposed by these relations.

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\))
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(z\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is contained in \(z\))

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

1. **B (Bounding box)**: If the bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\):
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

2. **N (North)**: If \(x\) is directly above \(z\) with horizontal containment:
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

3. **NE (North East)**: If \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

4. **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

5. **W (West)**: If \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) with vertical containment:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

6. **E (East)**: If \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) with vertical containment:
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

The relations S, SE, and SW are not possible due to the vertical constraints from \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\), ensuring \(x\) cannot be below \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are: **B, N, NE, NW, W, E**.
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is vertically contained within \(z\))

From \(y\) E \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\). From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combining these, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\), meaning the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must involve an eastern component (E, NE, or SE).

Now, consider the vertical direction:
- From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- From \(y\) E \(z\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

This gives \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
   Here, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\). With \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this matches the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\):  
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

2. **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\)**  
   Here, the vertical extent of \(z\) overlaps or extends above the bottom of \(x\). However, from \(y\) E \(z\), \(y\) is vertically contained in \(z\), and from \(x\) NE \(y\), \(y\) is below \(x\). This can lead to \(x\) E \(z\) if \(x\) is vertically contained in \(z\):  
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (already satisfied)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied from above)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (requires the top of \(x\) to be below or at the top of \(z\))  

   Example:  
   - \(z\): bounding box \([0, 1] \times [0, 3]\)  
   - \(y\): bounding box \([1.5, 2.5] \times [0.5, 1.5]\) (satisfies \(y\) E \(z\))  
   - \(x\): bounding box \([3, 4] \times [2, 3]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))  
   Then \(x\) E \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(z) = 1 \leq \inf_x(x) = 3\)
     - \(\inf_y(z) = 0 \leq \inf_y(x) = 2\)
     - \(\sup_y(x) = 3 \leq \sup_y(z) = 3\)

The relation SE (\(x\) SE \(z\)) would require \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but from \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), this implies \(\inf_y(z) = \inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x)\), which is impossible for regions homeomorphic to a disk (having area). Thus, SE is not possible.

Other relations (N, S, NW, SW, W, B) do not satisfy \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or the vertical conditions.

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE and E.

**Answer: NE, E**
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the bounding box constraints. The relations that are possible include:

- **N (North)**: x can be north of z if z is below x and the horizontal projection of x is within the horizontal projection of z.
- **NE (North East)**: x can be northeast of z if z is below and to the left of x.
- **E (East)**: x can be east of z if z is to the left of x and the vertical projections align such that z is not above or below x.
- **SE (South East)**: x can be southeast of z if z is above and to the left of x.
- **S (South)**: x can be south of z if z is above x and the horizontal projection of x is within the horizontal projection of z.
- **B (Bounding box)**: x can have its bounding box contained within the bounding box of z under specific alignment conditions.

The relations NW, W, and SW are impossible because x is east of y (from x NE y), and thus cannot be west of z relative to the bounding boxes.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(y\) is west of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is south of \(x\))

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(z\) is south of \(y\))

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), transitivity gives \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) is west of \(x\)).
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), transitivity gives \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(z\) is south of \(x\)).

Thus, relative to \(x\), \(z\) is to the west and south, which corresponds to \(z\) being SW of \(x\). Conversely, relative to \(z\), \(x\) is to the east and north, which corresponds to \(x\) being NE of \(z\). Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- \(x\) NE \(z\)
- \(z\) SW \(x\)

In terms of the base relations, this corresponds to **NE** and **SW**.

**Answer:** NE, SW
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (the entire \(y\) is to the left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (the entire \(y\) is below \(x\))
- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (the entire \(y\) is to the left of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (the entire \(y\) is below \(z\))

These constraints imply:
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(y\).
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) start above \(y\).

The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary. Through specific examples, all nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:

- **NE**: \(x\) can be northeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) far right and up, \(z\) centered).
- **E**: \(x\) can be east of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right of \(z\), vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounds).
- **SE**: \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right and below \(z\)).
- **S**: \(x\) can be south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) below \(z\), horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s bounds).
- **SW**: \(x\) can be southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left and below \(z\)).
- **W**: \(x\) can be west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\), vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounds).
- **NW**: \(x\) can be northwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left and above \(z\)).
- **N**: \(x\) can be north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\), horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s bounds).
- **B**: \(x\) can be within the bounding box of \(z\) (e.g., both aligned such that \(z\)'s box contains \(x\)'s box).

Thus, every relation is possible under the given constraints.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (with \(x\) as the subject and \(z\) as the reference) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) NE \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is west of \(x\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(x\)).
  
- From \(y\) SE \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is west of \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(z\)).

Chaining the \(x\)-constraints:  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\).

For the \(y\)-direction:  
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning both \(x\) and \(z\) are north of \(y\), but their vertical alignment relative to each other is unconstrained. Possible cases:
  1. \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\): \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) → \(x\) NE \(z\).
  2. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\): \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) → \(x\) SE \(z\).
  3. Vertical containment: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(x\) E \(z\).

Examples confirm all three are feasible:
- **NE**: \(z\) at \(x:[-1, -0.5]\), \(y:[1.5, 2]\); \(y\) at \(x:[0,1]\), \(y:[0,1]\); \(x\) at \(x:[1.5,2]\), \(y:[2.5,3]\).  
  \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) hold; \(x\) NE \(z\).
- **SE**: \(z\) at \(x:[-1, -0.5]\), \(y:[2.5,3]\); \(y\) at \(x:[0,1]\), \(y:[0,1]\); \(x\) at \(x:[1.5,2]\), \(y:[1.5,2]\).  
  \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) hold; \(x\) SE \(z\).
- **E**: \(z\) at \(x:[-1, -0.5]\), \(y:[1.5,3]\); \(y\) at \(x:[0,1]\), \(y:[0,1]\); \(x\) at \(x:[1.5,2]\), \(y:[2,2.5]\).  
  \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) hold; \(x\) E \(z\).

Other relations (N, S, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the east constraint \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations are NE, SE, and E.

**Answer: NE, SE, E**
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the conditions are:

- For \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- For \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

Chaining the inequalities:
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

These satisfy the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) is possible because:
- The \(x\)-coordinate condition (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) requires \(x\) to be strictly east of \(z\), ruling out W, NW, SW, and B.
- The \(y\)-coordinate condition (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)) requires \(x\) to be strictly north of \(z\), ruling out S, SE, and B.
- Relations like N or E require additional constraints (e.g., horizontal alignment for N or vertical alignment for E) that are violated due to the strict displacement in both axes.

Thus, the only possible relation is **NE**.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **NE (North East)**:  
   Occurs when \(x\) is entirely east and north of \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This is possible if the bounds align such that \(x\) lies strictly northeast of \(z\).

2. **E (East)**:  
   Occurs when \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) and within the north-south bounds of \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   This requires \(x\) to be east of \(z\) but vertically contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.

3. **N (North)**:  
   Occurs when \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) and within the east-west bounds of \(z\):  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   This requires \(x\) to be north of \(z\) but horizontally contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.

4. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   Occurs when \(x\) is entirely contained within the bounding box of \(z\):  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
   \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   This is possible if \(z\)'s bounding box is large enough to include \(x\).

These relations are mutually exclusive and cover all possible configurations under the given constraints. Other relations (S, SE, SW, W, NW) are not possible due to the northeast positioning of \(x\) relative to \(y\) and the containment of \(y\) in \(z\), which prevent \(x\) from being south, southwest, west, or northwest of \(z\).

**Possible relations: NE, E, N, B**
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: Based on the given relations:

- **x B y**: The bounding box of y contains the bounding box of x. This implies:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (x-projection within y).
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (y-projection within y).

- **y N z**: Region y is North of region z. This implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (z is entirely below y).
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (x-projection of y within z).

### Analysis for x and z:
1. **x-projection**:
   - From x B y: \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).
   - From y N z: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
   - Combining: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), meaning the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z.

2. **y-projection**:
   - From x B y: \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
   - From y N z: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
   - Combining: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

### Conclusion:
- The conditions \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) satisfy the definition of **x N z** (North relation).
- Other relations (NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are not possible due to:
  - The strict vertical separation (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)) rules out S, SE, SW, E, W, B, and NE.
  - The x-containment rules out E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.

Thus, the only possible relation between region x and region z is **N**.
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is \(B\) (bounding box) of \(y\):  
  This implies:  
  \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) is \(W\) (West) of \(z\):  
  This implies:  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraint for \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x \ B \ y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y \ W \ z\)), so:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   This means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraints for \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(x \ B \ y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y \ W \ z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Chaining these:  
   \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   This means the vertical span of \(x\) is contained within the vertical span of \(z\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) match the definition of the \(W\) (West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\).  

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:  
- \(SW\) or \(NW\) would require \(x\) to be entirely below or above \(z\) vertically, but the vertical constraints show \(x\) is within \(z\)'s vertical span.  
- \(S\), \(N\), \(E\), \(NE\), \(SE\), or \(B\) are inconsistent with the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the vertical containment.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is \(W\).

**Answer: W**
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Given that region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are East (E), North East (NE), and South East (SE).

- **x E z** is possible when z is vertically within the y-range of x.
- **x NE z** is possible when z is below x vertically.
- **x SE z** is possible when z is above x vertically.

These relations are derived from the bounding box constraints:
- From x B y: The bounding box of y contains the bounding box of x, so infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- From y E z: z is to the East of y, so supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(z), and supy(z) ≤ supy(y).
- Combining these, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) holds, meaning z is to the West of x on the x-axis. The vertical relationship determines whether the relation is E, NE, or SE.

No other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are possible due to the fixed leftward position of z relative to x and the vertical constraints from the relations with y.

\boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- **x B y**: The bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y.  
  This implies:  
  - `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (x is horizontally within y).  
  - `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)` and `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (x is vertically within y).  

- **y S z**: y is directly below z.  
  This implies:  
  - `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y is entirely below z).  
  - `infx(z) ≤ infx(y)` and `supx(y) ≤ supx(z)` (y is horizontally within z).  

### Analysis of x relative to z:
1. **Horizontal alignment**:  
   - From `x B y`: `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`.  
   - From `y S z`: `infx(z) ≤ infx(y)` and `supx(y) ≤ supx(z)`.  
   Combining these:  
   - `infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` → `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)`.  
   - `supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)` → `supx(x) ≤ supx(z)`.  
   Thus, x is horizontally within z.  

2. **Vertical alignment**:  
   - From `x B y`: `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)`.  
   - From `y S z`: `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)`.  
   Combining these: `supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` → `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`.  
   Thus, x is entirely below z.  

### Conclusion:
The conditions `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`, `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)`, and `supx(x) ≤ supx(z)` satisfy the definition of **S** (South) for x relative to z.  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, SW, B) is possible because:  
- **B** requires `infy(z) ≤ infy(x)`, but `infy(z) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(x)` (from `y S z` and `x B y`), and equality cannot hold for non-degenerate regions (as regions are homeomorphic to a disk with positive extent).  
- **SW**, **W**, **NW** require `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`, but we have `infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x)`, making this impossible.  
- **E**, **SE**, **NE** require `supx(z) ≤ infx(x)`, but we have `infx(x) ≥ infx(z)`, making this impossible.  
- **N**, **NE**, **NW** require `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`, but `supy(z) ≥ infy(z) ≥ supy(y) ≥ supy(x) ≥ infy(x)`, and strict inequality holds for non-degenerate regions.  

Thus, the only possible relation between region x and region z is **S**.  

**Answer: S**
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given relations:

- **x B y**: This means the bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of y. Specifically:
  - Horizontally: `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`
  - Vertically: `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)` and `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)`

- **y NW z**: This means y is northwest of z. Specifically:
  - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y is entirely to the west of z)
  - `supy(z) ≤ infy(y)` (y is entirely to the north of z)

### Deriving the relation between x and z:
1. **Horizontal position (x-axis)**:
   - From x B y: `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`
   - From y NW z: `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`
   - Combining: `supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` → `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`
   - Thus, x is entirely to the west of z.

2. **Vertical position (y-axis)**:
   - From x B y: `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)`
   - From y NW z: `supy(z) ≤ infy(y)`
   - Combining: `supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)` → `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`
   - Thus, x is entirely to the north of z.

The conditions `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)` satisfy the definition of **NW** (x is northwest of z).

### Conclusion:
The only possible relation between x and z is **NW**. 

**Answer: NW**
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given relations:

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies the bounding box of \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\):
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)

- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies \(y\) is southwest of \(z\):
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal position**:
   - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
   - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) SW \(z\))
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical position**:
   - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
   - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SW \(z\))
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

The conditions \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of the **SW (South West)** relation between \(x\) and \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, B) is possible under these constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **SW**.

**Final Answer**  
SW
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is SE (South East).

### Reasoning:
- **x B y** means the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y. Specifically:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
  
- **y SE z** means region y is southeast of region z. Specifically:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these:
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- From x B y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- From y SE z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- From x B y: supy(x) ≤ supy(y), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) satisfy the definition of x SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) implies x is east of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies x is south of z.

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, S, NW, W, SW, B) are possible, as they require additional conditions that may not hold (e.g., for S, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is not necessarily true; for E, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not necessarily true).

Thus, the only possible relation is SE.
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is NE (North East) of region \(z\), we analyze the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\).

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), we get \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), we get \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

These combined conditions, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), match the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\):
- \(x\) NE \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be NE. No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SE, SW, B) satisfies these conditions simultaneously.

**Answer: NE**
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ B } z\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. For the x-axis:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) → \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

2. For the y-axis:
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x \text{ B } z\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW) is possible because:

- Relations like N, S, E, W require strict directional constraints (e.g., for \(x \text{ N } z\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) must hold, but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which does not force \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- Diagonal relations (NE, SE, NW, SW) require additional positional constraints (e.g., for \(x \text{ SW } z\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), but we have \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which cannot satisfy \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) without degeneracy, which is excluded since regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk.

Thus, the only possible relation is **B**.
