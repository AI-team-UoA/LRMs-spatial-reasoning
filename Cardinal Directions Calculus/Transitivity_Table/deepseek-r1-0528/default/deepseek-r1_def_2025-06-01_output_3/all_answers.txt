For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the only possible cardinal direction relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is N. This is determined by the transitive nature of the N relation under the given definitions.

- From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these:
- For the y-coordinates: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- For the x-coordinates: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

These inequalities satisfy all conditions for \(x\) N \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) is possible, as they would violate one or more of the derived inequalities.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is N.

\boxed{\text{N}}
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- **x N y**: Region x is north of y, meaning x is above y and horizontally within the extent of y. This implies:
  - `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)` (x starts above the top of y).
  - `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (x is horizontally aligned within y's bounds).

- **y W z**: Region y is west of z, meaning y is left of z and vertically within the extent of z. This implies:
  - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y ends before z starts horizontally).
  - `infy(z) ≤ infy(y)` and `supy(y) ≤ supy(z)` (y is vertically within z's bounds).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between x and z**:
   - From x N y: `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`.
   - From y W z: `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`.
   - Thus, `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`, meaning x is entirely to the left of z.

2. **Vertical relation between x and z**:
   - From x N y: `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`.
   - From y W z: `infy(z) ≤ infy(y)` and `supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`.
   - Thus, `infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`, implying `infy(z) ≤ infy(x)`.
   - However, `supy(z)` can vary relative to `infy(x)` and `supy(x)`:
     - **Case 1**: If `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`, then z is entirely below x. Combined with x left of z, this yields **NW** (x is northwest of z).
     - **Case 2**: If `supy(z) > infy(x)`, then z extends above the bottom of x. If additionally `supy(x) ≤ supy(z)` (x's top is at or below z's top), this yields **W** (x is west of z, vertically within z's bounds). If `supy(x) > supy(z)`, no basic relation fits, but this case is constrained by the regions being homeomorphic to disks, and the bounding box analysis shows only NW and W are achievable under the definitions.

The possible relations between x and z are **NW** and **W**. No other cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, B) are satisfied based on the constraints.

**Answer: NW, W**
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below \(x\), and \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely left of \(y\), and \(y\) is vertically within the bounds of \(z\).

### Analysis for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relation**:  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).

2. **Vertical relation**:  
   From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) < \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   The vertical extent of \(z\) starts below \(\inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z)\) can vary relative to \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x)\).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
  The entire \(z\) is below \(x\). Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\), this fits the definition of NE:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) NE \(z\) is possible.

- **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**  
  \(z\) is left of \(x\), and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (since \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). This fits the definition of E:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) E \(z\) is possible.

### Ruled out relations:
- **N, S, NW, SW, SE, W, B**:  
  - N requires \(z\) entirely below \(x\) and \(x\) horizontally within \(z\), but \(z\) is left of \(x\), not containing it horizontally.  
  - S requires \(x\) entirely below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(z\) extends below, not above \(x\) entirely.  
  - NW requires \(z\) entirely below \(x\) (contradicts Case 2) and left, but Case 1 already covers NE when entirely below.  
  - SW requires \(x\) entirely below \(z\), impossible.  
  - SE requires \(x\) entirely below \(z\), impossible.  
  - W requires \(z\) right of \(x\), but \(z\) is left.  
  - E is covered in Case 2; NE in Case 1.  
  - B requires \(z\) to contain \(x\)'s bounding box, but \(z\) is left of \(x\), not containing it.

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.  
These depend on the vertical extents of \(z\) and \(x\):
- **NE** if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
- **E** if \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

**Answer: NE, E**
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\), and \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).

Combining these:
- **Horizontal constraints**:  
  \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\),  
  so \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\). This means the horizontal projection of \(x\) is within that of \(z\).
- **Vertical constraints**:  
  \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), but no direct relation between \(\text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{infy}(z)\), or \(\text{supy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(z)\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **N (North)**: Requires \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), and the horizontal constraints are satisfied.  
   *Example*: Set \(\text{supy}(y) = 0\), \(\text{infy}(z) = 0\), \(\text{supy}(z) = 0.5\), \(\text{infy}(x) = 1\). Then \(\text{supy}(z) = 0.5 \leq 1 = \text{infy}(x)\) holds.
2. **S (South)**: Requires \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), and the horizontal constraints are satisfied.  
   *Example*: Set \(\text{supy}(y) = 0\), \(\text{supy}(x) = 0.5\), \(\text{infy}(z) = 1\). Then \(\text{supy}(x) = 0.5 \leq 1 = \text{infy}(z)\) holds.
3. **B (Bounding box)**: Requires \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), and the horizontal constraints are satisfied.  
   *Example*: Set \(\text{supy}(y) = 0\), \(\text{infy}(z) = 0.5\), \(\text{infy}(x) = 0.6\), \(\text{supy}(x) = 0.7\), \(\text{supy}(z) = 0.8\). Then \(\text{infy}(z) = 0.5 \leq 0.6 = \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) = 0.7 \leq 0.8 = \text{supy}(z)\) hold.

Other relations (NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW) are impossible because:
- NE, E, SE require \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), but \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) imply \(\text{supx}(z) \geq \text{supx}(x) \geq \text{infx}(x) \geq \text{infx}(z)\), contradicting \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).
- NW, W, SW require \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), but \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x)\), so \(\text{supx}(x) \geq \text{infx}(z)\), contradicting \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N, S, B**.

**Answer: B, N, S**
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is above \(y\)),  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s extent).  

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is left of \(z\)),  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is below \(y\)).  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).  
  Since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(x\) is above \(z\).  

- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)).  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is left of \(z\).  

- **Resulting relation**:  
  \(x\) is both above and left of \(z\), which corresponds to the NW relation.  
  - Definition of NW: \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\). Here, \(a = x\), \(b = z\):  
    - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) holds (horizontal),  
    - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) holds (vertical).  

No other relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible because:  
- \(x\) cannot be south, east, or overlapping vertically/horizontally with \(z\) due to the strict above-left positioning.  
- Bounding box conditions for other relations (e.g., horizontal overlap for N, vertical overlap for W) are violated.  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **NW**.  

**Answer: NW**
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\).

From \(x\) N \(y\) and \(y\) SW \(z\), the following constraints arise:  
1. \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) → \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) (so \(x\) is west of \(z\)).  
2. \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\) (both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\)).

The vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:  
- If \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).  
- If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).  
- If \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\) (vertically within \(z\)'s bounds).

All three cases are possible and consistent with the constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, NW, and W.

**Possible relations: SW, NW, W**
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) horizontally aligned.

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the northwest of \(y\) (since \(y\) is southeast of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely west of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), but the relative vertical position between \(x\) and \(z\) is not fixed.

The possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\) lead to three mutually exclusive cases:
1. **NE (North East)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(z\) is below \(x\)), then \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).  
   Example: \(z\) vertically below \(x\), with \(z\) west of \(x\).
2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(z\)), then \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).  
   Example: \(z\) vertically above \(x\), with \(z\) west of \(x\).
3. **E (East)**: If neither of the above, but \(z\) is vertically aligned such that the vertical span of \(x\) is contained within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is east of \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) and \(z\) share vertical alignment or \(x\) is contained vertically within \(z\), with \(z\) west of \(x\).

These cover all possible relations given the constraints. Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are impossible due to the horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and the lack of vertical conditions to satisfy them.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (expressed as \(x\) relative to \(z\)) are NE, SE, and E.

**Answer: NE SE E**
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) (in the y-direction), and \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the west and south of \(y\) (i.e., \(y\) is northeast of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- **Y-direction**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

- **X-direction**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\).

Therefore, \(x\) is both north and east of \(z\), satisfying the definition of NE:  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) holds, as they would require additional conditions (e.g., horizontal containment for N or vertical containment for E) that are not met here.

**Possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\): NE**
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\):  
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically).  
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)).  

- \(y\) is B of \(z\):  
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\), \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is horizontally within \(z\)).  
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is vertically within \(z\)).  

Combining these:  
- **Horizontally**:  
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\), so \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).  

- **Vertically**:  
  - From \(x\) N \(y\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
  - From \(y\) B \(z\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).  
  - Thus, \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \min(\text{infy}(x), \text{supy}(z))\).  

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{infy}(x)\) relative to \(\text{supy}(z)\):  
1. **If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)**:  
   - The top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\), so \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) vertically.  
   - Combined with horizontal containment, \(x\) is N of \(z\).  

2. **If \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\)**:  
   - The bottom of \(x\) is below the top of \(z\), so vertical overlap may occur.  
   - However, \(x\) must be vertically within \(z\) for B: \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (true, as \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).  
   - If \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).  
   - If \(\text{supy}(x) > \text{supy}(z)\), no defined atomic relation fits (as other relations require horizontal misalignment), but the problem asks for possible relations that can occur, and this case does not yield a valid atomic relation.  

In all valid cases:  
- When \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(x\) N \(z\).  
- When \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), \(x\) B \(z\).  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **B**.  

**Answer: N, B**
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as:  
\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), implying that \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

Horizontally, combining the constraints:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned relative to \(\inf_x(y)\).  
- \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y)\).

Two possible horizontal scenarios arise:

1. **Case 1: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
   Here, the horizontal interval of \(x\) is contained within \(z\):  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
   Vertically, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x\) N \(z\):  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

2. **Case 2: \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
   Here, \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Vertically, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x\) NW \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The scenario where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) (horizontal overlap) does not correspond to any defined atomic relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) due to lack of horizontal containment for N and insufficient conditions for other relations. However, only N and NW are achievable under the given constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N and NW.

**Answer: N, NW**
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is west (W) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is west (W) of region \(z\), the cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be west (W). This is determined by the transitive properties of the inequalities defining the W relation:

- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- For the x-coordinates: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- For the y-coordinates: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) imply \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Similarly, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These satisfy the conditions for \(x\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) is possible due to the strict leftward placement and vertical containment derived from the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is W.

\boxed{\text{W}}
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraints**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\). However, the relative horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
   - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is left of \(z\), leading to W relation.
   - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(z\) is left of \(x\), leading to E relation.
   - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\)'s bounding box, which, combined with vertical containment (below), leads to B relation.

2. **Vertical constraints**:  
   From \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), we get \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), we get \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, the vertical span of \(x\) is contained within the vertical span of \(z\). This rules out N, S, NE, NW, SE, SW, as these require \(x\) to be entirely above, below, or diagonally outside \(z\)'s vertical bounds.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **W**: If \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), with vertical containment.
- **E**: If \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), with vertical containment.
- **B**: If \(x\)'s bounding box is contained within \(z\)'s bounding box horizontally (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) and vertically.

Examples:
- **W**: \(x = [0, 1] \times [1, 3]\), \(z = [1.5, 2.5] \times [-1, 5]\), \(y = [3, 5] \times [0, 4]\).
- **E**: \(x = [1.5, 2.5] \times [1, 3]\), \(z = [0, 1] \times [-1, 5]\), \(y = [3, 5] \times [0, 4]\).
- **B**: \(x = [1, 2] \times [1, 3]\), \(z = [0, 2.5] \times [-1, 5]\), \(y = [3, 5] \times [0, 4]\).

Thus, the possible relations are **W, E, B**.
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is W (West) of region y and region y is S (South) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South) or SW (South West).

### Explanation:
- Vertically, since y is S of z, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z). Also, since x is W of y, we have supy(x) ≤ supy(y). Combining these, supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is below z vertically, so the relation between x and z must have a southern component (i.e., S, SW, or SE).
- Horizontally:
  - From x W y, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
  - From y S z, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
  - Combining, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) always holds.
- SE (South East) is impossible because it requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but from the above, supx(z) ≥ supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) > infx(x) (since regions have positive extent), so supx(z) > infx(x).
- S (South) is possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the latter always true). This occurs when z is not left of x horizontally.
- SW (South West) is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This occurs when x is completely to the left of z horizontally.
- Cases where infx(z) > infx(x) and supx(x) > infx(z) (horizontal overlap without containment) do not satisfy S, SW, or SE under the given definitions, but such configurations are not possible under the constraints derived from the relations; thus, only S and SW are feasible.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are S and SW.

**Final Answer: S, SW**
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

### Derivation:
- **x W y** implies:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom is at or below x's bottom)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

- **y NW z** implies:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's top is at or below y's bottom)

Combining these:
- From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z).
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x, meaning x is north of z).

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of **x NW z**:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is south of x, so x is north of z)

No other cardinal direction relation is possible, as the inequalities force x to be strictly northwest of z with no vertical or horizontal overlap that would allow other relations (e.g., W would require vertical overlap, but supy(z) ≤ infy(x) prevents this).

Thus, the only possible relation is **NW**.
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining the inequalities:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of SW for \(x\) and \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). 

No other cardinal direction relation holds:
- **S**: Requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), violating \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) unless equality, but projections are disjoint.
- **W**: Requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) > \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\), violating \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **NW**: Requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\), violating \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- Others (N, NE, E, SE, B) similarly fail due to horizontal or vertical constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation is **SW**.

**Answer: SW**
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) → \(x\) is below \(z\) in the y-direction.
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) in the x-direction (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their relative x-positions are not fixed.

Possible relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is left and below \(z\)).
2. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is below \(z\) with x-projections overlapping appropriately).
3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is right and below \(z\)).

No other relations are possible because:
- \(x\) must be below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
- Relations like N, NE, NW, E, W, B require conditions not satisfied (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\) or specific containments that conflict with the constraints).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S, SW, SE**.
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the inequalities defined for the relations.

- x W y implies:  
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is left of y)  
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x is vertically within y's y-bounds)  

- y NE z implies:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is left of y)  
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)  

From these, it follows that:  
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning z is entirely below x.  
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but the relative horizontal positions of x and z can vary.  

Given that z is below x, the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are those where x is north of z in some form. The possible relations are:  
- **N (North)**: This holds if x is directly north of z with z containing x horizontally (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)). This is possible when the x-projection of z contains that of x.  
- **NE (Northeast)**: This holds if x is northeast of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). This is possible when z is left of x.  
- **NW (Northwest)**: This holds if x is northwest of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). This is possible when x is left of z.  

All other relations (B, S, SE, SW, E, W) are impossible due to the vertical separation (z below x) and the lack of required horizontal containments or alignments.  

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **X-axis constraints**:  
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   This implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but the relative order of \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) is not fixed. Two cases arise:  

   - **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
     Combined with the y-axis constraints (below), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) W \(z\).  

   - **Case 2**: \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\).  
     To avoid undefined or invalid configurations (where no relation holds due to partial overlap), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) must hold. This, with the y-axis constraints and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)), satisfies \(x\) B \(z\).  

2. **Y-axis constraints**:  
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). These hold in both cases.  

In Case 1, \(x\) W \(z\) is possible. In Case 2, \(x\) B \(z\) is possible. Other relations (e.g., SW, NW, S, N) are impossible due to y-axis constraints and the requirement that regions have positive area (non-degenerate bounding boxes), preventing equalities like \(\sup_y(x) = \inf_y(z)\) or \(\sup_y(z) = \inf_y(x)\).  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **W** and **B**.

**Answer: W, B**
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Vertical Constraints**:  
   From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
   From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.

2. **Horizontal Constraints**:  
   From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).  
   From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\).  
   This implies \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(x\) starts to the right of \(z\) horizontally.

3. **Possible Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (including equality).  
     Here, \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) horizontally. Combined with \(z\) being below \(x\), this satisfies the conditions for \(x\) NE \(z\):  
     \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
   - **Case 2**: \(\text{sup}_x(z) > \text{inf}_x(x)\).  
     Now, \(z\) extends rightward beyond the start of \(x\). If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)). Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\):  
     \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

No other atomic relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, E, SE) are possible given the constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **NE**.

**Answer: N, NE**
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **Vertical constraints**: From \(x\) E \(y\), we have \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\). From \(y\) W \(z\), we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Combining these:
  \[
  \inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \quad \text{and} \quad \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)
  \]
  This implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning the vertical projection of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

- **Horizontal possibilities**: The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
  1. **If \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\))**: This satisfies the definition of \(x\) W \(z\), as the vertical conditions also hold.
  2. **If \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\))**: This satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\), as the vertical conditions also hold.
  3. **If the horizontal projection of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\))**: This satisfies the definition of \(x\) B \(z\), as the vertical conditions also hold.

The vertical constraints rule out other cardinal directions (N, NE, SE, S, NW, SW) because they require conditions incompatible with the vertical containment (e.g., being entirely above, below, or in diagonal positions that contradict \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are W, E, and B.

**Final Answer: W, E, B**
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E (East) of \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely to the east of y),  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within the y-bounds of y).

- \(y\) is E (East) of \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is entirely to the east of z),  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is vertically within the z-bounds of z).

### Analysis for \(x\) and \(z\):
- **Horizontal relation**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
  Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\).

- **Vertical relation**:  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is vertically within the z-bounds of \(z\).

### Conclusion:
The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) exactly match the definition of the **E (East)** relation between \(x\) and \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, B) satisfies these constraints simultaneously under the given premises.

**Possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\): E**
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) E \(y\) means \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and vertically, \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) S \(z\) means \(y\) is entirely south of \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and horizontally, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)).

This implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\inf_x(x)\) relative to \(\sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x)\) relative to \(\sup_x(z)\):

1. **If \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:
   - \(x\) is within the horizontal span of \(z\).
   - Combined with \(x\) being below \(z\), this matches the definition of S: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

2. **If \(\inf_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\) or \(\inf_x(x) = \sup_x(z)\)**:
   - \(x\) starts at or to the east of the east edge of \(z\).
   - Combined with \(x\) being below \(z\), this matches the definition of SE: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, E, SW, B) are not possible because:
- N, NE, NW require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(x\) is below.
- W, E require vertical alignment within \(z\)'s span, but \(x\) is entirely below.
- SW requires \(x\) west of \(z\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- B requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box vertically, but \(x\) is below.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S and SE.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\):  
  - \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  - \(x\) is vertically within \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\):  
  - \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  - \(y\) is entirely to the north of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  

Combining these:  
- Vertically:  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)).  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\).  

- Horizontally:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)).  
  - Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.  

Possible horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
1. **Entirely east of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - Combined with vertical: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) → **NE**.  
2. **Entirely west of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   - Combined with vertical: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) → **NW**.  
3. **Horizontal overlap with \(x\) within \(z\) horizontally**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   - Combined with vertical: \(x\) is north of \(z\) → **N**.  

Other relations are not possible:  
- \(B\), \(S\), \(SW\), \(W\), \(E\), \(SE\) violate the vertical or horizontal constraints derived.  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE**, **NW**, and **N**.  

**Answer: NE, NW, N**
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is to the right of \(y\) and vertically within the bounds of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is to the left and below \(z\).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the right of \(y\) (since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **S (South)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\):  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), along with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This is possible if \(x\)'s bounding box is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s.

2. **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is left and below \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This occurs if \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) horizontally.

3. **SE (South East)**: If \(x\) is right and below \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This occurs if \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) horizontally.

Other relations are impossible:
- **N, NE, NW**: Require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(x\) is below.
- **E, W, B**: Require vertical overlap or containment, but \(x\) and \(z\) are vertically disjoint with \(x\) below.
- **N, S, E, W, B** have additional constraints not satisfied here (e.g., horizontal containment for S, vertical containment for E/W, or full containment for B).

Thus, the possible relations are **S, SW, SE**.
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is SE (South East).

### Derivation:
- From \(y\) SE \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is to the west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is to the south of \(z\))

- From \(x\) E \(y\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is to the west of \(x\))
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

Combining the inequalities:
- **Horizontal direction (x-axis):**  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\).

- **Vertical direction (y-axis):**  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the south of \(z\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of SE:  
- \(x\) SE \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible, as they would require additional or conflicting conditions that are not necessarily satisfied:
- For example, \(x\) E \(z\) would require \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but we have \(\inf_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), and equality is not guaranteed. Similarly, \(x\) S \(z\) would require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which conflicts with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\).

Thus, SE is the only possible relation.

**Answer:** SE
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these constraints:  
1. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
2. From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
3. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
4. From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\):  
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z is west of x),  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is south of x).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE.

**Answer**: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E (East) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is B (bounding box) of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Vertical constraints from the relations**:  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\)).  
   Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), satisfying the vertical conditions for \(x\) B \(z\) if horizontal conditions hold.

2. **Horizontal constraints**:  
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   This leads to two cases for \(\sup_x(z)\) relative to \(\inf_x(x)\):  
     - **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\).  
       Then:  
       - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) satisfies the horizontal condition for \(x\) E \(z\).  
       - Combined with vertical constraints, \(x\) E \(z\) holds.  
     - **Case 2**: \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\).  
       Additionally, consider \(\sup_x(x)\) relative to \(\sup_x(z)\):  
       - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), the horizontal conditions for \(x\) B \(z\) are satisfied (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
         Combined with vertical constraints, \(x\) B \(z\) holds.  
       - If \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\), no defined cardinal direction relation holds (horizontal overlap without containment violates all other relations). However, this case does not yield a valid relation among the given set, so only the subcase \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) is possible.

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are:
- **E (East)**: When \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\).  
- **B (bounding box)**: When \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

No other relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW) are possible, as they require conditions contradicted by the vertical containment or horizontal alignment derived from the given \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\).

**Answer: B, E**
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the following definitions apply:

- \(x\) S \(y\) requires:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box)
- \(y\) N \(z\) requires:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(z\) is below \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(z\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box)

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) and horizontally constrained within \(y\)'s bounding box. However, there are no additional constraints on the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) in either the vertical or horizontal directions. Specifically:
- The vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\), \(z\) above \(x\), or overlapping vertically).
- The horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\), \(z\) left of \(x\), overlapping, or one contained horizontally within the other).

Given this flexibility, any of the nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can occur, as demonstrated by specific examples:
- **N**: \(z\) directly below \(x\) and horizontally contained in \(x\).
- **NE**: \(z\) above and to the left of \(x\).
- **E**: \(z\) directly to the left of \(x\) at the same vertical level.
- **SE**: \(z\) below and to the left of \(x\).
- **S**: \(x\) directly above \(z\) and horizontally contained in \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) above and to the left of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) directly to the left of \(z\) at the same vertical level.
- **NW**: \(x\) below and to the left of \(z\).
- **B**: \(z\)'s bounding box contained within \(x\)'s bounding box.

Thus, all nine relations are possible.

**Possible relations:** B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are SW and W.

- The relation SW (South West) is possible when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- The relation W (West) is possible when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These relations are derived from the constraints:
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is west of \(z\). The y-coordinate conditions determine whether SW or W holds, depending on the relative positions of \(\inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x)\), \(\inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z)\).

Other relations like NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, or B are not possible due to the west constraint and the impossibility of y-coordinate conditions aligning (e.g., NW requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which conflicts with the area of regions).

Thus, the possible relations are SW and W.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}}
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are E (east) and SE (southeast).

- **x SE z** is possible when x is entirely below z vertically (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) and z is entirely to the west of x horizontally (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).
- **x E z** is possible when x is vertically within z (i.e., infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) and z is entirely to the west of x horizontally (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).

No other relations are possible because:
- Horizontally, x must be east of z due to the chain of relations (y E z implies z west of y, and x S y implies x horizontally within y, leading to z west of x).
- Vertically, NE is impossible because supy(z) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(x) ≥ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x) cannot hold.
- Other relations like N, S, B, W, NW, SW are inconsistent with the east horizontal alignment or vertical constraints.

Thus, the possible relations are E and SE.

\boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S (South) of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is S (South).

This is determined by the transitive nature of the S relation under the given definitions:
- From \(x\) S \(y\), we have \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) S \(z\), we have \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: 
  - From \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), we get \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - From \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), we get \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Thus, all conditions for \(x\) S \(z\) are satisfied: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relations (such as SW, SE, B, etc.) are possible, as they require additional constraints that are not met here (e.g., horizontal misalignment or vertical containment, which would contradict the inequalities derived).

**Possible relation: S**
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(x\) is directly south of \(y\), meaning \(x\) is below \(y\) with horizontal overlap constraints.
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(y\) is northwest of \(z\), meaning \(y\) is above and to the west of \(z\).

From \(x\) S \(y\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (top of \(x\) is at or below bottom of \(y\)).
- \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontal projection of \(x\) is within the horizontal bounds of \(y\)).

From \(y\) NW \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (right of \(y\) is at or left of left of \(z\)).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (top of \(z\) is at or below bottom of \(y\)).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), but no direct constraint between \(x\) and \(z\) vertically.

Possible vertical arrangements:
1. **NW relation**: If \(x\) is above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), then \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
2. **W relation**: If \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is west of \(z\).
3. **SW relation**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations given the horizontal constraint and flexible vertical alignment. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are incompatible due to the horizontal separation or vertical positioning.

**Possible relations**: NW, W, SW.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is SW (South West) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these constraints:  
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of the SW (South West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is SW.

**Final Answer**  
SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is SE (South East).

### Derivation:
- From \(x\) S \(y\):
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is south of \(y\) in the y-direction).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., the x-interval of \(x\) is contained within the x-interval of \(y\)).

- From \(y\) SE \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is east of \(y\) in the x-direction).
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(z\) in the y-direction).

#### Combining the y-coordinate constraints:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(x\) S \(y\)).
- \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) from \(y\) SE \(z\), and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\) always holds).
- Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

#### Combining the x-coordinate constraints:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)).
- \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) S \(y\)).
- Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

#### Resulting relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) means \(x\) is south of \(z\) in the y-direction.
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) means \(x\) is east of \(z\) in the x-direction (since \(z\) is west of \(x\)).
- Therefore, the combined relation is SE (South East), as \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\).

### Why other relations are not possible:
- **S (South)**: Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) only holds if equality occurs, which is not general.
- **E (East)**: Requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) only holds if equality occurs, which is not general.
- Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW, B) are inconsistent with the derived y and x constraints (e.g., \(x\) cannot be north or west of \(z\) given the south and east positioning).

Thus, SE is the only possible relation.

\boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).

Combining these constraints:
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).
- Thus, \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).
- Also, \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), but no direct vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) (horizontal constraint). The vertical relation can be:
- If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- If \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).

Both scenarios are feasible with appropriate vertical placements:
- For NE: Set \(\text{infy}(x)\) above \(\text{supy}(z)\).
- For SE: Set \(\text{infy}(z)\) above \(\text{supy}(x)\).

No other relations satisfy the horizontal constraint \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and the definitions. Thus, the possible relations are NE and SE.

**Answer: NE, SE**
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ S } y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- \(y \text{ B } z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:

- **X-direction constraints**:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) → \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
- **Y-direction analysis**:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \geq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\))

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) satisfies the y-condition for \(x \text{ S } z\).
   - Combined with x-conditions \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(x \text{ S } z\) holds.

2. **If \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\)**:
   - The y-condition for S fails.
   - For \(x \text{ B } z\), the y-condition requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (besides \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which holds).
   - Given the constraints, \(\inf_y(x)\) must satisfy \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) to avoid spatial contradictions (since \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is within \(z\)'s bounds, ensuring \(x\) does not extend below \(z\)'s bounding box in a way that violates the relations).
   - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and the existing x-conditions imply \(x \text{ B } z\).

In all valid scenarios (considering the regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk and the relations are exhaustive), the only possible relations are **S** and **B**.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S** and **B**.
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

The horizontal relation depends on the bounding boxes:
- From NW: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From N: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

### Possible horizontal scenarios:
1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies the definition of NW: \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
   
2. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)** (which implies overlap or adjacency in horizontal projection):
   - Further, if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\):
     - Then \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
     - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies the definition of N: \(x\) is N of \(z\).
   - If \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\):
     - The horizontal condition for N fails (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) not met), and no other relation (like NW, NE, E, W, etc.) holds due to the horizontal overlap and vertical constraint. However, such a configuration is not possible under the given constraints without violating the initial relations or the connectedness of the regions. Thus, only the above cases are valid.

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **NW** (when \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\)).
- **N** (when \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(z\)).

Thus, the answer is **N and NW**.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed based on the bounding box constraints:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is above y)
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z contains y vertically)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z).

For the vertical constraints, two cases arise based on \(\sup_y(z)\) relative to \(\inf_y(x)\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) < \inf_y(x)\)**  
   - Then \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.  
   - Combined with x being left of z, the relation is NW.  
   - Example: \(x: [0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(y: [2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(z: [4,5] \times [-1,1.5]\) → \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\)**  
   - Along with \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from the constraints), z contains x vertically.  
   - Combined with x being left of z, the relation is W.  
   - Example: \(x: [0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(y: [2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(z: [4,5] \times [0,4]\) → \(x\) W \(z\).

Other relations (e.g., SW) are impossible due to vertical constraints: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) imply \(z\) cannot be entirely above \(x\), and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\) prevents \(x\) from being entirely below \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW and W**.
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the spatial constraints.

- From x NW y:  
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)  

- From y E z:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is west of y)  
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is vertically contained within z)  

Combining these:  
- Both x and z are west of y, so their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary (x can be west, east, or horizontally aligned with z).  
- Vertically, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x). If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then z is completely below x; otherwise, vertical overlap may occur, but the constraints typically place x north of z.  

The possible relations from x to z are:  
- **NW**: If x is west and north of z (e.g., supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  
- **N**: If x is directly north of z with horizontal containment by z (e.g., supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  
- **NE**: If x is east and north of z (e.g., supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  

Other relations (E, SE, S, SW, W, B) are not possible due to the northward bias from the constraints (e.g., x cannot be south of z because infy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are NW, N, and NE.

\boxed{\text{NW}} \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{NE}}
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined and the given conditions that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)
- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z covers y horizontally)

Combining these constraints, the spatial arrangement allows the following relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **B (Bounding box)**: \(z\) contains the bounding box of \(x\) in both axes.  
   Example: \(x\) in \([1,3] \times [4,5]\), \(z\) in \([0,7] \times [3.5,6]\) satisfies \(x\) NW \(y\) and \(y\) S \(z\) with \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **N (North)**: \(z\) is below \(x\) and \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([1,3] \times [5,6]\), \(z\) in \([0,7] \times [4,5]\) satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).

3. **S (South)**: \(x\) is below \(z\) and \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([1,3] \times [3.5,4]\), \(z\) in \([0,7] \times [4.5,5]\) satisfies \(x\) S \(z\).

4. **NW (North West)**: \(x\) is left of \(z\) and \(z\) is below \(x\).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([0,3] \times [4,5]\), \(z\) in \([4,7] \times [3.5,4]\) satisfies \(x\) NW \(z\).

5. **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is left of \(z\) and \(x\) is below \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([0,3] \times [3.5,4.5]\), \(z\) in \([4,7] \times [5,6]\) satisfies \(x\) SW \(z\).

6. **W (West)**: \(x\) is left of \(z\) and \(z\) contains \(x\) vertically.  
   Example: \(x\) in \([0,3] \times [3.5,5]\), \(z\) in \([3.5,7] \times [3,6]\) satisfies \(x\) W \(z\).

The relations NE, E, and SE are impossible because they require \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which contradicts \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) from the constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **B, N, S, NW, SW, W**.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) means \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) NW \(z\) means \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From \(x\) NW \(y\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

From \(y\) NW \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Chaining the x-direction inequalities:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

Chaining the y-direction inequalities:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which by definition means \(x\) is NW of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible under these constraints, as they require conditions that contradict the derived inequalities (e.g., for \(x\) to be S of \(z\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) would be needed, but we have \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(z)\), implying \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), violating the S condition).

Therefore, the only possible relation is **NW**.

**Answer**: NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW. This is determined by the inequalities derived from the relations and the possible configurations of the regions' bounding boxes.

- From x NW y:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)  

- From y SW z:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)  

Combining these:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z).  
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) can vary.  

The relation between x and z depends on the vertical positioning:  
- **x NW z** if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is below x).  
- **x SW z** if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is below z).  
- **x W z** if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x is vertically within the y-range of z).  

All three relations are possible for some configurations, and no other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are possible due to x being left of z.

\boxed{\text{NW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}}
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Given the relations: region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are all nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B. This is because the constraints allow for various spatial arrangements where \(x\) and \(z\) can satisfy any of the relations through appropriate positioning relative to each other and \(y\). Below are brief justifications for each:

- **NW**: \(x\) can be left and above \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([1.5,2.5] \times [0,1]\), \(y\): \([3,4] \times [-1,0]\)).
- **N**: \(x\) can be above \(z\) with horizontal containment (e.g., \(x\): \([1,2] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([0,3] \times [1,2]\), \(y\): \([4,5] \times [-1,0]\)).
- **NE**: \(x\) can be right and above \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\): \([4,5] \times [-2,-1]\)).
- **E**: \(x\) can be right of \(z\) with vertical containment (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [1,3]\), \(z\): \([0,2] \times [0,4]\), \(y\): \([5,6] \times [-1,0]\)).
- **SE**: \(x\) can be right and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([1,2] \times [3,4]\), \(y\): \([5,6] \times [0,1]\)).
- **S**: \(x\) can be below \(z\) with horizontal containment (e.g., \(x\): \([1,2] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([0,5] \times [4,5]\), \(y\): \([6,7] \times [0,1]\)).
- **SW**: \(x\) can be left and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\): \([2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(y\): \([4,5] \times [-2,-1]\)).
- **W**: \(x\) can be left of \(z\) with vertical containment (e.g., \(x\): \([0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([2,3] \times [1,4]\), \(y\): \([4,5] \times [0,1]\)).
- **B**: \(x\)'s bounding box can be contained in \(z\)'s (e.g., \(x\): \([1,2] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([0,5] \times [3,5]\), \(y\): \([5,6] \times [1,2]\)).

Thus, the possible relations are: **N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B**.
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these:
1. **Vertical relation**: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
2. **Horizontal relations**: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible relations of \(x\) to \(z\) (considering \(x\) as the first region and \(z\) as the second):
- **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) and \(z\) is below \(x\) (already satisfied), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
- **NE (North East)**: If \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and \(z\) is below \(x\), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: If the horizontal projection of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) and \(z\) is below \(x\), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).

Other relations (like S, SW, SE, etc.) are not possible because they would violate the vertical or horizontal constraints derived. Specifically:
- \(z\) is always below \(x\), so relations where \(x\) is below \(z\) (e.g., S) are impossible.
- Corner relations (e.g., SW, SE) require \(x\) to be entirely left or right without vertical containment, but the vertical relation is fixed (\(z\) below \(x\)), and horizontal overlap may occur without full side alignment.

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are **NW, NE, and N**.
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, if region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(y\) B \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these, the following relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:

1. **NW (North West)**: Occurs when:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z)
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is below x)
   Example: \(x = [0,1] \times [4,5]\), \(y = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(z = [1,4] \times [1,4]\) → \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **W (West)**: Occurs when:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x is vertically within z's span)
   Example: \(x = [0,1] \times [3.5,4.5]\), \(y = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(z = [1,4] \times [1,5]\) → \(x\) W \(z\).

3. **N (North)**: Occurs when:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x is horizontally within z's span)
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is below x)
   Example: \(x = [1,3] \times [4,5]\), \(y = [4,6] \times [2,3]\), \(z = [0,10] \times [0,4]\) → \(x\) N \(z\).

4. **B (Bounding box)**: Occurs when:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x is completely within z's bounding box)
   Example: \(x = [0,1] \times [4,5]\), \(y = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(z = [0,4] \times [0,5]\) → \(x\) B \(z\).

Other relations (S, SW, E, SE, NE) are not possible due to contradictions with the constraints, such as \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) preventing \(x\) from being south of \(z\), and x-axis constraints ruling out east/southeast/northeast relations.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, NW, W**.
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\) if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\) if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **B**: \(x\) is bounding box of \(z\) if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\) if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These relations cover all feasible arrangements based on the given constraints. The relations NE, E, and SE are not possible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), which prevent \(x\) from being east of \(z\).

**Possible relations**: NW, W, SW, N, B, S.
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **SW (South West)**: This occurs when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). From \(x\) SW \(y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\). From \(y\) W \(z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Combining these, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), satisfying \(x\) SW \(z\).

- **W (West)**: This occurs when \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). The horizontal condition \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) holds as above. Vertically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) is satisfied due to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). If additionally \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) W \(z\) holds.

- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs when the bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\), specifically \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Given the horizontal deduction \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), containment requires \(\inf_x(z) = \inf_x(x) = \sup_x(x)\). Vertically, the conditions can align with \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\), allowing \(x\) B \(z\) in specific configurations (e.g., vertical line segments).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, SW, W**. No other relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW) are possible under the given constraints.

**Final Answer**  
B, SW, W
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the definitions and constraints of the relations. The possible relations are those that can hold under some configuration of regions \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in REG, considering the bounding box inequalities.

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

The relations between \(x\) and \(z\) that are possible, based on these constraints and achievable configurations, are:
- **B** (bounding box): \(x\) can be contained within the bounding box of \(z\).
- **S** (south): \(x\) can be directly south of \(z\), with horizontal containment.
- **SW** (southwest): \(x\) can be southwest of \(z\).
- **W** (west): \(x\) can be directly west of \(z\), with vertical containment.
- **E** (east): \(x\) can be directly east of \(z\), with vertical containment.
- **SE** (southeast): \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\).

The relations N (north), NE (northeast), and NW (northwest) are impossible because they require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which conflicts with the constraints \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) > \inf_y(y) \geq \inf_y(x)\) (since regions have positive area, \(\inf_y(y) < \sup_y(y)\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B, S, SW, W, E, and SE.

\boxed{\text{B}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these, we derive:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- For the x-coordinates:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\). The possible atomic relations with this southern component are SW, S, and SE. However:

- **SE is impossible**: It requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and regions have positive extent, so \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), contradicting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

For SW and S:
- **SW occurs** if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This is possible, e.g., with bounding boxes:
  - \(x: [0, 2] \times [0, 1]\), \(y: [3, 5] \times [2, 3]\), \(z: [2.5, 4] \times [4, 5]\).
  - \(x\) SW \(y\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(1 \leq 2\).
  - \(y\) S \(z\): \(3 \leq 4\), \(2.5 \leq 3\), and \(5 \leq 4\) (adjust to valid, e.g., \(z: [2.5, 6] \times [4, 5]\), then \(5 \leq 6\)).
  - \(x\) SW \(z\): \(2 \leq 2.5\) and \(1 \leq 4\).
- **S occurs** if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (which holds from constraints). This is possible, e.g.:
  - \(x: [3, 4] \times [1, 2]\), \(y: [4, 6] \times [3, 4]\), \(z: [2, 7] \times [5, 6]\).
  - \(x\) SW \(y\): \(4 \leq 4\) and \(2 \leq 3\).
  - \(y\) S \(z\): \(4 \leq 5\), \(2 \leq 4\), and \(6 \leq 7\).
  - \(x\) S \(z\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(4 \leq 7\), with \(2 \leq 5\).

Cases where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) do not fit any atomic relation (not SW, S, or SE), but such configurations may not align with the atomic set. Given the constraints, only SW and S are achievable atomic relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **S**.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

From these, the horizontal relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as:
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is west of \(z\).

Vertically:
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(\text{inf}_y(y)\), but their relative vertical positions can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must have \(x\) west of \(z\):
- **SW**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x is south of z).
- **W**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (x is vertically within z).
- **NW**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (z is south of x, so x is north of z).

All three relations are possible under the constraints, depending on the vertical arrangement of \(x\) and \(z\). Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, B) are excluded due to the west requirement.

Thus, the possible relations are **W, NW, SW**.
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, the relations are defined as follows:

- x SW y implies:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

- y SW z implies:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these inequalities, we derive the relation between x and z:

- For the x-direction:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
  - infx(y) ≤ supx(y) (by definition of bounding boxes)
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y SW z)
  - Thus, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

- For the y-direction:
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
  - infy(y) ≤ supy(y) (by definition of bounding boxes)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)
  - Thus, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) satisfy the definition of the SW relation between x and z. Therefore, x must be SW of z.

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as the inequalities enforce that x is strictly to the left and below z, with no overlap or other spatial relationships allowed under the given constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\) in the x-axis.
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\) in the y-axis.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Example: \(x\) entirely left of \(z\), with \(x\) below \(z\).

2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Example: \(z\) entirely left of \(x\), with \(x\) below \(z\).

3. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning the x-projection of \(z\) contains that of \(x\), and \(x\) is below \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s x-bounds but below.

Other relations are impossible:
- **N**, **NE**, **NW**: Require \(z\) below \(x\), contradicting \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **B**: Requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounds, but \(x\) is below \(z\).
- **E**, **W**: Require full y-containment within \(z\), not satisfied here.
- **NE**, **NW**: Require \(z\) below \(x\), impossible.

Thus, the possible relations are **SW**, **SE**, and **S**.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the constraints are:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left and below \(y\), but their relative positions to each other are not fixed. The bounding boxes of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary independently within these constraints, allowing for any cardinal direction relation between them. Examples confirming each possibility are:

- **B**: \(x\) and \(z\) share the same bounding box (e.g., both at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), with \(y\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\)).
- **N**: \(x\) is above \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **NE**: \(x\) is above and right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **E**: \(x\) is right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\)).
- **SE**: \(x\) is below and right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **S**: \(x\) is below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(y\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **SW**: \(x\) is below and left of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **W**: \(x\) is left of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\)).
- **NW**: \(x\) is above and left of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(z\) at \([2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([3,4] \times [3,4]\)).

Thus, every cardinal direction relation is possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Possible relations: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B**
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are determined by the bounding box interactions. Here's the reasoning:

- **SW of \(y\) implies**:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely below y)  

- **B of \(z\) implies**:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z horizontally contains y)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z vertically contains y)  

### Possible Relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   If \(z\)'s bounding box extends left and below \(x\), such that:  
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  
   *Example*: \(x = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [2,4] \times [2,4]\), \(z = [0,5] \times [0,5]\). Here, \(x\) is inside \(z\)'s bounding box.

2. **S (South)**:  
   If \(z\) is above \(x\) and horizontally aligned:  
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is below z)  
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x is horizontally within z)  
   *Example*: \(x = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [2,4] \times [2,4]\), \(z = [0,5] \times [1.5,5]\). Here, \(x\) is south of \(z\).

3. **SW (South West)**:  
   If \(x\) is left and below \(z\):  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x left of z)  
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x below z)  
   *Example*: \(x = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [2,4] \times [2,4]\), \(z = [1.5,5] \times [1.5,5]\). Here, \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).

4. **W (West)**:  
   If \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically overlapping, with \(z\) vertically containing \(x\):  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x left of z)  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x vertically within z)  
   *Example*: \(x = [0,2] \times [2.5,3]\), \(y = [3,5] \times [3,5]\), \(z = [2,6] \times [1,5]\). Here, \(x\) is west of \(z\).

### Why other relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW) are impossible:
- \(x\) is left and below \(y\), and \(z\) contains \(y\), so \(x\) cannot be north, northeast, east, southeast, or northwest of \(z\) without violating the initial SW and B constraints. For example:
  - **E (East)**: Would require \(x\) right of \(z\), but \(x\) is left of \(y\) and \(z\) contains \(y\), making this impossible for non-degenerate regions.
  - **N, NE, NW**: Would require \(x\) above \(y\) or \(z\), but \(x\) is below \(y\).
  - **SE**: Would require \(x\) below and right of \(z\), contradicting \(x\) being left of \(y\) (hence left of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations are **B, S, SW, W**.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) can be **B** (bounding box) of \(z\) if the bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\) horizontally and vertically.
- \(x\) can be **N** (North) of \(z\) if \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) and horizontally contained within \(z\).
- \(x\) can be **NE** (North East) of \(z\) if \(x\) is entirely above and to the right of \(z\).
- \(x\) can be **SE** (South East) of \(z\) if \(x\) is entirely below and to the right of \(z\).
- \(x\) can be **S** (South) of \(z\) if \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) and horizontally contained within \(z\).

These relations are possible under specific configurations satisfying the initial conditions. The relations E, NW, W, and SW are not possible due to the spatial constraints imposed by \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) N \(z\).

**Possible relations: B, N, NE, SE, S**
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. Analyzing the horizontal and vertical bounds:

- Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the east of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), leading to two cases:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z starts left of x)  
  - \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x starts left of z)  

- Vertically:  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z extends below and above y)  
  This results in:  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is below z)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) (vertical overlap possible)  

Combining these, the possible relations are:

- **SW (South West)**: Occurs when \(x\) starts left of \(z\) and is below \(z\) (\(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), and \(x\) ends left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).  
- **S (South)**: Occurs when \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) and horizontally within \(z\)’s bounds (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)). This can happen in both horizontal cases if bounds align appropriately.  
- **SE (South East)**: Occurs when \(z\) ends left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
- **B (Bounding box)**: Occurs when \(z\)’s bounding box contains \(x\)’s, i.e., \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). This is possible with vertical overlap and horizontal containment.  

The relations N, NE, E, NW, W are not possible due to the constraints (e.g., \(x\) is always south of \(y\), and \(z\) is east of \(y\), preventing north or west relations between \(x\) and \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, S, SE, SW**.  

**Final Answer**  
B, S, SE, SW
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertically, \(x\) is below \(y\))

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(z\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is contained within \(z\))

Combining these:

- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is left of \(x\).

- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). Also, \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), giving \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) has two cases:

1. **Case 1:** \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)  
   This means \(x\) is entirely below \(z\). Combined with \(z\) being left of \(x\), the relation is \(x\) SE \(z\).

2. **Case 2:** \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\)  
   Here, \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so \(z\) extends below the top of \(x\). However, \(x\) is still below \(y\), and \(z\) contains \(y\) vertically. For the relation to hold, we must have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical containment of \(x\) in \(z\)). Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), the relation is \(x\) E \(z\). If \(\inf_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\), no defined relation fits (based on the given 9 relations), but this case can be avoided by region choices satisfying \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SE and E.

**Answer: SE, E**
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South) and SE (South East).

### Explanation:
- From x SE y:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)  
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)  
- From y S z:  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)  
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within the x-span of z)  

Combining the inequalities:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is south of z on the y-axis, limiting possible relations to S, SE, or SW. However, SW is impossible due to the x-axis constraints:  
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) implies infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the SW requirement (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) for regions with positive area.  

Thus, only S and SE are possible:
- **S (South)**: Occurs when supx(x) ≤ supx(z), in addition to supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
- **SE (South East)**: Occurs when supx(z) ≤ infx(x), in addition to supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Configurations where neither S nor SE holds (e.g., supx(z) > infx(x) and supx(x) > supx(z)) are inconsistent with the given relations and region properties, so they are not considered.

The possible relations are S and SE.
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x \text{ SE } y\) means \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y \text{ NW } z\) means \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Given these constraints, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B). This is because both \(x\) and \(z\) are constrained to be southeast of \(y\) (as \(y \text{ NW } z\) implies \(z\) is southeast of \(y\)), but their relative positions to each other can vary widely depending on the specific bounds of their bounding boxes. By adjusting the infima and suprema of the x and y projections, all pairwise relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be satisfied without violating the initial conditions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\))

- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(z\))

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the right of \(y\) (since \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)), but the relative horizontal position between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)** if \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
2. **S (South)** if \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box and below:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
3. **SE (South East)** if \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

These are the only possible relations, as \(x\) must be below \(z\) and can be left, aligned, or right relative to \(z\). Examples confirm each case is feasible.

**Possible relations: SW, S, SE**
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the relations imply the following spatial constraints:

- \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), we get \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- From \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), we get \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These combined constraints, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), exactly match the definition of \(x\) being SE of \(z\). 

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) satisfies both constraints simultaneously without additional conditions that conflict with the given relations. For example:
- **E** requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), contradicting \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) unless degenerate (not allowed).
- Other relations like **S**, **SW**, **W**, **NW**, **N**, **NE** fail due to mismatched horizontal or vertical constraints derived above.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SE.

**Answer: SE**
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

From these, we derive:
1. \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (x is east of z).
2. \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (both x and z are below y).

The vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) determines the possible relations:
- If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x below z), then \(x\) is SE of \(z\): satisfies SE conditions (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)).
- If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (z below x), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\): satisfies NE conditions (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).
- If the vertical interval of \(z\) contains that of \(x\) (\(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is E of \(z\): satisfies E conditions (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)).

Other relations (like SW, NW, etc.) are impossible due to the east constraint (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)). Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE, E, and SE.

**Final Answer**  
NE, E, SE
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **SE (South East)**: This occurs when \(z\) is entirely to the left and above \(x\) in the bounding box comparison. Specifically, \( \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \) and \( \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \) must hold, which is feasible under the constraints.
- **E (East)**: This occurs when \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (so \( \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \)) and the \(y\)-interval of \(z\) contains that of \(x\) (i.e., \( \inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \) and \( \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z) \)). This is possible by appropriate arrangement of the \(y\)-bounds.
- **S (South)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (so \( \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \)) and the \(x\)-interval of \(z\) contains that of \(x\) (i.e., \( \inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \) and \( \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) \)). This is achievable under the constraints.
- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs when the bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\) in both axes, satisfying \( \inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \), \( \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) \), \( \inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \), and \( \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z) \). This is possible with appropriate region arrangements.

Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW) are not possible due to conflicts with the constraints from \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\). For example:
- N requires \(z\) below \(x\), but constraints place \(x\) below or overlapping \(z\).
- NE, NW, W, SW require specific disjointness in \(x\) or \(y\) that contradicts the given relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, E, S, SE**.

**Final Answer**  
**B, E, S, SE**
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (y is entirely to the west of x)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is entirely to the south of x)

- \(y\) N \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is entirely to the south of y)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is horizontally within z's bounding box)

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely south of \(x\).
- Horizontally: 
  - From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  - Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

Now, consider possible horizontal positions of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. If \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\):
   - \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\).
   - With \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies the conditions for \(x\) NE \(z\).
2. If \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\):
   - \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
   - With \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies the conditions for \(x\) N \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- \(x\) NW \(z\) would require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) contradicts this.
- Relations like SW, SE, S, etc., violate the vertical condition (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(z\) south of \(x\), not north).
- B, E, W require containment or specific horizontal alignments not guaranteed here.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N and NE.

**Answer: N, NE**
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **NE of \(y\) implies**:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(x\))  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))  

- **W of \(z\) implies**:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\))  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(z\) vertically covers \(y\))  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical relations**:  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\))  
  - \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\), leading to two cases:  
    - Case 1: \(\inf_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\) → \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (vertical separation)  
    - Case 2: \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → vertical overlap or boundary contact  

- **Horizontal relations**:  
  - Both \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but no direct constraint between \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\), leading to three subcases:  
    - Entirely west: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
    - Entirely east: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)  
    - Horizontal containment: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)  

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
1. **When \(\inf_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\) (vertical separation)**:  
   - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) → **NW**  
   - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → **NE**  
   - If horizontal containment → **N**  

2. **When \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical overlap or contact)**:  
   - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → **W**  
   - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → **E**  
   - If horizontal and vertical containment → **B**  
   - If \(\inf_y(x) = \sup_y(z)\) and horizontal containment → **N**  

**Excluded relations**:  
- **S**, **SW**, **SE** are impossible because \(x\) is always above \(y\) (so cannot be below \(z\), which covers \(y\) vertically).  

Through case analysis and examples (e.g., specific placements of regions satisfying the given relations), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **B, N, NE, E, W, NW**.  

**Final Answer**:  
**B, N, NE, E, W, NW**
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is strictly east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is strictly north of y)

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is strictly east of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y's vertical extent is within z's)

Combining these:

- **Horizontal direction (x-axis):**
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\))
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z is strictly west of x).

- **Vertical direction (y-axis):**
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\))
  - This gives \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - The relation between \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) determines two cases:
    - **Case 1:** \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is strictly south of x).  
      Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), this implies \(x\) NE \(z\).
    - **Case 2:** \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) (overlap or north).  
      Here, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), and if additionally \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x's vertical extent within z's), then \(x\) E \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- \(x\) NE \(z\) (Case 1)
- \(x\) E \(z\) (Case 2 with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\))

Other relations do not satisfy the combined constraints in all cases. Therefore, the possible relations are **NE** and **E**.
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box inequalities defined for regions in REG.

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is east of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is north of \(y\))

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(z\) is north of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

From these, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy the constraints:
- \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
- \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
- \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\))
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\))
- \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\))

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are those that can be satisfied under these constraints, considering the flexibility in the exact positions and sizes of the bounding boxes (as regions in REG have positive area, but inequalities may hold with equality for tangency).

- **B (bounding box)**: Possible, as \(z\)'s bounding box can contain \(x\)'s by setting \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **N (North)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be north of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- **NE (North East)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be northeast of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **E (East)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be east of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), with \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **SE (South East)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **S (South)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be south of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The relations NW, W, and SW are impossible because they require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which contradicts \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \inf_x(z)\) (since regions have positive area, \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(x)\), making \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) infeasible).

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are B, N, NE, E, SE, and S.

\boxed{\text{B}} \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{NE}} \boxed{\text{E}} \boxed{\text{SE}} \boxed{\text{S}}
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the relative positions based on the bounding box inequalities.

- From \(x\) NE \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is to the right and above \(y\).

- From \(y\) NW \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is to the left of \(z\) and \(z\) is below \(y\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(x\) is above \(z\) (i.e., a North component).
- For the East-West relation, \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) can vary relative to each other.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must have \(x\) North of \(z\) due to the y-axis inequality. The specific relation depends on the x-axis positions:
- If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is to the left of \(z\), so \(x\) NW \(z\).
- If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is within the x-range of \(z\), so \(x\) N \(z\).
- If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is to the right of \(z\), so \(x\) NE \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, N, and NE.

\boxed{\text{NW}} \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{NE}}
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are all nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B. This is because the constraints imposed by the relations x NE y and y SW z allow for various relative positions of x and z, depending on the specific sizes and placements of their bounding boxes. Below are examples demonstrating each possible relation:

- **x B z** (z contains x):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 4.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 3.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x B z holds.

- **x N z** (x north of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x N z holds.

- **x NE z** (x northeast of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x NE z holds.

- **x E z** (x east of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 2.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x E z holds.

- **x SE z** (x southeast of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x SE z holds.

- **x S z** (x south of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x S z holds.

- **x SW z** (x southwest of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x SW z holds.

- **x W z** (x west of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 2.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x W z holds.

- **x NW z** (x northwest of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x NW z holds.

Thus, all cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z.

\boxed{\text{B}} \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{NE}} \boxed{\text{E}} \boxed{\text{SE}} \boxed{\text{S}} \boxed{\text{SW}} \boxed{\text{W}} \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is north of y)

- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is east of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z)

Chaining these:

1. **Horizontal direction (x-axis):**
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\))
   - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(x\) is east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical direction (y-axis):**
   - From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is north of y)
   - From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z, so z is north of y)
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are north of \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other can vary:
     - **Case 1 (NE):** If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is north of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being east of \(z\), the relation is NE.
     - **Case 2 (SE):** If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is south of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being east of \(z\), the relation is SE.
     - **Case 3 (E):** If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being east of \(z\), the relation is E.

These cases are mutually exclusive and cover the possible vertical arrangements. Examples exist for each:
- **NE:** \(z = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [1,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(x = [2,3] \times [1.5,2.5]\)
- **SE:** \(z = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [1,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(x = [2,3] \times [-0.5,-0.1]\)
- **E:** \(z = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [1,2] \times [-1,0]\), \(x = [2,3] \times [0.2,0.8]\)

No other base relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are possible, as they conflict with the east constraint or vertical conditions.

**Possible relations:** E, NE, SE
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\):  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, B) holds simultaneously under all configurations satisfying the premises, as the derived inequalities exclusively match NE.

Thus, the only possible relation is **NE**.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the right and above \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(y\)'s bounding box.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **NE (North East)**:  
   Possible when \(x\) is entirely to the right and above \(z\).  
   Example:  
   - \(z: [0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
   - \(y: [2, 8] \times [2, 8]\) (so \(y\) B \(z\)),  
   - \(x: [10.5, 12] \times [10.5, 12]\) (so \(x\) NE \(y\) and NE \(z\)).

2. **E (East)**:  
   Possible when \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounds.  
   Example:  
   - \(z: [0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
   - \(y: [2, 8] \times [2, 8]\),  
   - \(x: [10.5, 12] \times [9, 10]\) (so \(x\) NE \(y\) and E \(z\)).

3. **N (North)**:  
   Possible when \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds.  
   Example:  
   - \(z: [0, 15] \times [0, 9]\),  
   - \(y: [2, 8] \times [2, 8]\),  
   - \(x: [9, 15] \times [9, 15]\) (so \(x\) NE \(y\) and N \(z\)).

4. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   Possible when \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s bounding box.  
   Example:  
   - \(z: [0, 20] \times [0, 20]\),  
   - \(y: [5, 15] \times [5, 15]\),  
   - \(x: [16, 18] \times [16, 18]\) (so \(x\) NE \(y\) and B \(z\)).

Other relations (SE, S, SW, W, NW) are impossible due to contradictions:  
- \(x\) is above \(y\) (from NE), and \(y\) is inside \(z\) (from B), so \(x\) cannot be below \(z\) (ruling out SE, S).  
- \(x\) is to the right of \(y\), and \(y\) is inside \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be to the left of \(z\) (ruling out SW, W, NW).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N, NE, E, B**.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ N } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:

1. From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
2. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
3. Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

4. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
5. From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
6. Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ N } z\). 

No other cardinal direction relation (NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) satisfies all these inequalities simultaneously under the given constraints. For example:
- NE requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but we have \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which contradicts \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) unless degenerate.
- B requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but we only have \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and no constraint on \(\inf_y(z)\) relative to \(\inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x)\) could be above \(\sup_y(z)\).

Thus, the only possible relation is N.

**Answer: N**
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: Given that region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is W (West).

### Explanation:
- **x B y** means that the bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of y. Specifically:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
  
- **y W z** means that y is entirely to the west of z and within the north-south range of z. Specifically:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
  - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these:
- **x-coordinate constraint**: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x B y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is completely to the west of z.
- **y-coordinate constraints**:
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x B y), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x B y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y W z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  
These satisfy the conditions for **x W z**:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) is possible, as they violate the constraints derived from the given relations. For example:
- **SW** or **NW** would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z) or supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) make this impossible.
- **B** would require x to be within z's bounding box, but supx(x) ≤ infx(z) means x is west of z, not inside.
- Other directions (e.g., E, N, S) are inconsistent with the west positioning and y-range constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y \text{ E } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y \text{ E } z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), leading to \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - From \(y \text{ E } z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Thus:
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
     - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) match the definition of the **E (East)** relation for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- \(x \text{ E } z\) requires:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(x\) is vertically within \(z\)).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, B) satisfies all these conditions simultaneously:
- **W, NW, SW** require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which contradicts \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **N, S** require specific vertical alignments not met here.
- **NE, SE** require vertical separation (e.g., \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), but the vertical conditions here show \(x\) is within \(z\) vertically.
- **B** would require \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) ensures disjoint horizontal positions.

Thus, the only possible relation is **E**.

**Answer: E**
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: Based on the given relations \(x \text{ B } y\) and \(y \text{ S } z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is analyzed as follows:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies that the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\). Specifically:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ S } z\) implies that \(y\) is entirely below \(z\) with horizontal overlap:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:
- **X-range constraints**: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \([\inf_x(x), \sup_x(x)] \subseteq [\inf_x(z), \sup_x(z)]\).
- **Y-range constraints**:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
  - \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y)\), but \(\inf_y(x)\) can be less than \(\inf_y(z)\) (since regions are 2D with interior, \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).

The relation \(x \text{ S } z\) requires:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (satisfied)
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (satisfied from X-range constraints).

Thus, \(x \text{ S } z\) holds. 

Other relations are not possible:
- **B**: Requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\), violating the condition.
- **SW, W, NW**: Require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) only if degenerate (not allowed for 2D regions).
- **SE, E, NE**: Require \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or similar, contradicted by X-range containment.
- **N**: Requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), not the reverse.

Hence, the only possible relation is **S**.

**Final Answer: S**
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ NW } z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\)

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraints**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
   - From \(y \text{ NW } z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)
   - Thus: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)

2. **Vertical constraints**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
   - From \(y \text{ NW } z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\)
   - Thus: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)

The conditions \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ NW } z\):
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (x is entirely to the west of z)
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (x is entirely to the north of z)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) is possible under these constraints, as they would violate the derived inequalities. For example:
- **W** requires vertical overlap, but \(x\) is entirely above \(z\).
- **N** requires horizontal overlap, but \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Other relations like **NE**, **SE**, **S**, **SW**, **E**, **B** similarly fail due to conflicting horizontal or vertical bounds.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **NW**.

**Answer: NW**
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means \(y\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s:  
  \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y \text{ SW } z\) means \(y\) is southwest of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
2. From \(y \text{ SW } z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  

3. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
4. From \(y \text{ SW } z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ SW } z\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) is possible because:  
- Relations like W or S require partial vertical/horizontal alignment (e.g., W requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which conflicts with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) since \(\inf_y(z) > \sup_y(x)\) implies no vertical overlap).  
- B would require \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\), but \(x\) is entirely left and below \(z\).  

Thus, the only possible relation is **SW**.
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\), meaning the bounding box of \(y\) contains that of \(x\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is SE (southeast) of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x\) being SE of \(z\):
- \(a\) SE \(b\) iff \(\sup_x(b) \leq \inf_x(a)\) and \(\sup_y(a) \leq \inf_y(b)\)

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SE.

**Answer:** SE
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: Given that region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is NE.

### Explanation:
- **x B y** means that the bounding box of y contains the bounding box of x:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

- **y NE z** means that y is northeast of z:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these:
- From y NE z, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
- From x B y, we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- Thus:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) implies supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

This satisfies the definition of **x NE z**, which requires:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) is possible, as the conditions for those relations (e.g., overlapping bounds or different directional constraints) are not met given the inequalities derived from x B y and y NE z.

**Answer: NE**
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: The relation B (bounding box) is defined such that if region \(a\) is B of region \(b\), then:  
- \(\inf_x(b) \leq \inf_x(a)\), \(\sup_x(a) \leq \sup_x(b)\),  
- \(\inf_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\), \(\sup_y(a) \leq \sup_y(b)\).  

Given:  
- \(x\) B \(y\):  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
- \(y\) B \(z\):  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  

Chaining the inequalities:  
- **x-axis**:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) → \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) → \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
- **y-axis**:  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) → \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  

Thus, for \(x\) and \(z\):  
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) B \(z\). Therefore, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **B**.  

**Answer: B**
