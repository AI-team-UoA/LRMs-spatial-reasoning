PROMPT: Let W and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the inequalities defined for the relations.

- x W y implies:  
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is left of y)  
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x is vertically within y's y-bounds)  

- y NE z implies:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is left of y)  
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)  

From these, it follows that:  
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning z is entirely below x.  
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but the relative horizontal positions of x and z can vary.  

Given that z is below x, the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are those where x is north of z in some form. The possible relations are:  
- **N (North)**: This holds if x is directly north of z with z containing x horizontally (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)). This is possible when the x-projection of z contains that of x.  
- **NE (Northeast)**: This holds if x is northeast of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). This is possible when z is left of x.  
- **NW (Northwest)**: This holds if x is northwest of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). This is possible when x is left of z.  

All other relations (B, S, SE, SW, E, W) are impossible due to the vertical separation (z below x) and the lack of required horizontal containments or alignments.  

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
