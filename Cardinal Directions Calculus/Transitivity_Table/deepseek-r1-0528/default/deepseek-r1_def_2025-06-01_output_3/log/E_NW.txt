PROMPT: Let E and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\):  
  - \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  - \(x\) is vertically within \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\):  
  - \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  - \(y\) is entirely to the north of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  

Combining these:  
- Vertically:  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)).  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\).  

- Horizontally:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)).  
  - Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.  

Possible horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
1. **Entirely east of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - Combined with vertical: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) → **NE**.  
2. **Entirely west of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   - Combined with vertical: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) → **NW**.  
3. **Horizontal overlap with \(x\) within \(z\) horizontally**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   - Combined with vertical: \(x\) is north of \(z\) → **N**.  

Other relations are not possible:  
- \(B\), \(S\), \(SW\), \(W\), \(E\), \(SE\) violate the vertical or horizontal constraints derived.  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE**, **NW**, and **N**.  

**Answer: NE, NW, N**
