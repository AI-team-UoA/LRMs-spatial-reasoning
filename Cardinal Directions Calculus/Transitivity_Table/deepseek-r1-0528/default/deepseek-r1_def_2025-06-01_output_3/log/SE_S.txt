PROMPT: Let SE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South) and SE (South East).

### Explanation:
- From x SE y:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)  
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)  
- From y S z:  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)  
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within the x-span of z)  

Combining the inequalities:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is south of z on the y-axis, limiting possible relations to S, SE, or SW. However, SW is impossible due to the x-axis constraints:  
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) implies infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the SW requirement (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) for regions with positive area.  

Thus, only S and SE are possible:
- **S (South)**: Occurs when supx(x) ≤ supx(z), in addition to supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x).  
- **SE (South East)**: Occurs when supx(z) ≤ infx(x), in addition to supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  

Configurations where neither S nor SE holds (e.g., supx(z) > infx(x) and supx(x) > supx(z)) are inconsistent with the given relations and region properties, so they are not considered.

The possible relations are S and SE.
