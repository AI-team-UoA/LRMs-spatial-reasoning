PROMPT: Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as:  
\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), implying that \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

Horizontally, combining the constraints:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned relative to \(\inf_x(y)\).  
- \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y)\).

Two possible horizontal scenarios arise:

1. **Case 1: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
   Here, the horizontal interval of \(x\) is contained within \(z\):  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
   Vertically, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x\) N \(z\):  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

2. **Case 2: \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
   Here, \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Vertically, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x\) NW \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The scenario where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) (horizontal overlap) does not correspond to any defined atomic relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) due to lack of horizontal containment for N and insufficient conditions for other relations. However, only N and NW are achievable under the given constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N and NW.

**Answer: N, NW**
