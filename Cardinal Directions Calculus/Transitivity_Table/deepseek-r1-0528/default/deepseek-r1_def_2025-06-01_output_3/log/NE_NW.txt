PROMPT: Let NE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the relative positions based on the bounding box inequalities.

- From \(x\) NE \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is to the right and above \(y\).

- From \(y\) NW \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is to the left of \(z\) and \(z\) is below \(y\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(x\) is above \(z\) (i.e., a North component).
- For the East-West relation, \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) can vary relative to each other.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must have \(x\) North of \(z\) due to the y-axis inequality. The specific relation depends on the x-axis positions:
- If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is to the left of \(z\), so \(x\) NW \(z\).
- If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is within the x-range of \(z\), so \(x\) N \(z\).
- If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is to the right of \(z\), so \(x\) NE \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, N, and NE.
