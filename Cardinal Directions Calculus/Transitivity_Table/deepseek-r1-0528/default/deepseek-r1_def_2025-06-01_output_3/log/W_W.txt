PROMPT: Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is west (W) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is west (W) of region \(z\), the cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be west (W). This is determined by the transitive properties of the inequalities defining the W relation:

- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- For the x-coordinates: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- For the y-coordinates: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) imply \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Similarly, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These satisfy the conditions for \(x\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) is possible due to the strict leftward placement and vertical containment derived from the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is W.

\boxed{\text{W}}
