PROMPT: Let S and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is SE (South East).

### Derivation:
- From \(x\) S \(y\):
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is south of \(y\) in the y-direction).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., the x-interval of \(x\) is contained within the x-interval of \(y\)).

- From \(y\) SE \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is east of \(y\) in the x-direction).
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(z\) in the y-direction).

#### Combining the y-coordinate constraints:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(x\) S \(y\)).
- \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) from \(y\) SE \(z\), and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\) always holds).
- Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

#### Combining the x-coordinate constraints:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)).
- \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) S \(y\)).
- Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

#### Resulting relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) means \(x\) is south of \(z\) in the y-direction.
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) means \(x\) is east of \(z\) in the x-direction (since \(z\) is west of \(x\)).
- Therefore, the combined relation is SE (South East), as \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\).

### Why other relations are not possible:
- **S (South)**: Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) only holds if equality occurs, which is not general.
- **E (East)**: Requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) only holds if equality occurs, which is not general.
- Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW, B) are inconsistent with the derived y and x constraints (e.g., \(x\) cannot be north or west of \(z\) given the south and east positioning).

Thus, SE is the only possible relation.
