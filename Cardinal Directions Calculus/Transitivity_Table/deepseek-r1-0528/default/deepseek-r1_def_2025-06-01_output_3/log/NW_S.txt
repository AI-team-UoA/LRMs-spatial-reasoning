PROMPT: Let NW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined and the given conditions that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)
- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z covers y horizontally)

Combining these constraints, the spatial arrangement allows the following relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **B (Bounding box)**: \(z\) contains the bounding box of \(x\) in both axes.  
   Example: \(x\) in \([1,3] \times [4,5]\), \(z\) in \([0,7] \times [3.5,6]\) satisfies \(x\) NW \(y\) and \(y\) S \(z\) with \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **N (North)**: \(z\) is below \(x\) and \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([1,3] \times [5,6]\), \(z\) in \([0,7] \times [4,5]\) satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).

3. **S (South)**: \(x\) is below \(z\) and \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([1,3] \times [3.5,4]\), \(z\) in \([0,7] \times [4.5,5]\) satisfies \(x\) S \(z\).

4. **NW (North West)**: \(x\) is left of \(z\) and \(z\) is below \(x\).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([0,3] \times [4,5]\), \(z\) in \([4,7] \times [3.5,4]\) satisfies \(x\) NW \(z\).

5. **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is left of \(z\) and \(x\) is below \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([0,3] \times [3.5,4.5]\), \(z\) in \([4,7] \times [5,6]\) satisfies \(x\) SW \(z\).

6. **W (West)**: \(x\) is left of \(z\) and \(z\) contains \(x\) vertically.  
   Example: \(x\) in \([0,3] \times [3.5,5]\), \(z\) in \([3.5,7] \times [3,6]\) satisfies \(x\) W \(z\).

The relations NE, E, and SE are impossible because they require \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which contradicts \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) from the constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **B, N, S, NW, SW, W**.
