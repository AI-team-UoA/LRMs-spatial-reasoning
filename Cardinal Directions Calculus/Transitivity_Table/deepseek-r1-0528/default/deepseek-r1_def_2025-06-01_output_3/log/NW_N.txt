PROMPT: Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

The horizontal relation depends on the bounding boxes:
- From NW: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From N: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

### Possible horizontal scenarios:
1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies the definition of NW: \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
   
2. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)** (which implies overlap or adjacency in horizontal projection):
   - Further, if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\):
     - Then \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
     - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies the definition of N: \(x\) is N of \(z\).
   - If \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\):
     - The horizontal condition for N fails (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) not met), and no other relation (like NW, NE, E, W, etc.) holds due to the horizontal overlap and vertical constraint. However, such a configuration is not possible under the given constraints without violating the initial relations or the connectedness of the regions. Thus, only the above cases are valid.

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **NW** (when \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\)).
- **N** (when \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(z\)).

Thus, the answer is **N and NW**.
