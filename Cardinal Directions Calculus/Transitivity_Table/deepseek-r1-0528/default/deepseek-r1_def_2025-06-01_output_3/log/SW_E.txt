PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the definitions and constraints of the relations. The possible relations are those that can hold under some configuration of regions \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in REG, considering the bounding box inequalities.

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

The relations between \(x\) and \(z\) that are possible, based on these constraints and achievable configurations, are:
- **B** (bounding box): \(x\) can be contained within the bounding box of \(z\).
- **S** (south): \(x\) can be directly south of \(z\), with horizontal containment.
- **SW** (southwest): \(x\) can be southwest of \(z\).
- **W** (west): \(x\) can be directly west of \(z\), with vertical containment.
- **E** (east): \(x\) can be directly east of \(z\), with vertical containment.
- **SE** (southeast): \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\).

The relations N (north), NE (northeast), and NW (northwest) are impossible because they require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which conflicts with the constraints \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) > \inf_y(y) \geq \inf_y(x)\) (since regions have positive area, \(\inf_y(y) < \sup_y(y)\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B, S, SW, W, E, and SE.

\boxed{\text{B}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
