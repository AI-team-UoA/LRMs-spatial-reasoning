PROMPT: Let SW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are determined by the bounding box interactions. Here's the reasoning:

- **SW of \(y\) implies**:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely below y)  

- **B of \(z\) implies**:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z horizontally contains y)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z vertically contains y)  

### Possible Relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   If \(z\)'s bounding box extends left and below \(x\), such that:  
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  
   *Example*: \(x = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [2,4] \times [2,4]\), \(z = [0,5] \times [0,5]\). Here, \(x\) is inside \(z\)'s bounding box.

2. **S (South)**:  
   If \(z\) is above \(x\) and horizontally aligned:  
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is below z)  
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x is horizontally within z)  
   *Example*: \(x = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [2,4] \times [2,4]\), \(z = [0,5] \times [1.5,5]\). Here, \(x\) is south of \(z\).

3. **SW (South West)**:  
   If \(x\) is left and below \(z\):  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x left of z)  
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x below z)  
   *Example*: \(x = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [2,4] \times [2,4]\), \(z = [1.5,5] \times [1.5,5]\). Here, \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).

4. **W (West)**:  
   If \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically overlapping, with \(z\) vertically containing \(x\):  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x left of z)  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x vertically within z)  
   *Example*: \(x = [0,2] \times [2.5,3]\), \(y = [3,5] \times [3,5]\), \(z = [2,6] \times [1,5]\). Here, \(x\) is west of \(z\).

### Why other relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW) are impossible:
- \(x\) is left and below \(y\), and \(z\) contains \(y\), so \(x\) cannot be north, northeast, east, southeast, or northwest of \(z\) without violating the initial SW and B constraints. For example:
  - **E (East)**: Would require \(x\) right of \(z\), but \(x\) is left of \(y\) and \(z\) contains \(y\), making this impossible for non-degenerate regions.
  - **N, NE, NW**: Would require \(x\) above \(y\) or \(z\), but \(x\) is below \(y\).
  - **SE**: Would require \(x\) below and right of \(z\), contradicting \(x\) being left of \(y\) (hence left of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations are **B, S, SW, W**.
