PROMPT: Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) means \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) NW \(z\) means \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From \(x\) NW \(y\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

From \(y\) NW \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Chaining the x-direction inequalities:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

Chaining the y-direction inequalities:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which by definition means \(x\) is NW of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible under these constraints, as they require conditions that contradict the derived inequalities (e.g., for \(x\) to be S of \(z\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) would be needed, but we have \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(z)\), implying \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), violating the S condition).

Therefore, the only possible relation is **NW**.
