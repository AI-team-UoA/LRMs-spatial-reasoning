PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) horizontally aligned.

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the northwest of \(y\) (since \(y\) is southeast of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely west of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), but the relative vertical position between \(x\) and \(z\) is not fixed.

The possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\) lead to three mutually exclusive cases:
1. **NE (North East)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(z\) is below \(x\)), then \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).  
   Example: \(z\) vertically below \(x\), with \(z\) west of \(x\).
2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(z\)), then \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).  
   Example: \(z\) vertically above \(x\), with \(z\) west of \(x\).
3. **E (East)**: If neither of the above, but \(z\) is vertically aligned such that the vertical span of \(x\) is contained within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is east of \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) and \(z\) share vertical alignment or \(x\) is contained vertically within \(z\), with \(z\) west of \(x\).

These cover all possible relations given the constraints. Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are impossible due to the horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and the lack of vertical conditions to satisfy them.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (expressed as \(x\) relative to \(z\)) are NE, SE, and E.
