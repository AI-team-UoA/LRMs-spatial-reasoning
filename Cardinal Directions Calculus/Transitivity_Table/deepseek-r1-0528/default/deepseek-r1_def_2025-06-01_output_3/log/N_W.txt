PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- **x N y**: Region x is north of y, meaning x is above y and horizontally within the extent of y. This implies:
  - `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)` (x starts above the top of y).
  - `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (x is horizontally aligned within y's bounds).

- **y W z**: Region y is west of z, meaning y is left of z and vertically within the extent of z. This implies:
  - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y ends before z starts horizontally).
  - `infy(z) ≤ infy(y)` and `supy(y) ≤ supy(z)` (y is vertically within z's bounds).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between x and z**:
   - From x N y: `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`.
   - From y W z: `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`.
   - Thus, `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`, meaning x is entirely to the left of z.

2. **Vertical relation between x and z**:
   - From x N y: `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`.
   - From y W z: `infy(z) ≤ infy(y)` and `supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`.
   - Thus, `infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`, implying `infy(z) ≤ infy(x)`.
   - However, `supy(z)` can vary relative to `infy(x)` and `supy(x)`:
     - **Case 1**: If `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`, then z is entirely below x. Combined with x left of z, this yields **NW** (x is northwest of z).
     - **Case 2**: If `supy(z) > infy(x)`, then z extends above the bottom of x. If additionally `supy(x) ≤ supy(z)` (x's top is at or below z's top), this yields **W** (x is west of z, vertically within z's bounds). If `supy(x) > supy(z)`, no basic relation fits, but this case is constrained by the regions being homeomorphic to disks, and the bounding box analysis shows only NW and W are achievable under the definitions.

The possible relations between x and z are **NW** and **W**. No other cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, B) are satisfied based on the constraints.
