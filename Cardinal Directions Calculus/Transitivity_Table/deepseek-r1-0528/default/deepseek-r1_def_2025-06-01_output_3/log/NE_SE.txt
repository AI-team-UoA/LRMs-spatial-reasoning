PROMPT: Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is north of y)

- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is east of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z)

Chaining these:

1. **Horizontal direction (x-axis):**
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\))
   - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(x\) is east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical direction (y-axis):**
   - From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is north of y)
   - From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z, so z is north of y)
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are north of \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other can vary:
     - **Case 1 (NE):** If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is north of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being east of \(z\), the relation is NE.
     - **Case 2 (SE):** If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is south of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being east of \(z\), the relation is SE.
     - **Case 3 (E):** If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\). Combined with \(x\) being east of \(z\), the relation is E.

These cases are mutually exclusive and cover the possible vertical arrangements. Examples exist for each:
- **NE:** \(z = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [1,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(x = [2,3] \times [1.5,2.5]\)
- **SE:** \(z = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [1,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(x = [2,3] \times [-0.5,-0.1]\)
- **E:** \(z = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y = [1,2] \times [-1,0]\), \(x = [2,3] \times [0.2,0.8]\)

No other base relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are possible, as they conflict with the east constraint or vertical conditions.

**Possible relations:** E, NE, SE
