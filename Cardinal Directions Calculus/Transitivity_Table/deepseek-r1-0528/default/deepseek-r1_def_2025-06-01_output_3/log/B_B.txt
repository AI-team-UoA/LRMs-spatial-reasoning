PROMPT: Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The relation B (bounding box) is defined such that if region \(a\) is B of region \(b\), then:  
- \(\inf_x(b) \leq \inf_x(a)\), \(\sup_x(a) \leq \sup_x(b)\),  
- \(\inf_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\), \(\sup_y(a) \leq \sup_y(b)\).  

Given:  
- \(x\) B \(y\):  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
- \(y\) B \(z\):  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  

Chaining the inequalities:  
- **x-axis**:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) → \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) → \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
- **y-axis**:  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) → \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  

Thus, for \(x\) and \(z\):  
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) B \(z\). Therefore, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **B**.
