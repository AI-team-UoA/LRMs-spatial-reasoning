PROMPT: Let NW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations: region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\), and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are all nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B. This is because the constraints allow for various spatial arrangements where \(x\) and \(z\) can satisfy any of the relations through appropriate positioning relative to each other and \(y\). Below are brief justifications for each:

- **NW**: \(x\) can be left and above \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([1.5,2.5] \times [0,1]\), \(y\): \([3,4] \times [-1,0]\)).
- **N**: \(x\) can be above \(z\) with horizontal containment (e.g., \(x\): \([1,2] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([0,3] \times [1,2]\), \(y\): \([4,5] \times [-1,0]\)).
- **NE**: \(x\) can be right and above \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\): \([4,5] \times [-2,-1]\)).
- **E**: \(x\) can be right of \(z\) with vertical containment (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [1,3]\), \(z\): \([0,2] \times [0,4]\), \(y\): \([5,6] \times [-1,0]\)).
- **SE**: \(x\) can be right and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([3,4] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([1,2] \times [3,4]\), \(y\): \([5,6] \times [0,1]\)).
- **S**: \(x\) can be below \(z\) with horizontal containment (e.g., \(x\): \([1,2] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([0,5] \times [4,5]\), \(y\): \([6,7] \times [0,1]\)).
- **SW**: \(x\) can be left and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\): \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\): \([2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(y\): \([4,5] \times [-2,-1]\)).
- **W**: \(x\) can be left of \(z\) with vertical containment (e.g., \(x\): \([0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(z\): \([2,3] \times [1,4]\), \(y\): \([4,5] \times [0,1]\)).
- **B**: \(x\)'s bounding box can be contained in \(z\)'s (e.g., \(x\): \([1,2] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([0,5] \times [3,5]\), \(y\): \([5,6] \times [1,2]\)).

Thus, the possible relations are: **N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B**.
