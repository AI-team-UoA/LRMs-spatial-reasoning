PROMPT: Let S and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the following definitions apply:

- \(x\) S \(y\) requires:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box)
- \(y\) N \(z\) requires:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(z\) is below \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(z\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box)

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) and horizontally constrained within \(y\)'s bounding box. However, there are no additional constraints on the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) in either the vertical or horizontal directions. Specifically:
- The vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\), \(z\) above \(x\), or overlapping vertically).
- The horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\), \(z\) left of \(x\), overlapping, or one contained horizontally within the other).

Given this flexibility, any of the nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can occur, as demonstrated by specific examples:
- **N**: \(z\) directly below \(x\) and horizontally contained in \(x\).
- **NE**: \(z\) above and to the left of \(x\).
- **E**: \(z\) directly to the left of \(x\) at the same vertical level.
- **SE**: \(z\) below and to the left of \(x\).
- **S**: \(x\) directly above \(z\) and horizontally contained in \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) above and to the left of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) directly to the left of \(z\) at the same vertical level.
- **NW**: \(x\) below and to the left of \(z\).
- **B**: \(z\)'s bounding box contained within \(x\)'s bounding box.

Thus, all nine relations are possible.

**Possible relations:** B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
