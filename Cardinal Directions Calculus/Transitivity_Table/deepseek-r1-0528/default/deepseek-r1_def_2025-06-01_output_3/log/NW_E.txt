PROMPT: Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the spatial constraints.

- From x NW y:  
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)  

- From y E z:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is west of y)  
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is vertically contained within z)  

Combining these:  
- Both x and z are west of y, so their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary (x can be west, east, or horizontally aligned with z).  
- Vertically, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x). If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then z is completely below x; otherwise, vertical overlap may occur, but the constraints typically place x north of z.  

The possible relations from x to z are:  
- **NW**: If x is west and north of z (e.g., supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  
- **N**: If x is directly north of z with horizontal containment by z (e.g., supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).  
- **NE**: If x is east and north of z (e.g., supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).  

Other relations (E, SE, S, SW, W, B) are not possible due to the northward bias from the constraints (e.g., x cannot be south of z because infy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are NW, N, and NE.

\boxed{\text{NW}} \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{NE}}
