PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\):  
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically).  
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)).  

- \(y\) is B of \(z\):  
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\), \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is horizontally within \(z\)).  
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is vertically within \(z\)).  

Combining these:  
- **Horizontally**:  
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\), so \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).  

- **Vertically**:  
  - From \(x\) N \(y\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
  - From \(y\) B \(z\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).  
  - Thus, \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \min(\text{infy}(x), \text{supy}(z))\).  

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{infy}(x)\) relative to \(\text{supy}(z)\):  
1. **If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)**:  
   - The top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\), so \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) vertically.  
   - Combined with horizontal containment, \(x\) is N of \(z\).  

2. **If \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\)**:  
   - The bottom of \(x\) is below the top of \(z\), so vertical overlap may occur.  
   - However, \(x\) must be vertically within \(z\) for B: \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (true, as \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).  
   - If \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).  
   - If \(\text{supy}(x) > \text{supy}(z)\), no defined atomic relation fits (as other relations require horizontal misalignment), but the problem asks for possible relations that can occur, and this case does not yield a valid atomic relation.  

In all valid cases:  
- When \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(x\) N \(z\).  
- When \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), \(x\) B \(z\).  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **B**.  

**Answer: N, B**
