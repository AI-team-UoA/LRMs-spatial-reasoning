PROMPT: Let B and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ NW } z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\)

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraints**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
   - From \(y \text{ NW } z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)
   - Thus: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)

2. **Vertical constraints**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
   - From \(y \text{ NW } z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\)
   - Thus: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)

The conditions \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ NW } z\):
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (x is entirely to the west of z)
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (x is entirely to the north of z)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) is possible under these constraints, as they would violate the derived inequalities. For example:
- **W** requires vertical overlap, but \(x\) is entirely above \(z\).
- **N** requires horizontal overlap, but \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Other relations like **NE**, **SE**, **S**, **SW**, **E**, **B** similarly fail due to conflicting horizontal or vertical bounds.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **NW**.
