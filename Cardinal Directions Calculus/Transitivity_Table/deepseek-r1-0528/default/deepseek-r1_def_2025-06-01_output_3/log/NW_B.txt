PROMPT: Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, if region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(y\) B \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these, the following relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:

1. **NW (North West)**: Occurs when:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z)
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is below x)
   Example: \(x = [0,1] \times [4,5]\), \(y = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(z = [1,4] \times [1,4]\) → \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **W (West)**: Occurs when:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x is vertically within z's span)
   Example: \(x = [0,1] \times [3.5,4.5]\), \(y = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(z = [1,4] \times [1,5]\) → \(x\) W \(z\).

3. **N (North)**: Occurs when:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x is horizontally within z's span)
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is below x)
   Example: \(x = [1,3] \times [4,5]\), \(y = [4,6] \times [2,3]\), \(z = [0,10] \times [0,4]\) → \(x\) N \(z\).

4. **B (Bounding box)**: Occurs when:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x is completely within z's bounding box)
   Example: \(x = [0,1] \times [4,5]\), \(y = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(z = [0,4] \times [0,5]\) → \(x\) B \(z\).

Other relations (S, SW, E, SE, NE) are not possible due to contradictions with the constraints, such as \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) preventing \(x\) from being south of \(z\), and x-axis constraints ruling out east/southeast/northeast relations.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, NW, W**.
