PROMPT: Let S and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are E (east) and SE (southeast).

- **x SE z** is possible when x is entirely below z vertically (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) and z is entirely to the west of x horizontally (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).
- **x E z** is possible when x is vertically within z (i.e., infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) and z is entirely to the west of x horizontally (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).

No other relations are possible because:
- Horizontally, x must be east of z due to the chain of relations (y E z implies z west of y, and x S y implies x horizontally within y, leading to z west of x).
- Vertically, NE is impossible because supy(z) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(x) ≥ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x) cannot hold.
- Other relations like N, S, B, W, NW, SW are inconsistent with the east horizontal alignment or vertical constraints.

Thus, the possible relations are E and SE.

\boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
