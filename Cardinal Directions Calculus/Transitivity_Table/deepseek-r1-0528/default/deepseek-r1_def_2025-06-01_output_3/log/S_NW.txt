PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(x\) is directly south of \(y\), meaning \(x\) is below \(y\) with horizontal overlap constraints.
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(y\) is northwest of \(z\), meaning \(y\) is above and to the west of \(z\).

From \(x\) S \(y\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (top of \(x\) is at or below bottom of \(y\)).
- \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontal projection of \(x\) is within the horizontal bounds of \(y\)).

From \(y\) NW \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (right of \(y\) is at or left of left of \(z\)).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (top of \(z\) is at or below bottom of \(y\)).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), but no direct constraint between \(x\) and \(z\) vertically.

Possible vertical arrangements:
1. **NW relation**: If \(x\) is above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), then \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
2. **W relation**: If \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is west of \(z\).
3. **SW relation**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations given the horizontal constraint and flexible vertical alignment. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are incompatible due to the horizontal separation or vertical positioning.

**Possible relations**: NW, W, SW.
