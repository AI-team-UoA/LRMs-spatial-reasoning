PROMPT: Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is above \(y\)),  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s extent).  

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is left of \(z\)),  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is below \(y\)).  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).  
  Since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(x\) is above \(z\).  

- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)).  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is left of \(z\).  

- **Resulting relation**:  
  \(x\) is both above and left of \(z\), which corresponds to the NW relation.  
  - Definition of NW: \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\). Here, \(a = x\), \(b = z\):  
    - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) holds (horizontal),  
    - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) holds (vertical).  

No other relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible because:  
- \(x\) cannot be south, east, or overlapping vertically/horizontally with \(z\) due to the strict above-left positioning.  
- Bounding box conditions for other relations (e.g., horizontal overlap for N, vertical overlap for W) are violated.  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **NW**.
