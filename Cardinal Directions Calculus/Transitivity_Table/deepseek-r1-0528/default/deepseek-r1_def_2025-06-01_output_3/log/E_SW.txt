PROMPT: Let E and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is to the right of \(y\) and vertically within the bounds of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is to the left and below \(z\).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the right of \(y\) (since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **S (South)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\):  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), along with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This is possible if \(x\)'s bounding box is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s.

2. **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is left and below \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This occurs if \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) horizontally.

3. **SE (South East)**: If \(x\) is right and below \(z\):  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This occurs if \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) horizontally.

Other relations are impossible:
- **N, NE, NW**: Require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(x\) is below.
- **E, W, B**: Require vertical overlap or containment, but \(x\) and \(z\) are vertically disjoint with \(x\) below.
- **N, S, E, W, B** have additional constraints not satisfied here (e.g., horizontal containment for S, vertical containment for E/W, or full containment for B).

Thus, the possible relations are **S, SW, SE**.
