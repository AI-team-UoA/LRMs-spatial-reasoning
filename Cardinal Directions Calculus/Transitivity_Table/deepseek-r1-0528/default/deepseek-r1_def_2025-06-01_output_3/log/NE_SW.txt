PROMPT: Let NE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are all nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B. This is because the constraints imposed by the relations x NE y and y SW z allow for various relative positions of x and z, depending on the specific sizes and placements of their bounding boxes. Below are examples demonstrating each possible relation:

- **x B z** (z contains x):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 4.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 3.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x B z holds.

- **x N z** (x north of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x N z holds.

- **x NE z** (x northeast of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x NE z holds.

- **x E z** (x east of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 2.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x E z holds.

- **x SE z** (x southeast of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x SE z holds.

- **x S z** (x south of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x S z holds.

- **x SW z** (x southwest of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 1.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 3.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x SW z holds.

- **x W z** (x west of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 2.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x W z holds.

- **x NW z** (x northwest of z):  
  Set supx(y) = 0, supy(y) = 0.  
  Let x: infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3.  
  Let z: infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.  
  Then x NE y and y SW z hold, and x NW z holds.

Thus, all cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z.
