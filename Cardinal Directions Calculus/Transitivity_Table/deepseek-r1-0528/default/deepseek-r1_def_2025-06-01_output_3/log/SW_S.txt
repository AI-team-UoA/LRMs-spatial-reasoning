PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these, we derive:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- For the x-coordinates:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\). The possible atomic relations with this southern component are SW, S, and SE. However:

- **SE is impossible**: It requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and regions have positive extent, so \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), contradicting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

For SW and S:
- **SW occurs** if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This is possible, e.g., with bounding boxes:
  - \(x: [0, 2] \times [0, 1]\), \(y: [3, 5] \times [2, 3]\), \(z: [2.5, 4] \times [4, 5]\).
  - \(x\) SW \(y\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(1 \leq 2\).
  - \(y\) S \(z\): \(3 \leq 4\), \(2.5 \leq 3\), and \(5 \leq 4\) (adjust to valid, e.g., \(z: [2.5, 6] \times [4, 5]\), then \(5 \leq 6\)).
  - \(x\) SW \(z\): \(2 \leq 2.5\) and \(1 \leq 4\).
- **S occurs** if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (which holds from constraints). This is possible, e.g.:
  - \(x: [3, 4] \times [1, 2]\), \(y: [4, 6] \times [3, 4]\), \(z: [2, 7] \times [5, 6]\).
  - \(x\) SW \(y\): \(4 \leq 4\) and \(2 \leq 3\).
  - \(y\) S \(z\): \(4 \leq 5\), \(2 \leq 4\), and \(6 \leq 7\).
  - \(x\) S \(z\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(4 \leq 7\), with \(2 \leq 5\).

Cases where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) do not fit any atomic relation (not SW, S, or SE), but such configurations may not align with the atomic set. Given the constraints, only SW and S are achievable atomic relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **S**.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S
