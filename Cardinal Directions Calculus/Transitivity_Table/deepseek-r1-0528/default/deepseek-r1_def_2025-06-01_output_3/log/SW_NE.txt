PROMPT: Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the constraints are:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left and below \(y\), but their relative positions to each other are not fixed. The bounding boxes of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary independently within these constraints, allowing for any cardinal direction relation between them. Examples confirming each possibility are:

- **B**: \(x\) and \(z\) share the same bounding box (e.g., both at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), with \(y\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\)).
- **N**: \(x\) is above \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **NE**: \(x\) is above and right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **E**: \(x\) is right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\)).
- **SE**: \(x\) is below and right of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **S**: \(x\) is below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([0,1] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(y\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **SW**: \(x\) is below and left of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [2.5,3.5]\)).
- **W**: \(x\) is left of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([2.5,3.5] \times [1.5,2.5]\)).
- **NW**: \(x\) is above and left of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at \([0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(z\) at \([2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) at \([3,4] \times [3,4]\)).

Thus, every cardinal direction relation is possible between \(x\) and \(z\).
