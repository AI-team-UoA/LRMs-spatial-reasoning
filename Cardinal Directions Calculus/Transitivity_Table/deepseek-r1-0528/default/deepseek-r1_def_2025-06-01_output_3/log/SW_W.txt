PROMPT: Let SW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **SW (South West)**: This occurs when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). From \(x\) SW \(y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\). From \(y\) W \(z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Combining these, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), satisfying \(x\) SW \(z\).

- **W (West)**: This occurs when \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). The horizontal condition \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) holds as above. Vertically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) is satisfied due to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). If additionally \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) W \(z\) holds.

- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs when the bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\), specifically \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Given the horizontal deduction \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), containment requires \(\inf_x(z) = \inf_x(x) = \sup_x(x)\). Vertically, the conditions can align with \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) W \(z\), allowing \(x\) B \(z\) in specific configurations (e.g., vertical line segments).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, SW, W**. No other relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW) are possible under the given constraints.

**Final Answer**  
B, SW, W
