PROMPT: Let W and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W (West) of region y and region y is S (South) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South) or SW (South West).

### Explanation:
- Vertically, since y is S of z, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z). Also, since x is W of y, we have supy(x) ≤ supy(y). Combining these, supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is below z vertically, so the relation between x and z must have a southern component (i.e., S, SW, or SE).
- Horizontally:
  - From x W y, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
  - From y S z, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
  - Combining, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) always holds.
- SE (South East) is impossible because it requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but from the above, supx(z) ≥ supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) > infx(x) (since regions have positive extent), so supx(z) > infx(x).
- S (South) is possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (the latter always true). This occurs when z is not left of x horizontally.
- SW (South West) is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This occurs when x is completely to the left of z horizontally.
- Cases where infx(z) > infx(x) and supx(x) > infx(z) (horizontal overlap without containment) do not satisfy S, SW, or SE under the given definitions, but such configurations are not possible under the constraints derived from the relations; thus, only S and SW are feasible.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are S and SW.

**Final Answer: S, SW**
