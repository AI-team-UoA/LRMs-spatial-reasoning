PROMPT: Let NW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these:
1. **Vertical relation**: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
2. **Horizontal relations**: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible relations of \(x\) to \(z\) (considering \(x\) as the first region and \(z\) as the second):
- **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) and \(z\) is below \(x\) (already satisfied), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
- **NE (North East)**: If \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and \(z\) is below \(x\), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: If the horizontal projection of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) and \(z\) is below \(x\), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).

Other relations (like S, SW, SE, etc.) are not possible because they would violate the vertical or horizontal constraints derived. Specifically:
- \(z\) is always below \(x\), so relations where \(x\) is below \(z\) (e.g., S) are impossible.
- Corner relations (e.g., SW, SE) require \(x\) to be entirely left or right without vertical containment, but the vertical relation is fixed (\(z\) below \(x\)), and horizontal overlap may occur without full side alignment.

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are **NW, NE, and N**.
