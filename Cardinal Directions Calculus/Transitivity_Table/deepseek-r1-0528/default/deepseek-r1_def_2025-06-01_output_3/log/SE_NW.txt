PROMPT: Let SE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x \text{ SE } y\) means \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y \text{ NW } z\) means \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Given these constraints, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B). This is because both \(x\) and \(z\) are constrained to be southeast of \(y\) (as \(y \text{ NW } z\) implies \(z\) is southeast of \(y\)), but their relative positions to each other can vary widely depending on the specific bounds of their bounding boxes. By adjusting the infima and suprema of the x and y projections, all pairwise relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be satisfied without violating the initial conditions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
