PROMPT: Let SE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\))

- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(z\))

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the right of \(y\) (since \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)), but the relative horizontal position between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)** if \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
2. **S (South)** if \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box and below:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
3. **SE (South East)** if \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

These are the only possible relations, as \(x\) must be below \(z\) and can be left, aligned, or right relative to \(z\). Examples confirm each case is feasible.

**Possible relations: SW, S, SE**
