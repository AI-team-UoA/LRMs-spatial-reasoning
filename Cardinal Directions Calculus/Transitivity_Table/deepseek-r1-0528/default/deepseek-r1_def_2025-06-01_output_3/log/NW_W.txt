PROMPT: Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed based on the bounding box constraints:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is above y)
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z contains y vertically)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z).

For the vertical constraints, two cases arise based on \(\sup_y(z)\) relative to \(\inf_y(x)\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) < \inf_y(x)\)**  
   - Then \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.  
   - Combined with x being left of z, the relation is NW.  
   - Example: \(x: [0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(y: [2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(z: [4,5] \times [-1,1.5]\) → \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\)**  
   - Along with \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from the constraints), z contains x vertically.  
   - Combined with x being left of z, the relation is W.  
   - Example: \(x: [0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(y: [2,3] \times [0,1]\), \(z: [4,5] \times [0,4]\) → \(x\) W \(z\).

Other relations (e.g., SW) are impossible due to vertical constraints: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) imply \(z\) cannot be entirely above \(x\), and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\) prevents \(x\) from being entirely below \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW and W**.
