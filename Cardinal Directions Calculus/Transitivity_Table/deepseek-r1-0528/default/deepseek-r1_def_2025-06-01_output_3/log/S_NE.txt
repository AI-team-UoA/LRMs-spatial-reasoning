PROMPT: Let S and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).

Combining these constraints:
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).
- Thus, \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).
- Also, \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), but no direct vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) (horizontal constraint). The vertical relation can be:
- If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- If \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).

Both scenarios are feasible with appropriate vertical placements:
- For NE: Set \(\text{infy}(x)\) above \(\text{supy}(z)\).
- For SE: Set \(\text{infy}(z)\) above \(\text{supy}(x)\).

No other relations satisfy the horizontal constraint \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and the definitions. Thus, the possible relations are NE and SE.
