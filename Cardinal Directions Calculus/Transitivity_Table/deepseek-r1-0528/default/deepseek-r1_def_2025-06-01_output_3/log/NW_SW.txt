PROMPT: Let NW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW. This is determined by the inequalities derived from the relations and the possible configurations of the regions' bounding boxes.

- From x NW y:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)  

- From y SW z:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)  

Combining these:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z).  
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) can vary.  

The relation between x and z depends on the vertical positioning:  
- **x NW z** if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is below x).  
- **x SW z** if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is below z).  
- **x W z** if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x is vertically within the y-range of z).  

All three relations are possible for some configurations, and no other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are possible due to x being left of z.

\boxed{\text{NW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}}
