PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **X-axis constraints**:  
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   This implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but the relative order of \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) is not fixed. Two cases arise:  

   - **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
     Combined with the y-axis constraints (below), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) W \(z\).  

   - **Case 2**: \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\).  
     To avoid undefined or invalid configurations (where no relation holds due to partial overlap), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) must hold. This, with the y-axis constraints and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)), satisfies \(x\) B \(z\).  

2. **Y-axis constraints**:  
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). These hold in both cases.  

In Case 1, \(x\) W \(z\) is possible. In Case 2, \(x\) B \(z\) is possible. Other relations (e.g., SW, NW, S, N) are impossible due to y-axis constraints and the requirement that regions have positive area (non-degenerate bounding boxes), preventing equalities like \(\sup_y(x) = \inf_y(z)\) or \(\sup_y(z) = \inf_y(x)\).  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **W** and **B**.
