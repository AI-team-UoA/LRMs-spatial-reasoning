PROMPT: Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y \text{ E } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y \text{ E } z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), leading to \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - From \(y \text{ E } z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Thus:
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
     - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) match the definition of the **E (East)** relation for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- \(x \text{ E } z\) requires:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(x\) is vertically within \(z\)).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, B) satisfies all these conditions simultaneously:
- **W, NW, SW** require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which contradicts \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **N, S** require specific vertical alignments not met here.
- **NE, SE** require vertical separation (e.g., \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), but the vertical conditions here show \(x\) is within \(z\) vertically.
- **B** would require \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) ensures disjoint horizontal positions.

Thus, the only possible relation is **E**.
