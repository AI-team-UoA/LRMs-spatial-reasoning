PROMPT: Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) E \(y\) means \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and vertically, \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) S \(z\) means \(y\) is entirely south of \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and horizontally, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)).

This implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\inf_x(x)\) relative to \(\sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x)\) relative to \(\sup_x(z)\):

1. **If \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:
   - \(x\) is within the horizontal span of \(z\).
   - Combined with \(x\) being below \(z\), this matches the definition of S: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

2. **If \(\inf_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\) or \(\inf_x(x) = \sup_x(z)\)**:
   - \(x\) starts at or to the east of the east edge of \(z\).
   - Combined with \(x\) being below \(z\), this matches the definition of SE: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, E, SW, B) are not possible because:
- N, NE, NW require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(x\) is below.
- W, E require vertical alignment within \(z\)'s span, but \(x\) is entirely below.
- SW requires \(x\) west of \(z\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- B requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box vertically, but \(x\) is below.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S and SE.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
