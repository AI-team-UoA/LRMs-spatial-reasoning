PROMPT: Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

From these, the horizontal relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as:
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is west of \(z\).

Vertically:
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(\text{inf}_y(y)\), but their relative vertical positions can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must have \(x\) west of \(z\):
- **SW**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x is south of z).
- **W**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (x is vertically within z).
- **NW**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (z is south of x, so x is north of z).

All three relations are possible under the constraints, depending on the vertical arrangement of \(x\) and \(z\). Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, B) are excluded due to the west requirement.

Thus, the possible relations are **W, NW, SW**.
