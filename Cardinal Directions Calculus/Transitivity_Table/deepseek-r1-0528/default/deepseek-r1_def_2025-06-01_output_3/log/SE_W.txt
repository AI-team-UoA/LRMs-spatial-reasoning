PROMPT: Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. Analyzing the horizontal and vertical bounds:

- Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the east of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), leading to two cases:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z starts left of x)  
  - \(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x starts left of z)  

- Vertically:  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z extends below and above y)  
  This results in:  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is below z)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) (vertical overlap possible)  

Combining these, the possible relations are:

- **SW (South West)**: Occurs when \(x\) starts left of \(z\) and is below \(z\) (\(\inf_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), and \(x\) ends left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).  
- **S (South)**: Occurs when \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) and horizontally within \(z\)’s bounds (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)). This can happen in both horizontal cases if bounds align appropriately.  
- **SE (South East)**: Occurs when \(z\) ends left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
- **B (Bounding box)**: Occurs when \(z\)’s bounding box contains \(x\)’s, i.e., \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). This is possible with vertical overlap and horizontal containment.  

The relations N, NE, E, NW, W are not possible due to the constraints (e.g., \(x\) is always south of \(y\), and \(z\) is east of \(y\), preventing north or west relations between \(x\) and \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, S, SE, SW**.  

**Final Answer**  
B, S, SE, SW
