PROMPT: Let NE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box inequalities defined for regions in REG.

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is east of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is north of \(y\))

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(z\) is north of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

From these, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy the constraints:
- \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
- \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
- \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\))
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\))
- \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\))

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are those that can be satisfied under these constraints, considering the flexibility in the exact positions and sizes of the bounding boxes (as regions in REG have positive area, but inequalities may hold with equality for tangency).

- **B (bounding box)**: Possible, as \(z\)'s bounding box can contain \(x\)'s by setting \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **N (North)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be north of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- **NE (North East)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be northeast of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **E (East)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be east of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), with \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **SE (South East)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **S (South)**: Possible, as \(x\) can be south of \(z\) by setting \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The relations NW, W, and SW are impossible because they require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which contradicts \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \inf_x(z)\) (since regions have positive area, \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(x)\), making \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) infeasible).

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are B, N, NE, E, SE, and S.
