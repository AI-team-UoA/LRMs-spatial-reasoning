PROMPT: Let SE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

From these, we derive:
1. \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (x is east of z).
2. \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (both x and z are below y).

The vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) determines the possible relations:
- If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x below z), then \(x\) is SE of \(z\): satisfies SE conditions (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)).
- If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (z below x), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\): satisfies NE conditions (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).
- If the vertical interval of \(z\) contains that of \(x\) (\(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is E of \(z\): satisfies E conditions (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)).

Other relations (like SW, NW, etc.) are impossible due to the east constraint (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)). Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE, E, and SE.

**Final Answer**  
NE, E, SE
