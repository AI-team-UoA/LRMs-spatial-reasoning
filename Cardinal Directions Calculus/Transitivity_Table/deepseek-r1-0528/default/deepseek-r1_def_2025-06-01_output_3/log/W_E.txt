PROMPT: Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraints**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\). However, the relative horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
   - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is left of \(z\), leading to W relation.
   - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(z\) is left of \(x\), leading to E relation.
   - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\)'s bounding box, which, combined with vertical containment (below), leads to B relation.

2. **Vertical constraints**:  
   From \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), we get \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), we get \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, the vertical span of \(x\) is contained within the vertical span of \(z\). This rules out N, S, NE, NW, SE, SW, as these require \(x\) to be entirely above, below, or diagonally outside \(z\)'s vertical bounds.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **W**: If \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), with vertical containment.
- **E**: If \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), with vertical containment.
- **B**: If \(x\)'s bounding box is contained within \(z\)'s bounding box horizontally (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) and vertically.

Examples:
- **W**: \(x = [0, 1] \times [1, 3]\), \(z = [1.5, 2.5] \times [-1, 5]\), \(y = [3, 5] \times [0, 4]\).
- **E**: \(x = [1.5, 2.5] \times [1, 3]\), \(z = [0, 1] \times [-1, 5]\), \(y = [3, 5] \times [0, 4]\).
- **B**: \(x = [1, 2] \times [1, 3]\), \(z = [0, 2.5] \times [-1, 5]\), \(y = [3, 5] \times [0, 4]\).

Thus, the possible relations are **W, E, B**.
