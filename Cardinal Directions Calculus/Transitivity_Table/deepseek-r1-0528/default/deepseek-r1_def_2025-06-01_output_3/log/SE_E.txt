PROMPT: Let SE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertically, \(x\) is below \(y\))

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(z\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is contained within \(z\))

Combining these:

- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is left of \(x\).

- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). Also, \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), giving \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) has two cases:

1. **Case 1:** \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)  
   This means \(x\) is entirely below \(z\). Combined with \(z\) being left of \(x\), the relation is \(x\) SE \(z\).

2. **Case 2:** \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\)  
   Here, \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so \(z\) extends below the top of \(x\). However, \(x\) is still below \(y\), and \(z\) contains \(y\) vertically. For the relation to hold, we must have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical containment of \(x\) in \(z\)). Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), the relation is \(x\) E \(z\). If \(\inf_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\), no defined relation fits (based on the given 9 relations), but this case can be avoided by region choices satisfying \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SE and E.
