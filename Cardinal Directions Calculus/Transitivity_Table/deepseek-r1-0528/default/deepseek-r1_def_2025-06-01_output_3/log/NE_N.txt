PROMPT: Let NE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (y is entirely to the west of x)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is entirely to the south of x)

- \(y\) N \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is entirely to the south of y)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is horizontally within z's bounding box)

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely south of \(x\).
- Horizontally: 
  - From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  - Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

Now, consider possible horizontal positions of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. If \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\):
   - \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\).
   - With \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies the conditions for \(x\) NE \(z\).
2. If \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\):
   - \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
   - With \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies the conditions for \(x\) N \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- \(x\) NW \(z\) would require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) contradicts this.
- Relations like SW, SE, S, etc., violate the vertical condition (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(z\) south of \(x\), not north).
- B, E, W require containment or specific horizontal alignments not guaranteed here.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N and NE.
