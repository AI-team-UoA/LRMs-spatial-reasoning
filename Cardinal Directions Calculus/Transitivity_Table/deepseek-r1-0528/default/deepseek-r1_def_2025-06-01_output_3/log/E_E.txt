PROMPT: Let E and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E (East) of \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely to the east of y),  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within the y-bounds of y).

- \(y\) is E (East) of \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is entirely to the east of z),  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is vertically within the z-bounds of z).

### Analysis for \(x\) and \(z\):
- **Horizontal relation**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
  Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\).

- **Vertical relation**:  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is vertically within the z-bounds of \(z\).

### Conclusion:
The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) exactly match the definition of the **E (East)** relation between \(x\) and \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, B) satisfies these constraints simultaneously under the given premises.
