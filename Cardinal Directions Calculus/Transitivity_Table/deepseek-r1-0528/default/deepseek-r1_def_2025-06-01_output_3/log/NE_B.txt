PROMPT: Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the right and above \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(y\)'s bounding box.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **NE (North East)**:  
   Possible when \(x\) is entirely to the right and above \(z\).  
   Example:  
   - \(z: [0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
   - \(y: [2, 8] \times [2, 8]\) (so \(y\) B \(z\)),  
   - \(x: [10.5, 12] \times [10.5, 12]\) (so \(x\) NE \(y\) and NE \(z\)).

2. **E (East)**:  
   Possible when \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounds.  
   Example:  
   - \(z: [0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
   - \(y: [2, 8] \times [2, 8]\),  
   - \(x: [10.5, 12] \times [9, 10]\) (so \(x\) NE \(y\) and E \(z\)).

3. **N (North)**:  
   Possible when \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds.  
   Example:  
   - \(z: [0, 15] \times [0, 9]\),  
   - \(y: [2, 8] \times [2, 8]\),  
   - \(x: [9, 15] \times [9, 15]\) (so \(x\) NE \(y\) and N \(z\)).

4. **B (Bounding box)**:  
   Possible when \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s bounding box.  
   Example:  
   - \(z: [0, 20] \times [0, 20]\),  
   - \(y: [5, 15] \times [5, 15]\),  
   - \(x: [16, 18] \times [16, 18]\) (so \(x\) NE \(y\) and B \(z\)).

Other relations (SE, S, SW, W, NW) are impossible due to contradictions:  
- \(x\) is above \(y\) (from NE), and \(y\) is inside \(z\) (from B), so \(x\) cannot be below \(z\) (ruling out SE, S).  
- \(x\) is to the right of \(y\), and \(y\) is inside \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be to the left of \(z\) (ruling out SW, W, NW).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N, NE, E, B**.
