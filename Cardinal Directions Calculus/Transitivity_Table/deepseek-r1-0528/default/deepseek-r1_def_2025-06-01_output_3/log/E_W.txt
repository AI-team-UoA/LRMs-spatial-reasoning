PROMPT: Let E and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **Vertical constraints**: From \(x\) E \(y\), we have \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\). From \(y\) W \(z\), we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Combining these:
  \[
  \inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \quad \text{and} \quad \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)
  \]
  This implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning the vertical projection of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

- **Horizontal possibilities**: The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
  1. **If \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\))**: This satisfies the definition of \(x\) W \(z\), as the vertical conditions also hold.
  2. **If \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\))**: This satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\), as the vertical conditions also hold.
  3. **If the horizontal projection of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\))**: This satisfies the definition of \(x\) B \(z\), as the vertical conditions also hold.

The vertical constraints rule out other cardinal directions (N, NE, SE, S, NW, SW) because they require conditions incompatible with the vertical containment (e.g., being entirely above, below, or in diagonal positions that contradict \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are W, E, and B.

**Final Answer: W, E, B**
