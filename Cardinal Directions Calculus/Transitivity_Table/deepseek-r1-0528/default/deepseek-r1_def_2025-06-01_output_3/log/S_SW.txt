PROMPT: Let S and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is SW (South West) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these constraints:  
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of the SW (South West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is SW.

**Final Answer**  
SW
