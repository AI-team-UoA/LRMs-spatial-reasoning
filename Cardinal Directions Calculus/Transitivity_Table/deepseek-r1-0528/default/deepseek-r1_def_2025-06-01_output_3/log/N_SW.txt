PROMPT: Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\).

From \(x\) N \(y\) and \(y\) SW \(z\), the following constraints arise:  
1. \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) â†’ \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) (so \(x\) is west of \(z\)).  
2. \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\) (both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\)).

The vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:  
- If \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).  
- If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).  
- If \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\) (vertically within \(z\)'s bounds).

All three cases are possible and consistent with the constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, NW, and W.
