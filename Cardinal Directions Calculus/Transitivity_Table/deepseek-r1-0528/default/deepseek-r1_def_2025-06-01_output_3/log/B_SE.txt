PROMPT: Let B and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- Region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\), meaning the bounding box of \(y\) contains that of \(x\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is SE (southeast) of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x\) being SE of \(z\):
- \(a\) SE \(b\) iff \(\sup_x(b) \leq \inf_x(a)\) and \(\sup_y(a) \leq \inf_y(b)\)

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SE.
