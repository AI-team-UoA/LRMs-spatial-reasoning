PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) â†’ \(x\) is below \(z\) in the y-direction.
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) in the x-direction (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their relative x-positions are not fixed.

Possible relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is left and below \(z\)).
2. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is below \(z\) with x-projections overlapping appropriately).
3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is right and below \(z\)).

No other relations are possible because:
- \(x\) must be below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
- Relations like N, NE, NW, E, W, B require conditions not satisfied (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\) or specific containments that conflict with the constraints).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S, SW, SE**.
