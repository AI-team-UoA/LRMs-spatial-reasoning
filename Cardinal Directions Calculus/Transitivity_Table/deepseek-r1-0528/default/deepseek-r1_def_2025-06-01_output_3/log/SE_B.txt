PROMPT: Let SE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **SE (South East)**: This occurs when \(z\) is entirely to the left and above \(x\) in the bounding box comparison. Specifically, \( \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \) and \( \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \) must hold, which is feasible under the constraints.
- **E (East)**: This occurs when \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (so \( \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \)) and the \(y\)-interval of \(z\) contains that of \(x\) (i.e., \( \inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \) and \( \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z) \)). This is possible by appropriate arrangement of the \(y\)-bounds.
- **S (South)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (so \( \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \)) and the \(x\)-interval of \(z\) contains that of \(x\) (i.e., \( \inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \) and \( \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) \)). This is achievable under the constraints.
- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs when the bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\) in both axes, satisfying \( \inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \), \( \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) \), \( \inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \), and \( \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z) \). This is possible with appropriate region arrangements.

Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW) are not possible due to conflicts with the constraints from \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\). For example:
- N requires \(z\) below \(x\), but constraints place \(x\) below or overlapping \(z\).
- NE, NW, W, SW require specific disjointness in \(x\) or \(y\) that contradicts the given relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, E, S, SE**.

**Final Answer**  
**B, E, S, SE**
