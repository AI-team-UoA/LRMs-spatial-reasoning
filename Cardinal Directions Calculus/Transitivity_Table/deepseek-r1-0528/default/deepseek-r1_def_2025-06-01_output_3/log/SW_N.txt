PROMPT: Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\) if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\) if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **B**: \(x\) is bounding box of \(z\) if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\) if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These relations cover all feasible arrangements based on the given constraints. The relations NE, E, and SE are not possible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), which prevent \(x\) from being east of \(z\).

**Possible relations**: NW, W, SW, N, B, S.
