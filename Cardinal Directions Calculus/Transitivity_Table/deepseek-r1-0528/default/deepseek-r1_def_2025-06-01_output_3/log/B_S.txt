PROMPT: Let B and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations \(x \text{ B } y\) and \(y \text{ S } z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is analyzed as follows:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies that the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\). Specifically:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ S } z\) implies that \(y\) is entirely below \(z\) with horizontal overlap:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:
- **X-range constraints**: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \([\inf_x(x), \sup_x(x)] \subseteq [\inf_x(z), \sup_x(z)]\).
- **Y-range constraints**:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
  - \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y)\), but \(\inf_y(x)\) can be less than \(\inf_y(z)\) (since regions are 2D with interior, \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).

The relation \(x \text{ S } z\) requires:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (satisfied)
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (satisfied from X-range constraints).

Thus, \(x \text{ S } z\) holds. 

Other relations are not possible:
- **B**: Requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\), violating the condition.
- **SW, W, NW**: Require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) only if degenerate (not allowed for 2D regions).
- **SE, E, NE**: Require \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or similar, contradicted by X-range containment.
- **N**: Requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), not the reverse.

Hence, the only possible relation is **S**.
