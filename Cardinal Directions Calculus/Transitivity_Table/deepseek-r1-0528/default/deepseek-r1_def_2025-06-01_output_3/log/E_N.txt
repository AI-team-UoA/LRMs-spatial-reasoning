PROMPT: Let E and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Vertical Constraints**:  
   From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
   From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.

2. **Horizontal Constraints**:  
   From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).  
   From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\).  
   This implies \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(x\) starts to the right of \(z\) horizontally.

3. **Possible Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (including equality).  
     Here, \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) horizontally. Combined with \(z\) being below \(x\), this satisfies the conditions for \(x\) NE \(z\):  
     \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
   - **Case 2**: \(\text{sup}_x(z) > \text{inf}_x(x)\).  
     Now, \(z\) extends rightward beyond the start of \(x\). If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)). Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\):  
     \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

No other atomic relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, E, SE) are possible given the constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **NE**.
