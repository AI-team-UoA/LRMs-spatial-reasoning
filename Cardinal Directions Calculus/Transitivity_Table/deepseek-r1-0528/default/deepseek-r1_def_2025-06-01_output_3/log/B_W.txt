PROMPT: Let B and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is W (West).

### Explanation:
- **x B y** means that the bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of y. Specifically:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
  
- **y W z** means that y is entirely to the west of z and within the north-south range of z. Specifically:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
  - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these:
- **x-coordinate constraint**: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x B y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is completely to the west of z.
- **y-coordinate constraints**:
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x B y), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x B y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y W z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  
These satisfy the conditions for **x W z**:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) is possible, as they violate the constraints derived from the given relations. For example:
- **SW** or **NW** would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z) or supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) make this impossible.
- **B** would require x to be within z's bounding box, but supx(x) ≤ infx(z) means x is west of z, not inside.
- Other directions (e.g., E, N, S) are inconsistent with the west positioning and y-range constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.
