PROMPT: Let B and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ N } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:

1. From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
2. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
3. Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

4. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
5. From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
6. Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ N } z\). 

No other cardinal direction relation (NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) satisfies all these inequalities simultaneously under the given constraints. For example:
- NE requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but we have \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which contradicts \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) unless degenerate.
- B requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but we only have \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and no constraint on \(\inf_y(z)\) relative to \(\inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x)\) could be above \(\sup_y(z)\).

Thus, the only possible relation is N.
