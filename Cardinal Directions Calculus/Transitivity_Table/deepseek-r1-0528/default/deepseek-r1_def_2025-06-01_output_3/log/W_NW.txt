PROMPT: Let W and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

### Derivation:
- **x W y** implies:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom is at or below x's bottom)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

- **y NW z** implies:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's top is at or below y's bottom)

Combining these:
- From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z).
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x, meaning x is north of z).

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of **x NW z**:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is south of x, so x is north of z)

No other cardinal direction relation is possible, as the inequalities force x to be strictly northwest of z with no vertical or horizontal overlap that would allow other relations (e.g., W would require vertical overlap, but supy(z) ≤ infy(x) prevents this).

Thus, the only possible relation is **NW**.
