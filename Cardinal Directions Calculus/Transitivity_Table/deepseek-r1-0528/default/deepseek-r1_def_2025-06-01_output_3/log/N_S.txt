PROMPT: Let N and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\), and \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).

Combining these:
- **Horizontal constraints**:  
  \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\),  
  so \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\). This means the horizontal projection of \(x\) is within that of \(z\).
- **Vertical constraints**:  
  \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), but no direct relation between \(\text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{infy}(z)\), or \(\text{supy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(z)\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **N (North)**: Requires \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), and the horizontal constraints are satisfied.  
   *Example*: Set \(\text{supy}(y) = 0\), \(\text{infy}(z) = 0\), \(\text{supy}(z) = 0.5\), \(\text{infy}(x) = 1\). Then \(\text{supy}(z) = 0.5 \leq 1 = \text{infy}(x)\) holds.
2. **S (South)**: Requires \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), and the horizontal constraints are satisfied.  
   *Example*: Set \(\text{supy}(y) = 0\), \(\text{supy}(x) = 0.5\), \(\text{infy}(z) = 1\). Then \(\text{supy}(x) = 0.5 \leq 1 = \text{infy}(z)\) holds.
3. **B (Bounding box)**: Requires \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), and the horizontal constraints are satisfied.  
   *Example*: Set \(\text{supy}(y) = 0\), \(\text{infy}(z) = 0.5\), \(\text{infy}(x) = 0.6\), \(\text{supy}(x) = 0.7\), \(\text{supy}(z) = 0.8\). Then \(\text{infy}(z) = 0.5 \leq 0.6 = \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) = 0.7 \leq 0.8 = \text{supy}(z)\) hold.

Other relations (NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW) are impossible because:
- NE, E, SE require \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), but \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) imply \(\text{supx}(z) \geq \text{supx}(x) \geq \text{infx}(x) \geq \text{infx}(z)\), contradicting \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).
- NW, W, SW require \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), but \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x)\), so \(\text{supx}(x) \geq \text{infx}(z)\), contradicting \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N, S, B**.

**Answer: B, N, S**
