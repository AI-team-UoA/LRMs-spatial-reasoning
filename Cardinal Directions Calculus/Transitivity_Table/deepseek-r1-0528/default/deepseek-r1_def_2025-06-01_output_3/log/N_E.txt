PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below \(x\), and \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely left of \(y\), and \(y\) is vertically within the bounds of \(z\).

### Analysis for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relation**:  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).

2. **Vertical relation**:  
   From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) < \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   The vertical extent of \(z\) starts below \(\inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z)\) can vary relative to \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x)\).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
  The entire \(z\) is below \(x\). Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\), this fits the definition of NE:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) NE \(z\) is possible.

- **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**  
  \(z\) is left of \(x\), and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (since \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). This fits the definition of E:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) E \(z\) is possible.

### Ruled out relations:
- **N, S, NW, SW, SE, W, B**:  
  - N requires \(z\) entirely below \(x\) and \(x\) horizontally within \(z\), but \(z\) is left of \(x\), not containing it horizontally.  
  - S requires \(x\) entirely below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(z\) extends below, not above \(x\) entirely.  
  - NW requires \(z\) entirely below \(x\) (contradicts Case 2) and left, but Case 1 already covers NE when entirely below.  
  - SW requires \(x\) entirely below \(z\), impossible.  
  - SE requires \(x\) entirely below \(z\), impossible.  
  - W requires \(z\) right of \(x\), but \(z\) is left.  
  - E is covered in Case 2; NE in Case 1.  
  - B requires \(z\) to contain \(x\)'s bounding box, but \(z\) is left of \(x\), not containing it.

### Conclusion:
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.  
These depend on the vertical extents of \(z\) and \(x\):
- **NE** if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
- **E** if \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

**Answer: NE, E**
