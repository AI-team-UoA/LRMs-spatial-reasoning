PROMPT: Let S and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S (South) of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is S (South).

This is determined by the transitive nature of the S relation under the given definitions:
- From \(x\) S \(y\), we have \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) S \(z\), we have \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: 
  - From \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), we get \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - From \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), we get \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Thus, all conditions for \(x\) S \(z\) are satisfied: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relations (such as SW, SE, B, etc.) are possible, as they require additional constraints that are not met here (e.g., horizontal misalignment or vertical containment, which would contradict the inequalities derived).
