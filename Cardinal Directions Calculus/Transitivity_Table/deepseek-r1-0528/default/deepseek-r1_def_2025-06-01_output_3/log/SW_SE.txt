PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\) in the x-axis.
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\) in the y-axis.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Example: \(x\) entirely left of \(z\), with \(x\) below \(z\).

2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Example: \(z\) entirely left of \(x\), with \(x\) below \(z\).

3. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning the x-projection of \(z\) contains that of \(x\), and \(x\) is below \(z\).  
   Example: \(x\) horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s x-bounds but below.

Other relations are impossible:
- **N**, **NE**, **NW**: Require \(z\) below \(x\), contradicting \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **B**: Requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounds, but \(x\) is below \(z\).
- **E**, **W**: Require full y-containment within \(z\), not satisfied here.
- **NE**, **NW**: Require \(z\) below \(x\), impossible.

Thus, the possible relations are **SW**, **SE**, and **S**.
