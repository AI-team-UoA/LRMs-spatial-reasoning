PROMPT: Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) (in the y-direction), and \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the west and south of \(y\) (i.e., \(y\) is northeast of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- **Y-direction**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

- **X-direction**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)).  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\).

Therefore, \(x\) is both north and east of \(z\), satisfying the definition of NE:  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) holds, as they would require additional conditions (e.g., horizontal containment for N or vertical containment for E) that are not met here.
