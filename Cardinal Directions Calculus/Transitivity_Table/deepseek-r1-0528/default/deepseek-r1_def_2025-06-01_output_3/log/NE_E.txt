PROMPT: Let NE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is strictly east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is strictly north of y)

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is strictly east of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y's vertical extent is within z's)

Combining these:

- **Horizontal direction (x-axis):**
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\))
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z is strictly west of x).

- **Vertical direction (y-axis):**
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\))
  - This gives \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - The relation between \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) determines two cases:
    - **Case 1:** \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is strictly south of x).  
      Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), this implies \(x\) NE \(z\).
    - **Case 2:** \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) (overlap or north).  
      Here, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), and if additionally \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (x's vertical extent within z's), then \(x\) E \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- \(x\) NE \(z\) (Case 1)
- \(x\) E \(z\) (Case 2 with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\))

Other relations do not satisfy the combined constraints in all cases. Therefore, the possible relations are **NE** and **E**.
