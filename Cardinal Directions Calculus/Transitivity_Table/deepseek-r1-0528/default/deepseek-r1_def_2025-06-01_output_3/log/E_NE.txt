PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these constraints:  
1. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
2. From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
3. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
4. From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\):  
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z is west of x),  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is south of x).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE.
