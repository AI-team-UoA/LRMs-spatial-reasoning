PROMPT: Let B and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is NE.

### Explanation:
- **x B y** means that the bounding box of y contains the bounding box of x:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

- **y NE z** means that y is northeast of z:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these:
- From y NE z, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
- From x B y, we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- Thus:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) implies supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

This satisfies the definition of **x NE z**, which requires:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) is possible, as the conditions for those relations (e.g., overlapping bounds or different directional constraints) are not met given the inequalities derived from x B y and y NE z.
