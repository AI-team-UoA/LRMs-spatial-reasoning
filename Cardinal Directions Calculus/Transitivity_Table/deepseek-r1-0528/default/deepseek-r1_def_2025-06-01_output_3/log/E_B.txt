PROMPT: Let E and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E (East) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is B (bounding box) of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Vertical constraints from the relations**:  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\)).  
   Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), satisfying the vertical conditions for \(x\) B \(z\) if horizontal conditions hold.

2. **Horizontal constraints**:  
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).  
   This leads to two cases for \(\sup_x(z)\) relative to \(\inf_x(x)\):  
     - **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\).  
       Then:  
       - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) satisfies the horizontal condition for \(x\) E \(z\).  
       - Combined with vertical constraints, \(x\) E \(z\) holds.  
     - **Case 2**: \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\).  
       Additionally, consider \(\sup_x(x)\) relative to \(\sup_x(z)\):  
       - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), the horizontal conditions for \(x\) B \(z\) are satisfied (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
         Combined with vertical constraints, \(x\) B \(z\) holds.  
       - If \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\), no defined cardinal direction relation holds (horizontal overlap without containment violates all other relations). However, this case does not yield a valid relation among the given set, so only the subcase \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) is possible.

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are:
- **E (East)**: When \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\).  
- **B (bounding box)**: When \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

No other relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW) are possible, as they require conditions contradicted by the vertical containment or horizontal alignment derived from the given \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\).
