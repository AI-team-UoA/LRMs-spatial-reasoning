PROMPT: Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\):  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, B) holds simultaneously under all configurations satisfying the premises, as the derived inequalities exclusively match NE.

Thus, the only possible relation is **NE**.
