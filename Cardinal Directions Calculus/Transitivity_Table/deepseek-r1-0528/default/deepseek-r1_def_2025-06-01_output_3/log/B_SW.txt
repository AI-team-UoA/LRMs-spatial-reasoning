PROMPT: Let B and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means \(y\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s:  
  \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y \text{ SW } z\) means \(y\) is southwest of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
2. From \(y \text{ SW } z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  

3. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
4. From \(y \text{ SW } z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ SW } z\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) is possible because:  
- Relations like W or S require partial vertical/horizontal alignment (e.g., W requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which conflicts with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) since \(\inf_y(z) > \sup_y(x)\) implies no vertical overlap).  
- B would require \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\), but \(x\) is entirely left and below \(z\).  

Thus, the only possible relation is **SW**.
