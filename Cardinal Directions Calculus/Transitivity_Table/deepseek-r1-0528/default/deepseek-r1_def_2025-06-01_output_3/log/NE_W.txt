PROMPT: Let NE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **NE of \(y\) implies**:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(x\))  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))  

- **W of \(z\) implies**:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(z\))  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(z\) vertically covers \(y\))  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical relations**:  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\))  
  - \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\), leading to two cases:  
    - Case 1: \(\inf_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\) → \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (vertical separation)  
    - Case 2: \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → vertical overlap or boundary contact  

- **Horizontal relations**:  
  - Both \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but no direct constraint between \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\), leading to three subcases:  
    - Entirely west: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
    - Entirely east: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)  
    - Horizontal containment: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)  

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
1. **When \(\inf_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\) (vertical separation)**:  
   - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) → **NW**  
   - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → **NE**  
   - If horizontal containment → **N**  

2. **When \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical overlap or contact)**:  
   - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → **W**  
   - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → **E**  
   - If horizontal and vertical containment → **B**  
   - If \(\inf_y(x) = \sup_y(z)\) and horizontal containment → **N**  

**Excluded relations**:  
- **S**, **SW**, **SE** are impossible because \(x\) is always above \(y\) (so cannot be below \(z\), which covers \(y\) vertically).  

Through case analysis and examples (e.g., specific placements of regions satisfying the given relations), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **B, N, NE, E, W, NW**.  

**Final Answer**:  
**B, N, NE, E, W, NW**
