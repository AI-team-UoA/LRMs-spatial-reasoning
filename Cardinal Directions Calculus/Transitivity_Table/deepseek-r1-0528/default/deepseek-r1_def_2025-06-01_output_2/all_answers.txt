For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Given that region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, the cardinal direction relation between x and z must be N. This is derived from the definitions of the N relation and the transitive property of the inequalities involved.

- x N y implies:
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y in the y-direction)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge is at least as far right as y's left edge)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge is at most as far right as y's right edge)

- y N z implies:
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z in the y-direction)
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left edge is at least as far right as z's left edge)
  - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right edge is at most as far right as z's right edge)

Combining these:
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) by transitivity.
- From infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), it follows that supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

These combined inequalities satisfy the definition of x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as they would violate the derived inequalities or require conditions (e.g., strict horizontal or vertical shifts) that are incompatible with the nested x-ranges and vertical separation enforced by the given N relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.

**Answer:** N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- The relation N (North) implies that \(y\) is below \(x\), specifically \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- The relation W (West) implies that \(y\) is to the left of \(z\), specifically \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is to the left of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\).

Two cases arise for the vertical position of \(z\) relative to \(x\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
   Here, the top of \(z\) is below the bottom of \(x\). With \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this matches the definition of NW:  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal)  
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical)  
   Thus, \(x\) can be NW of \(z\).

2. **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\)**  
   Here, the top of \(z\) is above the bottom of \(x\). Further subcases depend on \(\sup_y(z)\) relative to \(\sup_y(x)\):  
   - **Subcase 2a: \(\sup_y(z) > \sup_y(x)\)**  
     The top of \(z\) is above the top of \(x\). With \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from earlier), and adding \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), this matches W:  
     - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
     - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  
     Thus, \(x\) can be W of \(z\).  
   - **Subcase 2b: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\)**  
     The top of \(z\) is at or below the top of \(x\) but above the bottom of \(x\). However, no atomic cardinal direction relation (from the given set) fits this scenario, as it requires a combination not defined in the atomic relations (e.g., partial vertical overlap with \(x\) left of \(z\) is not atomic). Thus, this subcase does not yield an additional atomic relation.

No other atomic relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, SW, B) are possible under the constraints, as verified by the bounding box conditions and examples. For instance:
- SW requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) makes this impossible for non-degenerate regions.
- B requires containment in both axes, which conflicts with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

Thus, the only possible atomic relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **W** and **NW**.

**Final Answer**  
W, NW
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\), \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined as follows:

1. **Horizontal constraint**: From \(y\) E \(z\), \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\). From \(x\) N \(y\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\). Thus, \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraints**:
   - From \(x\) N \(y\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).
   - From \(y\) E \(z\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) and \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y)\) (since \(y\) is a region).
   - Thus, \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), so \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).

Now, consider vertical possibilities:
- If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely above \(z\), leading to \(x\) NE \(z\) (since \(x\) is east and north of \(z\)).
- If \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds, leading to \(x\) E \(z\) (east and vertically contained).

Other relations are impossible:
- **B, S, SW, W, NW, N, SE**: Violate horizontal or vertical constraints derived (e.g., \(x\) must be east of \(z\), cannot be west, south, etc., based on the chain).

Thus, the possible relations are NE and E.

**Answer**: NE, E
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From the horizontal constraints:
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so the x-projection of \(x\) is contained within the x-projection of \(z\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary, but the horizontal containment limits the possible cardinal direction relations to those that do not require horizontal displacement. The valid relations are:

- **B** (bounding box): If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **N** (North): If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **S** (South): If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Other relations (E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) are impossible because they require horizontal displacement (e.g., \(z\) entirely left or right of \(x\)), which contradicts the horizontal containment derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B, N, and S.

**Final Answer**  
B, N, S
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical: \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontal: \(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounds)  

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal: \(y\) is entirely left of \(z\))  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertical: \(z\) is entirely below \(y\))  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) imply \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  

- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\).  

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being **NW of \(z\)**:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal)  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical)  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) is possible, as they require conflicting horizontal or vertical alignments (e.g., \(x\) N \(z\) would require \(z\) to span horizontally over \(x\), but here \(x\) is left of \(z\)).

**Possible relation: NW**
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the following constraints apply:

- From \(x\) N \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely above \(y\) and horizontally within the x-projection of \(y\).

- From \(y\) SW \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below and to the west of \(z\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This implies \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), but their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). The candidate relations are NW, W, and SW, as they all require this horizontal condition. The vertical relationship determines which of these holds:

- **NW (North West)**: If \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
  Example: \(y = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z = [2,3] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(x = [0.2,0.8] \times [3,4]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is above and west of \(z\).

- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  
  Example: \(y = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(x = [0.2,0.8] \times [2.1,2.9]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is west of \(z\) and vertically aligned inside \(z\)'s y-bounds.

- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
  Example: \(y = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z = [2,3] \times [3,4]\), \(x = [0.2,0.8] \times [1.5,2.5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is below and west of \(z\).

No other relations satisfy the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, W, and SW.

**Answer: NW, W, SW**
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(x\) is above \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is within the bounds of \(y\))
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is to the right of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(x\) is to the right of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (since \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\)), but their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **E (East)**: If \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounds:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (holds)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (possible, e.g., \(z\) vertically contains \(x\))
- **NE (North East)**: If \(x\) is to the right and above \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (holds)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (possible, e.g., \(z\) entirely below \(x\))
- **SE (South East)**: If \(x\) is to the right and below \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (holds)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (possible, e.g., \(x\) entirely below \(z\))

Other relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N) are impossible due to the horizontal condition \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and vertical constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are E, NE, and SE.
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely above \(y\), and the horizontal extent of \(x\) is within the horizontal extent of \(y\).

- \(y\) is NE of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the right and above \(z\).

Combining these:  
- Vertically:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) imply \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  
- Horizontally:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) imply \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) requires:  
- \(z\) entirely below \(x\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
- \(z\) entirely to the left of \(x\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  

This matches the definition of NE:  
\(x\) is NE of \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously under the given constraints. For example:  
- N requires \(z\) below \(x\) and the horizontal extent of \(z\) to contain that of \(x\), but here \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(z\) is left of \(x\), violating containment.  
- Other relations fail similarly due to mismatched horizontal or vertical constraints.  

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.  

**Answer: NE**
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is above y),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (x is within the horizontal bounds of y).

- \(y\) is B of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is within the horizontal bounds of z),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is within the vertical bounds of z).

Combining these:

- **Horizontally**: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) → \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  - Thus, \(x\) is within the horizontal bounds of \(z\).

- **Vertically**:
  - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - Chaining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - The relation between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z)\) determines the vertical relation with \(z\).

**Possible cases for vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:

1. **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**:
   - Then \(x\) is within the vertical bounds of \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Combined with horizontal containment, this satisfies \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **If \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z)\)**:
   - Then \(x\) is entirely above \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Combined with horizontal containment, this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).

**No other relations are possible**:
- Horizontal containment rules out E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW (require horizontal displacement).
- If neither vertical condition holds (e.g., \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\)), the vertical overlap prevents S, NE, SE, etc., but the horizontal containment and vertical constraints from the premises ensure only B and N can occur.

**Examples**:
- **B example**: \(z = [0,10] \times [0,10]\), \(y = [2,8] \times [2,8]\), \(x = [2,8] \times [9,10]\). Here, \(x\) B \(z\).
- **N example**: \(z = [0,10] \times [0,10]\), \(y = [2,8] \times [2,8]\), \(x = [2,8] \times [12,15]\). Here, \(x\) N \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **N**.
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(y\) and vertically contained within \(y\)'s bounding box.

- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the north of \(y\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(z\)), and \(y\)'s horizontal span is contained within \(z\)'s horizontal span.

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely below \(x\). Thus, \(x\) is above \(z\).
- Horizontally:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(x\) W \(y\)).  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\)).  

The possible horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
1. If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\):  
   \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\), and with \(x\) above \(z\), this yields \(x\) NW \(z\).
2. If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (which implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)):  
   \(x\)'s horizontal span is contained within \(z\)'s, and with \(x\) above \(z\), this yields \(x\) N \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B: Violate the vertical or horizontal constraints derived.
- Cases with horizontal overlap but no containment (e.g., \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)) do not satisfy any atomic relation's requirements, but such configurations are covered by the above cases when relations hold.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW and N.

**Answer: N, NW**
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions for the West (W) relation:

- \(x\) W \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
2. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
3. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) W \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\),
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) is possible because:
- Horizontal: \(x\) is strictly left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), ruling out E, NE, SE, and B (which requires horizontal containment).
- Vertical: The vertical span of \(x\) is contained within \(z\)'s vertical span (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), but \(x\) is not entirely above, below, or aligned in a way that satisfies N, S, NW, SW, or other relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is W.

**Answer: W**
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

The constraints imply:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) horizontally (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)).
- Vertically, \(x\) and \(z\) are contained within the bounds of \(y\) (\(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\)).

No direct constraints exist between \(x\) and \(z\) in either dimension. Thus, any relative position is possible:
- **Horizontally**: \(x\) can be left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), right of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), or overlap (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) for containment, or partial overlap without containment).
- **Vertically**: \(x\) can be above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), or at the same height (overlap or containment).

All nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:
- **B** (bounding box): \(x\) contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.
- **S** (south): \(x\) directly below \(z\).
- **SW** (southwest): \(x\) below and left of \(z\).
- **W** (west): \(x\) directly left of \(z\).
- **NW** (northwest): \(x\) above and left of \(z\).
- **N** (north): \(x\) directly above \(z\).
- **NE** (northeast): \(x\) above and right of \(z\).
- **E** (east): \(x\) directly right of \(z\).
- **SE** (southeast): \(x\) below and right of \(z\).

Examples for each exist within the constraints (e.g., varying horizontal positions relative to \(z\) and vertical alignments while staying left of \(y\) and within \(y\)'s vertical bounds).

**Possible relations**: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE.
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From these:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the x-axis bounds:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of SW.
   - Thus, \(x\) can be SW of \(z\).

2. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)** (which implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)):
   - Additionally, if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then:
     - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
     - Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies the definition of S.
   - Thus, \(x\) can be S of \(z\) when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The case where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\) does not fit any atomic relation (e.g., not SW, S, or others), as \(x\) would span both west and south tiles relative to \(z\), which is not covered by the defined relations. Hence, only SW and S are possible.

**Possible relations**: S, SW
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relation between x and z is NW.

- x W y implies:  
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)  
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y contains x vertically)  

- y NW z implies:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)  
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y)  

Combining these:  
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is west of z)  
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) imply supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is south of x, so x is north of z)  

Thus, x is both west and north of z, satisfying the NW relation: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) are possible given the constraints, as they would violate the conditions derived from the given relations.

\boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given relations:

- \(x\) is \(W\) of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) is \(SW\) of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining the horizontal constraints:  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

Combining the vertical constraints:  
\(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being \(SW\) of \(z\):  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (such as \(W\), \(S\), etc.) is possible, as the vertical and horizontal alignment strictly places \(x\) southwest of \(z\) without overlapping or fitting other constraints.

**Possible relation: SW**
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- **Vertical direction**: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This implies that \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) vertically.
- **Horizontal direction**: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other are not fixed.

The possible horizontal arrangements between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).
2. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.
3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (or equivalently, \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\)).

These are the only possible relations, as the vertical separation (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) restricts the relation to southern directions (SW, S, SE), and the horizontal arrangements cover all cases:
- SW when \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- S when \(x\) is horizontally aligned within \(z\).
- SE when \(x\) is right of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S, SE
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, we derive:
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are entirely to the left of \(y\).
2. \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (since the highest point of \(z\) is below the lowest point of \(x\)).

The horizontal relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
- **Case 1: \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).**  
  Then \(x\) is NW of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (satisfied) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied).
- **Case 2: \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).**  
  Then \(x\) is NE of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (satisfied) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied).

Horizontal overlap (where neither \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) nor \(z\) entirely left of \(x\)) does not yield any valid base relation for \(x\) relative to \(z\) under the given constraints, as the base relations require clear horizontal positioning (entirely left, entirely right, or containment, which is not guaranteed here).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (with \(x\) as the subject and \(z\) as the reference) are **NE** and **NW**.

**Answer: NE, NW**
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions that region \(x\) is W of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- From \(x\) W \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)  

- From \(y\) B \(z\):  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical direction**:  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so the vertical extent of \(x\) is contained within \(z\):  
    - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
    - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  

- **Horizontal direction**:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(\inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x)\) are \(\leq \inf_x(y)\).  

Possible cases for horizontal alignment:  
1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:  
   - This satisfies the condition for \(x\) W \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical, already true)  
   - Thus, \(x\) can be W of \(z\).  

2. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   - This satisfies the condition for \(x\) B \(z\):  
     - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical, already true)  
   - Note: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), ensuring horizontal containment.  
   - Thus, \(x\) can be B of \(z\).  

No other cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW) are possible, as they require conditions not satisfied by the vertical containment and horizontal constraints (e.g., NE requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which conflicts with \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x)\)).  

**Conclusion**: The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **W** and **B**.  

Answer: **W, B**
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.

Horizontally:
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) N \(z\)), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- \(\sup_x(z)\) can vary relative to \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x)\).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **N (North)**:
   - Requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - The vertical condition holds. Horizontally, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is satisfied, and if \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\), then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) holds. Thus, \(x\) N \(z\) is possible.

2. **NE (North East)**:
   - Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - The vertical condition holds. If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely to the left (east) of \(x\) horizontally. This is possible since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) can occur if \(\sup_x(z)\) is at most \(\inf_x(x)\).

### Why other relations are impossible:
- **S, SE, SW**: Require \(x\) below \(z\), but \(z\) is below \(x\) vertically, so impossible.
- **E, B, W, NW**: 
  - **E** requires \(z\) entirely to the left of \(x\) horizontally (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) but does not account for the vertical relation properly (NE already covers this horizontal with vertical).
  - **B** requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s, but vertically \(z\) is below \(x\), so impossible.
  - **W** requires \(x\) entirely to the left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(x)\), impossible for regions with area.
  - **NW** requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which similarly implies \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(x)\), impossible.
- **S, SE, SW** conflict with the vertical relation as explained.

Thus, the possible relations are **N** and **NE**.
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is E (East) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\), the constraints derived from the cardinal direction relations are as follows:

- From \(x\) E \(y\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- From \(y\) W \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these, the following inequalities hold for \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- Let \(S = \sup_x(y)\). Then \(\inf_x(x) \geq S\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq S\).

The relations N, S, NE, SE, NW, and SW are impossible because they require conditions that conflict with the y-axis constraints (e.g., \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) for N or NE, or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for S or SE, which contradict \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) for regions with area).

The only possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) that satisfy the constraints are:
- **E (East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This is possible, for example, if \(\inf_x(z) = S\), \(\sup_x(z) = S + 1\), and \(\inf_x(x) = S + 2\), so \(\sup_x(z) = S + 1 \leq S + 2 = \inf_x(x)\), and the y-conditions are satisfied.
- **W (West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This is possible, for example, if \(\inf_x(x) = S\), \(\sup_x(x) = S + 0.5\), and \(\inf_x(z) = S + 1\), so \(\sup_x(x) = S + 0.5 \leq S + 1 = \inf_x(z)\), and the y-conditions are satisfied.
- **B (Bounding Box)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). This is possible, for example, if both \(x\) and \(z\) start at \(x = S\), but \(z\) is wider, such as \(\inf_x(z) = S\), \(\sup_x(z) = S + 3\), \(\inf_x(x) = S + 1\), \(\sup_x(x) = S + 2\), so \(\inf_x(z) = S \leq S + 1 = \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) = S + 2 \leq S + 3 = \sup_x(z)\), and the y-conditions are satisfied.

Cases with partial x-axis overlap (not covered by E, W, or B) are inconsistent with the defined cardinal direction relations, as the relations require either no x-axis overlap (for E or W) or full containment (for B).

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are E, W, and B.

\boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is E (East) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E (East) of region \(z\), the relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) must be E (East). This is derived from the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., the left edge of \(x\) is to the right of the right edge of \(y\)),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., the left edge of \(y\) is to the right of the right edge of \(z\)),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Chaining these inequalities:
- For the x-coordinates: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- For the y-infimum: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- For the y-supremum: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These satisfy the conditions for \(x\) E \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, or B) is possible, as they require different positional constraints (e.g., vertical misalignment or bounding box containment) that contradict the derived inequalities for non-degenerate regions in REG.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is E.

\boxed{\text{E}}
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), leading to \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).

The vertical condition \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) satisfies the vertical requirement for S, SE, and SW relations between \(x\) and \(z\). The horizontal conditions \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (with \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) allow two scenarios for the horizontal extent of \(x\) relative to \(z\):

1. **If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)**:
   - Horizontally: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
   - Vertically: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
   - This satisfies the definition of **S** (South) for \(x\) relative to \(z\).

2. **If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)**:
   - Horizontally: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
   - Vertically: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
   - This satisfies the definition of **SE** (South East) for \(x\) relative to \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **SW** requires \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), but \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\) makes this impossible.
- **B**, **N**, **NE**, **E**, **NW**, **W** violate vertical or horizontal constraints derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S** and **SE**.

**Answer: S, SE**
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (so \(x\) is to the east of \(y\))
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (so \(y\) is to the west of \(z\))
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (so \(z\) is below \(y\))

Combining these, the vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), satisfying the vertical condition for \(x\) being north of \(z\) (common to N, NE, NW).

Horizontally, the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) vary:
- If \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- If \(z\) is entirely to the east of \(x\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is entirely within the horizontal extent of \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).

These cover all possible horizontal configurations under the constraints, and the vertical condition is always satisfied for N, NE, NW. Other relations (e.g., S, SW, E, W, SE, B) are incompatible with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), which ensures \(x\) is above \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, and NW.

**Answer: N, NE, NW**
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S, SE, and SW.  

- **S (South)**: x is directly south of z.  
- **SE (South East)**: x is southeast of z.  
- **SW (South West)**: x is southwest of z.  

These relations are derived from the constraints:  
- From x E y: \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).  
- From y SW z: \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).  
- Combining: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x is south of z), but the x-coordinate relationship varies, allowing S, SE, or SW.  

Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are impossible due to the south constraint and region properties.  

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}}
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

Combining these:  
- From \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
- From \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

These combined conditions, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), define the relation \(x\) SE \(z\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible, as they would require conflicting constraints (e.g., \(x\) cannot be north or west of \(z\) given the above).  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SE.  

**Answer: SE**
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: Given that region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NE (North East).

### Explanation:
- **x E y** implies:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y in the x-direction).
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y's y-interval contains x's y-interval).
- **y NE z** implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z in the x-direction).
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z in the y-direction).

Chaining these inequalities:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) define the relation **x NE z**. No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) is possible, as derived from the inequalities and the fact that regions have positive area (ensuring strict inequalities in bounds prevent other relations).

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

**Final Answer: NE**
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely to the east of y),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y's bounds).

- \(y\) B \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is horizontally within z's bounds),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is vertically within z's bounds).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraints**:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - However, \(\sup_x(z)\) could be:
     - **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning z is entirely to the west of x.
     - **Case 2**: \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\), meaning x starts within z's horizontal span.

2. **Vertical constraints**:
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so x is vertically within z's bounds.

**Possible relations between x and z**:

- **Case 1** (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)):
  - Horizontally: z is entirely west of x (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
  - Vertically: x is within z's bounds.
  - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\).

- **Case 2** (\(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\)):
  - Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(z)\).
  - Vertically: x is within z's bounds.
  - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then x is entirely within z's bounding box, satisfying \(x\) B \(z\).
  - No other cardinal relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW) are possible because:
    - Vertical constraints prevent x from being entirely north or south of z.
    - Horizontal constraints prevent x from being entirely west or diagonal relations (e.g., \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) rules out SE, NE, E, etc.).

Thus, the possible relations are **E** (when z is west of x) and **B** (when x is within z's bounding box).

**Answer**: B, E
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) S \(y\) implies \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) and horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box:  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies \(y\) is entirely above \(z\) and horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box (which is consistent as \(y\) is the reference):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

Combining the vertical constraints:  
\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) lie below \(\inf_y(y)\). The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their specific bounds:
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (implying \(x\) is above \(z\)).

Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are within \([\inf_x(y), \sup_x(y)]\), but their relative positions can vary:
- \(x\) could be left of, right of, or horizontally overlapping with \(z\).

Considering all cases:
1. **If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)):**
   - If \(x\) is left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), then \(x\) SW \(z\).
   - If \(x\) is right of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), then \(x\) SE \(z\).
   - If \(z\) horizontally covers \(x\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), then \(x\) S \(z\).

2. **If \(z\) is below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)):**
   - If \(x\) is left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), then \(x\) NW \(z\).
   - If \(x\) is right of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), then \(x\) NE \(z\).
   - If \(z\) horizontally covers \(x\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), then \(x\) N \(z\) (since \(x\) is above \(z\) and covered horizontally).

3. **Horizontal overlap without vertical separation or covering is not covered by the defined relations, so these cases are excluded.**

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are therefore SW, SE, S, NW, NE, N.  

**Final Answer:**  
SW, SE, S, NW, NE, N
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, the constraints are:

- From x S y: 
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- From y W z: 
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning x is entirely to the west of z.
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) are bounded above by \(\inf_y(y)\).

The y-axis relation between x and z depends on the relative positions of \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\):
1. If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then x is entirely below the bounding box of z, resulting in **SW**.
2. If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) and additionally \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) (so x is within the vertical bounds of z's bounding box), then the relation is **W**.

Both scenarios are possible under the given constraints, as verified by examples:
- **SW** example:  
  - y: bounding box \([1, 3] \times [2, 4]\)  
  - x: \([1.5, 2.5] \times [0, 1.5]\) (satisfies x S y, \(\sup_y(x) = 1.5 \leq 2\))  
  - z: \([4, 6] \times [2, 5]\) (satisfies y W z, \(\inf_y(z) = 2\), and \(\sup_y(x) = 1.5 \leq 2\))  
  - x is SW of z.
- **W** example:  
  - y: bounding box \([1, 3] \times [2, 4]\)  
  - x: \([1.5, 2.5] \times [0.6, 1.5]\) (satisfies x S y, \(\sup_y(x) = 1.5 \leq 2\))  
  - z: \([4, 6] \times [0.5, 5]\) (satisfies y W z, \(\inf_y(z) = 0.5\), and \(\inf_y(x) = 0.6 \geq 0.5\))  
  - x is W of z.

No other relations are possible because:
- x must be west of z (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), ruling out N, NE, E, SE, S, B.
- NW requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), making NW impossible.

Thus, the possible relations are **W** and **SW**.

**Answer: W SW**
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SE (South East) and E (East).

- **SE (South East)** is possible when \(x\) is completely below and to the right of \(z\), with no vertical or horizontal overlap in their bounding boxes.
- **E (East)** is possible when \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically contained within the y-range of \(z\)'s bounding box.

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible due to the constraints:
- Horizontally, \(x\) must be to the right of \(z\) (since \(y\) is east of \(z\) and \(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)).
- Vertically, \(x\) is below \(y\), and \(y\) is vertically within \(z\), but \(x\) may or may not be below \(z\) entirely or vertically contained.

Thus, the possible relations are SE and E.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) S \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (top of \(x\) is at or below bottom of \(y\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box).

- \(y\) S \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (top of \(y\) is at or below bottom of \(z\)),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (\(y\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box).

Combining these:
- Vertical relation: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontal relation: 
  - From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\); from \(x\) S \(y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\); from \(y\) S \(z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- Therefore, \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) S \(z\). No other relation (e.g., SW, SE, B) holds because:
- SW/SE require \(x\) to be strictly left/right of \(z\), but \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).
- B requires \(z\) to fully contain \(x\) vertically, which is not necessarily true (e.g., \(x\) could extend below \(z\)'s bottom, but here \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).

Thus, the only possible relation is S.

**Answer: S**
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the spatial constraints.

- From \(x\) S \(y\):
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\)).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(y\)).

- From \(y\) NW \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\)).
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(y\)).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\), as \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Given that \(x\) is left of \(z\), the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are limited to those where \(x\) is west of \(z\): specifically, SW, W, or NW, depending on the vertical alignment.

- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(x\) is below \(z\). For example, if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **W (West)**: Possible if \(z\) is vertically within the bounding box of \(x\). For example, if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **NW (North West)**: Possible if \(x\) is above \(z\). For example, if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Relations such as N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are impossible because:
- \(x\) is left of \(z\), so east relations (E, NE, SE) are excluded.
- \(x\) and \(z\) are both below \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other do not support north (N) or south (S) relations directly without horizontal alignment, which is not present.
- B (bounding box containment) is not possible due to the horizontal separation.

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \boxed{\text{W}} \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

### Explanation:
- From x S y:  
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)  
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is within the x-range of y)  

- From y SW z:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is southwest of z)  

Combining these:  
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) imply supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  

The conditions supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z) satisfy the definition of x SW z.  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) is possible, as they require additional conditions (e.g., x-range containment for S or W) that are not met due to the relative positions enforced by the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.

**Final Answer: SW**
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z must be derived from the definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

- x S y implies:
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within the x-range of y)

- y SE z implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)

Combining these:

- From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), it follows that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is south of z).
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is west of x).

Therefore:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) indicates that z is entirely to the west of x.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) indicates that x is entirely to the south of z.

This satisfies the definition of SE for x relative to z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (east condition, with z as reference)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (south condition)

No other cardinal direction relation or B (bounding box) is possible, as the constraints force x to be strictly southeast of z. For example:
- S would require x to be within the x-range of z, but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) prevents this.
- E would require z to be within the y-range of x, but supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies infy(z) > infy(x), which violates the infy(z) ≤ infy(x) condition for E.
- Similarly, other directions like SW, W, NW, N, NE, or B do not hold due to the positional constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

**Final Answer: SE**
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  

Combining these constraints:  
1. \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\) and \(x\) S \(y\)).  
2. Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is east of \(z\) horizontally. The vertical relation depends on possible configurations:  

- **If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**:  
  \(x\) is north and east of \(z\) → \(x\) **NE** \(z\).  
- **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:  
  \(x\) is south and east of \(z\) → \(x\) **SE** \(z\).  
- **If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**:  
  \(x\) is east of \(z\) with vertical containment → \(x\) **E** \(z\).  

These are the only possible relations that satisfy the constraints. Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are incompatible due to the horizontal separation \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and the vertical constraints.  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, SE, E**.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B (bounding box) of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S and B.

### Reasoning:
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

#### Horizontal Constraints:
- Combining the inequalities: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- This means \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(z\) (i.e., the x-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\)).

#### Vertical Constraints:
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), implying \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) always holds.
- However, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so the relative positions of \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) depend on the specific values:
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) S \(z\) holds because \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and the horizontal constraints satisfy the S relation.
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) B \(z\) holds because \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), and the horizontal constraints are satisfied.
- The relation N (North) is impossible because \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) cannot hold for 2D regions with positive area.
- Relations requiring horizontal misalignment (e.g., E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) are impossible due to the horizontal containment.

#### Conclusion:
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S and B, depending on the vertical positioning:
- S is possible when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- B is possible when \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations are S and B.

**Final Answer: S, B**
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z must be determined based on the cardinal direction relation definitions.

- x NW y implies:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is strictly left of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (x is strictly above y)

- y N z implies:
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  (z is strictly below y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(z)  (z starts at or to the right of y's left edge)
  - supx(z) ≤ supx(y)  (z ends at or to the left of y's right edge)

From these, derive the relation between x and z:

1. **Vertical direction (y-coordinates):**
   - From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - Combining: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - This means z is strictly below x.

2. **Horizontal direction (x-coordinates):**
   - From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - From y N z: infx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - Combining: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - This means x is strictly left of z.

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of x being NW of z (i.e., x NW z).

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:
- **N**: Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which holds) but also infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). However, infx(z) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) ≥ infx(x), and since regions have area, infx(z) > infx(x), violating infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- **NE**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But supx(z) ≥ infx(z) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) ≥ infx(x), so supx(z) > infx(x), violating supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- **E**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is contradicted as above.
- **SE**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But supy(x) ≥ infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(z) ≥ infy(z), so supy(x) > infy(z) if regions have area, violating supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- **S**: Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but supy(x) ≥ infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(z) ≥ infy(z), so supy(x) > infy(z), violating the condition.
- **SW**: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which holds) but also supy(x) ≤ infy(z). However, supy(x) ≥ infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(z) ≥ infy(z), so supy(x) > infy(z), violating supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- **W**: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which holds) but also infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z) would require supy(z) = supy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x), implying supy(x) ≤ infy(x), which is impossible for regions with area.
- **B**: Requires the bounding box of z to contain that of x, but x is left and above z, so not possible.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

**Answer:** NW
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely to the west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is entirely to the south of x, so x is north of y)

- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely to the west of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is vertically contained within z)

From these:
- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\):**  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is west of \(z\), limiting possible relations to W, NW, or SW.

- **Vertical analysis:**
  - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  - Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

This implies:
- The entire \(y\) is below \(x\) and vertically within \(z\).
- The bottom of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\), and the top of \(z\) is at or above the top of \(y\).

**Possible vertical scenarios for \(x\) and \(z\):**
1. **If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\):**  
   The entire \(z\) is below \(x\) (since \(z\)'s top is at or below \(x\)'s bottom). With \(x\) west of \(z\), this matches the **NW** relation:  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (west)  
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (north)  
   *Example: \(z\) vertically below \(x\).*

2. **If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\):**  
   \(z\) extends above \(x\)'s bottom, but \(x\)'s top is at or below \(z\)'s top. With \(x\) west of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\), this matches the **W** relation:  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (west)  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment)  
   *Example: \(x\) vertically within \(z\)'s span, with \(x\) west of \(z\).*

**Excluded relations:**
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) only if vertical spans degenerate to a point, which is impossible for regions in REG. Thus, SW is impossible.
- Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are excluded because \(x\) is west of \(z\).

**Conclusion:**  
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW** and **W**. These cover scenarios where \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (NW) or \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\) (W), both consistent with the given constraints.

**Answer: NW, W**
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is entirely below x)
  
- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is entirely left of y)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (z is vertically within y)

Combining these:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is entirely below x).

Possible horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **If \(x\) is left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)):**
   - Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - This matches \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **If \(z\) is left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)):**
   - Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - This matches \(x\) NE \(z\).

3. **If \(x\) and \(z\) overlap horizontally (neither entirely left of the other), but \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)):**
   - Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - This matches \(x\) N \(z\).

Other overlap scenarios (e.g., partial overlap without containment) do not satisfy any of the defined relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) under the given constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, NE, and N.

**Answer: NW, NE, N**
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely west and north of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is S of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely south of \(z\), and the x-projection of \(y\) is contained within that of \(z\).

Given these constraints, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the relative positions:

- **B (bounding box)**: Possible if the bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([4,5] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([3,8] \times [2.5,5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) B \(z\).

- **N (North)**: Possible if \(z\) is south of \(x\) and the x-projection of \(x\) is contained in \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([3,4] \times [3,5]\), \(z\): \([2,8] \times [4,5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) N \(z\).

- **NW (North West)**: Possible if \(x\) is west and north of \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([4,6] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([1,3] \times [3,5]\), \(z\): \([3,7] \times [2,3]\).  
  Here, \(x\) NW \(z\).

- **W (West)**: Possible if \(x\) is west of \(z\) and the y-projection of \(x\) is contained in \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([3,4] \times [3,5]\), \(z\): \([4.5,8] \times [2,6]\).  
  Here, \(x\) W \(z\).

- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(x\) is west and south of \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([3,4] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([4.5,8] \times [4.5,5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) SW \(z\).

- **S (South)**: Possible if \(x\) is south of \(z\) and the x-projection of \(x\) is contained in \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([3,4] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([2,8] \times [4,5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) S \(z\).

The relations NE, E, and SE are impossible:  
- **NE** requires \(z\) west and south of \(x\), but \(z\) must extend east to at least \(\sup_x(y) \geq 5\), while \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq 5\), leading to contradiction.  
- **E** requires \(z\) west of \(x\), but \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq 5\) and \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq 5\), again contradicting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
- **SE** similarly requires \(z\) west and above \(x\), facing the same contradiction as NE and E.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, NW, W, SW, S**.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the following conditions hold based on the definition of NW:

- \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

These combined conditions, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), exactly define the NW relation. Therefore, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is NW.

\boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW. This is derived from the inequalities defining the relations:

- From x NW y: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- From y SW z: \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning x is west of z.
- The y-coordinate relation between x and z can vary:
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then x is north of z, resulting in x NW z.
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then x is south of z, resulting in x SW z.
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then x is west of z with vertical alignment, resulting in x W z.

All three relations (NW, W, SW) are possible depending on the specific positions of the regions, and no other relations are possible due to the west constraint from the x-coordinate inequality.

**Possible relations:** NW, W, SW
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the constraints are:

- \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These imply:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are entirely to the left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\): \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\).

However, there are no direct constraints between \(x\) and \(z\) on their horizontal or vertical positions relative to each other. The horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can be arranged in any order (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\), \(z\) left of \(x\), or overlapping), and similarly for vertical positions (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\), \(z\) above \(x\), or overlapping). Thus, any cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is possible, as all arrangements can be realized while satisfying the given constraints with \(y\).

The possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:  
**N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B**
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box constraints.

- From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(x\) is to the left and above \(y\).
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). This means \(z\) is to the left and below \(y\).

Combining these:
- Vertically, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is below \(x\).
- Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\), as \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their horizontal alignment:
- If \(x\) is strictly to the left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
- If \(z\) is strictly to the left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- If \(z\) contains \(x\) horizontally (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), and given \(z\) is below \(x\), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).

Other relations are impossible because:
- \(z\) is below \(x\), so relations like S, SE, SW cannot hold.
- The vertical separation rules out E, W, and B.
- There is no scenario where \(x\) is directly south of \(z\) or contained within \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are NW, N, and NE.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the constraints on their bounding boxes. Through case analysis and example constructions, the following relations are achievable:

- **NW (North West)**: When \(x\) is entirely left and above \(z\).  
  Example: \(x\)’s bounding box ends before \(z\)’s starts on the x-axis, and \(z\)’s bounding box ends before \(x\)’s starts on the y-axis.
- **W (West)**: When \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) and vertically overlaps or is contained within \(z\)’s y-bounds.  
  Example: \(x\)’s x-interval ends before \(z\)’s starts, while \(z\)’s y-interval overlaps or contains \(x\)’s y-interval.
- **N (North)**: When \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) and \(x\)’s x-interval is contained within \(z\)’s x-interval.  
  Example: \(z\)’s y-max is at or below \(x\)’s y-min, and \(x\)’s x-interval is within \(z\)’s.
- **B (Bounding box)**: When \(x\)’s bounding box is contained within \(z\)’s.  
  Example: All boundaries of \(x\) are inside or on the boundaries of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: When \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) and \(x\)’s x-interval is contained within \(z\)’s x-interval.  
  Example: \(x\)’s y-max is at or below \(z\)’s y-min, and \(x\)’s x-interval is within \(z\)’s.

Other relations (NE, SE, E, SW) are not possible due to inherent constraints from the given relations. For instance:
- **NE, SE, E** require \(x\) to be right of \(z\), but \(x\) is left of \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), making \(x\) left-aligned.
- **SW** requires \(x\) below and left of \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), preventing \(x\) from being below \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are **NW, W, N, B, S**.

**Final Answer**  
NW, W, N, B, S
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).

The constraints imply:
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), but the vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) relative to each other can vary.

Possible vertical relationships:
1. If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), then \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) (NW relation).
2. If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is southwest of \(z\) (SW relation).
3. If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is west of \(z\) (W relation).

These cases are achievable under the constraints, while other relations (e.g., N, S, E) are not possible due to the west constraint \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, SW, and W.

**Final Answer: NW, SW, W**
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining the horizontal conditions:
\[
\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z),
\]
so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is to the west of \(z\) (i.e., the horizontal relation is W, NW, or SW).

For the vertical conditions:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) are both \(\leq \inf_y(y)\).

Two cases arise based on the comparison of \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**  
   Then \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which satisfies the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\).

2. **Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)**  
   Here, \(\inf_y(x)\) (the infimum of \(y\)-coordinates of \(x\)) must be considered:
   - **Subcase 2a: \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\)**  
     Then \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). With \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) W \(z\).
   - **Subcase 2b: \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\)**  
     This configuration does not fit any cardinal direction relation (e.g., SW requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), violated here; W requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), violated; NW requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), impossible since \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

Additionally, the equality case \(\sup_x(x) = \inf_x(z)\) was considered but ruled out for two-dimensional regions in REG, as they must have positive area, making bounding box degeneracies (like vertical lines) impossible.

Thus, the only possible relations are SW and W, corresponding to Case 1 and Subcase 2a, respectively.

**Possible relations: SW, W**
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are determined by the relative positions derived from the definitions.

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) E \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\). Also, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), with \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) implying \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y)\).

The relations N, NE, and NW are impossible because they require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\), violating the condition.

The other relations are possible under specific configurations:
- **SW**: \(x\) can be southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) and \(z\) positioned such that \(x\) is left and below \(z\)).
- **S**: \(x\) can be south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) below \(z\) with \(z\)'s x-projection containing \(x\)'s).
- **SE**: \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right and below \(z\)).
- **E**: \(x\) can be east of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) left of \(x\) with vertical containment).
- **W**: \(x\) can be west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\) with vertical containment).
- **B**: \(x\) can have its bounding box contained in \(z\)'s (e.g., full containment in both directions).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, SE, E, W, and B.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (vertically, \(x\) is below \(z\)).
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), so \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of or at \(\text{inf}_x(y)\)).

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{sup}_x(x)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z)\):
1. If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\):
   - Then \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) horizontally, and with \(x\) below \(z\), this satisfies SW: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) SW \(z\) is possible.
2. If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\) (and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\)):
   - Additionally, if \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (so \(z\)'s left bound is left of or equal to \(x\)'s left bound), and since \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)), we have \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\). With \(x\) below \(z\), this satisfies S: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) S \(z\) is possible.

Other relations (like SE, W, etc.) are not possible because:
- \(x\) cannot be east of \(z\) since \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), so \(x\) is not right of \(z\).
- Vertical relations (N, NE, NW) are invalid as \(x\) is below \(z\).
- B (bounding box) requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s box vertically, but \(x\) is below, not within.
- In cases where \(\text{inf}_x(x) < \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\), no basic relation fits (e.g., not S due to horizontal left bound, not SW due to horizontal overlap), but such configurations still allow the possibilities of SW and S in other cases.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and S.

**Answer: SW, S**
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the following relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:

- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the left and below \(z\).  
  This is possible because \(x\) is left of \(y\) and below \(y\), while \(y\) is left of \(z\) and above \(z\). Thus, \(x\) can be positioned to the left and below \(z\).

- **W (West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\), with the vertical extent of \(x\) contained within that of \(z\).  
  This is possible if \(z\) vertically spans an interval that includes the vertical interval of \(x\), while \(x\) remains left of \(z\).

- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the left and above \(z\).  
  This is possible because \(x\) is below \(y\), but \(z\) is below \(y\), allowing \(x\) to be positioned above \(z\) while both are left-aligned relative to the horizontal axis.

These relations satisfy the bounding box constraints derived from the given conditions:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) ensures \(x\) is left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), but their relative vertical positions can vary to allow SW, W, or NW.

Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, B) are not possible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the lack of vertical containment or alignment required by those relations.

Thus, the possible relations are **SW, W, NW**.
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is SW.

### Explanation:
- The SW relation is defined as: \(a\) SW \(b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(a) \leq \inf_y(b)\).
- From \(x\) SW \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) SW \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Combining the inequalities:  
  - For the x-coordinates: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  - For the y-coordinates: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
- These satisfy the conditions for \(x\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, B) are possible, as they require additional conditions that are not met here (e.g., alignment in one direction or containment of bounding boxes).

**Answer: SW**
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their relative positions in the x-direction, while \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) in the y-direction (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)). The possible cases are:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:  
   This satisfies the condition for \(x\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   Example: \(x\) [1, 2] in x, \(z\) [3, 4] in x.

2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   This satisfies the condition for \(x\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   Example: \(z\) [1, 2] in x, \(x\) [3, 4] in x.

3. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   This satisfies the condition for \(x\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Example: \(z\) [5, 8] in x, \(x\) [6, 7] in x.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S, SE
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The constraints imply:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

No additional constraints are imposed on the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, by adjusting the bounding boxes of \(x\) and \(z\) within these constraints, any cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is possible:

- **N (North)**: \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
- **NE (North East)**: \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\).
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) is below and to the right of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\).
- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\).

Thus, all cardinal direction relations are possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Possible relations**: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints and examples below:

- **SW (South West)**: Example:  
  \(z\): bounding box \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
  \(y\): bounding box \([0, 1] \times [0, 1]\),  
  \(x\): bounding box \([-2, -1] \times [-2, -1]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is entirely left and below \(z\), satisfying SW:  
  \(\sup_x(x) = -1 \leq \inf_x(z) = 0\) and \(\sup_y(x) = -1 \leq \inf_y(z) = 0\).

- **S (South)**: Example:  
  \(z\): bounding box \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
  \(y\): bounding box \([1, 2] \times [3, 4]\),  
  \(x\): bounding box \([0, 1] \times [-2, -1]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s x-bounds, satisfying S:  
  \(\sup_y(x) = -1 \leq \inf_y(z) = 0\), \(\inf_x(z) = 0 \leq \inf_x(x) = 0\), and \(\sup_x(x) = 1 \leq \sup_x(z) = 10\).

- **W (West)**: Example:  
  \(z\): bounding box \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
  \(y\): bounding box \([5, 6] \times [5, 6]\),  
  \(x\): bounding box \([-2, -1] \times [3, 4]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically aligned within \(z\)'s y-bounds, satisfying W:  
  \(\sup_x(x) = -1 \leq \inf_x(z) = 0\), \(\inf_y(z) = 0 \leq \inf_y(x) = 3\), and \(\sup_y(x) = 4 \leq \sup_y(z) = 10\).

- **B (Bounding box)**: Example:  
  \(z\): bounding box \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
  \(y\): bounding box \([5, 6] \times [5, 6]\),  
  \(x\): bounding box \([4, 4.5] \times [4, 4.5]\).  
  Here, \(x\)'s bounding box is entirely within \(z\)'s, satisfying B:  
  \(\inf_x(z) = 0 \leq \inf_x(x) = 4\), \(\sup_x(x) = 4.5 \leq \sup_x(z) = 10\), \(\inf_y(z) = 0 \leq \inf_y(x) = 4\), and \(\sup_y(x) = 4.5 \leq \sup_y(z) = 10\).

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW) are impossible due to contradictions in the constraints:
- **N, NE, NW**: Require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is bounded by \(z\)'s top, forcing \(x\) below \(z\).
- **E, SE**: Require \(x\) right of \(z\), but \(x\) is left of \(y\) and \(y\) is bounded by \(z\)'s right, forcing \(x\) left or overlapping horizontally.

Thus, the possible relations are **SW, S, W, B**.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

From these:
- \(y\) is above \(z\) and \(x\) is below \(y\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\).
- \(y\) is left of \(x\) (since SE requires \(y\) entirely left of \(x\)).
- \(z\) horizontally spans at least the width of \(y\) (since \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Horizontal alignment**:
   - **Case A**: \(\text{sup}_x(z) < \text{inf}_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) left of \(x\)).
     - **NW**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (\(z\) above \(x\)).
     - **SW**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (\(z\) below \(x\)).
     - **W**: If \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{sup}_y(x)\) (\(z\) vertically within \(x\)'s span).
   - **Case B**: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \geq \text{sup}_x(x)\) (\(z\) horizontally covers \(x\)).
     - **B**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (\(z\) vertically contains \(x\)).
     - **N**: If \(\text{inf}_x(z) = \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (\(z\) above \(x\) with aligned left boundaries).
     - **S**: If \(\text{inf}_x(z) = \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (\(z\) below \(x\) with aligned left boundaries).

### Excluded relations:
- **E**, **NE**, **SE**: Require \(z\) east of \(x\), but constraints place \(z\) west or covering \(x\) horizontally.
- **Partial horizontal overlap** (e.g., \(\text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z) < \text{sup}_x(x)\)) does not fit any defined relation.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, S, NW, SW, W**.
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x \text{ SE } y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is to the right of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)

- \(y \text{ W } z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is to the left of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z covers y vertically)

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by considering the relative positions in the x and y axes:

1. **B (bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\). This occurs when there is overlap in both axes and \(x\) is entirely within \(z\)'s bounding box.
2. **S (South)**: \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) and horizontally contained within \(z\)'s x-span.
3. **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\) (no overlap in either axis).
4. **W (West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-span.
5. **E (East)**: \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-span.
6. **SE (South East)**: \(x\) is below and to the right of \(z\) (no overlap in either axis).

These relations are achievable under the given constraints:
- **B** and **S** occur when there is horizontal overlap (x-axis intervals intersect), with **B** for vertical overlap and **S** if \(x\) is below \(z\).
- **SW**, **W**, **E**, and **SE** occur with no horizontal overlap, depending on whether \(x\) is left or right of \(z\) and vertically below or contained.

The relations **N (North)**, **NE (North East)**, and **NW (North West)** are impossible because \(x\) is always below \(y\) (from \(x \text{ SE } y\)) and \(z\) covers \(y\) vertically, making it impossible for \(x\) to be above \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are **B, S, SW, W, E, SE**.

**Answer: B, S, SW, W, E, SE**
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are SE (Southeast) or E (East).

- **SE (Southeast) is possible**: This occurs when \(x\) is sufficiently south of \(z\), specifically when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). For example, if \(y\) is positioned such that its southern edge aligns with or is above the southern edge of \(z\), and \(x\) is south of \(y\), then \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\).
  
- **E (East) is possible**: This occurs when \(x\) is directly east of \(z\) with vertical containment, specifically when \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (the latter always holds given the constraints). For example, if \(x\) is not too far south relative to \(z\), such that it is vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-range, then \(x\) can be east of \(z\).

The relation NE (Northeast) is impossible because it would require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which contradicts the constraints derived from \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\) (as regions have positive area, making zero-height bounding boxes invalid). Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are not possible due to the eastward offset between \(x\) and \(z\) and the vertical constraints.

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SE and E.

\boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}}
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is strictly east of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is strictly south of y)  

- Region \(y\) is S of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is strictly south of z)  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y's x-range is contained within z's x-range)  

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Vertical relation (y-coordinate):**  
   From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This means \(x\) is south of \(z\) vertically. Thus, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be one of S, SW, or SE (south row relations).  

2. **Horizontal relation (x-coordinate):**  
   From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - **Case 1: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
     This implies \(x\) is strictly east of \(z\) (since \(z\)'s right edge is left of \(x\)'s left edge).  
     With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (south), the relation is SE.  
   - **Case 2: \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\)**  
     This implies \(x\)'s x-range overlaps or is contained within \(z\)'s x-range. However, from \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and the requirement that the entire bounding box of \(x\) must lie in one tile relative to \(z\), \(x\) must be horizontally contained within \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) to avoid spanning multiple tiles (since SW and SE are excluded by the inequalities).  
     With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), the relation is S.  

### Possible relations:
- **SE** occurs in Case 1 (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).  
- **S** occurs in Case 2 (\(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
No other relations (like SW, NE, etc.) are possible due to the vertical constraint and horizontal chain of inequalities.  

**Answer: S, SE**
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The constraints derived are:
1. \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\)
2. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
3. \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
4. \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

These constraints allow for various spatial arrangements between \(x\) and \(z\). By adjusting the exact positions (within the constraints), all nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:

- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) above \(z\), horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s span.
- **NE**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) east and north of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) is east of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) directly east of \(z\), vertically contained.
- **SE**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) east and south of \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) below \(z\), horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s span.
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) west and south of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) directly west of \(z\), vertically contained.
- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) west and north of \(z\).
- **B**: \(x\) is in the bounding box of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) entirely contained within \(z\)'s minimum bounding box.

Thus, every relation is achievable with appropriate positioning satisfying the initial constraints. The possible relations are: **N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B**.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South), SE (South East), and SW (South West).

- **S (South)**: This is possible when x is directly below z and the bounding box of x is within the x-range of z. For example, with appropriate positioning, the inequalities satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
  
- **SE (South East)**: This is possible when x is below and to the right of z. For example, with appropriate positioning, the inequalities satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  
- **SW (South West)**: This is possible when x is below and to the left of z. For example, with appropriate positioning, the inequalities satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

The y-direction constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (derived from x SE y and y SW z) ensures that x is always below z, making relations where x is not south of z (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) impossible. Specifically:
- N, NE, and NW require x to be north of z, which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- E and W require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is not satisfied as infy(z) > infy(x) due to the regions having positive area.
- B requires the bounding box of z to contain that of x in both dimensions, but infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not satisfied.

Thus, only S, SE, and SW are possible.

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}}
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is SE. This is determined by the transitivity of the SE relation:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely to the east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely to the south of y)
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is entirely to the east of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely to the south of z)

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely to the east of z).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is entirely to the south of z).

These conditions satisfy the definition of SE for \(x\) relative to \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible under the given constraints and the requirement that regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (ensuring positive area and non-degenerate bounding boxes).

Thus, the only possible relation is SE.

**Answer:** SE
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\), which implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\))

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), which implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(y\))

Combining these:
- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\), satisfying the horizontal condition for relations E, SE, and NE.

- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  The vertical alignment between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary, leading to three cases:
    1. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).  
    2. **NE (North East)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(x\)).  
    3. **E (East)**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., the vertical span of \(x\) is contained within \(z\)).  

These cases are mutually possible under the constraints, and no other relations (N, S, NW, W, SW, B) satisfy the horizontal condition \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **E, SE, NE**.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:

- **B (bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(z\) contains the bounding box of \(x\). This is possible if \(x\) lies entirely within the bounding box of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) and vertically within the bounding box of \(z\). This occurs when \(x\) is horizontally to the right of \(z\) and vertically contained.
- **S (South)**: \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) and horizontally within the bounding box of \(z\). This happens when \(x\) is vertically below \(z\) and horizontally contained.
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) is entirely to the right and below \(z\). This requires \(x\) to be both horizontally to the right and vertically below \(z\).

These relations are derived from the constraints:
- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies \(x\) is to the right and below \(y\).
- \(y\) B \(z\) implies \(y\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\).
- The spatial relationships between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on how the bounding boxes align, leading to the possible outcomes B, E, S, and SE.

Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW) are not possible due to the relative positions enforced by SE and B (e.g., \(x\) cannot be above or to the left of \(z\)).

**Final Answer: B, E, S, SE**
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are N and NE.

- **N (North)**: This occurs when the bounding box of \(x\) is directly above and within the x-range of \(z\)'s bounding box. Specifically, this requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). These conditions can be satisfied based on the given relations and the properties of the regions.
- **NE (North East)**: This occurs when \(x\) is completely to the northeast of \(z\), meaning no overlap in the x or y directions. Specifically, this requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). These conditions can also be satisfied based on the given relations.

Other relations (such as S, SW, W, NW, E, SE, or B) are not possible because:
- \(x\) must be north of \(z\) due to the y-coordinate inequalities derived from \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) N \(z\), specifically \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(x\) cannot be west of \(z\) because \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) from the relations, ruling out W and NW.
- \(x\) cannot be south, southeast, or directly east because of the north positioning, and containment (B) is not possible due to the directional constraints.

Thus, the only possible relations are N and NE.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}}
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) starts to the east of \(y\)'s right boundary),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) starts above \(y\)'s top boundary).
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(z\) starts to the east of \(y\)'s right boundary),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds).

Combining these:
1. **Vertical Position**: Since \(x\) is above \(y\) (\(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\)) and \(y\) is vertically contained in \(z\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), \(x\) is above \(y\) and thus above part of \(z\). However, \(z\) may extend above \(y\), leading to two cases:
   - **Vertical non-overlap**: If \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely above \(z\), enabling pure vertical or diagonal relations:
     - **N**: If \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
     - **NE**: If \(z\) is to the west of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and vertically separated.
     - **NW**: If \(x\) is to the west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) and vertically separated.
   - **Vertical overlap**: If \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) and \(z\) overlap vertically, but \(x\) remains above \(y\) and within \(z\)'s vertical extent if fully contained (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). Horizontal positioning determines:
     - **W**: If \(x\) is to the west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) and vertically contained.
     - **E**: If \(z\) is to the west of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and vertically contained.
     - **B**: If \(x\) is horizontally and vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

Relations like S, SW, SE are impossible because \(x\) is always above \(y\) (hence cannot be below \(z\)). After verifying with example configurations (e.g., \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), adjusting \(x\) and \(z\) accordingly), the possible relations are **N, NE, NW, W, E, B**.

**Answer**: N, NE, NW, W, E, B
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are NE (North East) and E (East).

- **NE (North East)**: This occurs when \(z\) is completely below and to the left of \(x\). Specifically, from the relations:
  - \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - \(y\) E \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  Combining these, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (so \(z\) is left of \(x\)) and if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (so \(z\) is below \(x\)), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).

- **E (East)**: This occurs when \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\). From the relations:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) holds (as derived).
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment), and given that \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) from the relations, vertical containment can hold if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Then \(x\) is E of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible because:
- \(z\) is always to the left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), ruling out W, SW, NW, and S.
- Vertical relations do not allow for SE (requires \(x\) below \(z\), but \(y\) is below \(x\) and within \(z\) vertically, so \(x\) cannot be below \(z\)), N (requires \(z\) completely below \(x\), but vertical containment may prevent this), or B (requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s, but \(z\) is left of \(x\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE and E.

\boxed{\text{NE}} \boxed{\text{E}}
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box constraints and the relative positions based on the given relations.

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies that \(x\) is to the northeast of \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is to the right of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is above y)

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies that \(y\) is to the south of \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z's x-interval contains y's x-interval)

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the relative horizontal and vertical positions of their bounding boxes. The constraints lead to the following possible relations:

- **NE (Northeast)**: Possible if \(z\) is to the left and below \(x\).
- **E (East)**: Possible if \(z\) is directly to the left of \(x\) with vertical containment of \(x\)'s y-interval by \(z\)'s y-interval.
- **SE (Southeast)**: Possible if \(z\) is to the left and above \(x\).
- **N (North)**: Possible if there is horizontal overlap and \(z\) is below \(x\) with \(x\)'s x-interval contained within \(z\)'s x-interval.
- **S (South)**: Possible if there is horizontal overlap and \(x\) is below \(z\) with \(x\)'s x-interval contained within \(z\)'s x-interval.
- **B (Bounding box)**: Possible if \(x\)'s bounding box is contained within \(z\)'s bounding box, including both x and y intervals.

The relations NW, W, and SW are not possible because the constraints \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply that \(x\) cannot be to the west of \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) is impossible).

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are NE, E, SE, N, S, and B.

\boxed{\text{NE}} \boxed{\text{E}} \boxed{\text{SE}} \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{S}} \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (x is north of y)

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (y is west of z)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (z is south of y)

From these, the vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as:
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This satisfies the vertical condition for relations where \(x\) is north of \(z\) (i.e., N, NE, NW).

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their bounding boxes:
- If \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) N \(z\).
- If \(z\) is entirely west of \(x\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)), then \(x\) NE \(z\).
- If \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) NW \(z\).

No other relations are possible because:
- B, S, SE, SW, E, W require incompatible vertical alignments (e.g., \(x\) south of \(z\) or vertical containment), which contradict \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, and NW.

**Answer: N, NE, NW**
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B. This is because the relations are defined solely based on the minimum bounding boxes of the regions, and the given constraints allow for various relative positions between \(x\) and \(z\) depending on their sizes and placements relative to \(y\).

- The NE relation from \(x\) to \(y\) implies that \(y\)'s bounding box is entirely to the southwest of \(x\)'s bounding box.
- The SW relation from \(y\) to \(z\) implies that \(y\)'s bounding box is entirely to the southwest of \(z\)'s bounding box.

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned to the northeast of \(y\), but their exact positions and sizes relative to each other can vary:
- If \(x\) is closer to \(y\) and \(z\) is farther northeast, \(x\) could be SW of \(z\).
- If \(z\) is closer to \(y\) and \(x\) is farther northeast, \(x\) could be NE of \(z\).
- Other configurations can satisfy relations such as N, E, SE, S, W, NW, or B, depending on the alignment and containment of their bounding boxes.

No constraints from the given relations prevent any of the cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\), making all nine relations possible.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. This is determined by the relative positions derived from the bounding box constraints:

- From x NE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), meaning x is east and north of y.
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), meaning y is east and south of z.

Combining these:
- The x-direction constraints (supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) imply supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so x is east of z.
- The y-direction constraints (supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) allow for different vertical relationships between x and z, leading to three possibilities:
  - **NE**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), x is north and east of z.
  - **E**: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x is directly east of z with vertical overlap.
  - **SE**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is south and east of z.

Other relations (N, S, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the east constraint and the lack of bounding box containment or other directional conflicts.

Thus, the possible relations are NE, E, and SE.

\boxed{\text{NE}} \boxed{\text{E}} \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, the relation between x and z must be analyzed based on the cardinal direction definitions.

- x NE y implies:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

- y NE z implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)

Combining these:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of z).
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of z).

Thus, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition for x NE z. No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible under these conditions, as the inequalities strictly position x to the northeast of z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

**Final Answer**  
NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:

- **B** (bounding box): If \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(z\).  
  Example: \(z = [0, 4] \times [0, 4]\), \(y = [1, 2] \times [1, 2]\), \(x = [2.5, 3.5] \times [2.5, 3.5]\).
- **N** (North): If \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) and within its horizontal bounds.  
  Example: \(z = [0, 4] \times [0, 4]\), \(y = [1, 2] \times [1, 2]\), \(x = [2.5, 3.5] \times [5, 6]\).
- **NE** (North East): If \(x\) is entirely above and to the right of \(z\).  
  Example: \(z = [0, 4] \times [0, 4]\), \(y = [1, 2] \times [1, 2]\), \(x = [5, 6] \times [5, 6]\).
- **E** (East): If \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) and within its vertical bounds.  
  Example: \(z = [0, 4] \times [0, 4]\), \(y = [1, 2] \times [1, 2]\), \(x = [4, 6] \times [2.5, 3.5]\).

These relations satisfy the constraints derived from \(x \text{ NE } y\) and \(y \text{ B } z\), considering the bounding box interactions. Other relations (S, SW, W, NW, SE) are not possible due to contradictions with the given constraints, such as \(x\) being to the right and above \(y\) (from NE), and \(y\) being contained within \(z\) (from B).

**Possible relations**: B, N, NE, E.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies that the bounding box of \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\). Thus:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ N } z\) implies that \(y\) is north of \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **Y-axis constraints**:
   - From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

2. **X-axis constraints**:
   - From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
   - Chaining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

The conditions \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ N } z\). 

Verifying other relations:
- **NE, NW, E, W, SE, SW**: Require specific horizontal alignments (e.g., \(x\) entirely east/west of \(z\)) that conflict with the x-axis constraints derived (since \(x\)'s x-range is within \(z\)'s, not to the side).
- **S, B**: Require \(y\)-axis conditions like \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which contradict \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (as \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\)).

Thus, the only possible relation is **N**.

**Answer: N**
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: Given that region x is B (bounding box) of region y and region y is W (West) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is W (West).

### Explanation:
- **x B y** implies that the bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of y:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (left edge of y is left of or equal to left edge of x),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (right edge of x is left of or equal to right edge of y),
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (bottom edge of y is below or equal to bottom edge of x),
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (top edge of x is below or equal to top edge of y).

- **y W z** implies that y is strictly to the west of z and vertically within z's vertical range:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (right edge of y is left of or equal to left edge of z),
  - \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (bottom edge of z is below or equal to bottom edge of y),
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (top edge of y is below or equal to top edge of z).

From these:
- Horizontally: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning x is entirely to the west of z.
- Vertically: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), so \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), meaning x is vertically within the range of z.

Thus, the relation between x and z satisfies the definition of W (West):
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\),
- \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\),
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., NW, SW, B, etc.) is possible because:
- The vertical containment rules out relations like NW or SW, which require misalignment (e.g., NW requires \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), which contradicts the vertical containment).
- B is impossible because x cannot be within z's bounding box due to the horizontal separation (x is west of z).

Therefore, the only possible relation is W.

**Final Answer: W**
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is in the B (bounding box) relation with region \(y\), and region \(y\) is in the E (East) relation with region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is E (East).

### Explanation:
- **x B y**: This means the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\). Specifically:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- **y E z**: This means \(y\) is directly east of \(z\), with the y-range of \(y\) contained within the y-range of \(z\). Specifically:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

From these, derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **x-direction**:
   - From \(y E z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(x B y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)

2. **y-direction**:
   - From \(y E z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(x B y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), thus \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - From \(x B y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
   - From \(y E z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), thus \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of the E relation between \(x\) and \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) is east of \(z\) with the y-range of \(x\) contained within the y-range of \(z\)).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, or B) is possible because:
- Relations like S, SE, or SW require \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) cannot hold for regions with area (as per REG, regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk).
- Relations like N, NE, or NW require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) cannot hold.
- Relations like W or SW require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) cannot hold.
- The B relation would require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x)\) may be greater than \(\sup_x(z)\), so B does not hold.

Thus, the only possible relation is E.

\boxed{\text{E}}
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S (South) of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as follows:

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) S \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as they require additional constraints (e.g., horizontal displacement or vertical reversal) that contradict the derived conditions.

Thus, the only possible relation is **S**.
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ NW } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining the horizontal bounds:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x \text{ B } y\))
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y \text{ NW } z\))
- Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)

Combining the vertical bounds:
- \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x \text{ B } y\))
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y \text{ NW } z\))
- Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ NW } z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- **W, SW, S, SE, E, NE, N, B** require additional conditions (e.g., horizontal or vertical alignment or overlap) that conflict with the derived inequalities. For example:
  - **W** requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\), violating \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) unless degenerate (not possible in REG).
  - **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\), violating \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) unless degenerate.

Thus, the only possible relation is \(x \text{ NW } z\).

**Answer: NW**
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is B of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the relations impose the following constraints:

- From \(x\) B \(y\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- From \(y\) SW \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) precisely define the SW relation between \(x\) and \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, B) is satisfied under these constraints, as they require additional or conflicting conditions (e.g., S requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which contradicts \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.

**Answer: SW**
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Based on the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ SE } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. From \(y \text{ SE } z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), leading to \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

2. From \(y \text{ SE } z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), leading to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ SE } z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z is entirely to the west of x)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is entirely to the south of z)

No other relations (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) satisfy both constraints simultaneously. For example:
- **S** requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) contradicts \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) unless equality holds, which would require degenerate regions (not allowed in REG).
- **E** requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), contradicting \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **B** requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). However, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) contradicts \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (as above), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) contradicts \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) due to the non-degenerate nature of regions in REG.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **SE**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) B \(y\) means the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) NE \(z\) means \(y\) is northeast of \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these:

1. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
2. From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
3. Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

Similarly for the y-axis:

1. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
2. From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
3. Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The relation \(x\) NE \(z\) is defined as:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Both conditions are satisfied, so \(x\) NE \(z\) holds.

No other relations are possible:
- \(x\) B \(z\) would require the bounding box of \(z\) to contain \(x\), but \(z\) is entirely left and below \(x\).
- \(x\) S, SW, W, NW, E, SE relations require \(x\) to be south, southwest, west, northwest, east, or southeast of \(z\), which contradict the positioning (e.g., \(x\) cannot be south of \(z\) because \(z\) is below \(x\)).
- \(x\) N would require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (which holds) but also \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which fails because \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\), implying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\), but equality would require degenerate bounding boxes, impossible for regions homeomorphic to a closed disk.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE (from \(x\) to \(z\)).

**Answer: NE**
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: The relation B (bounding box) is defined such that for regions \(a\) and \(b\), \(a \text{ B } b\) holds if and only if the minimum bounding box of \(a\) is contained within the minimum bounding box of \(b\). Specifically, this requires:
- \(\inf_x(b) \leq \inf_x(a)\)
- \(\sup_x(a) \leq \sup_x(b)\)
- \(\inf_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\)
- \(\sup_y(a) \leq \sup_y(b)\)

Given that region \(x\) is B of region \(y\) (\(x \text{ B } y\)) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\) (\(y \text{ B } z\)), the following inequalities hold:

From \(x \text{ B } y\):
1. \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
2. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
3. \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
4. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

From \(y \text{ B } z\):
5. \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
6. \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
7. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
8. \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From (5) and (1): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- From (2) and (6): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
- From (7) and (3): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- From (4) and (8): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

These combined inequalities satisfy the definition of \(x \text{ B } z\). Therefore, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be B. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW) can hold simultaneously under the given conditions, as they would violate the bounding box containment derived from the transitivity of the B relation.

Thus, the only possible relation is **B**.
