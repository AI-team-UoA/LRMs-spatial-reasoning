PROMPT: Let W and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relation between x and z is NW.

- x W y implies:  
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)  
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y contains x vertically)  

- y NW z implies:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)  
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y)  

Combining these:  
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is west of z)  
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) imply supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is south of x, so x is north of z)  

Thus, x is both west and north of z, satisfying the NW relation: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).  

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) are possible given the constraints, as they would violate the conditions derived from the given relations.
