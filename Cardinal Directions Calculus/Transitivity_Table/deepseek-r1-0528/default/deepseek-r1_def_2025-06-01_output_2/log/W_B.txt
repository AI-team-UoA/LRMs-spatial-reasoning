PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions that region \(x\) is W of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- From \(x\) W \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)  

- From \(y\) B \(z\):  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical direction**:  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so the vertical extent of \(x\) is contained within \(z\):  
    - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
    - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  

- **Horizontal direction**:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(\inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x)\) are \(\leq \inf_x(y)\).  

Possible cases for horizontal alignment:  
1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:  
   - This satisfies the condition for \(x\) W \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical, already true)  
   - Thus, \(x\) can be W of \(z\).  

2. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   - This satisfies the condition for \(x\) B \(z\):  
     - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical, already true)  
   - Note: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), ensuring horizontal containment.  
   - Thus, \(x\) can be B of \(z\).  

No other cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW) are possible, as they require conditions not satisfied by the vertical containment and horizontal constraints (e.g., NE requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which conflicts with \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x)\)).  

**Conclusion**: The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **W** and **B**.
