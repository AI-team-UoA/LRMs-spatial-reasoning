PROMPT: Let W and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From these:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the x-axis bounds:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of SW.
   - Thus, \(x\) can be SW of \(z\).

2. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)** (which implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)):
   - Additionally, if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then:
     - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
     - Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies the definition of S.
   - Thus, \(x\) can be S of \(z\) when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The case where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\) does not fit any atomic relation (e.g., not SW, S, or others), as \(x\) would span both west and south tiles relative to \(z\), which is not covered by the defined relations. Hence, only SW and S are possible.

**Possible relations**: S, SW
