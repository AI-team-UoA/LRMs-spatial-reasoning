PROMPT: Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is entirely below x)
  
- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is entirely left of y)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (z is vertically within y)

Combining these:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is entirely below x).

Possible horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **If \(x\) is left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)):**
   - Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - This matches \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **If \(z\) is left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)):**
   - Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - This matches \(x\) NE \(z\).

3. **If \(x\) and \(z\) overlap horizontally (neither entirely left of the other), but \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)):**
   - Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - This matches \(x\) N \(z\).

Other overlap scenarios (e.g., partial overlap without containment) do not satisfy any of the defined relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) under the given constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, NE, and N.

**Answer: NW, NE, N**
