PROMPT: Let SE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South), SE (South East), and SW (South West).

- **S (South)**: This is possible when x is directly below z and the bounding box of x is within the x-range of z. For example, with appropriate positioning, the inequalities satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
  
- **SE (South East)**: This is possible when x is below and to the right of z. For example, with appropriate positioning, the inequalities satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
  
- **SW (South West)**: This is possible when x is below and to the left of z. For example, with appropriate positioning, the inequalities satisfy supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

The y-direction constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (derived from x SE y and y SW z) ensures that x is always below z, making relations where x is not south of z (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) impossible. Specifically:
- N, NE, and NW require x to be north of z, which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- E and W require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is not satisfied as infy(z) > infy(x) due to the regions having positive area.
- B requires the bounding box of z to contain that of x in both dimensions, but infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not satisfied.

Thus, only S, SE, and SW are possible.

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}}
