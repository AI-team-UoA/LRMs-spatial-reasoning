PROMPT: Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), leading to \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).

The vertical condition \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) satisfies the vertical requirement for S, SE, and SW relations between \(x\) and \(z\). The horizontal conditions \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (with \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) allow two scenarios for the horizontal extent of \(x\) relative to \(z\):

1. **If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)**:
   - Horizontally: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
   - Vertically: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
   - This satisfies the definition of **S** (South) for \(x\) relative to \(z\).

2. **If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)**:
   - Horizontally: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
   - Vertically: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
   - This satisfies the definition of **SE** (South East) for \(x\) relative to \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **SW** requires \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), but \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\) makes this impossible.
- **B**, **N**, **NE**, **E**, **NW**, **W** violate vertical or horizontal constraints derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S** and **SE**.

**Answer: S, SE**
