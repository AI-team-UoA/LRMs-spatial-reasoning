PROMPT: Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the constraints on their bounding boxes. Through case analysis and example constructions, the following relations are achievable:

- **NW (North West)**: When \(x\) is entirely left and above \(z\).  
  Example: \(x\)’s bounding box ends before \(z\)’s starts on the x-axis, and \(z\)’s bounding box ends before \(x\)’s starts on the y-axis.
- **W (West)**: When \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) and vertically overlaps or is contained within \(z\)’s y-bounds.  
  Example: \(x\)’s x-interval ends before \(z\)’s starts, while \(z\)’s y-interval overlaps or contains \(x\)’s y-interval.
- **N (North)**: When \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) and \(x\)’s x-interval is contained within \(z\)’s x-interval.  
  Example: \(z\)’s y-max is at or below \(x\)’s y-min, and \(x\)’s x-interval is within \(z\)’s.
- **B (Bounding box)**: When \(x\)’s bounding box is contained within \(z\)’s.  
  Example: All boundaries of \(x\) are inside or on the boundaries of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: When \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) and \(x\)’s x-interval is contained within \(z\)’s x-interval.  
  Example: \(x\)’s y-max is at or below \(z\)’s y-min, and \(x\)’s x-interval is within \(z\)’s.

Other relations (NE, SE, E, SW) are not possible due to inherent constraints from the given relations. For instance:
- **NE, SE, E** require \(x\) to be right of \(z\), but \(x\) is left of \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), making \(x\) left-aligned.
- **SW** requires \(x\) below and left of \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), preventing \(x\) from being below \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are **NW, W, N, B, S**.

**Final Answer**  
NW, W, N, B, S
