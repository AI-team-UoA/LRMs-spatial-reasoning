PROMPT: Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z must be determined based on the cardinal direction relation definitions.

- x NW y implies:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y)  (x is strictly left of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x)  (x is strictly above y)

- y N z implies:
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)  (z is strictly below y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(z)  (z starts at or to the right of y's left edge)
  - supx(z) ≤ supx(y)  (z ends at or to the left of y's right edge)

From these, derive the relation between x and z:

1. **Vertical direction (y-coordinates):**
   - From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - Combining: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - This means z is strictly below x.

2. **Horizontal direction (x-coordinates):**
   - From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - From y N z: infx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - Combining: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - This means x is strictly left of z.

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of x being NW of z (i.e., x NW z).

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:
- **N**: Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which holds) but also infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). However, infx(z) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) ≥ infx(x), and since regions have area, infx(z) > infx(x), violating infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- **NE**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But supx(z) ≥ infx(z) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) ≥ infx(x), so supx(z) > infx(x), violating supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- **E**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is contradicted as above.
- **SE**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But supy(x) ≥ infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(z) ≥ infy(z), so supy(x) > infy(z) if regions have area, violating supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- **S**: Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but supy(x) ≥ infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(z) ≥ infy(z), so supy(x) > infy(z), violating the condition.
- **SW**: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which holds) but also supy(x) ≤ infy(z). However, supy(x) ≥ infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≥ infy(y) ≥ supy(z) ≥ infy(z), so supy(x) > infy(z), violating supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- **W**: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which holds) but also infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z) would require supy(z) = supy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x), implying supy(x) ≤ infy(x), which is impossible for regions with area.
- **B**: Requires the bounding box of z to contain that of x, but x is left and above z, so not possible.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.
