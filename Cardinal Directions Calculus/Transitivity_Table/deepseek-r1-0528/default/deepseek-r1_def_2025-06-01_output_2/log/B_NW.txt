PROMPT: Let B and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ NW } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining the horizontal bounds:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x \text{ B } y\))
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y \text{ NW } z\))
- Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)

Combining the vertical bounds:
- \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x \text{ B } y\))
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y \text{ NW } z\))
- Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ NW } z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- **W, SW, S, SE, E, NE, N, B** require additional conditions (e.g., horizontal or vertical alignment or overlap) that conflict with the derived inequalities. For example:
  - **W** requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\), violating \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) unless degenerate (not possible in REG).
  - **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\), violating \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) unless degenerate.

Thus, the only possible relation is \(x \text{ NW } z\).
