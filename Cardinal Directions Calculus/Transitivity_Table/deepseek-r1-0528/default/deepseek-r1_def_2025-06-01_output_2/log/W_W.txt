PROMPT: Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions for the West (W) relation:

- \(x\) W \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
2. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
3. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) W \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\),
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) is possible because:
- Horizontal: \(x\) is strictly left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), ruling out E, NE, SE, and B (which requires horizontal containment).
- Vertical: The vertical span of \(x\) is contained within \(z\)'s vertical span (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), but \(x\) is not entirely above, below, or aligned in a way that satisfies N, S, NW, SW, or other relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is W.
