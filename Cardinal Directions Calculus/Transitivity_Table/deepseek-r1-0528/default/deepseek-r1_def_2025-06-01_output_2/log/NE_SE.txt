PROMPT: Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. This is determined by the relative positions derived from the bounding box constraints:

- From x NE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), meaning x is east and north of y.
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), meaning y is east and south of z.

Combining these:
- The x-direction constraints (supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) imply supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so x is east of z.
- The y-direction constraints (supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) allow for different vertical relationships between x and z, leading to three possibilities:
  - **NE**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), x is north and east of z.
  - **E**: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x is directly east of z with vertical overlap.
  - **SE**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is south and east of z.

Other relations (N, S, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the east constraint and the lack of bounding box containment or other directional conflicts.

Thus, the possible relations are NE, E, and SE.
