PROMPT: Let SE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\), which implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\))

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), which implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(y\))

Combining these:
- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\), satisfying the horizontal condition for relations E, SE, and NE.

- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  The vertical alignment between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary, leading to three cases:
    1. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).  
    2. **NE (North East)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(x\)).  
    3. **E (East)**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., the vertical span of \(x\) is contained within \(z\)).  

These cases are mutually possible under the constraints, and no other relations (N, S, NW, W, SW, B) satisfy the horizontal condition \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **E, SE, NE**.
