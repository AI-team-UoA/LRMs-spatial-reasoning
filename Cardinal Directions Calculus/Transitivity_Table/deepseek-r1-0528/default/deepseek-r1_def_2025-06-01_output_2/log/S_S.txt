PROMPT: Let S and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) S \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (top of \(x\) is at or below bottom of \(y\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box).

- \(y\) S \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (top of \(y\) is at or below bottom of \(z\)),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (\(y\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box).

Combining these:
- Vertical relation: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontal relation: 
  - From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\); from \(x\) S \(y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\); from \(y\) S \(z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- Therefore, \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) S \(z\). No other relation (e.g., SW, SE, B) holds because:
- SW/SE require \(x\) to be strictly left/right of \(z\), but \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).
- B requires \(z\) to fully contain \(x\) vertically, which is not necessarily true (e.g., \(x\) could extend below \(z\)'s bottom, but here \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).

Thus, the only possible relation is S.
