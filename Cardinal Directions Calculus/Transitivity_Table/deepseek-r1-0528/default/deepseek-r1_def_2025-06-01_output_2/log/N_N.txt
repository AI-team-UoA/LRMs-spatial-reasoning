PROMPT: Let N and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, the cardinal direction relation between x and z must be N. This is derived from the definitions of the N relation and the transitive property of the inequalities involved.

- x N y implies:
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y in the y-direction)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge is at least as far right as y's left edge)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge is at most as far right as y's right edge)

- y N z implies:
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z in the y-direction)
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left edge is at least as far right as z's left edge)
  - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right edge is at most as far right as z's right edge)

Combining these:
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) by transitivity.
- From infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), it follows that supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

These combined inequalities satisfy the definition of x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as they would violate the derived inequalities or require conditions (e.g., strict horizontal or vertical shifts) that are incompatible with the nested x-ranges and vertical separation enforced by the given N relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.
