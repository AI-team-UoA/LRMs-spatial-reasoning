PROMPT: Let NW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely west and north of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is S of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely south of \(z\), and the x-projection of \(y\) is contained within that of \(z\).

Given these constraints, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the relative positions:

- **B (bounding box)**: Possible if the bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([4,5] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([3,8] \times [2.5,5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) B \(z\).

- **N (North)**: Possible if \(z\) is south of \(x\) and the x-projection of \(x\) is contained in \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([3,4] \times [3,5]\), \(z\): \([2,8] \times [4,5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) N \(z\).

- **NW (North West)**: Possible if \(x\) is west and north of \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([4,6] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([1,3] \times [3,5]\), \(z\): \([3,7] \times [2,3]\).  
  Here, \(x\) NW \(z\).

- **W (West)**: Possible if \(x\) is west of \(z\) and the y-projection of \(x\) is contained in \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([3,4] \times [3,5]\), \(z\): \([4.5,8] \times [2,6]\).  
  Here, \(x\) W \(z\).

- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(x\) is west and south of \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([3,4] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([4.5,8] \times [4.5,5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) SW \(z\).

- **S (South)**: Possible if \(x\) is south of \(z\) and the x-projection of \(x\) is contained in \(z\). For example:  
  \(y\): \([5,7] \times [0,2]\), \(x\): \([3,4] \times [3,4]\), \(z\): \([2,8] \times [4,5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) S \(z\).

The relations NE, E, and SE are impossible:  
- **NE** requires \(z\) west and south of \(x\), but \(z\) must extend east to at least \(\sup_x(y) \geq 5\), while \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq 5\), leading to contradiction.  
- **E** requires \(z\) west of \(x\), but \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq 5\) and \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq 5\), again contradicting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
- **SE** similarly requires \(z\) west and above \(x\), facing the same contradiction as NE and E.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, NW, W, SW, S**.
