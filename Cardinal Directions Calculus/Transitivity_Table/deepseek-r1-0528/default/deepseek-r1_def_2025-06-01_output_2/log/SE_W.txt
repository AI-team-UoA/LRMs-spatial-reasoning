PROMPT: Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x \text{ SE } y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is to the right of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)

- \(y \text{ W } z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is to the left of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z covers y vertically)

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by considering the relative positions in the x and y axes:

1. **B (bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\). This occurs when there is overlap in both axes and \(x\) is entirely within \(z\)'s bounding box.
2. **S (South)**: \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) and horizontally contained within \(z\)'s x-span.
3. **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\) (no overlap in either axis).
4. **W (West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-span.
5. **E (East)**: \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-span.
6. **SE (South East)**: \(x\) is below and to the right of \(z\) (no overlap in either axis).

These relations are achievable under the given constraints:
- **B** and **S** occur when there is horizontal overlap (x-axis intervals intersect), with **B** for vertical overlap and **S** if \(x\) is below \(z\).
- **SW**, **W**, **E**, and **SE** occur with no horizontal overlap, depending on whether \(x\) is left or right of \(z\) and vertically below or contained.

The relations **N (North)**, **NE (North East)**, and **NW (North West)** are impossible because \(x\) is always below \(y\) (from \(x \text{ SE } y\)) and \(z\) covers \(y\) vertically, making it impossible for \(x\) to be above \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are **B, S, SW, W, E, SE**.

**Answer: B, S, SW, W, E, SE**
