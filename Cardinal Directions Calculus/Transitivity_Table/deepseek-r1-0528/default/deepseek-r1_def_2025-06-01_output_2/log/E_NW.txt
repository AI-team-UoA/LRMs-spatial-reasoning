PROMPT: Let E and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (so \(x\) is to the east of \(y\))
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (so \(y\) is to the west of \(z\))
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (so \(z\) is below \(y\))

Combining these, the vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), satisfying the vertical condition for \(x\) being north of \(z\) (common to N, NE, NW).

Horizontally, the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) vary:
- If \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- If \(z\) is entirely to the east of \(x\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
- If \(x\) is entirely within the horizontal extent of \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).

These cover all possible horizontal configurations under the constraints, and the vertical condition is always satisfied for N, NE, NW. Other relations (e.g., S, SW, E, W, SE, B) are incompatible with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), which ensures \(x\) is above \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, and NW.

**Answer: N, NE, NW**
