PROMPT: Let S and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  

Combining these constraints:  
1. \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\) and \(x\) S \(y\)).  
2. Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is east of \(z\) horizontally. The vertical relation depends on possible configurations:  

- **If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**:  
  \(x\) is north and east of \(z\) → \(x\) **NE** \(z\).  
- **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:  
  \(x\) is south and east of \(z\) → \(x\) **SE** \(z\).  
- **If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**:  
  \(x\) is east of \(z\) with vertical containment → \(x\) **E** \(z\).  

These are the only possible relations that satisfy the constraints. Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are incompatible due to the horizontal separation \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and the vertical constraints.  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, SE, E**.
