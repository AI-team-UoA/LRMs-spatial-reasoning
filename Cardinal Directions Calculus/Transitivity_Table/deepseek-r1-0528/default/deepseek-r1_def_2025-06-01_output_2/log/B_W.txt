PROMPT: Let B and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is B (bounding box) of region y and region y is W (West) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is W (West).

### Explanation:
- **x B y** implies that the bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of y:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (left edge of y is left of or equal to left edge of x),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (right edge of x is left of or equal to right edge of y),
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (bottom edge of y is below or equal to bottom edge of x),
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (top edge of x is below or equal to top edge of y).

- **y W z** implies that y is strictly to the west of z and vertically within z's vertical range:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (right edge of y is left of or equal to left edge of z),
  - \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (bottom edge of z is below or equal to bottom edge of y),
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (top edge of y is below or equal to top edge of z).

From these:
- Horizontally: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning x is entirely to the west of z.
- Vertically: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), so \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), meaning x is vertically within the range of z.

Thus, the relation between x and z satisfies the definition of W (West):
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\),
- \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\),
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., NW, SW, B, etc.) is possible because:
- The vertical containment rules out relations like NW or SW, which require misalignment (e.g., NW requires \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), which contradicts the vertical containment).
- B is impossible because x cannot be within z's bounding box due to the horizontal separation (x is west of z).

Therefore, the only possible relation is W.

**Final Answer: W**
