PROMPT: Let S and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z must be derived from the definitions of the cardinal direction relations.

- x S y implies:
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within the x-range of y)

- y SE z implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)

Combining these:

- From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), it follows that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is south of z).
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is west of x).

Therefore:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) indicates that z is entirely to the west of x.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) indicates that x is entirely to the south of z.

This satisfies the definition of SE for x relative to z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (east condition, with z as reference)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (south condition)

No other cardinal direction relation or B (bounding box) is possible, as the constraints force x to be strictly southeast of z. For example:
- S would require x to be within the x-range of z, but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) prevents this.
- E would require z to be within the y-range of x, but supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies infy(z) > infy(x), which violates the infy(z) ≤ infy(x) condition for E.
- Similarly, other directions like SW, W, NW, N, NE, or B do not hold due to the positional constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.
