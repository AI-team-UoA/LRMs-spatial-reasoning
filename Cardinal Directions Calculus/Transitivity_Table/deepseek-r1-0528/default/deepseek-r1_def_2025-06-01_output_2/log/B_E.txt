PROMPT: Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is in the B (bounding box) relation with region \(y\), and region \(y\) is in the E (East) relation with region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is E (East).

### Explanation:
- **x B y**: This means the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\). Specifically:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- **y E z**: This means \(y\) is directly east of \(z\), with the y-range of \(y\) contained within the y-range of \(z\). Specifically:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

From these, derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **x-direction**:
   - From \(y E z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(x B y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)

2. **y-direction**:
   - From \(y E z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(x B y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), thus \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - From \(x B y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
   - From \(y E z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), thus \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of the E relation between \(x\) and \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) is east of \(z\) with the y-range of \(x\) contained within the y-range of \(z\)).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, or B) is possible because:
- Relations like S, SE, or SW require \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) cannot hold for regions with area (as per REG, regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk).
- Relations like N, NE, or NW require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) cannot hold.
- Relations like W or SW require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) cannot hold.
- The B relation would require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x)\) may be greater than \(\sup_x(z)\), so B does not hold.

Thus, the only possible relation is E.
