PROMPT: Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).

The constraints imply:
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), but the vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) relative to each other can vary.

Possible vertical relationships:
1. If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), then \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) (NW relation).
2. If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is southwest of \(z\) (SW relation).
3. If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is west of \(z\) (W relation).

These cases are achievable under the constraints, while other relations (e.g., N, S, E) are not possible due to the west constraint \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, SW, and W.

**Final Answer: NW, SW, W**
