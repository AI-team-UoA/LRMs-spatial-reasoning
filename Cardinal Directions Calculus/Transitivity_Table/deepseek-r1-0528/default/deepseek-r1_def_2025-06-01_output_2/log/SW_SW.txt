PROMPT: Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is SW.

### Explanation:
- The SW relation is defined as: \(a\) SW \(b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(a) \leq \inf_y(b)\).
- From \(x\) SW \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) SW \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Combining the inequalities:  
  - For the x-coordinates: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  - For the y-coordinates: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
- These satisfy the conditions for \(x\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, B) are possible, as they require additional conditions that are not met here (e.g., alignment in one direction or containment of bounding boxes).
