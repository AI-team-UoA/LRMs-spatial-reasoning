PROMPT: Let NE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are N and NE.

- **N (North)**: This occurs when the bounding box of \(x\) is directly above and within the x-range of \(z\)'s bounding box. Specifically, this requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). These conditions can be satisfied based on the given relations and the properties of the regions.
- **NE (North East)**: This occurs when \(x\) is completely to the northeast of \(z\), meaning no overlap in the x or y directions. Specifically, this requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). These conditions can also be satisfied based on the given relations.

Other relations (such as S, SW, W, NW, E, SE, or B) are not possible because:
- \(x\) must be north of \(z\) due to the y-coordinate inequalities derived from \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) N \(z\), specifically \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(x\) cannot be west of \(z\) because \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) from the relations, ruling out W and NW.
- \(x\) cannot be south, southeast, or directly east because of the north positioning, and containment (B) is not possible due to the directional constraints.

Thus, the only possible relations are N and NE.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}}
