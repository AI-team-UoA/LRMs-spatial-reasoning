PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- **Vertical direction**: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This implies that \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) vertically.
- **Horizontal direction**: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other are not fixed.

The possible horizontal arrangements between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).
2. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.
3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (or equivalently, \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\)).

These are the only possible relations, as the vertical separation (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) restricts the relation to southern directions (SW, S, SE), and the horizontal arrangements cover all cases:
- SW when \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- S when \(x\) is horizontally aligned within \(z\).
- SE when \(x\) is right of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S, SE
