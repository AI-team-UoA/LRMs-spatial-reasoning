PROMPT: Let B and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies that the bounding box of \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\). Thus:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ N } z\) implies that \(y\) is north of \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **Y-axis constraints**:
   - From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

2. **X-axis constraints**:
   - From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
   - Chaining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

The conditions \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ N } z\). 

Verifying other relations:
- **NE, NW, E, W, SE, SW**: Require specific horizontal alignments (e.g., \(x\) entirely east/west of \(z\)) that conflict with the x-axis constraints derived (since \(x\)'s x-range is within \(z\)'s, not to the side).
- **S, B**: Require \(y\)-axis conditions like \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which contradict \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (as \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\)).

Thus, the only possible relation is **N**.
