PROMPT: Let B and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) B \(y\) means the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) NE \(z\) means \(y\) is northeast of \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these:

1. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
2. From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
3. Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

Similarly for the y-axis:

1. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
2. From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
3. Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The relation \(x\) NE \(z\) is defined as:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Both conditions are satisfied, so \(x\) NE \(z\) holds.

No other relations are possible:
- \(x\) B \(z\) would require the bounding box of \(z\) to contain \(x\), but \(z\) is entirely left and below \(x\).
- \(x\) S, SW, W, NW, E, SE relations require \(x\) to be south, southwest, west, northwest, east, or southeast of \(z\), which contradict the positioning (e.g., \(x\) cannot be south of \(z\) because \(z\) is below \(x\)).
- \(x\) N would require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (which holds) but also \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which fails because \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\), implying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\), but equality would require degenerate bounding boxes, impossible for regions homeomorphic to a closed disk.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE (from \(x\) to \(z\)).
