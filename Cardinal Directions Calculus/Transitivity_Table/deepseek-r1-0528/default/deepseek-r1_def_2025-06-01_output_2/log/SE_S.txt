PROMPT: Let SE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is strictly east of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is strictly south of y)  

- Region \(y\) is S of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is strictly south of z)  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y's x-range is contained within z's x-range)  

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Vertical relation (y-coordinate):**  
   From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This means \(x\) is south of \(z\) vertically. Thus, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be one of S, SW, or SE (south row relations).  

2. **Horizontal relation (x-coordinate):**  
   From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - **Case 1: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
     This implies \(x\) is strictly east of \(z\) (since \(z\)'s right edge is left of \(x\)'s left edge).  
     With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (south), the relation is SE.  
   - **Case 2: \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\)**  
     This implies \(x\)'s x-range overlaps or is contained within \(z\)'s x-range. However, from \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and the requirement that the entire bounding box of \(x\) must lie in one tile relative to \(z\), \(x\) must be horizontally contained within \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) to avoid spanning multiple tiles (since SW and SE are excluded by the inequalities).  
     With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), the relation is S.  

### Possible relations:
- **SE** occurs in Case 1 (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).  
- **S** occurs in Case 2 (\(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
No other relations (like SW, NE, etc.) are possible due to the vertical constraint and horizontal chain of inequalities.  

**Answer: S, SE**
