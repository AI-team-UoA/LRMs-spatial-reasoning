PROMPT: Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The constraints imply:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

No additional constraints are imposed on the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, by adjusting the bounding boxes of \(x\) and \(z\) within these constraints, any cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is possible:

- **N (North)**: \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
- **NE (North East)**: \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\).
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) is below and to the right of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\).
- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\).

Thus, all cardinal direction relations are possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Possible relations**: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.
