PROMPT: Let N and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From the horizontal constraints:
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so the x-projection of \(x\) is contained within the x-projection of \(z\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary, but the horizontal containment limits the possible cardinal direction relations to those that do not require horizontal displacement. The valid relations are:

- **B** (bounding box): If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **N** (North): If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **S** (South): If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Other relations (E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) are impossible because they require horizontal displacement (e.g., \(z\) entirely left or right of \(x\)), which contradicts the horizontal containment derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B, N, and S.

**Final Answer**  
B, N, S
