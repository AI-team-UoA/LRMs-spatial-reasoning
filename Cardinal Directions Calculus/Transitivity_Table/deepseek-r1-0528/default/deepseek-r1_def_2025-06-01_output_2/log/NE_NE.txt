PROMPT: Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, the relation between x and z must be analyzed based on the cardinal direction definitions.

- x NE y implies:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

- y NE z implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)

Combining these:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of z).
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of z).

Thus, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition for x NE z. No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible under these conditions, as the inequalities strictly position x to the northeast of z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.
