PROMPT: Let NE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) starts to the east of \(y\)'s right boundary),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) starts above \(y\)'s top boundary).
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(z\) starts to the east of \(y\)'s right boundary),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds).

Combining these:
1. **Vertical Position**: Since \(x\) is above \(y\) (\(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\)) and \(y\) is vertically contained in \(z\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), \(x\) is above \(y\) and thus above part of \(z\). However, \(z\) may extend above \(y\), leading to two cases:
   - **Vertical non-overlap**: If \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely above \(z\), enabling pure vertical or diagonal relations:
     - **N**: If \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
     - **NE**: If \(z\) is to the west of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and vertically separated.
     - **NW**: If \(x\) is to the west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) and vertically separated.
   - **Vertical overlap**: If \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) and \(z\) overlap vertically, but \(x\) remains above \(y\) and within \(z\)'s vertical extent if fully contained (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). Horizontal positioning determines:
     - **W**: If \(x\) is to the west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) and vertically contained.
     - **E**: If \(z\) is to the west of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and vertically contained.
     - **B**: If \(x\) is horizontally and vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

Relations like S, SW, SE are impossible because \(x\) is always above \(y\) (hence cannot be below \(z\)). After verifying with example configurations (e.g., \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), adjusting \(x\) and \(z\) accordingly), the possible relations are **N, NE, NW, W, E, B**.

**Answer**: N, NE, NW, W, E, B
