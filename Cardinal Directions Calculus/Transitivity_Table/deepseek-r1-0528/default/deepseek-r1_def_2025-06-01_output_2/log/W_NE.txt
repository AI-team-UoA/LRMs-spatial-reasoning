PROMPT: Let W and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, we derive:
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are entirely to the left of \(y\).
2. \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (since the highest point of \(z\) is below the lowest point of \(x\)).

The horizontal relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
- **Case 1: \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).**  
  Then \(x\) is NW of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (satisfied) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied).
- **Case 2: \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).**  
  Then \(x\) is NE of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (satisfied) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied).

Horizontal overlap (where neither \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) nor \(z\) entirely left of \(x\)) does not yield any valid base relation for \(x\) relative to \(z\) under the given constraints, as the base relations require clear horizontal positioning (entirely left, entirely right, or containment, which is not guaranteed here).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (with \(x\) as the subject and \(z\) as the reference) are **NE** and **NW**.

**Answer: NE, NW**
