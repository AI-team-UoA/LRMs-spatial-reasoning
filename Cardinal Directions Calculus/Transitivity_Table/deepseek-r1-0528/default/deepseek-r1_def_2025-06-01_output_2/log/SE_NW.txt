PROMPT: Let SE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The constraints derived are:
1. \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\)
2. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
3. \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
4. \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

These constraints allow for various spatial arrangements between \(x\) and \(z\). By adjusting the exact positions (within the constraints), all nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:

- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) above \(z\), horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s span.
- **NE**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) east and north of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) is east of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) directly east of \(z\), vertically contained.
- **SE**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) east and south of \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) below \(z\), horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s span.
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) west and south of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) directly west of \(z\), vertically contained.
- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) west and north of \(z\).
- **B**: \(x\) is in the bounding box of \(z\)  
  Example: \(x\) entirely contained within \(z\)'s minimum bounding box.

Thus, every relation is achievable with appropriate positioning satisfying the initial constraints. The possible relations are: **N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B**.
