PROMPT: Let S and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

### Explanation:
- From x S y:  
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)  
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is within the x-range of y)  

- From y SW z:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is southwest of z)  

Combining these:  
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) imply supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z) imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  

The conditions supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z) satisfy the definition of x SW z.  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) is possible, as they require additional conditions (e.g., x-range containment for S or W) that are not met due to the relative positions enforced by the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.
