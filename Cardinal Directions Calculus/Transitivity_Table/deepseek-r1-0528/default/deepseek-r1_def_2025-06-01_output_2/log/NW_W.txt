PROMPT: Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely to the west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is entirely to the south of x, so x is north of y)

- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely to the west of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is vertically contained within z)

From these:
- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\):**  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is west of \(z\), limiting possible relations to W, NW, or SW.

- **Vertical analysis:**
  - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  - Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

This implies:
- The entire \(y\) is below \(x\) and vertically within \(z\).
- The bottom of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\), and the top of \(z\) is at or above the top of \(y\).

**Possible vertical scenarios for \(x\) and \(z\):**
1. **If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\):**  
   The entire \(z\) is below \(x\) (since \(z\)'s top is at or below \(x\)'s bottom). With \(x\) west of \(z\), this matches the **NW** relation:  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (west)  
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (north)  
   *Example: \(z\) vertically below \(x\).*

2. **If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\):**  
   \(z\) extends above \(x\)'s bottom, but \(x\)'s top is at or below \(z\)'s top. With \(x\) west of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\), this matches the **W** relation:  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (west)  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment)  
   *Example: \(x\) vertically within \(z\)'s span, with \(x\) west of \(z\).*

**Excluded relations:**
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) only if vertical spans degenerate to a point, which is impossible for regions in REG. Thus, SW is impossible.
- Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are excluded because \(x\) is west of \(z\).

**Conclusion:**  
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW** and **W**. These cover scenarios where \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (NW) or \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\) (W), both consistent with the given constraints.
