PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(x\) is above \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is within the bounds of \(y\))
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is to the right of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(x\) is to the right of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (since \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\)), but their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **E (East)**: If \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounds:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (holds)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (possible, e.g., \(z\) vertically contains \(x\))
- **NE (North East)**: If \(x\) is to the right and above \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (holds)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (possible, e.g., \(z\) entirely below \(x\))
- **SE (South East)**: If \(x\) is to the right and below \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (holds)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (possible, e.g., \(x\) entirely below \(z\))

Other relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N) are impossible due to the horizontal condition \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and vertical constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are E, NE, and SE.
