PROMPT: Let S and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, the constraints are:

- From x S y: 
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- From y W z: 
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning x is entirely to the west of z.
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) are bounded above by \(\inf_y(y)\).

The y-axis relation between x and z depends on the relative positions of \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\):
1. If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then x is entirely below the bounding box of z, resulting in **SW**.
2. If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) and additionally \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) (so x is within the vertical bounds of z's bounding box), then the relation is **W**.

Both scenarios are possible under the given constraints, as verified by examples:
- **SW** example:  
  - y: bounding box \([1, 3] \times [2, 4]\)  
  - x: \([1.5, 2.5] \times [0, 1.5]\) (satisfies x S y, \(\sup_y(x) = 1.5 \leq 2\))  
  - z: \([4, 6] \times [2, 5]\) (satisfies y W z, \(\inf_y(z) = 2\), and \(\sup_y(x) = 1.5 \leq 2\))  
  - x is SW of z.
- **W** example:  
  - y: bounding box \([1, 3] \times [2, 4]\)  
  - x: \([1.5, 2.5] \times [0.6, 1.5]\) (satisfies x S y, \(\sup_y(x) = 1.5 \leq 2\))  
  - z: \([4, 6] \times [0.5, 5]\) (satisfies y W z, \(\inf_y(z) = 0.5\), and \(\inf_y(x) = 0.6 \geq 0.5\))  
  - x is W of z.

No other relations are possible because:
- x must be west of z (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), ruling out N, NE, E, SE, S, B.
- NW requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), making NW impossible.

Thus, the possible relations are **W** and **SW**.
