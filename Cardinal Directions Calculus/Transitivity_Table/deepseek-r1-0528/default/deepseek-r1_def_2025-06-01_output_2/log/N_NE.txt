PROMPT: Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely above \(y\), and the horizontal extent of \(x\) is within the horizontal extent of \(y\).

- \(y\) is NE of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the right and above \(z\).

Combining these:  
- Vertically:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) imply \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  
- Horizontally:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) imply \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) requires:  
- \(z\) entirely below \(x\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
- \(z\) entirely to the left of \(x\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  

This matches the definition of NE:  
\(x\) is NE of \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously under the given constraints. For example:  
- N requires \(z\) below \(x\) and the horizontal extent of \(z\) to contain that of \(x\), but here \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(z\) is left of \(x\), violating containment.  
- Other relations fail similarly due to mismatched horizontal or vertical constraints.  

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.
