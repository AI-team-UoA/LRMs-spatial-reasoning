PROMPT: Let NW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box constraints.

- From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(x\) is to the left and above \(y\).
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). This means \(z\) is to the left and below \(y\).

Combining these:
- Vertically, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is below \(x\).
- Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\), as \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their horizontal alignment:
- If \(x\) is strictly to the left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
- If \(z\) is strictly to the left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- If \(z\) contains \(x\) horizontally (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), and given \(z\) is below \(x\), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).

Other relations are impossible because:
- \(z\) is below \(x\), so relations like S, SE, SW cannot hold.
- The vertical separation rules out E, W, and B.
- There is no scenario where \(x\) is directly south of \(z\) or contained within \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are NW, N, and NE.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
