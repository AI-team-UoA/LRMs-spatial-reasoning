PROMPT: Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical: \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontal: \(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounds)  

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal: \(y\) is entirely left of \(z\))  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertical: \(z\) is entirely below \(y\))  

Combining these:  
- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) imply \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  

- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\).  

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being **NW of \(z\)**:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal)  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical)  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) is possible, as they require conflicting horizontal or vertical alignments (e.g., \(x\) N \(z\) would require \(z\) to span horizontally over \(x\), but here \(x\) is left of \(z\)).
