PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\), \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\), and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined as follows:

1. **Horizontal constraint**: From \(y\) E \(z\), \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\). From \(x\) N \(y\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\). Thus, \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraints**:
   - From \(x\) N \(y\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).
   - From \(y\) E \(z\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) and \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y)\) (since \(y\) is a region).
   - Thus, \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), so \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).

Now, consider vertical possibilities:
- If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely above \(z\), leading to \(x\) NE \(z\) (since \(x\) is east and north of \(z\)).
- If \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds, leading to \(x\) E \(z\) (east and vertically contained).

Other relations are impossible:
- **B, S, SW, W, NW, N, SE**: Violate horizontal or vertical constraints derived (e.g., \(x\) must be east of \(z\), cannot be west, south, etc., based on the chain).

Thus, the possible relations are NE and E.

**Answer**: NE, E
