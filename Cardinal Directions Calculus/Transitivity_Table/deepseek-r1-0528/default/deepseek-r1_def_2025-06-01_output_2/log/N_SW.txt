PROMPT: Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the following constraints apply:

- From \(x\) N \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely above \(y\) and horizontally within the x-projection of \(y\).

- From \(y\) SW \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below and to the west of \(z\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This implies \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), but their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). The candidate relations are NW, W, and SW, as they all require this horizontal condition. The vertical relationship determines which of these holds:

- **NW (North West)**: If \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
  Example: \(y = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z = [2,3] \times [1.5,2.5]\), \(x = [0.2,0.8] \times [3,4]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is above and west of \(z\).

- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  
  Example: \(y = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(x = [0.2,0.8] \times [2.1,2.9]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is west of \(z\) and vertically aligned inside \(z\)'s y-bounds.

- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
  Example: \(y = [0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z = [2,3] \times [3,4]\), \(x = [0.2,0.8] \times [1.5,2.5]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is below and west of \(z\).

No other relations satisfy the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, W, and SW.

**Answer: NW, W, SW**
