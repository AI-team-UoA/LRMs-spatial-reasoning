PROMPT: Let SE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is SE. This is determined by the transitivity of the SE relation:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely to the east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely to the south of y)
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is entirely to the east of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely to the south of z)

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely to the east of z).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is entirely to the south of z).

These conditions satisfy the definition of SE for \(x\) relative to \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible under the given constraints and the requirement that regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (ensuring positive area and non-degenerate bounding boxes).

Thus, the only possible relation is SE.
