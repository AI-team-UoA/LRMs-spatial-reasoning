PROMPT: Let E and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is E (East) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E (East) of region \(z\), the relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) must be E (East). This is derived from the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., the left edge of \(x\) is to the right of the right edge of \(y\)),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., the left edge of \(y\) is to the right of the right edge of \(z\)),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Chaining these inequalities:
- For the x-coordinates: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- For the y-infimum: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- For the y-supremum: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These satisfy the conditions for \(x\) E \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, or B) is possible, as they require different positional constraints (e.g., vertical misalignment or bounding box containment) that contradict the derived inequalities for non-degenerate regions in REG.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is E.

\boxed{\text{E}}
