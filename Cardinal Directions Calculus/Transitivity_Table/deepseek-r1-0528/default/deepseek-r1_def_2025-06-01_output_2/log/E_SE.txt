PROMPT: Let E and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

Combining these:  
- From \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
- From \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

These combined conditions, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), define the relation \(x\) SE \(z\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible, as they would require conflicting constraints (e.g., \(x\) cannot be north or west of \(z\) given the above).  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SE.
