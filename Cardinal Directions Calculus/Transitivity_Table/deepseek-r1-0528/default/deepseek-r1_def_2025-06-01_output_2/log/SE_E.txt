PROMPT: Let SE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are SE (Southeast) or E (East).

- **SE (Southeast) is possible**: This occurs when \(x\) is sufficiently south of \(z\), specifically when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). For example, if \(y\) is positioned such that its southern edge aligns with or is above the southern edge of \(z\), and \(x\) is south of \(y\), then \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\).
  
- **E (East) is possible**: This occurs when \(x\) is directly east of \(z\) with vertical containment, specifically when \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (the latter always holds given the constraints). For example, if \(x\) is not too far south relative to \(z\), such that it is vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-range, then \(x\) can be east of \(z\).

The relation NE (Northeast) is impossible because it would require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which contradicts the constraints derived from \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\) (as regions have positive area, making zero-height bounding boxes invalid). Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are not possible due to the eastward offset between \(x\) and \(z\) and the vertical constraints.

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SE and E.

\boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}}
