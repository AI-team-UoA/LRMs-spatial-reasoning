PROMPT: Let NE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box constraints and the relative positions based on the given relations.

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies that \(x\) is to the northeast of \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is to the right of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is above y)

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies that \(y\) is to the south of \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z's x-interval contains y's x-interval)

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the relative horizontal and vertical positions of their bounding boxes. The constraints lead to the following possible relations:

- **NE (Northeast)**: Possible if \(z\) is to the left and below \(x\).
- **E (East)**: Possible if \(z\) is directly to the left of \(x\) with vertical containment of \(x\)'s y-interval by \(z\)'s y-interval.
- **SE (Southeast)**: Possible if \(z\) is to the left and above \(x\).
- **N (North)**: Possible if there is horizontal overlap and \(z\) is below \(x\) with \(x\)'s x-interval contained within \(z\)'s x-interval.
- **S (South)**: Possible if there is horizontal overlap and \(x\) is below \(z\) with \(x\)'s x-interval contained within \(z\)'s x-interval.
- **B (Bounding box)**: Possible if \(x\)'s bounding box is contained within \(z\)'s bounding box, including both x and y intervals.

The relations NW, W, and SW are not possible because the constraints \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply that \(x\) cannot be to the west of \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) is impossible).

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are NE, E, SE, N, S, and B.
