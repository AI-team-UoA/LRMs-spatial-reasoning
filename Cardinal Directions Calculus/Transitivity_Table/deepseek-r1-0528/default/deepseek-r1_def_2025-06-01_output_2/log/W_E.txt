PROMPT: Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

The constraints imply:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) horizontally (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)).
- Vertically, \(x\) and \(z\) are contained within the bounds of \(y\) (\(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\)).

No direct constraints exist between \(x\) and \(z\) in either dimension. Thus, any relative position is possible:
- **Horizontally**: \(x\) can be left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), right of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), or overlap (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) for containment, or partial overlap without containment).
- **Vertically**: \(x\) can be above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), or at the same height (overlap or containment).

All nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:
- **B** (bounding box): \(x\) contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.
- **S** (south): \(x\) directly below \(z\).
- **SW** (southwest): \(x\) below and left of \(z\).
- **W** (west): \(x\) directly left of \(z\).
- **NW** (northwest): \(x\) above and left of \(z\).
- **N** (north): \(x\) directly above \(z\).
- **NE** (northeast): \(x\) above and right of \(z\).
- **E** (east): \(x\) directly right of \(z\).
- **SE** (southeast): \(x\) below and right of \(z\).

Examples for each exist within the constraints (e.g., varying horizontal positions relative to \(z\) and vertical alignments while staying left of \(y\) and within \(y\)'s vertical bounds).

**Possible relations**: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE.
