PROMPT: Let W and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- \(x\) is \(W\) of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) is \(SW\) of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining the horizontal constraints:  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

Combining the vertical constraints:  
\(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being \(SW\) of \(z\):  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (such as \(W\), \(S\), etc.) is possible, as the vertical and horizontal alignment strictly places \(x\) southwest of \(z\) without overlapping or fitting other constraints.
