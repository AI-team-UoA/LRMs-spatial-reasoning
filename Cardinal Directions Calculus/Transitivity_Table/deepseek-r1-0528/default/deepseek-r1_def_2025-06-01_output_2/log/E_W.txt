PROMPT: Let E and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is E (East) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\), the constraints derived from the cardinal direction relations are as follows:

- From \(x\) E \(y\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- From \(y\) W \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these, the following inequalities hold for \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- Let \(S = \sup_x(y)\). Then \(\inf_x(x) \geq S\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq S\).

The relations N, S, NE, SE, NW, and SW are impossible because they require conditions that conflict with the y-axis constraints (e.g., \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) for N or NE, or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for S or SE, which contradict \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) for regions with area).

The only possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) that satisfy the constraints are:
- **E (East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This is possible, for example, if \(\inf_x(z) = S\), \(\sup_x(z) = S + 1\), and \(\inf_x(x) = S + 2\), so \(\sup_x(z) = S + 1 \leq S + 2 = \inf_x(x)\), and the y-conditions are satisfied.
- **W (West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This is possible, for example, if \(\inf_x(x) = S\), \(\sup_x(x) = S + 0.5\), and \(\inf_x(z) = S + 1\), so \(\sup_x(x) = S + 0.5 \leq S + 1 = \inf_x(z)\), and the y-conditions are satisfied.
- **B (Bounding Box)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). This is possible, for example, if both \(x\) and \(z\) start at \(x = S\), but \(z\) is wider, such as \(\inf_x(z) = S\), \(\sup_x(z) = S + 3\), \(\inf_x(x) = S + 1\), \(\sup_x(x) = S + 2\), so \(\inf_x(z) = S \leq S + 1 = \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) = S + 2 \leq S + 3 = \sup_x(z)\), and the y-conditions are satisfied.

Cases with partial x-axis overlap (not covered by E, W, or B) are inconsistent with the defined cardinal direction relations, as the relations require either no x-axis overlap (for E or W) or full containment (for B).

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are E, W, and B.
