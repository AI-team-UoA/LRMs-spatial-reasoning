PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- The relation N (North) implies that \(y\) is below \(x\), specifically \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- The relation W (West) implies that \(y\) is to the left of \(z\), specifically \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is to the left of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\).

Two cases arise for the vertical position of \(z\) relative to \(x\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
   Here, the top of \(z\) is below the bottom of \(x\). With \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this matches the definition of NW:  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal)  
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical)  
   Thus, \(x\) can be NW of \(z\).

2. **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\)**  
   Here, the top of \(z\) is above the bottom of \(x\). Further subcases depend on \(\sup_y(z)\) relative to \(\sup_y(x)\):  
   - **Subcase 2a: \(\sup_y(z) > \sup_y(x)\)**  
     The top of \(z\) is above the top of \(x\). With \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from earlier), and adding \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), this matches W:  
     - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
     - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  
     Thus, \(x\) can be W of \(z\).  
   - **Subcase 2b: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\)**  
     The top of \(z\) is at or below the top of \(x\) but above the bottom of \(x\). However, no atomic cardinal direction relation (from the given set) fits this scenario, as it requires a combination not defined in the atomic relations (e.g., partial vertical overlap with \(x\) left of \(z\) is not atomic). Thus, this subcase does not yield an additional atomic relation.

No other atomic relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, SW, B) are possible under the constraints, as verified by the bounding box conditions and examples. For instance:
- SW requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) makes this impossible for non-degenerate regions.
- B requires containment in both axes, which conflicts with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

Thus, the only possible atomic relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **W** and **NW**.
