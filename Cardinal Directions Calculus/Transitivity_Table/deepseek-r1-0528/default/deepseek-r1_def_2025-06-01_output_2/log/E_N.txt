PROMPT: Let E and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.

Horizontally:
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) N \(z\)), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- \(\sup_x(z)\) can vary relative to \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x)\).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **N (North)**:
   - Requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - The vertical condition holds. Horizontally, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is satisfied, and if \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\), then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) holds. Thus, \(x\) N \(z\) is possible.

2. **NE (North East)**:
   - Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - The vertical condition holds. If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely to the left (east) of \(x\) horizontally. This is possible since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) can occur if \(\sup_x(z)\) is at most \(\inf_x(x)\).

### Why other relations are impossible:
- **S, SE, SW**: Require \(x\) below \(z\), but \(z\) is below \(x\) vertically, so impossible.
- **E, B, W, NW**: 
  - **E** requires \(z\) entirely to the left of \(x\) horizontally (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) but does not account for the vertical relation properly (NE already covers this horizontal with vertical).
  - **B** requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s, but vertically \(z\) is below \(x\), so impossible.
  - **W** requires \(x\) entirely to the left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(x)\), impossible for regions with area.
  - **NW** requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which similarly implies \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(x)\), impossible.
- **S, SE, SW** conflict with the vertical relation as explained.

Thus, the possible relations are **N** and **NE**.
