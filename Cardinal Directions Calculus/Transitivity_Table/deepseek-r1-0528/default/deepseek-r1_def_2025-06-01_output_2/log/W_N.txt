PROMPT: Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(y\) and vertically contained within \(y\)'s bounding box.

- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the north of \(y\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(z\)), and \(y\)'s horizontal span is contained within \(z\)'s horizontal span.

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely below \(x\). Thus, \(x\) is above \(z\).
- Horizontally:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(x\) W \(y\)).  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\)).  

The possible horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
1. If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\):  
   \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\), and with \(x\) above \(z\), this yields \(x\) NW \(z\).
2. If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (which implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)):  
   \(x\)'s horizontal span is contained within \(z\)'s, and with \(x\) above \(z\), this yields \(x\) N \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B: Violate the vertical or horizontal constraints derived.
- Cases with horizontal overlap but no containment (e.g., \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)) do not satisfy any atomic relation's requirements, but such configurations are covered by the above cases when relations hold.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW and N.
