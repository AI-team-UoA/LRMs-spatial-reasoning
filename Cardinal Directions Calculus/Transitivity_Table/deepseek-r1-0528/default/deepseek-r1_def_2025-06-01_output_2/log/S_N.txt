PROMPT: Let S and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) S \(y\) implies \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) and horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box:  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies \(y\) is entirely above \(z\) and horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box (which is consistent as \(y\) is the reference):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

Combining the vertical constraints:  
\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) lie below \(\inf_y(y)\). The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their specific bounds:
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (implying \(x\) is above \(z\)).

Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are within \([\inf_x(y), \sup_x(y)]\), but their relative positions can vary:
- \(x\) could be left of, right of, or horizontally overlapping with \(z\).

Considering all cases:
1. **If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)):**
   - If \(x\) is left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), then \(x\) SW \(z\).
   - If \(x\) is right of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), then \(x\) SE \(z\).
   - If \(z\) horizontally covers \(x\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), then \(x\) S \(z\).

2. **If \(z\) is below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)):**
   - If \(x\) is left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), then \(x\) NW \(z\).
   - If \(x\) is right of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), then \(x\) NE \(z\).
   - If \(z\) horizontally covers \(x\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), then \(x\) N \(z\) (since \(x\) is above \(z\) and covered horizontally).

3. **Horizontal overlap without vertical separation or covering is not covered by the defined relations, so these cases are excluded.**

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are therefore SW, SE, S, NW, NE, N.  

**Final Answer:**  
SW, SE, S, NW, NE, N
