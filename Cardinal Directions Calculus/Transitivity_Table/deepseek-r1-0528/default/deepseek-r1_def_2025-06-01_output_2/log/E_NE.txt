PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NE (North East).

### Explanation:
- **x E y** implies:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y in the x-direction).
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y's y-interval contains x's y-interval).
- **y NE z** implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z in the x-direction).
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z in the y-direction).

Chaining these inequalities:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) define the relation **x NE z**. No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) is possible, as derived from the inequalities and the fact that regions have positive area (ensuring strict inequalities in bounds prevent other relations).

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

**Final Answer: NE**
