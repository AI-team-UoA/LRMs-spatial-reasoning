PROMPT: Let SW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining the horizontal conditions:
\[
\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z),
\]
so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is to the west of \(z\) (i.e., the horizontal relation is W, NW, or SW).

For the vertical conditions:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) are both \(\leq \inf_y(y)\).

Two cases arise based on the comparison of \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\):

1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**  
   Then \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which satisfies the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\).

2. **Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)**  
   Here, \(\inf_y(x)\) (the infimum of \(y\)-coordinates of \(x\)) must be considered:
   - **Subcase 2a: \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\)**  
     Then \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). With \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) W \(z\).
   - **Subcase 2b: \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\)**  
     This configuration does not fit any cardinal direction relation (e.g., SW requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), violated here; W requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), violated; NW requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), impossible since \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

Additionally, the equality case \(\sup_x(x) = \inf_x(z)\) was considered but ruled out for two-dimensional regions in REG, as they must have positive area, making bounding box degeneracies (like vertical lines) impossible.

Thus, the only possible relations are SW and W, corresponding to Case 1 and Subcase 2a, respectively.
