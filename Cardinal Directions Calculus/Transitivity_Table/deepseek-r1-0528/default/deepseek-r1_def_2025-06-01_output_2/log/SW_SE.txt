PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their relative positions in the x-direction, while \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) in the y-direction (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)). The possible cases are:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:  
   This satisfies the condition for \(x\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   Example: \(x\) [1, 2] in x, \(z\) [3, 4] in x.

2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   This satisfies the condition for \(x\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   Example: \(z\) [1, 2] in x, \(x\) [3, 4] in x.

3. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   This satisfies the condition for \(x\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Example: \(z\) [5, 8] in x, \(x\) [6, 7] in x.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S, SE
