PROMPT: Let NE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (x is north of y)

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (y is west of z)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (z is south of y)

From these, the vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as:
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This satisfies the vertical condition for relations where \(x\) is north of \(z\) (i.e., N, NE, NW).

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their bounding boxes:
- If \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) N \(z\).
- If \(z\) is entirely west of \(x\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)), then \(x\) NE \(z\).
- If \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) NW \(z\).

No other relations are possible because:
- B, S, SE, SW, E, W require incompatible vertical alignments (e.g., \(x\) south of \(z\) or vertical containment), which contradict \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, and NW.

**Answer: N, NE, NW**
