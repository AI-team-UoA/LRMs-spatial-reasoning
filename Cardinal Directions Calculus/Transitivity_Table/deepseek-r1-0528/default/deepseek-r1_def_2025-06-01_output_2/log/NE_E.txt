PROMPT: Let NE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are NE (North East) and E (East).

- **NE (North East)**: This occurs when \(z\) is completely below and to the left of \(x\). Specifically, from the relations:
  - \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - \(y\) E \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  Combining these, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (so \(z\) is left of \(x\)) and if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (so \(z\) is below \(x\)), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).

- **E (East)**: This occurs when \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\). From the relations:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) holds (as derived).
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment), and given that \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) from the relations, vertical containment can hold if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Then \(x\) is E of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible because:
- \(z\) is always to the left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), ruling out W, SW, NW, and S.
- Vertical relations do not allow for SE (requires \(x\) below \(z\), but \(y\) is below \(x\) and within \(z\) vertically, so \(x\) cannot be below \(z\)), N (requires \(z\) completely below \(x\), but vertical containment may prevent this), or B (requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s, but \(z\) is left of \(x\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE and E.
