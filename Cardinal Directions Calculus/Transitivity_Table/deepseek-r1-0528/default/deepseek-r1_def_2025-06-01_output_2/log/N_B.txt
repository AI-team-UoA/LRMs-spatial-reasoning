PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is above y),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (x is within the horizontal bounds of y).

- \(y\) is B of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is within the horizontal bounds of z),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is within the vertical bounds of z).

Combining these:

- **Horizontally**: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) → \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  - Thus, \(x\) is within the horizontal bounds of \(z\).

- **Vertically**:
  - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - Chaining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - The relation between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z)\) determines the vertical relation with \(z\).

**Possible cases for vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:

1. **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**:
   - Then \(x\) is within the vertical bounds of \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Combined with horizontal containment, this satisfies \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **If \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z)\)**:
   - Then \(x\) is entirely above \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Combined with horizontal containment, this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).

**No other relations are possible**:
- Horizontal containment rules out E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW (require horizontal displacement).
- If neither vertical condition holds (e.g., \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\)), the vertical overlap prevents S, NE, SE, etc., but the horizontal containment and vertical constraints from the premises ensure only B and N can occur.

**Examples**:
- **B example**: \(z = [0,10] \times [0,10]\), \(y = [2,8] \times [2,8]\), \(x = [2,8] \times [9,10]\). Here, \(x\) B \(z\).
- **N example**: \(z = [0,10] \times [0,10]\), \(y = [2,8] \times [2,8]\), \(x = [2,8] \times [12,15]\). Here, \(x\) N \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **N**.
