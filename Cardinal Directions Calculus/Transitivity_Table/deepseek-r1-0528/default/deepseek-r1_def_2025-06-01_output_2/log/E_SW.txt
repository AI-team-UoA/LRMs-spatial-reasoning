PROMPT: Let E and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S, SE, and SW.  

- **S (South)**: x is directly south of z.  
- **SE (South East)**: x is southeast of z.  
- **SW (South West)**: x is southwest of z.  

These relations are derived from the constraints:  
- From x E y: \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).  
- From y SW z: \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).  
- Combining: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x is south of z), but the x-coordinate relationship varies, allowing S, SE, or SW.  

Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are impossible due to the south constraint and region properties.  

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}}
