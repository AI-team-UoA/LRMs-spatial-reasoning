PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the spatial constraints.

- From \(x\) S \(y\):
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\)).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(y\)).

- From \(y\) NW \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\)).
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(y\)).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\), as \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Given that \(x\) is left of \(z\), the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are limited to those where \(x\) is west of \(z\): specifically, SW, W, or NW, depending on the vertical alignment.

- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(x\) is below \(z\). For example, if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **W (West)**: Possible if \(z\) is vertically within the bounding box of \(x\). For example, if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- **NW (North West)**: Possible if \(x\) is above \(z\). For example, if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Relations such as N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are impossible because:
- \(x\) is left of \(z\), so east relations (E, NE, SE) are excluded.
- \(x\) and \(z\) are both below \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other do not support north (N) or south (S) relations directly without horizontal alignment, which is not present.
- B (bounding box containment) is not possible due to the horizontal separation.

Thus, the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.
