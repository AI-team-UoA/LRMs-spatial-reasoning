PROMPT: Let B and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S (South) of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as follows:

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) S \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as they require additional constraints (e.g., horizontal displacement or vertical reversal) that contradict the derived conditions.

Thus, the only possible relation is **S**.
