PROMPT: Let B and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ SE } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. From \(y \text{ SE } z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), leading to \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

2. From \(y \text{ SE } z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), leading to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ SE } z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z is entirely to the west of x)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is entirely to the south of z)

No other relations (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) satisfy both constraints simultaneously. For example:
- **S** requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) contradicts \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) unless equality holds, which would require degenerate regions (not allowed in REG).
- **E** requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), contradicting \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **B** requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). However, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) contradicts \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (as above), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) contradicts \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) due to the non-degenerate nature of regions in REG.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **SE**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{SE}}
