PROMPT: Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The relation B (bounding box) is defined such that for regions \(a\) and \(b\), \(a \text{ B } b\) holds if and only if the minimum bounding box of \(a\) is contained within the minimum bounding box of \(b\). Specifically, this requires:
- \(\inf_x(b) \leq \inf_x(a)\)
- \(\sup_x(a) \leq \sup_x(b)\)
- \(\inf_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\)
- \(\sup_y(a) \leq \sup_y(b)\)

Given that region \(x\) is B of region \(y\) (\(x \text{ B } y\)) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\) (\(y \text{ B } z\)), the following inequalities hold:

From \(x \text{ B } y\):
1. \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
2. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
3. \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
4. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

From \(y \text{ B } z\):
5. \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
6. \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
7. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
8. \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From (5) and (1): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- From (2) and (6): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
- From (7) and (3): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- From (4) and (8): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

These combined inequalities satisfy the definition of \(x \text{ B } z\). Therefore, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be B. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW) can hold simultaneously under the given conditions, as they would violate the bounding box containment derived from the transitivity of the B relation.

Thus, the only possible relation is **B**.
