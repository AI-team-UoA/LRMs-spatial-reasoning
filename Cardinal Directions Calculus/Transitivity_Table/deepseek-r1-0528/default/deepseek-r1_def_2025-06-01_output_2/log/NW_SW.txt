PROMPT: Let NW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW. This is derived from the inequalities defining the relations:

- From x NW y: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- From y SW z: \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning x is west of z.
- The y-coordinate relation between x and z can vary:
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then x is north of z, resulting in x NW z.
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then x is south of z, resulting in x SW z.
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then x is west of z with vertical alignment, resulting in x W z.

All three relations (NW, W, SW) are possible depending on the specific positions of the regions, and no other relations are possible due to the west constraint from the x-coordinate inequality.

**Possible relations:** NW, W, SW
