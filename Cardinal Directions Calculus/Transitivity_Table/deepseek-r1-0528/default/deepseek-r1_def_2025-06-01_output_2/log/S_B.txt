PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B (bounding box) of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S and B.

### Reasoning:
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

#### Horizontal Constraints:
- Combining the inequalities: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- This means \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(z\) (i.e., the x-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\)).

#### Vertical Constraints:
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), implying \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) always holds.
- However, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so the relative positions of \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) depend on the specific values:
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) S \(z\) holds because \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and the horizontal constraints satisfy the S relation.
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) B \(z\) holds because \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), and the horizontal constraints are satisfied.
- The relation N (North) is impossible because \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) cannot hold for 2D regions with positive area.
- Relations requiring horizontal misalignment (e.g., E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) are impossible due to the horizontal containment.

#### Conclusion:
The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S and B, depending on the vertical positioning:
- S is possible when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- B is possible when \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations are S and B.

**Final Answer: S, B**
