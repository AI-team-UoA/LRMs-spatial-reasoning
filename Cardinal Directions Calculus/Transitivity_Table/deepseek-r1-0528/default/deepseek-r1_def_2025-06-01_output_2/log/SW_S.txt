PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (vertically, \(x\) is below \(z\)).
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), so \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of or at \(\text{inf}_x(y)\)).

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{sup}_x(x)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z)\):
1. If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\):
   - Then \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) horizontally, and with \(x\) below \(z\), this satisfies SW: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) SW \(z\) is possible.
2. If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\) (and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\)):
   - Additionally, if \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (so \(z\)'s left bound is left of or equal to \(x\)'s left bound), and since \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)), we have \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\). With \(x\) below \(z\), this satisfies S: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) S \(z\) is possible.

Other relations (like SE, W, etc.) are not possible because:
- \(x\) cannot be east of \(z\) since \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), so \(x\) is not right of \(z\).
- Vertical relations (N, NE, NW) are invalid as \(x\) is below \(z\).
- B (bounding box) requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s box vertically, but \(x\) is below, not within.
- In cases where \(\text{inf}_x(x) < \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\), no basic relation fits (e.g., not S due to horizontal left bound, not SW due to horizontal overlap), but such configurations still allow the possibilities of SW and S in other cases.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and S.
