PROMPT: Let E and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely to the east of y),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y's bounds).

- \(y\) B \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is horizontally within z's bounds),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y is vertically within z's bounds).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraints**:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - However, \(\sup_x(z)\) could be:
     - **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning z is entirely to the west of x.
     - **Case 2**: \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\), meaning x starts within z's horizontal span.

2. **Vertical constraints**:
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so x is vertically within z's bounds.

**Possible relations between x and z**:

- **Case 1** (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)):
  - Horizontally: z is entirely west of x (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
  - Vertically: x is within z's bounds.
  - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\).

- **Case 2** (\(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\)):
  - Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(z)\).
  - Vertically: x is within z's bounds.
  - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then x is entirely within z's bounding box, satisfying \(x\) B \(z\).
  - No other cardinal relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW) are possible because:
    - Vertical constraints prevent x from being entirely north or south of z.
    - Horizontal constraints prevent x from being entirely west or diagonal relations (e.g., \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) rules out SE, NE, E, etc.).

Thus, the possible relations are **E** (when z is west of x) and **B** (when x is within z's bounding box).

**Answer**: B, E
