PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are determined by the relative positions derived from the definitions.

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) E \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\). Also, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), with \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) implying \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y)\).

The relations N, NE, and NW are impossible because they require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\), violating the condition.

The other relations are possible under specific configurations:
- **SW**: \(x\) can be southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) and \(z\) positioned such that \(x\) is left and below \(z\)).
- **S**: \(x\) can be south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) below \(z\) with \(z\)'s x-projection containing \(x\)'s).
- **SE**: \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right and below \(z\)).
- **E**: \(x\) can be east of \(z\) (e.g., \(z\) left of \(x\) with vertical containment).
- **W**: \(x\) can be west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\) with vertical containment).
- **B**: \(x\) can have its bounding box contained in \(z\)'s (e.g., full containment in both directions).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, SE, E, W, and B.
