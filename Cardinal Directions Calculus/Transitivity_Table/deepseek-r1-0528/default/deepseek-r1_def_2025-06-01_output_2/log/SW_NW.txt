PROMPT: Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the following relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:

- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the left and below \(z\).  
  This is possible because \(x\) is left of \(y\) and below \(y\), while \(y\) is left of \(z\) and above \(z\). Thus, \(x\) can be positioned to the left and below \(z\).

- **W (West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\), with the vertical extent of \(x\) contained within that of \(z\).  
  This is possible if \(z\) vertically spans an interval that includes the vertical interval of \(x\), while \(x\) remains left of \(z\).

- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) is entirely to the left and above \(z\).  
  This is possible because \(x\) is below \(y\), but \(z\) is below \(y\), allowing \(x\) to be positioned above \(z\) while both are left-aligned relative to the horizontal axis.

These relations satisfy the bounding box constraints derived from the given conditions:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) ensures \(x\) is left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), but their relative vertical positions can vary to allow SW, W, or NW.

Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, B) are not possible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the lack of vertical containment or alignment required by those relations.

Thus, the possible relations are **SW, W, NW**.
