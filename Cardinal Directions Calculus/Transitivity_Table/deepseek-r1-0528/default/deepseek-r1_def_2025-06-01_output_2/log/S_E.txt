PROMPT: Let S and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SE (South East) and E (East).

- **SE (South East)** is possible when \(x\) is completely below and to the right of \(z\), with no vertical or horizontal overlap in their bounding boxes.
- **E (East)** is possible when \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically contained within the y-range of \(z\)'s bounding box.

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible due to the constraints:
- Horizontally, \(x\) must be to the right of \(z\) (since \(y\) is east of \(z\) and \(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)).
- Vertically, \(x\) is below \(y\), and \(y\) is vertically within \(z\), but \(x\) may or may not be below \(z\) entirely or vertically contained.

Thus, the possible relations are SE and E.
