PROMPT: Let SW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints and examples below:

- **SW (South West)**: Example:  
  \(z\): bounding box \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
  \(y\): bounding box \([0, 1] \times [0, 1]\),  
  \(x\): bounding box \([-2, -1] \times [-2, -1]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is entirely left and below \(z\), satisfying SW:  
  \(\sup_x(x) = -1 \leq \inf_x(z) = 0\) and \(\sup_y(x) = -1 \leq \inf_y(z) = 0\).

- **S (South)**: Example:  
  \(z\): bounding box \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
  \(y\): bounding box \([1, 2] \times [3, 4]\),  
  \(x\): bounding box \([0, 1] \times [-2, -1]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally aligned within \(z\)'s x-bounds, satisfying S:  
  \(\sup_y(x) = -1 \leq \inf_y(z) = 0\), \(\inf_x(z) = 0 \leq \inf_x(x) = 0\), and \(\sup_x(x) = 1 \leq \sup_x(z) = 10\).

- **W (West)**: Example:  
  \(z\): bounding box \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
  \(y\): bounding box \([5, 6] \times [5, 6]\),  
  \(x\): bounding box \([-2, -1] \times [3, 4]\).  
  Here, \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically aligned within \(z\)'s y-bounds, satisfying W:  
  \(\sup_x(x) = -1 \leq \inf_x(z) = 0\), \(\inf_y(z) = 0 \leq \inf_y(x) = 3\), and \(\sup_y(x) = 4 \leq \sup_y(z) = 10\).

- **B (Bounding box)**: Example:  
  \(z\): bounding box \([0, 10] \times [0, 10]\),  
  \(y\): bounding box \([5, 6] \times [5, 6]\),  
  \(x\): bounding box \([4, 4.5] \times [4, 4.5]\).  
  Here, \(x\)'s bounding box is entirely within \(z\)'s, satisfying B:  
  \(\inf_x(z) = 0 \leq \inf_x(x) = 4\), \(\sup_x(x) = 4.5 \leq \sup_x(z) = 10\), \(\inf_y(z) = 0 \leq \inf_y(x) = 4\), and \(\sup_y(x) = 4.5 \leq \sup_y(z) = 10\).

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW) are impossible due to contradictions in the constraints:
- **N, NE, NW**: Require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is bounded by \(z\)'s top, forcing \(x\) below \(z\).
- **E, SE**: Require \(x\) right of \(z\), but \(x\) is left of \(y\) and \(y\) is bounded by \(z\)'s right, forcing \(x\) left or overlapping horizontally.

Thus, the possible relations are **SW, S, W, B**.
