PROMPT: Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the following conditions hold based on the definition of NW:

- \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

These combined conditions, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), exactly define the NW relation. Therefore, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is NW.

\boxed{\text{NW}}
