PROMPT: Let SE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

From these:
- \(y\) is above \(z\) and \(x\) is below \(y\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\).
- \(y\) is left of \(x\) (since SE requires \(y\) entirely left of \(x\)).
- \(z\) horizontally spans at least the width of \(y\) (since \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Horizontal alignment**:
   - **Case A**: \(\text{sup}_x(z) < \text{inf}_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) left of \(x\)).
     - **NW**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (\(z\) above \(x\)).
     - **SW**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (\(z\) below \(x\)).
     - **W**: If \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{sup}_y(x)\) (\(z\) vertically within \(x\)'s span).
   - **Case B**: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \geq \text{sup}_x(x)\) (\(z\) horizontally covers \(x\)).
     - **B**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (\(z\) vertically contains \(x\)).
     - **N**: If \(\text{inf}_x(z) = \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (\(z\) above \(x\) with aligned left boundaries).
     - **S**: If \(\text{inf}_x(z) = \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (\(z\) below \(x\) with aligned left boundaries).

### Excluded relations:
- **E**, **NE**, **SE**: Require \(z\) east of \(x\), but constraints place \(z\) west or covering \(x\) horizontally.
- **Partial horizontal overlap** (e.g., \(\text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z) < \text{sup}_x(x)\)) does not fit any defined relation.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, S, NW, SW, W**.
