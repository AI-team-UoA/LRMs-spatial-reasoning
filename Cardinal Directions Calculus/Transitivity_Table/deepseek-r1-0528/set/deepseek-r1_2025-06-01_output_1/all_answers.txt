For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely above \(y\))  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\)'s x-interval is contained within \(y\)'s x-interval).  

- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely above \(z\))  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\)'s x-interval is contained within \(z\)'s x-interval).  

Combining these:  
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
- Horizontally:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  

Thus, for \(x\) and \(z\):  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical condition for N),  
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal condition for N).  

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) being N of \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (NE, NW, E, W, S, SE, SW, B) can hold simultaneously under these constraints due to:  
- Vertical constraints ensuring \(x\) is above \(z\),  
- Horizontal constraints ensuring containment,  
- Mutual exclusivity of the relations.  

Thus, the only possible relation is **N**.  

**Answer: N**
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these constraints:  
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(x\) is left of \(z\).  
2. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
3. \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but no direct constraint between \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x)\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
- **NW (North West)**: Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This is possible if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (e.g., \(z\)'s top is at or below \(x\)'s bottom).  
- **W (West)**: Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This is possible if \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\) (e.g., \(z\)'s top is at or above \(x\)'s top, with \(x\) vertically within \(z\)'s bounds).

Other relations are not possible:  
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **N**, **NE**, **E**, **SE** violate the constraints (e.g., horizontal separation or vertical ordering).  
- The vertical overlap where \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\) does not fit any defined relation, but NW and W are achievable under specific configurations.

Thus, the possible relations are **NW** and **W**.  

**Answer: NW, W**
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) N \(y\): 
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\) vertically).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box).
- From \(y\) E \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(y\) horizontally).
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(y\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).
- Vertically: 
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) from \(x\) N \(y\)), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  - This implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but the relative positions of \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z)\) vary.

Possible vertical scenarios:
1. **NE (North East)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely below \(x\). Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).
2. **E (East)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box. Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\), this gives \(x\) E \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- SE requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), leading to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), implying \(\inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x)\), impossible for a region in REG.
- N, S, W, SW, NW, B violate the horizontal or vertical constraints derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}}
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are N, S, or B. This is derived from the constraints of the bounding boxes:

- From \(x\) N \(y\), we have \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) S \(z\), we have \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these, the horizontal bounds satisfy \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning \(x\)'s bounding box is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s bounding box. The vertical relationship depends on the specific bounds:

- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is S of \(z\).
- If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).

Diagonal relations (e.g., NE, SE, SW, NW) and pure east/west (E, W) are impossible due to the horizontal containment. Therefore, the possible relations are N, S, and B.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (the entire \(y\) is below \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (the entire \(y\) is left of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (the entire \(z\) is below \(y\)).

Combining these constraints:

1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

2. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Chaining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\).

The relation NW is defined as:
- \(a\) NW \(b\) if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).

Here, for \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (satisfies the horizontal condition for NW),
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfies the vertical condition for NW).

Thus, \(x\) must be NW of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible under these constraints because:
- They require conditions that contradict the derived vertical and horizontal separations (e.g., S or SW would require \(z\) above or overlapping vertically, which is not the case; E or W would require horizontal overlap or opposite alignment; B requires containment, but \(x\) and \(z\) are disjoint and separated).

Therefore, the only possible relation is **NW**.
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW. This is determined by the constraints from the given relations:

- From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). Thus, x is above y and horizontally within the extent of y.
- From y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). Thus, y is to the left and below z.

Combining these:
- Horizontally, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is entirely to the left of z.
- Vertically, the relative positions of the y-coordinates can vary, leading to different possible relations between x and z.

The possible relations are:
- **SW (South West)**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is left and below z.
- **W (West)**: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is left of z and vertically within z's range.
- **NW (North West)**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is left and above z.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible because:
- x is always left of z, so relations requiring x to be to the right (E, NE, SE), below (S), or horizontally aligned (N, B) cannot hold.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \boxed{\text{W}} \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the bounding box inequalities.

- From x N y:  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x)  
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x starts at or right of y's start)  
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x ends at or left of y's end)  

- From y SE z:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is left of y)  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)  

Combining these:  
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning z is entirely to the left of x.  
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), but no direct relation between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).  

Given that z is left of x, the possible relations for x relative to z are those where x is to the east of z: E (East), NE (North East), or SE (South East).  

- **NE (North East)**: Possible if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x).  
- **E (East)**: Possible if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x is vertically within the y-range of z).  
- **SE (South East)**: Possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (z is above x).  

Numerical examples confirm each is possible under the given constraints:  
- NE: e.g., y: supy(y)=0; z: infy(z)=0, supy(z)=1; x: infy(x)=2, supy(x)=3.  
- E: e.g., y: supy(y)=0; z: infy(z)=1, supy(z)=3; x: infy(x)=1.5, supy(x)=2.5.  
- SE: e.g., y: supy(y)=0; z: infy(z)=2, supy(z)=3; x: infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1.  

Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are impossible because:  
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) prevents x from being west of z or having overlapping/containing x-ranges required for N, S, B, etc.  

Thus, the possible relations are NE, E, and SE.

\boxed{\text{NE}} \boxed{\text{E}} \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).

From \(y\) NE of \(z\):  
- \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\)  
- \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\)  

From \(x\) N of \(y\):  
- \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)  
- \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\)  
- \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\)  

Chaining the inequalities:  
- **Vertical direction**: \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), so \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
- **Horizontal direction**: \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).  

The relation \(x\) NE of \(z\) is defined by \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), which are both satisfied.  

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:  
- **N, S, E, W, B, NW, SE, SW** require conditions that conflict with the derived inequalities (e.g., horizontal overlap for N/S, vertical containment for E/W, or specific bounds not met).  

Thus, the only possible relation is **NE**.  

**Answer: NE**
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: Given that region \(x\) is North (N) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is bounding box (B) of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_y(z)\) relative to \(\inf_y(x)\):
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) N \(z\) holds because:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical condition for N),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal conditions for N).
- If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) B \(z\) may hold if additionally \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), because:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) are already satisfied,
  - and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) completes the conditions for B.

Other cardinal direction relations (e.g., S, E, NE) are impossible due to the horizontal alignment and vertical constraints derived from the given relations. Specifically:
- Horizontal alignment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) precludes relations like E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.
- Vertical constraints (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)) preclude relations like S.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N or B.

\boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and from \(x\) W \(y\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). Combining these, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically, so the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must involve \(x\) being north of \(z\) (N, NE, or NW). However, horizontal constraints determine the specific relation.

Horizontal analysis:
- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
- Combining: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).

Two cases for horizontal alignment between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)**:  
   - \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) horizontally.
   - Vertically, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) holds.
   - This matches NW: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\), defined by \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

2. **If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (and automatically \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\) due to bounding boxes, and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) from constraints)**:  
   - \(x\) is horizontally within the west-east bounds of \(z\).
   - Vertically, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) holds.
   - This matches N: \(x\) is north of \(z\), defined by \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **NE** requires \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), but constraints imply \(\text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \geq \text{inf}_x(x)\), making NE impossible.
- **B, S, SW, W, E, SE** either contradict the vertical relation (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)) or horizontal constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **NW**.

**Answer: N, NW**
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Based on the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is West (W) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is West (W) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - From \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), we have \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) match the definition of the West (W) relation for \(x\) relative to \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, SW, B) satisfies all these constraints simultaneously under the given conditions. For example:
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) (equality only in degenerate cases, not generally).
- Other relations (like NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, B) conflict with the horizontal or vertical bounds derived.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: Given that region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z can be any of the nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B. This is because both x and z are positioned west of y (due to x W y and y E z implying z is west of y), and their vertical positions relative to each other can vary within the constraints of the relations. All combinations of horizontal and vertical alignments are possible, allowing for any of the defined cardinal direction relations to hold between x and z.

- **N**: x can be north of z if z is below and horizontally contained by x.  
- **NE**: x can be northeast of z if z is southwest of x.  
- **E**: x can be east of z if z is west of x.  
- **SE**: x can be southeast of z if z is northwest of x.  
- **S**: x can be south of z if z is above and horizontally contained by x.  
- **SW**: x can be southwest of z if z is northeast of x.  
- **W**: x can be west of z if z is east of x.  
- **NW**: x can be northwest of z if z is southeast of x.  
- **B**: x can be within the bounding box of z, or vice versa, depending on their extents.  

Thus, no relation is excluded based on the given conditions.

**Possible relations:** N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these constraints:

1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

2. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

The possible horizontal scenarios are:
- **Case 1: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**.
  - Here, \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).
  - Combined with \(x\) being below \(z\), this satisfies the SW relation: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **Case 2: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**.
  - Here, the left bound of \(z\) is left of or equal to the left bound of \(x\).
  - Also, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
  - Combined with \(x\) being below \(z\), this satisfies the S relation: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **SE** requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\), violating SE.
- **B** requires vertical containment \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is only possible if equality holds, which would imply zero vertical extent for \(x\), contradicting the requirement that regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk (having positive area).
- **N, NE, NW, W, E** are ruled out by the vertical constraint \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which implies \(x\) cannot be above \(z\) or have other vertical overlaps.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and S.

**Final Answer: SW, S**
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

### Explanation:
- From x W y:  
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)  
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y's vertical range contains or is aligned with x's vertical range; specifically, y is not south of x).
- From y NW z:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)  
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y).

Chaining the horizontal inequalities:  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) → supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is west of z.

Chaining the vertical inequalities:  
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) → supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning z is south of x (so x is north of z).

Thus, x is both west and north of z, satisfying the definition of x NW z:  
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) is possible due to the strict inequalities derived from the regions having positive area (as they are homeomorphic to a closed disk), which prevents vertical or horizontal alignment that would allow other relations.

Therefore, the only possible relation is **NW**.
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions and the given relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  

- \(y\) is SW of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

Combining these:  
- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (by definition of bounds), it follows that:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  

- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x\) being SW of \(z\).  

No other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, NW, W, B) are possible because:  
- For W, NW, or S: Requires additional constraints (e.g., vertical alignment) that are not satisfied here.  
- For others: The combined bounds force \(x\) strictly southwest of \(z\) without overlap or other alignments.  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.  

**Answer: SW**
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y's bounds)

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **\(x\) left of \(z\)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\) (below and left).
2. **\(z\) left of \(x\)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is SE of \(z\) (below and right, since \(z\) is left of \(x\)).
3. **Horizontal containment**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is S of \(z\) (below and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds).

These cover the possible cases where the vertical condition (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) is satisfied. Configurations exist for each:
- **SW**: Arrange \(x\) entirely left of \(z\).
- **SE**: Arrange \(z\) entirely left of \(x\).
- **S**: Arrange \(z\)'s horizontal bounds to contain \(x\)'s.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S, SE
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and vertically, \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(y\) and vertically within the span of \(y\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\). This means \(y\) is to the right and above \(z\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\).
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

For the relation from \(x\) to \(z\):
- \(z\) is below \(x\), so the vertical condition for relations where \(x\) is above \(z\) is satisfied: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- The horizontal relation depends on the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\):
  - If \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
  - If \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
  - If \(z\) is horizontally within \(x\) (\(\text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\)), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as demonstrated by configurations that satisfy the initial conditions:
- **NW example**: \(x\) in \([0, 3] \times [5, 7]\), \(z\) in \([4, 6] \times [0, 4.5]\), \(y\) appropriately set.
- **N example**: \(x\) in \([5, 10] \times [6, 8]\), \(z\) in \([5, 10] \times [0, 5]\), \(y\) appropriately set.
- **NE example**: \(x\) in \([4, 6] \times [5, 7]\), \(z\) in \([0, 3] \times [0, 4.5]\), \(y\) appropriately set.

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are NW, N, and NE.

**Final Answer**  
NW, N, NE
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Given that region x is W (West) of region y and region y is B (bounding box) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are W (West) and B (bounding box).

### Explanation:
- **x is W of y**: This means that the right edge of x is less than or equal to the left edge of y (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(y)), and x is vertically within the bounds of y (i.e., infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).
- **y is B of z**: This means that the bounding box of z contains the bounding box of y (i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

From these relations:
- The vertical bounds of x are contained within the vertical bounds of z because infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This vertical containment means that x cannot be directly north, south, or in any diagonal direction (e.g., NE, NW, SE, SW) relative to z, as those require vertical separation.
- The horizontal position between x and z depends on the relative values of infx(z) and supx(x):
  - If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is W of z (since the vertical containment is already satisfied).
  - If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (which is true from the relations), then x is B of z (as the vertical containment is also satisfied).
- It is impossible for x to be E (East) of z because supx(z) ≥ supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) ≥ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) cannot hold (it would require regions to be points, which is not the case for regions homeomorphic to disks).

Thus, the possible relations from x to z are W or B.

**Possible relations: W, B**
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is to the east of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (vertically, \(x\) is within the bounds of \(y\))
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertically, \(y\) is north of \(z\))
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is within the bounds of \(z\))

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), so \(x\) must be north of \(z\) in some form (N, NE, or NW).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\))
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\))

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_x(z)\) relative to \(\inf_x(x)\):
1. **If \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\)**:
   - \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\) (since \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
   - Combined with \(z\) being below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\).
2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\)**:
   - There is potential horizontal overlap or containment.
   - Additionally, if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) imply \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).
   - Combined with \(z\) being below \(x\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).
   - If \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\), no defined cardinal direction fits, but this case does not yield a valid relation among the nine.

Other relations (e.g., NW, E, B) are impossible:
- **NW** would require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) makes this degenerate (non-standard for regions homeomorphic to a disk).
- **E**, **W**, **S**, **SE**, **SW**, **B** violate the vertical condition (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) ensures \(x\) is above \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **NE**.

**Answer: N, NE**
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these constraints:
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). This means the vertical projection of \(x\) is contained within the vertical projection of \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

Possible horizontal scenarios between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Disjoint with \(x\) left of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This satisfies the conditions for \(x\) W \(z\) (West relation), as:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from above)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from above)

2. **Disjoint with \(x\) right of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This satisfies the conditions for \(x\) E \(z\) (East relation), as:
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

3. **Overlap with horizontal containment of \(x\) in \(z\)**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). This satisfies the conditions for \(x\) B \(z\) (bounding box relation), as:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Other relations (N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW) are impossible because:
- They require specific vertical disjointness (e.g., \(x\) above or below \(z\)), but the vertical constraints force containment, not disjointness.
- For example, \(x\) N \(z\) requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), making it impossible for \(z\) to be entirely below \(x\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, E, W**.

**Final Answer: B, E, W**
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Given that region x is E (East) of region y and region y is E (East) of region z, the relation between x and z must be E (East). This is derived from the transitive properties of the cardinal direction relations:

- From x E y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- From y E z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Chaining these:
- For the x-direction: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) imply supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- For the y-direction: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) implies infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) implies supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Thus, the conditions for x E z are satisfied:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is left of x),
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x is vertically within z).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible, as they violate the derived inequalities or the vertical containment.

\boxed{\text{E}}
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely left of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is vertically within \(y\)).

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(z\)),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is horizontally within \(z\)).

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) S \(z\)).
  - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the horizontal bound \(\sup_x(x)\) relative to \(\sup_x(z)\):

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:
   - Horizontally, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).
   - Vertically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - This matches the definition of \(x\) S \(z\).

2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:
   - Horizontally, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).
   - Vertically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - This matches the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\).

Cases where \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) do not fit any atomic relation as defined, as \(x\) is not entirely within \(z\) horizontally, nor entirely to the left or right. However, the possible relations that **can** occur (based on satisfiable conditions) are S and SE.

**Possible relations: S, SE**
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) NW \(z\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\text{sup}_x(y)\).
- Vertically, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their horizontal alignment:
1. **NW relation**: If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\), and with \(x\) above \(z\), \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
2. **N relation**: If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(z\), and with \(x\) above \(z\), \(x\) is N of \(z\).
3. **NE relation**: If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\), and with \(x\) above \(z\), \(x\) is NE of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, given the vertical constraint forces \(x\) above \(z\), and the horizontal alignment can vary. Other relations (e.g., S, SW, SE, E, W, B) are incompatible with \(x\) being above \(z\) or the given constraints.

**Possible relations: NW, N, NE**
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SW of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From \(x\) E \(y\), \(x\) is to the east of \(y\) and vertically contained within \(y\)'s y-bounds. From \(y\) SW \(z\), \(y\) is to the southwest of \(z\), so \(z\) is northeast of \(y\). Combining these:

- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (south in cardinal terms).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(y\)'s right edge (\(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)), but their relative horizontal positions can vary:
  - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) → relation is SW.
  - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) → relation is SE.
  - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds → relation is S.

No other relations are possible because:
- Vertically, \(x\) must be below \(z\) (due to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), ruling out N, NE, E, NW, W, B.
- The horizontal constraints only allow SW, SE, or S, depending on the alignment.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, SE.
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these constraints:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   From \(y\) SE \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), leading to \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This means \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) (east).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   From \(y\) SE \(z\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This means \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (south).

The combined direction of \(x\) being east and south of \(z\) corresponds to the **SE (South East)** relation. Specifically, the conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) satisfies both constraints simultaneously:
- **S** requires \(x\) to be within the horizontal bounds of \(z\), but \(x\) is entirely to the right.
- **E** requires \(x\) to be within the vertical bounds of \(z\), but \(x\) is entirely below.
- **B** requires \(x\) to be within both horizontal and vertical bounds of \(z\), which is not true.
- Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW) do not align with the derived east and south positioning.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **SE**.

**Answer: SE**
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\)) and  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) vertically contains \(x\)).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the east of \(z\)) and  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the north of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\).
- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the north of \(z\).

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\):  
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (east condition),  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (north condition).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) is possible, as they violate either the horizontal or vertical constraints derived. For example:
- **E** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but we have \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z)\), violating E.
- **N** requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but we have \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), violating horizontal containment.
- **SE** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(z)\), violating SE.

Thus, the only possible relation is **NE**.
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: Based on the given relations and definitions:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\): \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

From \(y\) B \(z\), the bounding box of \(y\) is contained within that of \(z\), so \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and vertically \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\). Combining with above, \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), so vertically, \(x\) is contained within \(z\)'s bounds.

Horizontally:
- \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\)).

Now, consider possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)**:  
   Horizontally, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).  
   Vertically, \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **If \(\text{inf}_x(x) \geq \text{sup}_x(z)\)**:  
   Horizontally, \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).  
   Vertically, \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) E \(z\).

Cases where \(\text{inf}_x(x) < \text{sup}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) > \text{sup}_x(z)\) do not satisfy any atomic relation due to horizontal overlap and lack of vertical misalignment, but the question asks for possible relations. The scenarios above are achievable with appropriate region placements (e.g., \(x\) fully inside \(z\)'s box for B, or \(x\) entirely to the east of \(z\) for E).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B and E.

**Answer: B, E**
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is \(S\) of \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- \(y\) is \(N\) of \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these, the vertical constraints are:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\).

The horizontal constraints are:
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so the \(x\)-projection of \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-projection of \(z\).

Possible vertical arrangements between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **\(x\) entirely above \(z\)**: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) is \(N\) of \(z\) (\(x\ N\ z\)), as:
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from horizontal constraints).

2. **\(x\) entirely below \(z\)**: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) is \(S\) of \(z\) (\(x\ S\ z\)), as:
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from horizontal constraints).

3. **Bounding box containment**: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) is \(B\) of \(z\) (\(x\ B\ z\)), as:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Other relations (e.g., \(E\), \(W\), \(NE\), etc.) are impossible due to the horizontal containment. Examples confirm \(N\), \(S\), and \(B\) are achievable:
- \(x\ N\ z\): When \(z\) is below \(x\).
- \(x\ S\ z\): When \(x\) is below \(z\).
- \(x\ B\ z\): When \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N, S, B**.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\), and the \(x\)-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely left of \(z\), and the \(y\)-interval of \(y\) is contained within that of \(z\).

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal constraint**:  
   From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) W \(z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) horizontally.

2. **Vertical constraint**:  
   - From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) W \(z\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but the position of \(\sup_y(x)\) relative to \(\inf_y(z)\) depends on specific cases.

Possible cases for the vertical direction:

- **Case 1**: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (top of \(x\) is below bottom of \(z\)).  
  Combined with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies the SW (South West) relation:  
  \(x\) SW \(z\).

- **Case 2**: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (top of \(x\) is above bottom of \(z\) but still below \(y\)), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (bottom of \(x\) is not below bottom of \(z\)).  
  Then:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (left constraint),  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment).  
  This satisfies the W (West) relation: \(x\) W \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **NW, N, NE**: Require \(z\) below or above \(x\), but \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is not constrained to be below \(z\) vertically in a way that forces \(z\) above \(x\).
- **S, SE**: Require \(x\) below \(z\), but \(\sup_y(x)\) may be above \(\inf_y(z)\) (Case 2).
- **E, NE, SE**: Require \(z\) left of \(x\), but \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- **B**: Requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box, but horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) prevents this.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **W**.

**Final Answer**  
SW, W
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal condition).
- Vertically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), leading to two cases for the vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Case 1: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**  
  This satisfies the conditions for SE:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

**Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\)**  
  Additionally, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  
  - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then the vertical containment for E holds: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Combined with the horizontal condition, \(x\) is E of \(z\).  
  - If \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\), no defined relation fits perfectly, but in practice, given the constraints and connectedness of regions, configurations consistently reduce to SE or E. Attempts to achieve other relations (e.g., vertical overlap without containment) either violate premises or yield no valid cardinal relation among the nine.

Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW, S, B) are incompatible:
- N, NE require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is within \(z\) vertically, forcing \(x\) below \(z\).
- S requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which conflicts with Case 2.
- W, SW require \(x\) west of \(z\), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(x\) east of \(z\).
- B requires full containment, violated horizontally.
- NW has horizontal and vertical conflicts.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SE and E**.

**Answer: SE, E**
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, the relation between x and z must be S. This is determined by the transitive nature of the S relation under the given cardinal direction definitions, as the inequalities derived from the bounding boxes enforce that x is directly south of z with x contained within the x-bounds of z.

- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- From y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
- Chaining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- Also, infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- And supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- These satisfy the conditions for x S z: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as they violate the derived inequalities or require additional conditions not met here.

Thus, the only possible relation is S.

**S**
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the bounding box inequalities.

From \(x\) S \(y\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is south of \(y\))
- \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)

From \(y\) NW \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is west of \(z\))
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is south of \(y\))

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are south of \(y\), with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their y-bounds relative to each other:
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is north and west of \(z\), so \(x\) NW \(z\).
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is south and west of \(z\), so \(x\) SW \(z\).
- If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is west of \(z\) with vertical containment, so \(x\) W \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- \(x\) cannot be directly north (N), northeast (NE), east (E), southeast (SE), or south (S) of \(z\) because \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- \(x\) cannot be bounding box (B) of \(z\) or vice versa due to separation.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\) means:
  - \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\),
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and
  - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).

- \(y\) is SW of \(z\) means:
  - \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), and
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\).

Combining these:

- From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).
- From \(y\) SW \(z\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\).
- Thus, \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), so \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\).

- From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- From \(y\) SW \(z\), \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).
- Thus, \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), so \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).

These conditions \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) match the definition of SW. Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.

**Answer:** SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) and horizontally within the x-range of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the right and below \(z\).

Combining these:  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) is below \(z\).  
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) is to the right of \(z\).  

This satisfies the definition of SE:  
\(x\) SE \(z\) requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which both hold.  

No other relations (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) are possible, as they would violate the combined constraints (e.g., \(x\) cannot be above, left, or within the bounding box of \(z\) given the below and right positioning).

Thus, the only possible relation is **SE**.  

**Answer: SE**
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are E (East), NE (North East), and SE (South East).

- **E (East)**: This occurs when x is directly to the east of z with vertical containment (i.e., the y-range of x is within the y-range of z).
- **NE (North East)**: This occurs when x is to the northeast of z (i.e., x is entirely to the right and above z).
- **SE (South East)**: This occurs when x is to the southeast of z (i.e., x is entirely to the right and below z).

These relations are possible due to the constraints from x S y and y NE z, which force x to be east of z, but allow for variation in the vertical position (above, below, or aligned with z). Other relations (such as N, S, W, etc.) are impossible because x must be east of z based on the given conditions.

E, NE, SE
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- **Horizontal constraints**:  
  From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).  
  From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).  
  Combining: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\).

- **Vertical constraints**:  
  From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
  From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
  This implies \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), but the vertical position relative to \(\text{inf}_y(z)\) varies.

Two cases arise based on the vertical alignment:

1. **Case 1**: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).  
   Here, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) vertically, and with horizontal containment, the relation \(x\) S \(z\) holds.  
   Example:  
   - \(y\): bounding box \([2, 3] \times [4, 5]\).  
   - \(z\): bounding box \([1, 4] \times [4, 6]\) (so \(y\) B \(z\)).  
   - \(x\): bounding box \([2, 3] \times [1, 3.5]\) (so \(x\) S \(y\), and \(x\) S \(z\)).

2. **Case 2**: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{sup}_y(x)\).  
   Here, vertical overlap occurs, and the relation depends on the infimum of \(y\)-coordinates:  
   - **Subcase 2a**: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).  
     Vertical containment holds: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). With horizontal containment, \(x\) B \(z\) holds.  
     Example:  
     - \(y\): \([2, 3] \times [4, 5]\).  
     - \(z\): \([1, 4] \times [2, 6]\) (so \(y\) B \(z\)).  
     - \(x\): \([2, 3] \times [2.5, 3.5]\) (so \(x\) S \(y\), and \(x\) B \(z\)).  
   - **Subcase 2b**: \(\text{inf}_y(x) < \text{inf}_y(z)\).  
     Vertical containment fails, and no other cardinal relation (N, NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW) applies due to horizontal containment or vertical overlap constraints. This case does not yield any of the defined relations.

Thus, the only possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) that satisfy the conditions and the defined cardinal directions are **S** and **B**.

**Answer: S, B**
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From these, the following constraints are derived:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the horizontal alignment:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - This implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - This matches the definition of NW: \(x\) is NW of \(z\).

2. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)** (which implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) due to the constraints):
   - The vertical condition \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) holds.
   - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then the horizontal conditions for N are satisfied: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
   - This matches the definition of N: \(x\) is N of \(z\).
   - The case where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\) is inconsistent with the atomic relations (as it violates the bounding box conditions for any relation), so it does not occur.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW and N.

**Answer**: NW, N
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW (North West) and W (West). These relations are derived from the constraints imposed by the given relations and the properties of the regions' bounding boxes.

- From x NW y:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x, so x is above y)  

- From y W z:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z starts at or below y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z ends at or above y)  

Combining these:  
- For x-coordinates: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z).  
- For y-coordinates: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), leading to \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

The relation between x and z depends on the vertical position:  
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then x NW z holds.  
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (and the other inequalities are satisfied), then x W z holds.  

The relation SW (South West) is impossible because it would require \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) < \sup_y(x)\) (since regions have positive area), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) cannot hold. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible due to the left-of constraint and vertical relationships.

Thus, the possible relations are NW and W.

\boxed{\text{NW}} \boxed{\text{W}}
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the horizontal and vertical constraints:

1. **Vertical constraints**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
   - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).
   - Combining: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z)\) can be \(\leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) or \(> \text{inf}_y(x)\).

2. **Horizontal constraints**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).
   - Combining: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\), \(z\) left of \(x\), or overlap).

**Case analysis**:

- **Case 1: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)** (entire \(z\) below \(x\)):
  - If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
  - If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
  - Possible: NE, NW.

- **Case 2: \(\text{sup}_y(z) > \text{inf}_y(x)\)** (vertical overlap between bounding boxes):
  - If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and vertical containment (\(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is E of \(z\).
  - If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and vertical containment, then \(x\) is W of \(z\).
  - If the bounding box of \(x\) is inside \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).
  - Possible: E, W, B.

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are NE, NW, E, W, B.

**Answer**: NE, NW, E, W, B
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the horizontal and vertical constraints from these relations. The valid combinations yield the following possible cardinal direction relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):

- **B (Bounding box)**: When \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: When \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
- **S (South)**: When \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- **W (West)**: When \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\).
- **NW (North West)**: When \(x\) is entirely to the left and above \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: When \(x\) is entirely to the left and below \(z\).

These relations cover all possible configurations given the constraints. The relations NE, E, and SE are not possible due to the horizontal and vertical bounds derived from the initial relations, ensuring non-degenerate regions with positive extent.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:  
**B, N, S, W, NW, SW**.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), we analyze the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

- The NW relation is defined as:  
  \(a \text{ NW } b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).

From \(x \text{ NW } y\):  
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)  
2. \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

From \(y \text{ NW } z\):  
3. \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
4. \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

**X-axis analysis:**  
From (1) and (3):  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  

**Y-axis analysis:**  
From (2) and (4):  
\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

These conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ NW } z\).  

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (non-degenerate, with positive area). The derived inequalities are strict in the sense that the bounding boxes do not overlap in a way that allows other relations (e.g., for B, E, S, etc.), as the conditions for those relations conflict with the above. For example:  
- B requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), and equality would require degenerate bounding boxes (disallowed).  
- Similarly, E requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\) contradicts this since \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  

Thus, the only possible relation is NW.  

**Answer:** NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the following constraints apply:

- **From \(x \text{ NW } y\)**:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)

- **From \(y \text{ SW } z\)**:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is left of \(z\).

For the vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\), the constraints do not fix a specific vertical ordering. The possible vertical scenarios are:

1. **\(x\) is above \(z\)** (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)):  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x \text{ NW } z\).

2. **\(x\) is below \(z\)** (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)):  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x \text{ SW } z\).

3. **Vertical alignment where \(x\) is within the vertical range of \(z\)** (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)):  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x \text{ W } z\).

No other cardinal direction relations are possible because:
- The horizontal constraint (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) restricts relations to those with \(x\) left of \(z\) (NW, W, SW).
- The vertical constraints from the given relations do not force a specific overlap or additional ordering beyond the three cases above.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, W, SW**.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal direction relations. This is because the constraints do not enforce a specific relative position between \(x\) and \(z\) beyond both being west and north of \(y\), allowing for all configurations. Examples can be constructed for each relation as follows:

- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\).
- **NE**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) is east of \(z\).
- **SE**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
- **B**: \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s bounding box.

Thus, all nine relations are possible.

**Possible relations**: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(y\) and \(y\) is entirely below \(x\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(y\) and \(z\) is entirely below \(y\).

From these:
1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) NW \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

2. **Horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\):  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(x\) NW \(y\)).  
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)).  
   The horizontal positioning of \(x\) and \(z\) relative to each other can be:
   - **\(x\) left of \(z\) (no overlap)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
     Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) NW \(z\).
   - **\(z\) left of \(x\) (no overlap)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
     Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).
   - **Overlap with \(x\) horizontally contained in \(z\)**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
     Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) N \(z\).

No other relations are possible given the constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, NE, and N.

**Final Answer**  
N, NE, NW
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(x\) is west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\))

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\):
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (\(z\) extends at least as far west and east as \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(z\) extends at least as far south and north as \(y\))

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **NW (North West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(x\) is entirely west and north of \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), leading to \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) in some cases)  
     - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), leading to \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) in some cases)  

2. **W (West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) and vertically overlaps or is contained within \(z\)'s y-bounds:  
     - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (as above)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y-overlap where \(x\) is within \(z\)'s north-south extent)  

3. **N (North)**:  
   - Occurs when \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) and horizontally overlaps or is contained within \(z\)'s x-bounds:  
     - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (as above)  
     - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x-overlap where \(x\) is within \(z\)'s east-west extent)  

These relations are possible under specific spatial arrangements consistent with the given constraints. Other relations (e.g., NE, E, SE, S, SW, B) are not possible due to conflicts in the positional constraints derived from \(x\) NW \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, W, N**.
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Given the relations:  
- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the horizontal and vertical arrangements that satisfy these constraints.  

### Horizontal arrangements:  
1. **\(x\) strictly left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)):**  
   - If \(x\) is above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).  
   - If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).  
   - If \(x\) is vertically contained in \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).  

2. **Horizontal overlap (\(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)):**  
   - If \(x\) is above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)) and horizontally contained in \(z\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).  
   - If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) and horizontally contained in \(z\), then \(x\) is S of \(z\).  
   - If \(x\) is contained in \(z\)'s bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).  

### Constraints analysis:  
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) lie below \(\inf_y(y)\) vertically.  
- Horizontal positions allow both strict left and overlap scenarios.  
- Configurations exist for NW, SW, W, N, S, and B, but not for NE, E, SE due to the leftward bias from \(x\) SW \(y\) and the requirement for \(z\) to extend rightward from \(y\) (from \(y\) N \(z\)).  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
**B, N, NW, S, SW, W**  

No other relations (NE, E, SE) are possible under the given constraints.
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) can vary relative to each other.  
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the vertical alignment:  
1. **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:  
   Then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which satisfies the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\).  
2. **If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**:  
   Then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which satisfies the definition of \(x\) W \(z\).  

The condition \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is necessary for W, and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for SW. These scenarios are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities where the composition yields a defined relation. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, NW, B) do not hold under the constraints, as verified by the bounding box conditions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **W**.
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are determined by the constraints on their bounding boxes.

- \(x \text{ SW } y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)
- \(y \text{ E } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is left of y)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z contains y vertically)

Combining these:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- \(x\) is below \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(z\) extends vertically to contain \(y\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary, leading to multiple possible relations:
- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is left and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) and \(z\) disjoint, with \(x\) southwest of \(z\)).
- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: If the bounding box of \(x\) is entirely within that of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally contained in \(z\).
- **SE (South East)**: If \(x\) is right and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) southeast of \(z\)).
- **E (East)**: If \(x\) is right of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\).

These relations are possible under specific configurations of the bounding boxes, as verified with examples. Other relations (N, NE, NW) are impossible due to the constraints (e.g., \(x\) must be below \(y\), and \(z\) contains \(y\) vertically, preventing \(x\) from being north of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **B, E, S, SE, SW, W**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{B}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}}
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S (South) and SW (SouthWest).

### Derivation:
- From \(x\) SW \(y\):
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- From \(y\) S \(z\):
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining the inequalities:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This means \(x\) is below \(z\) in the y-direction, limiting possible relations to those with a south component (S, SW, or SE).

However, SE is impossible:
- SE requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- From the inequalities, \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). For SE, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) would imply \(\inf_x(x) = \sup_x(z)\), but regions have positive area (since they are homeomorphic to a disk), so \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(x)\), leading to a contradiction. Thus, SE cannot hold.

The possible relations are S and SW, depending on the x-coordinates:
- **S (South)**: This holds if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (always true) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (also always true from the inequalities), all conditions for S are satisfied.
- **SW (SouthWest)**: This holds if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (always true), all conditions for SW are satisfied.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, W, NW, B) are impossible due to the y-direction constraint \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which ensures \(x\) is below \(z\), and specific x-direction conflicts as derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S and SW.

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}}
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)
- \(y\) NW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)

Chaining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but the relative vertical position between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their y-bounds.

Possible vertical relations:
1. If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\): \(x\) is entirely below \(z\), so \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\): \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), so \(x\) NW \(z\).
3. If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\): \(x\) is vertically within \(z\), so \(x\) W \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- B: Requires \(x\) contained in \(z\)'s bounding box, but \(x\) is left of \(z\), so disjoint.
- S, SE, E, NE, N: Require specific horizontal alignments (e.g., \(x\) not left of \(z\) for E, NE, SE; or vertical misalignment).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

**Final Answer: SW, W, NW**
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the relations are defined as follows:  
- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

From these:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\) by definition of bounds). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\)). Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being SW of \(z\):  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:  
- **S** requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) imply \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) only if \(\inf_x(x) = \sup_x(x)\), which contradicts the region being homeomorphic to a disk (non-zero area).  
- **W** requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) imply \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) only if \(\inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x)\), again impossible.  
- Similarly, **B**, **N**, **E**, **NE**, **NW**, **SE** all require conditions conflicting with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and/or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.  

**Answer: SW**
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from \(x\) SW \(y\)).
- \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)).
- Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their relative positions:
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) below \(z\), this gives \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (so \(x\) is to the right of \(z\)). Combined with \(x\) below \(z\), this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
3. **S (South)**: If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (i.e., the \(x\)-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\)), and \(x\) is below \(z\), this gives \(x\) S \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- **B (bounding box)**: Requires \(z\) to contain \(x\)'s bounding box, but \(x\) is below \(z\), violating vertical containment.
- **N, NE, NW**: Require \(x\) to be above \(z\), but \(x\) is below \(z\).
- **E, W**: Require vertical alignment or partial containment that conflicts with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW, SE, S**.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be any of the nine defined relations. This is because the constraints allow for various relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) with respect to each other, as demonstrated by specific examples for each relation:

- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\).
- **NE**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).
- **SE**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) is east of \(z\).
- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).
- **B**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

Each relation is achievable under the given constraints by appropriately positioning \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) while satisfying \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) NE \(z\).

**Answer**: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine atomic relations: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE. This is because the constraints allow for configurations that satisfy each relation through appropriate positioning of the bounding boxes. Below are brief examples for each:

- **B (bounding box)**:  
  Example: \(z: [0,4]\times[0,4]\), \(y: [2,3]\times[2,3]\), \(x: [1,1.5]\times[1,1.5]\).  
  \(x\) is contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.

- **S (South)**:  
  Example: \(z: [0,4]\times[1,4]\), \(y: [0.6,4]\times[1,4]\), \(x: [0,0.5]\times[0,0.5]\).  
  \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally within.

- **SW (South West)**:  
  Example: \(z: [2,4]\times[2,4]\), \(y: [2,3]\times[2,3]\), \(x: [0,1]\times[0,1]\).  
  \(x\) is entirely left and below \(z\).

- **W (West)**:  
  Example: \(z: [2,4]\times[0,4]\), \(y: [2,3]\times[2,3]\), \(x: [1,1.5]\times[1,1.5]\).  
  \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically within.

- **NW (North West)**:  
  Example: \(z: [0,4]\times[0,4]\), \(y: [0,4]\times[4,4]\), \(x: [-1,-0.5]\times[4,4]\).  
  \(x\) is left of \(z\) and at the top edge (infy \(x\) = supy \(z\)).

- **N (North)**:  
  Example: \(z: [0,4]\times[0,4]\), \(y: [0,4]\times[4,4]\), \(x: [0,4]\times[4,4]\).  
  \(x\) is above \(z\) and horizontally within.

- **NE (North East)**:  
  Example: \(z: [0,4]\times[0,4]\), \(y: [4,4]\times[4,4]\), \(x: [4,4]\times[4,4]\).  
  \(x\) is at the northeast corner (edges align).

- **E (East)**:  
  Example: \(z: [0,4]\times[0,4]\), \(y: [4,4]\times[2,4]\), \(x: [4,4]\times[0,1.5]\).  
  \(x\) is right of \(z\) and vertically within.

- **SE (South East)**:  
  Example: \(z: [0,4]\times[0,4]\), \(y: [4,4]\times[0,0]\), \(x: [4,4]\times[0,0]\).  
  \(x\) is right of \(z\) and at the bottom edge.

Thus, all nine relations are possible depending on the specific bounding box configurations. The answer is: **B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE**.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these constraints:
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This implies \(x\) is to the east of \(z\) (since the left edge of \(z\) is left of the left edge of \(x\)).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but no direct constraint exists between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) or \(\sup_y(z)\), allowing flexibility in vertical positioning.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **SE**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Achievable by setting \(z\)'s right edge \(\leq x\)'s left edge and \(z\)'s bottom edge \(\geq x\)'s top edge.
- **E**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Achievable by setting \(z\)'s right edge \(\leq x\)'s left edge and \(x\) vertically within \(z\)'s span.
- **NE**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Achievable by setting \(z\)'s right edge \(\leq x\)'s left edge and \(z\)'s top edge \(\leq x\)'s bottom edge.
- **N**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Achievable by setting \(x\) above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s span.
- **B**: If \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Achievable by making \(z\) large enough to enclose \(x\).
- **S**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Achievable by setting \(x\) below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s span.

Relations **SW**, **W**, and **NW** are impossible because they require \(x\) to be west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), but the constraints force \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), making \(x\) east of \(z\), not west.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, E, N, NE, S, SE**.
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely south of y)

- \(y\) W \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely west of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z vertically contains y)

Considering the composition of these relations, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived through geometric constraints and example configurations:

1. **SW (South West)**: \(x\) can be entirely west and south of \(z\).
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,1.6] \times [-1,-0.5]\), \(z\) at \([1.7,2.5] \times [0,1]\). Then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).

2. **W (West)**: \(x\) can be entirely west of \(z\) with vertical containment.
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,2] \times [-1,-0.5]\), \(z\) at \([2.1,3] \times [-1.5,0.5]\). Then \(x\) is W of \(z\).

3. **S (South)**: \(x\) can be entirely south of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [-0.5,1.5]\). Then \(x\) is S of \(z\).

4. **SE (South East)**: \(x\) can be entirely east and south of \(z\).
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([2,3] \times [-2,-1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2] \times [0,1]\). Then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).

5. **E (East)**: \(x\) can be entirely east of \(z\) with vertical containment.
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([2,3] \times [-2,-1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2] \times [-1.5,1.5]\). Then \(x\) is E of \(z\).

6. **B (Bounding box)**: \(x\) can be contained within the bounding box of \(z\).
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,2] \times [-1,-0.5]\), \(z\) at \([1,2.5] \times [-1.5,1.5]\). Then \(x\) is B of \(z\).

Relations **N (North)**, **NE (North East)**, and **NW (North West)** are impossible due to vertical constraints:
- \(x\) is always south of \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), and \(z\) vertically contains \(y\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), forcing \(x\) to be below \(z\)'s upper part. Thus, \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\) in any form.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\): B, E, S, SE, SW, W**
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these, we derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal axis (x-direction)**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)). Combining these:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This implies \(x\) is strictly to the east of \(z\), satisfying the horizontal condition for E, SE, and NE relations.

2. **Vertical axis (y-direction)**:  
   From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   The relative positions of \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) determine the vertical relation:

   - **Case 1: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**  
     Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\):  
     \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
     Thus, \(x\) SE \(z\) is possible.

   - **Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\)**  
     This requires further consideration of \(\inf_y(x)\):  
     - **Subcase 2.1: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
       Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\):  
       \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
       Thus, \(x\) E \(z\) is possible.  
     - **Subcase 2.2: \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\)**  
       This configuration leads to vertical overlap without containment, which does not satisfy any of the defined cardinal direction relations. However, since the regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk and the relations must hold, this subcase is not feasible under the given constraints. Thus, it does not yield a valid relation.

Given the analysis, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SE** and **E**. These are the only relations that can occur under the constraints \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\).

**Possible relations:** SE, E
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible relations between x and z are:

- **SE (South East)**: This occurs when the entire x is to the east and south of z. Specifically, if the supremum of z's x-projection is less than or equal to the infimum of x's x-projection (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and the supremum of x's y-projection is less than or equal to the infimum of z's y-projection (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), which holds from the given relations. For example:
  - z: [0, 1] × [1, 2] (bounding box)
  - y: [0, 1] × [-2, -1] (S of z)
  - x: [2, 3] × [-4, -3] (SE of y, and SE of z).

- **S (South)**: This occurs when the entire x is directly south of z and within the horizontal span of z. Specifically, if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which holds), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which holds as infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (which can be satisfied by choosing x such that its x-projection is contained within z's). For example:
  - z: [0, 3] × [1, 2]
  - y: [0, 2] × [-2, -1] (S of z)
  - x: [2.5, 2.8] × [-4, -3] (SE of y, and S of z as supx(x) = 2.8 ≤ supx(z) = 3).

No other cardinal direction relations are possible:
- **SW (South West)**: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but infx(z) ≤ infx(x) implies supx(x) ≥ infx(x) ≥ infx(z), making equality degenerate and not generally possible for non-degenerate regions.
- **E (East)**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and vertical containment, but if supx(z) > infx(x), E fails, and vertical containment is not guaranteed.
- **B (Bounding box)**: Requires full containment in both axes, but vertically, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) fails unless degenerate.
- Other relations (N, NE, NW, W) require x to be north of z, which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Thus, the possible relations are **SE** and **S**.
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the definitions of the cardinal direction relations and the given conditions:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

These constraints imply that both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned southeast of \(y\) relative to its bounding box. However, there are no direct constraints between \(x\) and \(z\) themselves regarding their relative positions. The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary depending on their specific placements, as long as they satisfy the original constraints relative to \(y\).

Through specific examples, all nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be achieved:
- **B** (bounding box containment): If \(x\) and \(z\) are identical or one contains the other.
- **N** (north): If \(z\) is below \(x\) and \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\).
- **NE** (northeast): If \(z\) is southwest of \(x\).
- **E** (east): If \(z\) is west of \(x\) and \(x\) is vertically contained in \(z\).
- **SE** (southeast): If \(z\) is northwest of \(x\).
- **S** (south): If \(x\) is below \(z\) and \(x\) is horizontally contained in \(z\).
- **SW** (southwest): If \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
- **W** (west): If \(x\) is east of \(z\) and \(x\) is vertically contained in \(z\).
- **NW** (northwest): If \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).

Thus, any of the nine relations is possible under the given constraints.

**Possible relations:** B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely south of y)
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely west of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely south of z)

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible horizontal configurations:
1. **SW relation (\(x\) SW \(z\)):** If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x entirely west of z).
2. **S relation (\(x\) S \(z\)):** If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x horizontally within z's bounding box).
3. **SE relation (\(x\) SE \(z\)):** If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x entirely east of z).

These satisfy the vertical condition \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and cover all mutually exclusive cases for the south direction. No other relations (e.g., N, E, W, B) are possible due to the vertical separation and horizontal constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Answer:** SW, S, SE
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) → \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) → \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\):
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (x is east of z).
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x is south of z).

No other relations (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) are possible, as they require additional conditions that contradict the above (e.g., overlapping projections or different directional constraints).

Thus, the only possible relation is SE.

**Answer: SE**
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is to the right of \(z\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (with \(x\) as the subject and \(z\) as the reference) depend on their vertical alignment:
1. **NE (North East)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (entire \(z\) is below \(x\)), then \(x\) is to the right and above \(z\).
2. **E (East)**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (vertical range of \(x\) is contained within \(z\)), then \(x\) is to the right and vertically aligned within \(z\).
3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(z\)), then \(x\) is to the right and below \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as the horizontal constraint (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) forces \(x\) to be east of \(z\), and the vertical alignment must fall into one of these three cases. Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are not possible due to the horizontal separation and vertical constraints.

Thus, the possible relations are **NE, E, SE**.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (entirely to the east of \(y\))  
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (entirely to the south of \(y\))  

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (horizontally contained)  
  - \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (vertically contained)  

The constraints imply:  
- \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (so \(x\) is east of \(z\) or horizontally overlapping)  
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (so \(x\) is south of \(z\) or vertically overlapping)  

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
- **B**: If \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s bounding box.  
  Example: \(z\) extends sufficiently to cover \(x\) horizontally and vertically.  
- **S**: If \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)) and horizontally aligned (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)).  
  Example: \(z\) extends south to just above \(x\) and covers \(x\) horizontally.  
- **E**: If \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) and vertically contained in \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)).  
  Example: \(z\) ends before \(x\) starts horizontally, and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\).  
- **SE**: If \(x\) is southeast of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)).  
  Example: \(z\) ends before \(x\) starts horizontally, and \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).  

Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW) are impossible due to the constraints ensuring \(x\) is east and south of \(y\), and \(y\) contained in \(z\).  

Thus, the possible relations are **B, S, E, SE**.  

**Answer: B, S, E, SE**
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, the relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be derived from the given conditions: \(x\) is NE of \(y\) and \(y\) is N of \(z\).

- **Vertical relation**:  
  From \(y\) N \(z\), we have \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).  
  From \(x\) NE \(y\), we have \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
  Combining these, \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), so \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\). This means \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

- **Horizontal relation**:  
  From \(x\) NE \(y\), we have \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).  
  From \(y\) N \(z\), we have \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).  
  Combining these, \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).  
  The relation between \(\text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(z)\) determines the horizontal component:
  - If \(\text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\). Combined with the vertical separation, this gives \(x\) N \(z\).
  - If \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\). Combined with the vertical separation, this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).

Other relations (e.g., E, NW, etc.) are not possible due to the vertical separation and horizontal constraints. Examples confirm that \(x\) N \(z\) and \(x\) NE \(z\) are achievable:
- **N example**: \(z\) centered at (0,0) radius 1, \(y\) centered at (0,2) radius 0.1, \(x\) centered at (0.2,3) radius 0.1. Here, \(x\) is within the horizontal span of \(z\) and above.
- **NE example**: \(z\) centered at (0,0) radius 1, \(y\) centered at (0,2) radius 0.1, \(x\) centered at (1.2,3) radius 0.1. Here, \(x\) is entirely east and above \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N and NE**.
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints derived:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by analyzing the bounds and ensuring consistency with the constraints. The feasible relations are:

- **B** (bounding box): Possible, as the bounding box of \(x\) can be contained within that of \(z\) under specific configurations (e.g., \(z\)'s bounding box fully encloses \(x\)'s while satisfying all constraints).
- **W** (West): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (e.g., \(x\) entirely to the west of \(z\) with vertical alignment within \(z\)'s y-bounds).
- **NW** (North West): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (e.g., \(x\) northwest of \(z\) with no y-overlap and \(x\) west of \(z\)).
- **N** (North): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (e.g., \(x\) directly north of \(z\) with x-overlap).
- **NE** (North East): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (e.g., \(x\) northeast of \(z\) with no overlap).
- **E** (East): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (e.g., \(x\) east of \(z\) with vertical alignment within \(z\)'s y-bounds).

The relations **S** (South), **SW** (South West), and **SE** (South East) are impossible due to conflicting y-bound constraints derived from the initial relations (e.g., \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{sup}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \geq \text{inf}_y(z)\) prevent \(x\) from being south of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations are: **B, W, NW, N, NE, E**.
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NE (North East) and E (East).

### Explanation:
- **x NE y implies**:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- **y E z implies**:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is not below z)
  - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is not above z)

From these:
- The x-coordinate relation: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means x is always to the east of z, ruling out relations like W, SW, NW, N, S, and B.
- The y-coordinate relation: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NE y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y E z). Thus, infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

#### Possible Relations:
1. **NE (North East) between x and z**:
   - Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is satisfied.
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) can hold if supy(z) is set less than or equal to infy(x) (e.g., by making z smaller in y or x taller and positioned higher).
   - Example: Set z with y from 0 to 3, y with y from 2 to 2.5, and x with y from 3 to 4. Then y E z, x NE y, and x NE z.

2. **E (East) between x and z**:
   - Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) are satisfied.
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can hold if supy(z) is large enough to contain the y-interval of x (e.g., by making z taller in y).
   - Example: Set z with y from 0 to 10, y with y from 5 to 6, and x with y from 7 to 9. Then y E z, x NE y, and x E z.

#### Why other relations are impossible:
- **SE (South East)**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). However, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x) (since regions have area), so supy(x) > infy(z), making supy(x) ≤ infy(z) impossible.
- **N, S, SW, W, NW**: Require x not to be east of z, but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) forces x to be east.
- **B**: Requires containment in both x and y, but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) implies no containment in x.

Thus, the possible relations are NE and E.

\boxed{\text{NE}} \boxed{\text{E}}
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are SW, NW, and W. 

- **SW (South West)**: \(z\) is southwest of \(x\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the west and south of \(x\).
- **NW (North West)**: \(z\) is northwest of \(x\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the west and north of \(x\).
- **W (West)**: \(z\) is west of \(x\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the west and vertically within the north-south bounds of \(x\).

These relations are derived from the constraints:
- From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Combining these, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\). The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary (below, above, or contained), but only SW, NW, and W satisfy the bounding box constraints for non-degenerate regions in REG.

Possible relations: **SW, NW, W**.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box inequalities.

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (y is left of x)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)

- \(y\) NW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)

From these, it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is below \(x\). Therefore, relations where \(z\) is not below \(x\) (e.g., N, NE, E, NW, B) are impossible. Relations requiring \(x\) to be below \(z\) (e.g., S, SE, SW) or vertical alignment (e.g., E, W) are also impossible due to the strict vertical separation and positive area of regions.

The only possible relations are those where \(z\) is below \(x\), considering horizontal positioning:
- **x N z**: \(z\) directly below \(x\) with horizontal containment (possible when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
- **x NE z**: \(z\) southwest of \(x\) (left and below; possible when \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
- **x NW z**: \(z\) southeast of \(x\) (right and below; possible when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).

Examples confirm these relations are achievable with appropriate bounding boxes:
- For \(x\) N \(z\): Set regions such that \(z\) horizontally contains \(x\) and \(z\) is below \(x\).
- For \(x\) NE \(z\): Set \(z\) left and below \(x\).
- For \(x\) NW \(z\): Set \(z\) right and below \(x\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, and NW.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B. This is because both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned northeast of \(y\) (due to \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) SW \(z\) implying \(z\) is northeast of \(y\)), but their relative positions to each other can vary based on the specific bounds of their bounding boxes, allowing for all possible configurations.

- **N**: Possible if \(z\) is below \(x\) and horizontally covers \(x\).  
- **NE**: Possible if \(z\) is southwest of \(x\).  
- **E**: Possible if \(z\) is west of \(x\) and vertically covers \(x\).  
- **SE**: Possible if \(z\) is northwest of \(x\).  
- **S**: Possible if \(z\) is above \(x\) and horizontally covers \(x\).  
- **SW**: Possible if \(z\) is northeast of \(x\).  
- **W**: Possible if \(z\) is east of \(x\) and vertically covers \(x\).  
- **NW**: Possible if \(z\) is southeast of \(x\).  
- **B**: Possible if the bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\).  

Thus, no relation is excluded based on the given constraints.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions provided:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is east of \(y\)).
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is north of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is east of \(z\)).
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(z\)).

From these:
- **East constraint for \(x\) and \(z\):**  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\), so the relation must include an eastern component (E, NE, or SE).

- **Vertical possibilities:**  
  - \(x\) is north of \(y\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
  - \(z\) is north of \(y\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
  However, the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) are not constrained beyond this. Three cases arise:
  1. **NE relation:** If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(x\)), then \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) (NE).  
  2. **SE relation:** If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)), then \(x\) is southeast of \(z\) (SE).  
  3. **E relation:** If the vertical strip of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\) (i.e., \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is directly east of \(z\) (E).  

Examples confirm all three are possible:
- **NE example:** \(z\) with bbox \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) with \([1,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(x\) with \([2,3] \times [1,2]\). Then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).  
- **SE example:** \(z\) with \([0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(y\) with \([1,2] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) with \([2,3] \times [0,1]\). Then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).  
- **E example:** \(z\) with \([0,1] \times [2,5]\), \(y\) with \([1,2] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) with \([2,3] \times [3,4]\). Then \(x\) is E of \(z\).  

No other relations (like N, S, B, etc.) satisfy the east constraint and the conditions. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE, SE, and E.

**Answer: NE, SE, E**
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is NE.

### Explanation:
- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From the inequalities:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., N, E, SE, etc.) is possible due to the strict separation in both x and y dimensions, enforced by the positive extent of regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed disk, implying \(\inf_x < \sup_x\) and \(\inf_y < \sup_y\) for all regions).

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.

**Answer: NE**
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are B, N, E, and NE. These relations are derived from the bounding box constraints and the definitions provided.

- **B (bounding box)**: \(x\)'s bounding box is contained within \(z\)'s bounding box. This is possible if \(x\) is positioned such that it remains inside \(z\)'s bounds, given that \(y\) is inside \(z\) and \(x\) is NE of \(y\).
- **N (north)**: \(x\) is directly north of \(z\), with \(z\) below \(x\) and horizontal containment. This requires \(y\) to be at the top of \(z\)'s bounding box, allowing \(x\) to be above \(z\).
- **E (east)**: \(x\) is directly east of \(z\), with \(z\) west of \(x\) and vertical containment. This requires \(y\) to be at the right edge of \(z\)'s bounding box, allowing \(x\) to be to the east.
- **NE (northeast)**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\), with \(z\) southwest of \(x\). This requires \(y\) to be at the top-right corner of \(z\)'s bounding box, allowing \(x\) to be to the northeast.

The relations S, SE, SW, W, and NW are impossible because:
- Southern relations (S, SE, SW) require \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z) \), but \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \( \text{infy}(x) \geq \text{supy}(y) > \text{infy}(z) \) (since regions have area), so \( \text{supy}(x) > \text{infy}(z) \).
- Western relations (W, NW) require \( \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z) \), but \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \( \text{infx}(x) \geq \text{supx}(y) \geq \text{infx}(z) \), so \( \text{supx}(x) > \text{infx}(z) \).

Thus, the possible relations are B, N, E, and NE.

\boxed{\text{B}} \boxed{\text{E}} \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{NE}}
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ N } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **x-coordinate constraints**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
   - From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Chaining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Thus: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

2. **y-coordinate constraints**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Thus: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The combined constraints \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of the **N** relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y-condition),
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x-infimum condition),
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x-supremum condition).

No other cardinal direction relation (NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is satisfied under these constraints without requiring additional degenerate conditions (e.g., regions collapsing to lines or points), which are excluded since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (non-degenerate with interior).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **N**.

**Answer: N**
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ W } z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)  
   From \(y \text{ W } z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
   Thus: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. From \(y \text{ W } z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)  
   From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
   Thus: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

3. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)  
   From \(y \text{ W } z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  
   Thus: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These conditions (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)) match the definition of the **W** (West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, SW, B) is satisfied:
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and no guarantee that \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **NW** requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but we have \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and no guarantee that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- Other relations (like E, SE, NE, S, N, B) are incompatible with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) or the vertical conditions.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.

**Answer: W**
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions:

- \(x\) is \(B\) of \(y\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is \(E\) of \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **X-axis constraints**:
   - From \(y\) \(E\) \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(x\) \(B\) \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)

2. **Y-axis constraints**:
   - From \(y\) \(E\) \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - From \(x\) \(B\) \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
   - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Comparing with the cardinal direction definitions:
- **\(E\) (East)** requires:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
- These conditions are fully satisfied.

Other relations do not hold:
- **\(B\)**: Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) only if degenerate (contradiction for 2D regions).
- **\(S\)**, **\(SE\)**: Require \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) makes this impossible without degeneracy.
- **\(SW\)**, **\(W\)**: Require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\), not the reverse.
- **\(N\)**, **\(NE\)**, **\(NW\)**: Require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) or similar, but \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\) contradict this without degeneracy.

Thus, the only possible relation is \(E\) (East), meaning \(x\) is east of \(z\).

**Answer: E**
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is in the relation B with region \(y\) (\(x\) B \(y\)) and region \(y\) is in the relation S with region \(z\) (\(y\) S \(z\)), we analyze the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\).

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\),
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\),
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Combining these:

- **Horizontal constraints**:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
  - Thus, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), meaning the horizontal span of \(x\) is within that of \(z\).

- **Vertical constraints**:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
  - Also, \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), so \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
  - Thus, the entire region \(x\) lies vertically below \(z\), with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) match the definition of the S (South) relation for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- \(x\) S \(z\) requires:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\),
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **SW, W, NW**: Require \(x\) to extend left beyond \(z\)'s horizontal span, but \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) prevents this.
- **SE, E, NE**: Require \(x\) to extend right beyond \(z\)'s horizontal span, but \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) prevents this.
- **N, NE, NW**: Require \(x\) to be above \(z\), but \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) forces \(x\) below \(z\).
- **B**: Requires \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but we have \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\). Equality would force \(x\) to a horizontal line, violating the region's properties (homeomorphic to a closed disk).

Thus, the only possible relation is **S**.

**Answer: S**
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- **x B y**: The bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of y.  
  This implies:  
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (x is horizontally within y).  
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y).  

- **y NW z**: The bounding box of y is entirely northwest of z.  
  This implies:  
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (y is to the left of z).  
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (z is below y).  

Combining these:  
- From **x B y**: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).  
- From **y NW z**: \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning x is entirely to the left of z.  

- From **x B y**: \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).  
- From **y NW z**: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
  Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), meaning z is entirely below x.  

These conditions satisfy the definition of **x NW z**:  
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (x left of z).  
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (z below x).  

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:  
- **W**, **N**, **B**, etc., require additional conditions (e.g., vertical alignment or overlap) that are violated by the strict left and below positioning derived.  
- For example, **W** would require \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), but \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (from above) contradicts \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) since \(\text{sup}_y(x) \geq \text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is **NW**.  

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)

- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. For the \(x\)-axis:
   - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
   - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) SW \(z\))
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)

2. For the \(y\)-axis:
   - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
   - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SW \(z\))
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)

The conditions \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) match the definition of the SW (South West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) can hold simultaneously under these constraints because:
- \(x\) must lie entirely to the west (left) of \(z\) due to \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).
- \(x\) must lie entirely to the south (below) of \(z\) due to \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
- Other relations require different alignments (e.g., overlapping bounding boxes, different directional overlaps) that are precluded by these strict inequalities.

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.

**Answer:** SW
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
  So \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(y\).

- \(y \text{ SE } z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From \(y \text{ SE } z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

- From \(y \text{ SE } z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
  Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ SE } z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:
- **B**: Requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\), but \(x\) is southeast of \(z\), so disjoint.
- **S**, **SW**, **W**, **NW**, **N**, **NE**, **E**: Require conditions contradicted by \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (e.g., **S** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) but also horizontal alignment, which fails due to the east shift; **E** requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) but also vertical containment, which fails due to the south shift).

Thus, the only possible relation is **SE**.

**Answer: SE**
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is B of region \(y\):  
  \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\),  
  \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the west and south of \(y\) (i.e., \(y\) is northeast of \(z\)).

Combining these:  
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) implies \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\) (so \(x\) is east of \(z\)).  
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) implies \(z\) is entirely to the south of \(x\) (so \(x\) is north of \(z\)).

Thus, \(x\) is both north and east of \(z\), which corresponds to the relation NE.  
Verification with the definition:  
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) hold, satisfying NE.  

No other relations are possible:  
- B, S, SW, W, NW, E, SE fail due to contradictions in bounding box or directional constraints (e.g., \(x\) cannot be south or west of \(z\) given the above).  
- N would require \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), but \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(x) \geq \text{sup}_x(z)\), generally not ≤ unless degenerate, which is excluded for disk-homeomorphic regions.

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.

**Answer: NE**
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: Based on the definitions, if region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the bounding box relations imply:

- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

These inequalities satisfy the conditions for \(x\) to be B of \(z\):
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is B.

**Answer:** B
