PROMPT: Let NE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints derived:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by analyzing the bounds and ensuring consistency with the constraints. The feasible relations are:

- **B** (bounding box): Possible, as the bounding box of \(x\) can be contained within that of \(z\) under specific configurations (e.g., \(z\)'s bounding box fully encloses \(x\)'s while satisfying all constraints).
- **W** (West): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (e.g., \(x\) entirely to the west of \(z\) with vertical alignment within \(z\)'s y-bounds).
- **NW** (North West): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (e.g., \(x\) northwest of \(z\) with no y-overlap and \(x\) west of \(z\)).
- **N** (North): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (e.g., \(x\) directly north of \(z\) with x-overlap).
- **NE** (North East): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (e.g., \(x\) northeast of \(z\) with no overlap).
- **E** (East): Possible, with \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (e.g., \(x\) east of \(z\) with vertical alignment within \(z\)'s y-bounds).

The relations **S** (South), **SW** (South West), and **SE** (South East) are impossible due to conflicting y-bound constraints derived from the initial relations (e.g., \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{sup}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \geq \text{inf}_y(z)\) prevent \(x\) from being south of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations are: **B, W, NW, N, NE, E**.
