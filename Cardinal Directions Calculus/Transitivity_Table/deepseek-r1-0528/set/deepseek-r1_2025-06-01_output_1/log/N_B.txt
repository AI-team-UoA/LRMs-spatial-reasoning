PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is North (N) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is bounding box (B) of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_y(z)\) relative to \(\inf_y(x)\):
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) N \(z\) holds because:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical condition for N),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal conditions for N).
- If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) B \(z\) may hold if additionally \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), because:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) are already satisfied,
  - and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) completes the conditions for B.

Other cardinal direction relations (e.g., S, E, NE) are impossible due to the horizontal alignment and vertical constraints derived from the given relations. Specifically:
- Horizontal alignment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) precludes relations like E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW.
- Vertical constraints (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)) preclude relations like S.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N or B.
