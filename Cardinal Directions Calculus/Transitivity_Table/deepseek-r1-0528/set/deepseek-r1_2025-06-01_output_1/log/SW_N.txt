PROMPT: Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:  
- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the horizontal and vertical arrangements that satisfy these constraints.  

### Horizontal arrangements:  
1. **\(x\) strictly left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)):**  
   - If \(x\) is above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).  
   - If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).  
   - If \(x\) is vertically contained in \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).  

2. **Horizontal overlap (\(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)):**  
   - If \(x\) is above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)) and horizontally contained in \(z\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).  
   - If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) and horizontally contained in \(z\), then \(x\) is S of \(z\).  
   - If \(x\) is contained in \(z\)'s bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).  

### Constraints analysis:  
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) lie below \(\inf_y(y)\) vertically.  
- Horizontal positions allow both strict left and overlap scenarios.  
- Configurations exist for NW, SW, W, N, S, and B, but not for NE, E, SE due to the leftward bias from \(x\) SW \(y\) and the requirement for \(z\) to extend rightward from \(y\) (from \(y\) N \(z\)).  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
**B, N, NW, S, SW, W**  

No other relations (NE, E, SE) are possible under the given constraints.
