PROMPT: Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are B, N, E, and NE. These relations are derived from the bounding box constraints and the definitions provided.

- **B (bounding box)**: \(x\)'s bounding box is contained within \(z\)'s bounding box. This is possible if \(x\) is positioned such that it remains inside \(z\)'s bounds, given that \(y\) is inside \(z\) and \(x\) is NE of \(y\).
- **N (north)**: \(x\) is directly north of \(z\), with \(z\) below \(x\) and horizontal containment. This requires \(y\) to be at the top of \(z\)'s bounding box, allowing \(x\) to be above \(z\).
- **E (east)**: \(x\) is directly east of \(z\), with \(z\) west of \(x\) and vertical containment. This requires \(y\) to be at the right edge of \(z\)'s bounding box, allowing \(x\) to be to the east.
- **NE (northeast)**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\), with \(z\) southwest of \(x\). This requires \(y\) to be at the top-right corner of \(z\)'s bounding box, allowing \(x\) to be to the northeast.

The relations S, SE, SW, W, and NW are impossible because:
- Southern relations (S, SE, SW) require \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z) \), but \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \( \text{infy}(x) \geq \text{supy}(y) > \text{infy}(z) \) (since regions have area), so \( \text{supy}(x) > \text{infy}(z) \).
- Western relations (W, NW) require \( \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z) \), but \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \( \text{infx}(x) \geq \text{supx}(y) \geq \text{infx}(z) \), so \( \text{supx}(x) > \text{infx}(z) \).

Thus, the possible relations are B, N, E, and NE.

\boxed{\text{B}} \boxed{\text{E}} \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{NE}}
