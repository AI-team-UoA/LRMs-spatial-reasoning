PROMPT: Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the relations are defined as follows:  
- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

From these:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\) by definition of bounds). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\)). Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being SW of \(z\):  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:  
- **S** requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) imply \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) only if \(\inf_x(x) = \sup_x(x)\), which contradicts the region being homeomorphic to a disk (non-zero area).  
- **W** requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) imply \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) only if \(\inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x)\), again impossible.  
- Similarly, **B**, **N**, **E**, **NE**, **NW**, **SE** all require conditions conflicting with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and/or \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.
