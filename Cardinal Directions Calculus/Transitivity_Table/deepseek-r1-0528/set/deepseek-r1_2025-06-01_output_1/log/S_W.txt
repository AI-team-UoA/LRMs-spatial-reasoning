PROMPT: Let S and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\), and the \(x\)-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely left of \(z\), and the \(y\)-interval of \(y\) is contained within that of \(z\).

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal constraint**:  
   From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) W \(z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) horizontally.

2. **Vertical constraint**:  
   - From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) W \(z\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but the position of \(\sup_y(x)\) relative to \(\inf_y(z)\) depends on specific cases.

Possible cases for the vertical direction:

- **Case 1**: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (top of \(x\) is below bottom of \(z\)).  
  Combined with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies the SW (South West) relation:  
  \(x\) SW \(z\).

- **Case 2**: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (top of \(x\) is above bottom of \(z\) but still below \(y\)), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (bottom of \(x\) is not below bottom of \(z\)).  
  Then:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (left constraint),  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment).  
  This satisfies the W (West) relation: \(x\) W \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **NW, N, NE**: Require \(z\) below or above \(x\), but \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(y\) is not constrained to be below \(z\) vertically in a way that forces \(z\) above \(x\).
- **S, SE**: Require \(x\) below \(z\), but \(\sup_y(x)\) may be above \(\inf_y(z)\) (Case 2).
- **E, NE, SE**: Require \(z\) left of \(x\), but \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- **B**: Requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box, but horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) prevents this.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **W**.

**Final Answer**  
SW, W
