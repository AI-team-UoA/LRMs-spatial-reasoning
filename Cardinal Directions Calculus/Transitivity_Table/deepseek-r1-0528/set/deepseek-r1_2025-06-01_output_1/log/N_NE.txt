PROMPT: Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).

From \(y\) NE of \(z\):  
- \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\)  
- \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\)  

From \(x\) N of \(y\):  
- \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)  
- \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\)  
- \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\)  

Chaining the inequalities:  
- **Vertical direction**: \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), so \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
- **Horizontal direction**: \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).  

The relation \(x\) NE of \(z\) is defined by \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), which are both satisfied.  

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:  
- **N, S, E, W, B, NW, SE, SW** require conditions that conflict with the derived inequalities (e.g., horizontal overlap for N/S, vertical containment for E/W, or specific bounds not met).  

Thus, the only possible relation is **NE**.
