PROMPT: Let B and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- Region \(x\) is B of region \(y\):  
  \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\),  
  \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the west and south of \(y\) (i.e., \(y\) is northeast of \(z\)).

Combining these:  
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) implies \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\) (so \(x\) is east of \(z\)).  
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) implies \(z\) is entirely to the south of \(x\) (so \(x\) is north of \(z\)).

Thus, \(x\) is both north and east of \(z\), which corresponds to the relation NE.  
Verification with the definition:  
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) hold, satisfying NE.  

No other relations are possible:  
- B, S, SW, W, NW, E, SE fail due to contradictions in bounding box or directional constraints (e.g., \(x\) cannot be south or west of \(z\) given the above).  
- N would require \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), but \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(x) \geq \text{sup}_x(z)\), generally not â‰¤ unless degenerate, which is excluded for disk-homeomorphic regions.

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.
