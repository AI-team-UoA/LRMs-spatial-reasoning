PROMPT: Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW. This is determined by the constraints from the given relations:

- From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). Thus, x is above y and horizontally within the extent of y.
- From y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). Thus, y is to the left and below z.

Combining these:
- Horizontally, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is entirely to the left of z.
- Vertically, the relative positions of the y-coordinates can vary, leading to different possible relations between x and z.

The possible relations are:
- **SW (South West)**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is left and below z.
- **W (West)**: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is left of z and vertically within z's range.
- **NW (North West)**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is left and above z.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible because:
- x is always left of z, so relations requiring x to be to the right (E, NE, SE), below (S), or horizontally aligned (N, B) cannot hold.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \boxed{\text{W}} \boxed{\text{NW}}
