PROMPT: Let SE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is to the right of \(z\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) (with \(x\) as the subject and \(z\) as the reference) depend on their vertical alignment:
1. **NE (North East)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (entire \(z\) is below \(x\)), then \(x\) is to the right and above \(z\).
2. **E (East)**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (vertical range of \(x\) is contained within \(z\)), then \(x\) is to the right and vertically aligned within \(z\).
3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(z\)), then \(x\) is to the right and below \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as the horizontal constraint (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) forces \(x\) to be east of \(z\), and the vertical alignment must fall into one of these three cases. Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are not possible due to the horizontal separation and vertical constraints.

Thus, the possible relations are **NE, E, SE**.
