PROMPT: Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW (North West) and W (West). These relations are derived from the constraints imposed by the given relations and the properties of the regions' bounding boxes.

- From x NW y:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x, so x is above y)  

- From y W z:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z starts at or below y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z ends at or above y)  

Combining these:  
- For x-coordinates: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is left of z).  
- For y-coordinates: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), leading to \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

The relation between x and z depends on the vertical position:  
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then x NW z holds.  
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (and the other inequalities are satisfied), then x W z holds.  

The relation SW (South West) is impossible because it would require \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) < \sup_y(x)\) (since regions have positive area), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) cannot hold. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible due to the left-of constraint and vertical relationships.

Thus, the possible relations are NW and W.
