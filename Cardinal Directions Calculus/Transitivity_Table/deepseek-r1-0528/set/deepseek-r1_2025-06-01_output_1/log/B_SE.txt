PROMPT: Let B and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
  So \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(y\).

- \(y \text{ SE } z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From \(y \text{ SE } z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

- From \(y \text{ SE } z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
  Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ SE } z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:
- **B**: Requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\), but \(x\) is southeast of \(z\), so disjoint.
- **S**, **SW**, **W**, **NW**, **N**, **NE**, **E**: Require conditions contradicted by \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (e.g., **S** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) but also horizontal alignment, which fails due to the east shift; **E** requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) but also vertical containment, which fails due to the south shift).

Thus, the only possible relation is **SE**.
