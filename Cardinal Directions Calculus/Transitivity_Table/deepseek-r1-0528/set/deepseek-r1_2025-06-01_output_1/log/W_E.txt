PROMPT: Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z can be any of the nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B. This is because both x and z are positioned west of y (due to x W y and y E z implying z is west of y), and their vertical positions relative to each other can vary within the constraints of the relations. All combinations of horizontal and vertical alignments are possible, allowing for any of the defined cardinal direction relations to hold between x and z.

- **N**: x can be north of z if z is below and horizontally contained by x.  
- **NE**: x can be northeast of z if z is southwest of x.  
- **E**: x can be east of z if z is west of x.  
- **SE**: x can be southeast of z if z is northwest of x.  
- **S**: x can be south of z if z is above and horizontally contained by x.  
- **SW**: x can be southwest of z if z is northeast of x.  
- **W**: x can be west of z if z is east of x.  
- **NW**: x can be northwest of z if z is southeast of x.  
- **B**: x can be within the bounding box of z, or vice versa, depending on their extents.  

Thus, no relation is excluded based on the given conditions.

**Possible relations:** N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
