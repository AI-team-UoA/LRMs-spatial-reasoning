PROMPT: Let SE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these, we derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Horizontal axis (x-direction)**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)). Combining these:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This implies \(x\) is strictly to the east of \(z\), satisfying the horizontal condition for E, SE, and NE relations.

2. **Vertical axis (y-direction)**:  
   From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   The relative positions of \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) determine the vertical relation:

   - **Case 1: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**  
     Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\):  
     \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
     Thus, \(x\) SE \(z\) is possible.

   - **Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\)**  
     This requires further consideration of \(\inf_y(x)\):  
     - **Subcase 2.1: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
       Combined with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\):  
       \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
       Thus, \(x\) E \(z\) is possible.  
     - **Subcase 2.2: \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\)**  
       This configuration leads to vertical overlap without containment, which does not satisfy any of the defined cardinal direction relations. However, since the regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk and the relations must hold, this subcase is not feasible under the given constraints. Thus, it does not yield a valid relation.

Given the analysis, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SE** and **E**. These are the only relations that can occur under the constraints \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\).

**Possible relations:** SE, E
