PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) N \(y\): 
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\) vertically).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box).
- From \(y\) E \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(y\) horizontally).
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(y\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).
- Vertically: 
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) from \(x\) N \(y\)), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  - This implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but the relative positions of \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z)\) vary.

Possible vertical scenarios:
1. **NE (North East)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely below \(x\). Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).
2. **E (East)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box. Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\), this gives \(x\) E \(z\).

Other relations are not possible:
- SE requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), leading to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), implying \(\inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x)\), impossible for a region in REG.
- N, S, W, SW, NW, B violate the horizontal or vertical constraints derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}}
