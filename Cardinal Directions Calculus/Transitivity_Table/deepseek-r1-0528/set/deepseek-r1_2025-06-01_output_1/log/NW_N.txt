PROMPT: Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From these, the following constraints are derived:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the horizontal alignment:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - This implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - This matches the definition of NW: \(x\) is NW of \(z\).

2. **If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)** (which implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) due to the constraints):
   - The vertical condition \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) holds.
   - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then the horizontal conditions for N are satisfied: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
   - This matches the definition of N: \(x\) is N of \(z\).
   - The case where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\) is inconsistent with the atomic relations (as it violates the bounding box conditions for any relation), so it does not occur.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW and N.

**Answer**: NW, N
