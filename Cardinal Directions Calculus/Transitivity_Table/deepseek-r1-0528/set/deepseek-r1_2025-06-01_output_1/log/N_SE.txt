PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are derived from the bounding box inequalities.

- From x N y:  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x)  
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x starts at or right of y's start)  
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x ends at or left of y's end)  

- From y SE z:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is left of y)  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)  

Combining these:  
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) implies supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning z is entirely to the left of x.  
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), but no direct relation between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).  

Given that z is left of x, the possible relations for x relative to z are those where x is to the east of z: E (East), NE (North East), or SE (South East).  

- **NE (North East)**: Possible if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x).  
- **E (East)**: Possible if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x is vertically within the y-range of z).  
- **SE (South East)**: Possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (z is above x).  

Numerical examples confirm each is possible under the given constraints:  
- NE: e.g., y: supy(y)=0; z: infy(z)=0, supy(z)=1; x: infy(x)=2, supy(x)=3.  
- E: e.g., y: supy(y)=0; z: infy(z)=1, supy(z)=3; x: infy(x)=1.5, supy(x)=2.5.  
- SE: e.g., y: supy(y)=0; z: infy(z)=2, supy(z)=3; x: infy(x)=0, supy(x)=1.  

Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) are impossible because:  
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) prevents x from being west of z or having overlapping/containing x-ranges required for N, S, B, etc.  

Thus, the possible relations are NE, E, and SE.
