PROMPT: Let W and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

### Explanation:
- From x W y:  
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)  
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y's vertical range contains or is aligned with x's vertical range; specifically, y is not south of x).
- From y NW z:  
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)  
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y).

Chaining the horizontal inequalities:  
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) → supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is west of z.

Chaining the vertical inequalities:  
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) → supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning z is south of x (so x is north of z).

Thus, x is both west and north of z, satisfying the definition of x NW z:  
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)  
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) is possible due to the strict inequalities derived from the regions having positive area (as they are homeomorphic to a closed disk), which prevents vertical or horizontal alignment that would allow other relations.

Therefore, the only possible relation is **NW**.
