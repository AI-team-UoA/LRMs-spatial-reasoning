PROMPT: Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(x\) is west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\))

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), meaning \(y\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\):
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (\(z\) extends at least as far west and east as \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(z\) extends at least as far south and north as \(y\))

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **NW (North West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(x\) is entirely west and north of \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), leading to \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) in some cases)  
     - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), leading to \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) in some cases)  

2. **W (West)**:  
   - Occurs when \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) and vertically overlaps or is contained within \(z\)'s y-bounds:  
     - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (as above)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y-overlap where \(x\) is within \(z\)'s north-south extent)  

3. **N (North)**:  
   - Occurs when \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\) and horizontally overlaps or is contained within \(z\)'s x-bounds:  
     - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (as above)  
     - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x-overlap where \(x\) is within \(z\)'s east-west extent)  

These relations are possible under specific spatial arrangements consistent with the given constraints. Other relations (e.g., NE, E, SE, S, SW, B) are not possible due to conflicts in the positional constraints derived from \(x\) NW \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, W, N**.
