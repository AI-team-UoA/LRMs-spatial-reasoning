PROMPT: Let SE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these constraints:
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This implies \(x\) is to the east of \(z\) (since the left edge of \(z\) is left of the left edge of \(x\)).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but no direct constraint exists between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) or \(\sup_y(z)\), allowing flexibility in vertical positioning.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **SE**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Achievable by setting \(z\)'s right edge \(\leq x\)'s left edge and \(z\)'s bottom edge \(\geq x\)'s top edge.
- **E**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Achievable by setting \(z\)'s right edge \(\leq x\)'s left edge and \(x\) vertically within \(z\)'s span.
- **NE**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Achievable by setting \(z\)'s right edge \(\leq x\)'s left edge and \(z\)'s top edge \(\leq x\)'s bottom edge.
- **N**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Achievable by setting \(x\) above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s span.
- **B**: If \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Achievable by making \(z\) large enough to enclose \(x\).
- **S**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Achievable by setting \(x\) below \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s span.

Relations **SW**, **W**, and **NW** are impossible because they require \(x\) to be west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), but the constraints force \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), making \(x\) east of \(z\), not west.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, E, N, NE, S, SE**.
