PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y's bounds)

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **\(x\) left of \(z\)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\) (below and left).
2. **\(z\) left of \(x\)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is SE of \(z\) (below and right, since \(z\) is left of \(x\)).
3. **Horizontal containment**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is S of \(z\) (below and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds).

These cover the possible cases where the vertical condition (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) is satisfied. Configurations exist for each:
- **SW**: Arrange \(x\) entirely left of \(z\).
- **SE**: Arrange \(z\) entirely left of \(x\).
- **S**: Arrange \(z\)'s horizontal bounds to contain \(x\)'s.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer**  
SW, S, SE
