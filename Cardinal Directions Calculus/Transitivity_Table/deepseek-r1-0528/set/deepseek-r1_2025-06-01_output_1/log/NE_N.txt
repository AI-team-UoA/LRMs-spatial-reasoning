PROMPT: Let NE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, the relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be derived from the given conditions: \(x\) is NE of \(y\) and \(y\) is N of \(z\).

- **Vertical relation**:  
  From \(y\) N \(z\), we have \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).  
  From \(x\) NE \(y\), we have \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).  
  Combining these, \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), so \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\). This means \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

- **Horizontal relation**:  
  From \(x\) NE \(y\), we have \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).  
  From \(y\) N \(z\), we have \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\) and \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).  
  Combining these, \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).  
  The relation between \(\text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(z)\) determines the horizontal component:
  - If \(\text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\). Combined with the vertical separation, this gives \(x\) N \(z\).
  - If \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\). Combined with the vertical separation, this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).

Other relations (e.g., E, NW, etc.) are not possible due to the vertical separation and horizontal constraints. Examples confirm that \(x\) N \(z\) and \(x\) NE \(z\) are achievable:
- **N example**: \(z\) centered at (0,0) radius 1, \(y\) centered at (0,2) radius 0.1, \(x\) centered at (0.2,3) radius 0.1. Here, \(x\) is within the horizontal span of \(z\) and above.
- **NE example**: \(z\) centered at (0,0) radius 1, \(y\) centered at (0,2) radius 0.1, \(x\) centered at (1.2,3) radius 0.1. Here, \(x\) is entirely east and above \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N and NE**.
