PROMPT: Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the horizontal and vertical constraints:

1. **Vertical constraints**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
   - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).
   - Combining: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z)\) can be \(\leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) or \(> \text{inf}_y(x)\).

2. **Horizontal constraints**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).
   - Combining: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\), \(z\) left of \(x\), or overlap).

**Case analysis**:

- **Case 1: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)** (entire \(z\) below \(x\)):
  - If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
  - If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
  - Possible: NE, NW.

- **Case 2: \(\text{sup}_y(z) > \text{inf}_y(x)\)** (vertical overlap between bounding boxes):
  - If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and vertical containment (\(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is E of \(z\).
  - If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and vertical containment, then \(x\) is W of \(z\).
  - If the bounding box of \(x\) is inside \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).
  - Possible: E, W, B.

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are NE, NW, E, W, B.

**Answer**: NE, NW, E, W, B
