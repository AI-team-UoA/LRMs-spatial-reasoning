PROMPT: Let S and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is \(S\) of \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- \(y\) is \(N\) of \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these, the vertical constraints are:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\).

The horizontal constraints are:
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so the \(x\)-projection of \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-projection of \(z\).

Possible vertical arrangements between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **\(x\) entirely above \(z\)**: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) is \(N\) of \(z\) (\(x\ N\ z\)), as:
   - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from horizontal constraints).

2. **\(x\) entirely below \(z\)**: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) is \(S\) of \(z\) (\(x\ S\ z\)), as:
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from horizontal constraints).

3. **Bounding box containment**: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) is \(B\) of \(z\) (\(x\ B\ z\)), as:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Other relations (e.g., \(E\), \(W\), \(NE\), etc.) are impossible due to the horizontal containment. Examples confirm \(N\), \(S\), and \(B\) are achievable:
- \(x\ N\ z\): When \(z\) is below \(x\).
- \(x\ S\ z\): When \(x\) is below \(z\).
- \(x\ B\ z\): When \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N, S, B**.
