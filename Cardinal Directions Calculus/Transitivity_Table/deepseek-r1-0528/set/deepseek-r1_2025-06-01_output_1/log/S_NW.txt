PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the bounding box inequalities.

From \(x\) S \(y\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is south of \(y\))
- \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)

From \(y\) NW \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is west of \(z\))
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is south of \(y\))

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are south of \(y\), with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their y-bounds relative to each other:
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is north and west of \(z\), so \(x\) NW \(z\).
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is south and west of \(z\), so \(x\) SW \(z\).
- If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is west of \(z\) with vertical containment, so \(x\) W \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- \(x\) cannot be directly north (N), northeast (NE), east (E), southeast (SE), or south (S) of \(z\) because \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- \(x\) cannot be bounding box (B) of \(z\) or vice versa due to separation.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
