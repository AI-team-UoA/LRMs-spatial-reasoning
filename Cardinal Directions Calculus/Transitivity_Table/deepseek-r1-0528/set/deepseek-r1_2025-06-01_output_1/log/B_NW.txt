PROMPT: Let B and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- **x B y**: The bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of y.  
  This implies:  
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (x is horizontally within y).  
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (x is vertically within y).  

- **y NW z**: The bounding box of y is entirely northwest of z.  
  This implies:  
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (y is to the left of z).  
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (z is below y).  

Combining these:  
- From **x B y**: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).  
- From **y NW z**: \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), meaning x is entirely to the left of z.  

- From **x B y**: \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).  
- From **y NW z**: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
  Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), meaning z is entirely below x.  

These conditions satisfy the definition of **x NW z**:  
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (x left of z).  
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (z below x).  

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:  
- **W**, **N**, **B**, etc., require additional conditions (e.g., vertical alignment or overlap) that are violated by the strict left and below positioning derived.  
- For example, **W** would require \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), but \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (from above) contradicts \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) since \(\text{sup}_y(x) \geq \text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is **NW**.  

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{NW}}
