PROMPT: Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is West (W) of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is West (W) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - From \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), we have \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) match the definition of the West (W) relation for \(x\) relative to \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, SW, B) satisfies all these constraints simultaneously under the given conditions. For example:
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) (equality only in degenerate cases, not generally).
- Other relations (like NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, B) conflict with the horizontal or vertical bounds derived.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.
