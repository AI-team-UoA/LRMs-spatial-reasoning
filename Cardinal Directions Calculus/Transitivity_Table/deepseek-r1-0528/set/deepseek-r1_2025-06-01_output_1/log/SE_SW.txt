PROMPT: Let SE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely south of y)
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely west of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely south of z)

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible horizontal configurations:
1. **SW relation (\(x\) SW \(z\)):** If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x entirely west of z).
2. **S relation (\(x\) S \(z\)):** If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x horizontally within z's bounding box).
3. **SE relation (\(x\) SE \(z\)):** If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x entirely east of z).

These satisfy the vertical condition \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and cover all mutually exclusive cases for the south direction. No other relations (e.g., N, E, W, B) are possible due to the vertical separation and horizontal constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Answer:** SW, S, SE
