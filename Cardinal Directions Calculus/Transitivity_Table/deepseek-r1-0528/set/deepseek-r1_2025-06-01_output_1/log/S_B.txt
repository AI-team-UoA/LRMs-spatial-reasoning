PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- **Horizontal constraints**:  
  From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).  
  From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).  
  Combining: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\).

- **Vertical constraints**:  
  From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
  From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
  This implies \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), but the vertical position relative to \(\text{inf}_y(z)\) varies.

Two cases arise based on the vertical alignment:

1. **Case 1**: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).  
   Here, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) vertically, and with horizontal containment, the relation \(x\) S \(z\) holds.  
   Example:  
   - \(y\): bounding box \([2, 3] \times [4, 5]\).  
   - \(z\): bounding box \([1, 4] \times [4, 6]\) (so \(y\) B \(z\)).  
   - \(x\): bounding box \([2, 3] \times [1, 3.5]\) (so \(x\) S \(y\), and \(x\) S \(z\)).

2. **Case 2**: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{sup}_y(x)\).  
   Here, vertical overlap occurs, and the relation depends on the infimum of \(y\)-coordinates:  
   - **Subcase 2a**: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).  
     Vertical containment holds: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). With horizontal containment, \(x\) B \(z\) holds.  
     Example:  
     - \(y\): \([2, 3] \times [4, 5]\).  
     - \(z\): \([1, 4] \times [2, 6]\) (so \(y\) B \(z\)).  
     - \(x\): \([2, 3] \times [2.5, 3.5]\) (so \(x\) S \(y\), and \(x\) B \(z\)).  
   - **Subcase 2b**: \(\text{inf}_y(x) < \text{inf}_y(z)\).  
     Vertical containment fails, and no other cardinal relation (N, NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW) applies due to horizontal containment or vertical overlap constraints. This case does not yield any of the defined relations.

Thus, the only possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) that satisfy the conditions and the defined cardinal directions are **S** and **B**.
