PROMPT: Let E and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SW of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From \(x\) E \(y\), \(x\) is to the east of \(y\) and vertically contained within \(y\)'s y-bounds. From \(y\) SW \(z\), \(y\) is to the southwest of \(z\), so \(z\) is northeast of \(y\). Combining these:

- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (south in cardinal terms).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(y\)'s right edge (\(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)), but their relative horizontal positions can vary:
  - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) → relation is SW.
  - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) → relation is SE.
  - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds → relation is S.

No other relations are possible because:
- Vertically, \(x\) must be below \(z\) (due to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), ruling out N, NE, E, NW, W, B.
- The horizontal constraints only allow SW, SE, or S, depending on the alignment.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, SE.
