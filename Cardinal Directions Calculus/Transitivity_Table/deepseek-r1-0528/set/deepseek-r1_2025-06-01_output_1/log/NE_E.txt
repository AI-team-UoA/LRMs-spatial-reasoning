PROMPT: Let NE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NE (North East) and E (East).

### Explanation:
- **x NE y implies**:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- **y E z implies**:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is not below z)
  - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is not above z)

From these:
- The x-coordinate relation: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means x is always to the east of z, ruling out relations like W, SW, NW, N, S, and B.
- The y-coordinate relation: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NE y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y E z). Thus, infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

#### Possible Relations:
1. **NE (North East) between x and z**:
   - Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is satisfied.
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) can hold if supy(z) is set less than or equal to infy(x) (e.g., by making z smaller in y or x taller and positioned higher).
   - Example: Set z with y from 0 to 3, y with y from 2 to 2.5, and x with y from 3 to 4. Then y E z, x NE y, and x NE z.

2. **E (East) between x and z**:
   - Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) are satisfied.
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) can hold if supy(z) is large enough to contain the y-interval of x (e.g., by making z taller in y).
   - Example: Set z with y from 0 to 10, y with y from 5 to 6, and x with y from 7 to 9. Then y E z, x NE y, and x E z.

#### Why other relations are impossible:
- **SE (South East)**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). However, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(x) (since regions have area), so supy(x) > infy(z), making supy(x) ≤ infy(z) impossible.
- **N, S, SW, W, NW**: Require x not to be east of z, but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) forces x to be east.
- **B**: Requires containment in both x and y, but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) implies no containment in x.

Thus, the possible relations are NE and E.
