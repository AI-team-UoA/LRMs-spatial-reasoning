PROMPT: Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions provided:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is east of \(y\)).
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is north of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is east of \(z\)).
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(z\)).

From these:
- **East constraint for \(x\) and \(z\):**  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\), so the relation must include an eastern component (E, NE, or SE).

- **Vertical possibilities:**  
  - \(x\) is north of \(y\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
  - \(z\) is north of \(y\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
  However, the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) are not constrained beyond this. Three cases arise:
  1. **NE relation:** If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(x\)), then \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) (NE).  
  2. **SE relation:** If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)), then \(x\) is southeast of \(z\) (SE).  
  3. **E relation:** If the vertical strip of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\) (i.e., \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is directly east of \(z\) (E).  

Examples confirm all three are possible:
- **NE example:** \(z\) with bbox \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(y\) with \([1,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(x\) with \([2,3] \times [1,2]\). Then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).  
- **SE example:** \(z\) with \([0,1] \times [2,3]\), \(y\) with \([1,2] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) with \([2,3] \times [0,1]\). Then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).  
- **E example:** \(z\) with \([0,1] \times [2,5]\), \(y\) with \([1,2] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) with \([2,3] \times [3,4]\). Then \(x\) is E of \(z\).  

No other relations (like N, S, B, etc.) satisfy the east constraint and the conditions. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE, SE, and E.
