PROMPT: Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and from \(x\) W \(y\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). Combining these, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically, so the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must involve \(x\) being north of \(z\) (N, NE, or NW). However, horizontal constraints determine the specific relation.

Horizontal analysis:
- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
- Combining: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).

Two cases for horizontal alignment between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)**:  
   - \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) horizontally.
   - Vertically, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) holds.
   - This matches NW: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\), defined by \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

2. **If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (and automatically \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\) due to bounding boxes, and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) from constraints)**:  
   - \(x\) is horizontally within the west-east bounds of \(z\).
   - Vertically, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) holds.
   - This matches N: \(x\) is north of \(z\), defined by \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **NE** requires \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), but constraints imply \(\text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \geq \text{inf}_x(x)\), making NE impossible.
- **B, S, SW, W, E, SE** either contradict the vertical relation (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)) or horizontal constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **NW**.
