PROMPT: Let E and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these constraints:
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). This means the vertical projection of \(x\) is contained within the vertical projection of \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

Possible horizontal scenarios between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Disjoint with \(x\) left of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This satisfies the conditions for \(x\) W \(z\) (West relation), as:
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from above)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from above)

2. **Disjoint with \(x\) right of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This satisfies the conditions for \(x\) E \(z\) (East relation), as:
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

3. **Overlap with horizontal containment of \(x\) in \(z\)**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). This satisfies the conditions for \(x\) B \(z\) (bounding box relation), as:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Other relations (N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW) are impossible because:
- They require specific vertical disjointness (e.g., \(x\) above or below \(z\)), but the vertical constraints force containment, not disjointness.
- For example, \(x\) N \(z\) requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), making it impossible for \(z\) to be entirely below \(x\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B, E, W**.

**Final Answer: B, E, W**
