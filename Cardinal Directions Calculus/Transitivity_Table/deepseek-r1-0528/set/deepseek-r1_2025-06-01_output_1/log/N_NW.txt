PROMPT: Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (the entire \(y\) is below \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (the entire \(y\) is left of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (the entire \(z\) is below \(y\)).

Combining these constraints:

1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

2. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Chaining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\).

The relation NW is defined as:
- \(a\) NW \(b\) if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).

Here, for \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (satisfies the horizontal condition for NW),
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfies the vertical condition for NW).

Thus, \(x\) must be NW of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible under these constraints because:
- They require conditions that contradict the derived vertical and horizontal separations (e.g., S or SW would require \(z\) above or overlapping vertically, which is not the case; E or W would require horizontal overlap or opposite alignment; B requires containment, but \(x\) and \(z\) are disjoint and separated).

Therefore, the only possible relation is **NW**.
