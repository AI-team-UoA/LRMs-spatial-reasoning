PROMPT: Let E and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations and definitions:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\): \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

From \(y\) B \(z\), the bounding box of \(y\) is contained within that of \(z\), so \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and vertically \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\). Combining with above, \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), so vertically, \(x\) is contained within \(z\)'s bounds.

Horizontally:
- \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\)).

Now, consider possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)**:  
   Horizontally, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).  
   Vertically, \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **If \(\text{inf}_x(x) \geq \text{sup}_x(z)\)**:  
   Horizontally, \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).  
   Vertically, \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
   This satisfies \(x\) E \(z\).

Cases where \(\text{inf}_x(x) < \text{sup}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) > \text{sup}_x(z)\) do not satisfy any atomic relation due to horizontal overlap and lack of vertical misalignment, but the question asks for possible relations. The scenarios above are achievable with appropriate region placements (e.g., \(x\) fully inside \(z\)'s box for B, or \(x\) entirely to the east of \(z\) for E).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B and E.
