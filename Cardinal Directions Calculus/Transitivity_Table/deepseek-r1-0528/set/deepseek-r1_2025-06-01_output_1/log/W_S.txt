PROMPT: Let W and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these constraints:

1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

2. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

The possible horizontal scenarios are:
- **Case 1: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**.
  - Here, \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).
  - Combined with \(x\) being below \(z\), this satisfies the SW relation: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **Case 2: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**.
  - Here, the left bound of \(z\) is left of or equal to the left bound of \(x\).
  - Also, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
  - Combined with \(x\) being below \(z\), this satisfies the S relation: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **SE** requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\), violating SE.
- **B** requires vertical containment \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is only possible if equality holds, which would imply zero vertical extent for \(x\), contradicting the requirement that regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk (having positive area).
- **N, NE, NW, W, E** are ruled out by the vertical constraint \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which implies \(x\) cannot be above \(z\) or have other vertical overlaps.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and S.

**Final Answer: SW, S**
