PROMPT: Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be any of the nine defined relations. This is because the constraints allow for various relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) with respect to each other, as demonstrated by specific examples for each relation:

- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\).
- **NE**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\).
- **SE**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) is east of \(z\).
- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\).
- **B**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

Each relation is achievable under the given constraints by appropriately positioning \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) while satisfying \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) NE \(z\).

**Answer**: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
