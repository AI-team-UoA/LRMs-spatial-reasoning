PROMPT: Let SE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible relations between x and z are:

- **SE (South East)**: This occurs when the entire x is to the east and south of z. Specifically, if the supremum of z's x-projection is less than or equal to the infimum of x's x-projection (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) and the supremum of x's y-projection is less than or equal to the infimum of z's y-projection (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), which holds from the given relations. For example:
  - z: [0, 1] × [1, 2] (bounding box)
  - y: [0, 1] × [-2, -1] (S of z)
  - x: [2, 3] × [-4, -3] (SE of y, and SE of z).

- **S (South)**: This occurs when the entire x is directly south of z and within the horizontal span of z. Specifically, if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which holds), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which holds as infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (which can be satisfied by choosing x such that its x-projection is contained within z's). For example:
  - z: [0, 3] × [1, 2]
  - y: [0, 2] × [-2, -1] (S of z)
  - x: [2.5, 2.8] × [-4, -3] (SE of y, and S of z as supx(x) = 2.8 ≤ supx(z) = 3).

No other cardinal direction relations are possible:
- **SW (South West)**: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but infx(z) ≤ infx(x) implies supx(x) ≥ infx(x) ≥ infx(z), making equality degenerate and not generally possible for non-degenerate regions.
- **E (East)**: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and vertical containment, but if supx(z) > infx(x), E fails, and vertical containment is not guaranteed.
- **B (Bounding box)**: Requires full containment in both axes, but vertically, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) fails unless degenerate.
- Other relations (N, NE, NW, W) require x to be north of z, which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Thus, the possible relations are **SE** and **S**.
