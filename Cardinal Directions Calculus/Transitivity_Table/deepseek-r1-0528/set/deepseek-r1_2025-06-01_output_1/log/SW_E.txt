PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are determined by the constraints on their bounding boxes.

- \(x \text{ SW } y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)
- \(y \text{ E } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is left of y)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z contains y vertically)

Combining these:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- \(x\) is below \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(z\) extends vertically to contain \(y\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary, leading to multiple possible relations:
- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is left and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) and \(z\) disjoint, with \(x\) southwest of \(z\)).
- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: If the bounding box of \(x\) is entirely within that of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally contained in \(z\).
- **SE (South East)**: If \(x\) is right and below \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) southeast of \(z\)).
- **E (East)**: If \(x\) is right of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\).

These relations are possible under specific configurations of the bounding boxes, as verified with examples. Other relations (N, NE, NW) are impossible due to the constraints (e.g., \(x\) must be below \(y\), and \(z\) contains \(y\) vertically, preventing \(x\) from being north of \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **B, E, S, SE, SW, W**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{B}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}}
