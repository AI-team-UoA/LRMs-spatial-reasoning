PROMPT: Let NW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the horizontal and vertical constraints from these relations. The valid combinations yield the following possible cardinal direction relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):

- **B (Bounding box)**: When \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: When \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
- **S (South)**: When \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- **W (West)**: When \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\).
- **NW (North West)**: When \(x\) is entirely to the left and above \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: When \(x\) is entirely to the left and below \(z\).

These relations cover all possible configurations given the constraints. The relations NE, E, and SE are not possible due to the horizontal and vertical bounds derived from the initial relations, ensuring non-degenerate regions with positive extent.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:  
**B, N, S, W, NW, SW**.
