PROMPT: Let E and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these constraints:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   From \(y\) SE \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), leading to \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This means \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\) (east).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   From \(y\) SE \(z\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   From \(x\) E \(y\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This means \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (south).

The combined direction of \(x\) being east and south of \(z\) corresponds to the **SE (South East)** relation. Specifically, the conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) satisfies both constraints simultaneously:
- **S** requires \(x\) to be within the horizontal bounds of \(z\), but \(x\) is entirely to the right.
- **E** requires \(x\) to be within the vertical bounds of \(z\), but \(x\) is entirely below.
- **B** requires \(x\) to be within both horizontal and vertical bounds of \(z\), which is not true.
- Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW) do not align with the derived east and south positioning.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **SE**.
