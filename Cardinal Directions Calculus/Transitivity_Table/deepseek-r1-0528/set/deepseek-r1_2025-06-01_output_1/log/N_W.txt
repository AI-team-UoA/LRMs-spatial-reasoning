PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these constraints:  
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(x\) is left of \(z\).  
2. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
3. \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but no direct constraint between \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x)\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
- **NW (North West)**: Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This is possible if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (e.g., \(z\)'s top is at or below \(x\)'s bottom).  
- **W (West)**: Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This is possible if \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\) (e.g., \(z\)'s top is at or above \(x\)'s top, with \(x\) vertically within \(z\)'s bounds).

Other relations are not possible:  
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **N**, **NE**, **E**, **SE** violate the constraints (e.g., horizontal separation or vertical ordering).  
- The vertical overlap where \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\) does not fit any defined relation, but NW and W are achievable under specific configurations.

Thus, the possible relations are **NW** and **W**.  

**Answer: NW, W**
