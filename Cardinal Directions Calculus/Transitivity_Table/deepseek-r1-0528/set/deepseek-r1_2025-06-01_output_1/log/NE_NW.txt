PROMPT: Let NE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box inequalities.

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (y is left of x)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)

- \(y\) NW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)

From these, it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is below \(x\). Therefore, relations where \(z\) is not below \(x\) (e.g., N, NE, E, NW, B) are impossible. Relations requiring \(x\) to be below \(z\) (e.g., S, SE, SW) or vertical alignment (e.g., E, W) are also impossible due to the strict vertical separation and positive area of regions.

The only possible relations are those where \(z\) is below \(x\), considering horizontal positioning:
- **x N z**: \(z\) directly below \(x\) with horizontal containment (possible when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
- **x NE z**: \(z\) southwest of \(x\) (left and below; possible when \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
- **x NW z**: \(z\) southeast of \(x\) (right and below; possible when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)).

Examples confirm these relations are achievable with appropriate bounding boxes:
- For \(x\) N \(z\): Set regions such that \(z\) horizontally contains \(x\) and \(z\) is below \(x\).
- For \(x\) NE \(z\): Set \(z\) left and below \(x\).
- For \(x\) NW \(z\): Set \(z\) right and below \(x\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, and NW.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
