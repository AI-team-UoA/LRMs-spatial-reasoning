PROMPT: Let N and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are N, S, or B. This is derived from the constraints of the bounding boxes:

- From \(x\) N \(y\), we have \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) S \(z\), we have \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Combining these, the horizontal bounds satisfy \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning \(x\)'s bounding box is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s bounding box. The vertical relationship depends on the specific bounds:

- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is S of \(z\).
- If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment), then \(x\) is B of \(z\).

Diagonal relations (e.g., NE, SE, SW, NW) and pure east/west (E, W) are impossible due to the horizontal containment. Therefore, the possible relations are N, S, and B.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
