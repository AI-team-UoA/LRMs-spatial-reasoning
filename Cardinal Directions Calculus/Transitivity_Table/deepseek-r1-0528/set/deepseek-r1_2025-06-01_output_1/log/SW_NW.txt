PROMPT: Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)
- \(y\) NW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)

Chaining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- Vertically: Both \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but the relative vertical position between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their y-bounds.

Possible vertical relations:
1. If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\): \(x\) is entirely below \(z\), so \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\): \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), so \(x\) NW \(z\).
3. If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\): \(x\) is vertically within \(z\), so \(x\) W \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- B: Requires \(x\) contained in \(z\)'s bounding box, but \(x\) is left of \(z\), so disjoint.
- S, SE, E, NE, N: Require specific horizontal alignments (e.g., \(x\) not left of \(z\) for E, NE, SE; or vertical misalignment).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

**Final Answer: SW, W, NW**
