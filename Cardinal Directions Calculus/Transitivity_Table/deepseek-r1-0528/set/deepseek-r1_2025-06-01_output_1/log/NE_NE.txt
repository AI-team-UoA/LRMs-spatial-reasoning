PROMPT: Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is NE.

### Explanation:
- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From the inequalities:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., N, E, SE, etc.) is possible due to the strict separation in both x and y dimensions, enforced by the positive extent of regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed disk, implying \(\inf_x < \sup_x\) and \(\inf_y < \sup_y\) for all regions).

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.
