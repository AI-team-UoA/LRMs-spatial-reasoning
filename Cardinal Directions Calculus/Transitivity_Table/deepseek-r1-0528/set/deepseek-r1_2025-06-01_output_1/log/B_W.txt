PROMPT: Let B and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and their definitions:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ W } z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)  
   From \(y \text{ W } z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
   Thus: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. From \(y \text{ W } z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)  
   From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
   Thus: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

3. From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)  
   From \(y \text{ W } z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)  
   Thus: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These conditions (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)) match the definition of the **W** (West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, SW, B) is satisfied:
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and no guarantee that \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- **NW** requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but we have \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and no guarantee that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- Other relations (like E, SE, NE, S, N, B) are incompatible with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) or the vertical conditions.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.
