PROMPT: Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is entirely east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely south of y)

- \(y\) W \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is entirely west of z)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z vertically contains y)

Considering the composition of these relations, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived through geometric constraints and example configurations:

1. **SW (South West)**: \(x\) can be entirely west and south of \(z\).
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,1.6] \times [-1,-0.5]\), \(z\) at \([1.7,2.5] \times [0,1]\). Then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).

2. **W (West)**: \(x\) can be entirely west of \(z\) with vertical containment.
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,2] \times [-1,-0.5]\), \(z\) at \([2.1,3] \times [-1.5,0.5]\). Then \(x\) is W of \(z\).

3. **S (South)**: \(x\) can be entirely south of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2.5] \times [-0.5,1.5]\). Then \(x\) is S of \(z\).

4. **SE (South East)**: \(x\) can be entirely east and south of \(z\).
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([2,3] \times [-2,-1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2] \times [0,1]\). Then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).

5. **E (East)**: \(x\) can be entirely east of \(z\) with vertical containment.
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([2,3] \times [-2,-1]\), \(z\) at \([1.5,2] \times [-1.5,1.5]\). Then \(x\) is E of \(z\).

6. **B (Bounding box)**: \(x\) can be contained within the bounding box of \(z\).
   - Example: \(y\) at \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) at \([1.5,2] \times [-1,-0.5]\), \(z\) at \([1,2.5] \times [-1.5,1.5]\). Then \(x\) is B of \(z\).

Relations **N (North)**, **NE (North East)**, and **NW (North West)** are impossible due to vertical constraints:
- \(x\) is always south of \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), and \(z\) vertically contains \(y\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), forcing \(x\) to be below \(z\)'s upper part. Thus, \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\) in any form.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\): B, E, S, SE, SW, W**
