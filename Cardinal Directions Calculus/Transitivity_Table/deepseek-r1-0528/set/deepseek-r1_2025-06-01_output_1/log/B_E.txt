PROMPT: Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions:

- \(x\) is \(B\) of \(y\) means:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is \(E\) of \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **X-axis constraints**:
   - From \(y\) \(E\) \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(x\) \(B\) \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)

2. **Y-axis constraints**:
   - From \(y\) \(E\) \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - From \(x\) \(B\) \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
   - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Comparing with the cardinal direction definitions:
- **\(E\) (East)** requires:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
- These conditions are fully satisfied.

Other relations do not hold:
- **\(B\)**: Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) only if degenerate (contradiction for 2D regions).
- **\(S\)**, **\(SE\)**: Require \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) makes this impossible without degeneracy.
- **\(SW\)**, **\(W\)**: Require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\), not the reverse.
- **\(N\)**, **\(NE\)**, **\(NW\)**: Require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) or similar, but \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\) contradict this without degeneracy.

Thus, the only possible relation is \(E\) (East), meaning \(x\) is east of \(z\).
