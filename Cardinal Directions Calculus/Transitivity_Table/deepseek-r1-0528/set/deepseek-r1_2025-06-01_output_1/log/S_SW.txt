PROMPT: Let S and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\) means:
  - \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\),
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), and
  - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).

- \(y\) is SW of \(z\) means:
  - \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), and
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\).

Combining these:

- From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y)\).
- From \(y\) SW \(z\), \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\).
- Thus, \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), so \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\).

- From \(x\) S \(y\), \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).
- From \(y\) SW \(z\), \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).
- Thus, \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), so \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).

These conditions \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) match the definition of SW. Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.
