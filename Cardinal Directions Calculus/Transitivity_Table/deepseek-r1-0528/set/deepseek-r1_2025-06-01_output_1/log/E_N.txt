PROMPT: Let E and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is to the east of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (vertically, \(x\) is within the bounds of \(y\))
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertically, \(y\) is north of \(z\))
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is within the bounds of \(z\))

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), so \(x\) must be north of \(z\) in some form (N, NE, or NW).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\))
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\))

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_x(z)\) relative to \(\inf_x(x)\):
1. **If \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\)**:
   - \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\) (since \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
   - Combined with \(z\) being below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\).
2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\)**:
   - There is potential horizontal overlap or containment.
   - Additionally, if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) imply \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).
   - Combined with \(z\) being below \(x\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).
   - If \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\), no defined cardinal direction fits, but this case does not yield a valid relation among the nine.

Other relations (e.g., NW, E, B) are impossible:
- **NW** would require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) makes this degenerate (non-standard for regions homeomorphic to a disk).
- **E**, **W**, **S**, **SE**, **SW**, **B** violate the vertical condition (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) ensures \(x\) is above \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **NE**.
