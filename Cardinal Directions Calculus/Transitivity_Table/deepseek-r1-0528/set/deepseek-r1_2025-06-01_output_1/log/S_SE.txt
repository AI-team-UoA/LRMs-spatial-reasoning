PROMPT: Let S and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) and horizontally within the x-range of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the right and below \(z\).

Combining these:  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) is below \(z\).  
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) is to the right of \(z\).  

This satisfies the definition of SE:  
\(x\) SE \(z\) requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which both hold.  

No other relations (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) are possible, as they would violate the combined constraints (e.g., \(x\) cannot be above, left, or within the bounding box of \(z\) given the below and right positioning).

Thus, the only possible relation is **SE**.
