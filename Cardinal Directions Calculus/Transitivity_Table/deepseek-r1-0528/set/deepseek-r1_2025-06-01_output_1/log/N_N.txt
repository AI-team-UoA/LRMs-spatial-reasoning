PROMPT: Let N and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely above \(y\))  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\)'s x-interval is contained within \(y\)'s x-interval).  

- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely above \(z\))  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\)'s x-interval is contained within \(z\)'s x-interval).  

Combining these:  
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
- Horizontally:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  

Thus, for \(x\) and \(z\):  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical condition for N),  
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal condition for N).  

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) being N of \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (NE, NW, E, W, S, SE, SW, B) can hold simultaneously under these constraints due to:  
- Vertical constraints ensuring \(x\) is above \(z\),  
- Horizontal constraints ensuring containment,  
- Mutual exclusivity of the relations.  

Thus, the only possible relation is **N**.
