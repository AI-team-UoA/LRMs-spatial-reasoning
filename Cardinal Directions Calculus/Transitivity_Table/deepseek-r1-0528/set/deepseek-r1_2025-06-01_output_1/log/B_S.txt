PROMPT: Let B and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is in the relation B with region \(y\) (\(x\) B \(y\)) and region \(y\) is in the relation S with region \(z\) (\(y\) S \(z\)), we analyze the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\).

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\),
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\),
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Combining these:

- **Horizontal constraints**:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).
  - Thus, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), meaning the horizontal span of \(x\) is within that of \(z\).

- **Vertical constraints**:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
  - Also, \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), so \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
  - Thus, the entire region \(x\) lies vertically below \(z\), with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) match the definition of the S (South) relation for \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- \(x\) S \(z\) requires:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\),
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\),
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Other relations are not possible:
- **SW, W, NW**: Require \(x\) to extend left beyond \(z\)'s horizontal span, but \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) prevents this.
- **SE, E, NE**: Require \(x\) to extend right beyond \(z\)'s horizontal span, but \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) prevents this.
- **N, NE, NW**: Require \(x\) to be above \(z\), but \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) forces \(x\) below \(z\).
- **B**: Requires \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but we have \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\). Equality would force \(x\) to a horizontal line, violating the region's properties (homeomorphic to a closed disk).

Thus, the only possible relation is **S**.
