PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\)) and  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) vertically contains \(x\)).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the east of \(z\)) and  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the north of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\).
- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the north of \(z\).

This satisfies the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\):  
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (east condition),  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (north condition).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) is possible, as they violate either the horizontal or vertical constraints derived. For example:
- **E** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but we have \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z)\), violating E.
- **N** requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), but we have \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), violating horizontal containment.
- **SE** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but we have \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(z)\), violating SE.

Thus, the only possible relation is **NE**.
