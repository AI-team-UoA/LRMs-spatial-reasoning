PROMPT: Let SE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (entirely to the east of \(y\))  
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (entirely to the south of \(y\))  

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (horizontally contained)  
  - \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (vertically contained)  

The constraints imply:  
- \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (so \(x\) is east of \(z\) or horizontally overlapping)  
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (so \(x\) is south of \(z\) or vertically overlapping)  

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
- **B**: If \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s bounding box.  
  Example: \(z\) extends sufficiently to cover \(x\) horizontally and vertically.  
- **S**: If \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)) and horizontally aligned (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)).  
  Example: \(z\) extends south to just above \(x\) and covers \(x\) horizontally.  
- **E**: If \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) and vertically contained in \(z\) (\(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)).  
  Example: \(z\) ends before \(x\) starts horizontally, and \(x\) is vertically within \(z\).  
- **SE**: If \(x\) is southeast of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)).  
  Example: \(z\) ends before \(x\) starts horizontally, and \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).  

Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW) are impossible due to the constraints ensuring \(x\) is east and south of \(y\), and \(y\) contained in \(z\).  

Thus, the possible relations are **B, S, E, SE**.  

**Answer: B, S, E, SE**
