PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W (West) of region y and region y is B (bounding box) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are W (West) and B (bounding box).

### Explanation:
- **x is W of y**: This means that the right edge of x is less than or equal to the left edge of y (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(y)), and x is vertically within the bounds of y (i.e., infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)).
- **y is B of z**: This means that the bounding box of z contains the bounding box of y (i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

From these relations:
- The vertical bounds of x are contained within the vertical bounds of z because infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This vertical containment means that x cannot be directly north, south, or in any diagonal direction (e.g., NE, NW, SE, SW) relative to z, as those require vertical separation.
- The horizontal position between x and z depends on the relative values of infx(z) and supx(x):
  - If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is W of z (since the vertical containment is already satisfied).
  - If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (which is true from the relations), then x is B of z (as the vertical containment is also satisfied).
- It is impossible for x to be E (East) of z because supx(z) ≥ supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) ≥ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) cannot hold (it would require regions to be points, which is not the case for regions homeomorphic to disks).

Thus, the possible relations from x to z are W or B.
