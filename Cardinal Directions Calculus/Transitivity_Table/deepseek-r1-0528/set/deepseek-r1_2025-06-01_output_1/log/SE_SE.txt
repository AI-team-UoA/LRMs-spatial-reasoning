PROMPT: Let SE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) → \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) → \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\):
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (x is east of z).
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x is south of z).

No other relations (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) are possible, as they require additional conditions that contradict the above (e.g., overlapping projections or different directional constraints).

Thus, the only possible relation is SE.
