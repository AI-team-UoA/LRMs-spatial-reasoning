PROMPT: Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions, if region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the bounding box relations imply:

- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

These inequalities satisfy the conditions for \(x\) to be B of \(z\):
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is B.
