PROMPT: Let NW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(y\) and \(y\) is entirely below \(x\).

- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(y\) and \(z\) is entirely below \(y\).

From these:
1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) NW \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

2. **Horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\):  
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(x\) NW \(y\)).  
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\)).  
   The horizontal positioning of \(x\) and \(z\) relative to each other can be:
   - **\(x\) left of \(z\) (no overlap)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
     Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) NW \(z\).
   - **\(z\) left of \(x\) (no overlap)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
     Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).
   - **Overlap with \(x\) horizontally contained in \(z\)**: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
     Combined with \(z\) below \(x\), this gives \(x\) N \(z\).

No other relations are possible given the constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW, NE, and N.

**Final Answer**  
N, NE, NW
