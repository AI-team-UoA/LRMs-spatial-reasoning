PROMPT: Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely left of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is vertically within \(y\)).

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(z\)),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is horizontally within \(z\)).

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) S \(z\)).
  - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the horizontal bound \(\sup_x(x)\) relative to \(\sup_x(z)\):

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:
   - Horizontally, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\).
   - Vertically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - This matches the definition of \(x\) S \(z\).

2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:
   - Horizontally, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).
   - Vertically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - This matches the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\).

Cases where \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) do not fit any atomic relation as defined, as \(x\) is not entirely within \(z\) horizontally, nor entirely to the left or right. However, the possible relations that **can** occur (based on satisfiable conditions) are S and SE.

**Possible relations: S, SE**
