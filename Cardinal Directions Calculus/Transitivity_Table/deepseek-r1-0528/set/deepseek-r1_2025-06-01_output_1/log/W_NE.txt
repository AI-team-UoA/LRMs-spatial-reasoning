PROMPT: Let W and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and vertically, \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(y\) and vertically within the span of \(y\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\). This means \(y\) is to the right and above \(z\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\).
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

For the relation from \(x\) to \(z\):
- \(z\) is below \(x\), so the vertical condition for relations where \(x\) is above \(z\) is satisfied: \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- The horizontal relation depends on the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\):
  - If \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
  - If \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)), then \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
  - If \(z\) is horizontally within \(x\) (\(\text{inf}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(x)\)), then \(x\) is N of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as demonstrated by configurations that satisfy the initial conditions:
- **NW example**: \(x\) in \([0, 3] \times [5, 7]\), \(z\) in \([4, 6] \times [0, 4.5]\), \(y\) appropriately set.
- **N example**: \(x\) in \([5, 10] \times [6, 8]\), \(z\) in \([5, 10] \times [0, 5]\), \(y\) appropriately set.
- **NE example**: \(x\) in \([4, 6] \times [5, 7]\), \(z\) in \([0, 3] \times [0, 4.5]\), \(y\) appropriately set.

Thus, the possible relations from \(x\) to \(z\) are NW, N, and NE.

**Final Answer**  
NW, N, NE
