PROMPT: Let E and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is E (East) of region y and region y is E (East) of region z, the relation between x and z must be E (East). This is derived from the transitive properties of the cardinal direction relations:

- From x E y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- From y E z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Chaining these:
- For the x-direction: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) imply supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- For the y-direction: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) implies infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) implies supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Thus, the conditions for x E z are satisfied:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is left of x),
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x is vertically within z).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible, as they violate the derived inequalities or the vertical containment.

\boxed{\text{E}}
