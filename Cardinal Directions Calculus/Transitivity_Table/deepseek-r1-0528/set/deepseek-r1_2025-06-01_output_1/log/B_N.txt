PROMPT: Let B and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ N } z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **x-coordinate constraints**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
   - From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Chaining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Thus: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

2. **y-coordinate constraints**:
   - From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - From \(y \text{ N } z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - Chaining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - Thus: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The combined constraints \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of the **N** relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y-condition),
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x-infimum condition),
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x-supremum condition).

No other cardinal direction relation (NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is satisfied under these constraints without requiring additional degenerate conditions (e.g., regions collapsing to lines or points), which are excluded since regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (non-degenerate with interior).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **N**.
