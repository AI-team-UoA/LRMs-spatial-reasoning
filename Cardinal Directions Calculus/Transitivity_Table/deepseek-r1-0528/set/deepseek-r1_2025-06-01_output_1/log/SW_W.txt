PROMPT: Let SW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) can vary relative to each other.  
- \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\) imply \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the vertical alignment:  
1. **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:  
   Then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which satisfies the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\).  
2. **If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**:  
   Then \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which satisfies the definition of \(x\) W \(z\).  

The condition \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is necessary for W, and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for SW. These scenarios are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities where the composition yields a defined relation. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, NW, B) do not hold under the constraints, as verified by the bounding box conditions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **W**.
