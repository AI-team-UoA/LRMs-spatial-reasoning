PROMPT: Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), we analyze the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

- The NW relation is defined as:  
  \(a \text{ NW } b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).

From \(x \text{ NW } y\):  
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)  
2. \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

From \(y \text{ NW } z\):  
3. \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
4. \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

**X-axis analysis:**  
From (1) and (3):  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  

**Y-axis analysis:**  
From (2) and (4):  
\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  

These conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x \text{ NW } z\).  

Regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (non-degenerate, with positive area). The derived inequalities are strict in the sense that the bounding boxes do not overlap in a way that allows other relations (e.g., for B, E, S, etc.), as the conditions for those relations conflict with the above. For example:  
- B requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), and equality would require degenerate bounding boxes (disallowed).  
- Similarly, E requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\) contradicts this since \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  

Thus, the only possible relation is NW.
