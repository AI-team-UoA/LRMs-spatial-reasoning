PROMPT: Let NW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the following constraints apply:

- **From \(x \text{ NW } y\)**:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)

- **From \(y \text{ SW } z\)**:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)

Combining the horizontal constraints:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) imply \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is left of \(z\).

For the vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\), the constraints do not fix a specific vertical ordering. The possible vertical scenarios are:

1. **\(x\) is above \(z\)** (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)):  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x \text{ NW } z\).

2. **\(x\) is below \(z\)** (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)):  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x \text{ SW } z\).

3. **Vertical alignment where \(x\) is within the vertical range of \(z\)** (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)):  
   This satisfies the definition of \(x \text{ W } z\).

No other cardinal direction relations are possible because:
- The horizontal constraint (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) restricts relations to those with \(x\) left of \(z\) (NW, W, SW).
- The vertical constraints from the given relations do not force a specific overlap or additional ordering beyond the three cases above.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, W, SW**.
