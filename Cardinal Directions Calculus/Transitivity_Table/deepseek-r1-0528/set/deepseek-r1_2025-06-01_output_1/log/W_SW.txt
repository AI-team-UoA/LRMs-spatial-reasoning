PROMPT: Let W and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions and the given relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  

- \(y\) is SW of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

Combining these:  
- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (by definition of bounds), it follows that:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  

- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x\) being SW of \(z\).  

No other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, NW, W, B) are possible because:  
- For W, NW, or S: Requires additional constraints (e.g., vertical alignment) that are not satisfied here.  
- For others: The combined bounds force \(x\) strictly southwest of \(z\) without overlap or other alignments.  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.
