PROMPT: Let NE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are SW, NW, and W. 

- **SW (South West)**: \(z\) is southwest of \(x\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the west and south of \(x\).
- **NW (North West)**: \(z\) is northwest of \(x\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the west and north of \(x\).
- **W (West)**: \(z\) is west of \(x\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the west and vertically within the north-south bounds of \(x\).

These relations are derived from the constraints:
- From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

Combining these, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\). The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary (below, above, or contained), but only SW, NW, and W satisfy the bounding box constraints for non-degenerate regions in REG.

Possible relations: **SW, NW, W**.
