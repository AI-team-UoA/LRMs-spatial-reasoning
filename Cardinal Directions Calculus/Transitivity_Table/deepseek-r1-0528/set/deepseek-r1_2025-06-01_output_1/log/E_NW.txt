PROMPT: Let E and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(x\) E \(y\) and \(y\) NW \(z\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\text{sup}_x(y)\).
- Vertically, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their horizontal alignment:
1. **NW relation**: If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\), and with \(x\) above \(z\), \(x\) is NW of \(z\).
2. **N relation**: If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(z\), and with \(x\) above \(z\), \(x\) is N of \(z\).
3. **NE relation**: If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(z\), and with \(x\) above \(z\), \(x\) is NE of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, given the vertical constraint forces \(x\) above \(z\), and the horizontal alignment can vary. Other relations (e.g., S, SW, SE, E, W, B) are incompatible with \(x\) being above \(z\) or the given constraints.

**Possible relations: NW, N, NE**
