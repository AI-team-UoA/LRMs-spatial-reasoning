PROMPT: Let S and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, the relation between x and z must be S. This is determined by the transitive nature of the S relation under the given cardinal direction definitions, as the inequalities derived from the bounding boxes enforce that x is directly south of z with x contained within the x-bounds of z.

- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- From y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
- Chaining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- Also, infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- And supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- These satisfy the conditions for x S z: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as they violate the derived inequalities or require additional conditions not met here.

Thus, the only possible relation is S.
