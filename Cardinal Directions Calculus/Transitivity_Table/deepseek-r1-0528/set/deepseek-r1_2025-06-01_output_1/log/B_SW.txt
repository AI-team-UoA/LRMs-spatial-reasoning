PROMPT: Let B and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)

- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. For the \(x\)-axis:
   - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
   - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) SW \(z\))
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)

2. For the \(y\)-axis:
   - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
   - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SW \(z\))
   - Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\)

The conditions \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) match the definition of the SW (South West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) can hold simultaneously under these constraints because:
- \(x\) must lie entirely to the west (left) of \(z\) due to \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).
- \(x\) must lie entirely to the south (below) of \(z\) due to \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
- Other relations require different alignments (e.g., overlapping bounding boxes, different directional overlaps) that are precluded by these strict inequalities.

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.
