PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from \(x\) SW \(y\)).
- \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)).
- Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their relative positions:
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) below \(z\), this gives \(x\) SW \(z\).
2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), then \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (so \(x\) is to the right of \(z\)). Combined with \(x\) below \(z\), this gives \(x\) SE \(z\).
3. **S (South)**: If \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (i.e., the \(x\)-interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\)), and \(x\) is below \(z\), this gives \(x\) S \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- **B (bounding box)**: Requires \(z\) to contain \(x\)'s bounding box, but \(x\) is below \(z\), violating vertical containment.
- **N, NE, NW**: Require \(x\) to be above \(z\), but \(x\) is below \(z\).
- **E, W**: Require vertical alignment or partial containment that conflicts with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW, SE, S**.
