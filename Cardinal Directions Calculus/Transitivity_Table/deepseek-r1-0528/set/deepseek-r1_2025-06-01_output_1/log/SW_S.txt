PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S (South) and SW (SouthWest).

### Derivation:
- From \(x\) SW \(y\):
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- From \(y\) S \(z\):
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining the inequalities:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This means \(x\) is below \(z\) in the y-direction, limiting possible relations to those with a south component (S, SW, or SE).

However, SE is impossible:
- SE requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- From the inequalities, \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). For SE, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) would imply \(\inf_x(x) = \sup_x(z)\), but regions have positive area (since they are homeomorphic to a disk), so \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(x)\), leading to a contradiction. Thus, SE cannot hold.

The possible relations are S and SW, depending on the x-coordinates:
- **S (South)**: This holds if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (always true) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (also always true from the inequalities), all conditions for S are satisfied.
- **SW (SouthWest)**: This holds if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (always true), all conditions for SW are satisfied.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, W, NW, B) are impossible due to the y-direction constraint \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which ensures \(x\) is below \(z\), and specific x-direction conflicts as derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are S and SW.
