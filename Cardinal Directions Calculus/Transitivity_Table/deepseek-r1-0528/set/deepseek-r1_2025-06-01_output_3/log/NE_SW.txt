PROMPT: Let NE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (y is left of x)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)

The relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their relative positions, constrained only by both being northeast of \(y\) and \(y\) being southwest of \(z\). This allows various configurations:

- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,2), \(z\) at (1,1), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **NE**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (2,2), \(z\) at (1,1), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **E**: \(x\) is east of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (2,0), \(z\) at (1,0), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **SE**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (2,1), \(z\) at (1,2), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,1), \(z\) at (1,2), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,1), \(z\) at (2,2), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,0), \(z\) at (2,0), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,2), \(z\) at (2,1), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **B**: \(x\) has a bounding box inside \(z\)'s (e.g., \(y\) at [0,1]×[0,1], \(x\) at [2,3]×[2,3], \(z\) at [1,4]×[1,4])

All nine cardinal direction relations are possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Possible relations**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
