PROMPT: Let B and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(y\), so:
  \[
  \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x), \quad \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y), \quad \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x), \quad \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y).
  \]
- \(y \text{ S } z\) means \(y\) is directly south of \(z\), so:
  \[
  \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z), \quad \inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y), \quad \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z).
  \]

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: 
  \[
  \inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x), \quad \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z),
  \]
  so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x \text{ S } z\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\),
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:
- **B (bounding box)**: Requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\), with equality only if degenerate (not allowed for regions homeomorphic to a disk). Thus, B is impossible.
- **SW, SE, W, E, NW, NE, N**: Require conditions like \(x\) being west, east, or north of \(z\), which contradict the horizontal containment and vertical south relation derived.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **S**.
