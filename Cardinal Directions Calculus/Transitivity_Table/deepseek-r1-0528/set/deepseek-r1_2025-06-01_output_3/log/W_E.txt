PROMPT: Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

The relations imply:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are entirely to the left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- The vertical intervals of \(x\) and \(z\) are contained within the vertical interval of \(y\): \([\inf_y(x), \sup_y(x)] \subseteq [\inf_y(y), \sup_y(y)]\) and \([\inf_y(z), \sup_y(z)] \subseteq [\inf_y(y), \sup_y(y)]\).

No direct constraints exist between \(x\) and \(z\) in terms of horizontal or vertical alignment. Therefore, any cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is possible by appropriately arranging their bounding boxes within the constraints relative to \(y\). For example:
- **W, NW, SW**: If \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) and vertically aligned as needed.
- **E, NE, SE**: If \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) and vertically aligned as needed.
- **N, S, B**: If \(x\) and \(z\) overlap horizontally but are vertically aligned as needed (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\), below \(z\), or contained within \(z\)).

All nine cardinal direction relations are possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Possible relations:** N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
