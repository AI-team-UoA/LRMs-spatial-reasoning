PROMPT: Let SE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by analyzing the constraints on their bounding boxes. The horizontal and vertical bounds from the given relations lead to the following possibilities:

1. **B (Bounding box)**: \(x\) can be inside the bounding box of \(z\) if \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
2. **S (South)**: \(x\) can be directly south of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
3. **E (East)**: \(x\) can be directly east of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
4. **N (North)**: \(x\) can be directly north of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
5. **NE (Northeast)**: \(x\) can be northeast of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
6. **SE (Southeast)**: \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.

The relations W (West), NW (Northwest), and SW (Southwest) are impossible because \(x\) must be to the east of \(z\) due to the constraints \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), ensuring \(x\) is never west of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **B, S, E, N, NE, SE**.

**Final Answer**  
**B, S, E, N, NE, SE**
