PROMPT: Let E and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\)).
- \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).
- Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), meaning \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

The horizontal relation depends on the bounds:
- Let \(a_1 = \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(a_2 = \text{sup}_x(x)\), \(c_1 = \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(c_2 = \text{sup}_x(z)\).
- From \(y\) N \(z\): \(c_1 \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq c_2\).
- From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq a_1\).
- Thus, \(c_1 \leq a_1\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq a_1 \leq a_2\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq c_2\).

Possible horizontal scenarios:
1. If \(a_2 \leq c_2\):
   - \(\text{inf}_x(z) = c_1 \leq a_1 = \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) = a_2 \leq c_2 = \text{sup}_x(z)\).
   - Combined with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).
2. If \(a_1 > c_2\):
   - \(\text{sup}_x(z) = c_2 \leq a_1 = \text{inf}_x(x)\).
   - Combined with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) NE \(z\).
3. If \(a_1 = c_2\) and \(a_2 > c_2\):
   - \(\text{sup}_x(z) = c_2 = a_1 = \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(c_2 \leq a_1\) holds.
   - Combined with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) NE \(z\).

Other relations are not possible due to the vertical separation (\(x\) above \(z\)) and horizontal constraints:
- \(x\) S \(z\), \(x\) SE \(z\), \(x\) SW \(z\), \(x\) W \(z\), \(x\) NW \(z\): Require \(x\) below \(z\) or specific horizontal alignments not satisfied.
- \(x\) E \(z\): Requires \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and vertical containment, which conflicts with \(x\) above \(z\).
- \(x\) B \(z\): Requires bounding box containment, but vertically \(z\) is below \(x\), impossible.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N and NE.
