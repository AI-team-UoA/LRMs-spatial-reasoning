PROMPT: Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) in the y-axis, and the x-projection of \(x\) is within the x-projection of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the left and below \(z\).

Combining these:  
- **X-axis constraint**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  
- **Y-axis constraint**: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (\(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\)), but the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
1. **NW (North West)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(z\) is below \(x\)) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (already satisfied).  
2. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
3. **W (West)**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical projection of \(x\) contained in \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

These are the only possible relations, as:  
- \(x\) must be left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), ruling out E, NE, SE, B, N, S.  
- Vertical variations lead exclusively to NW, SW, or W.

**Possible relations**: NW, W, SW.
