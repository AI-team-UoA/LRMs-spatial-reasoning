PROMPT: Let B and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The relation B (bounding box) is transitive based on the given definitions. If region x is B of region y, then the minimum bounding box of x is entirely within the minimum bounding box of y. Similarly, if region y is B of region z, then the minimum bounding box of y is entirely within the minimum bounding box of z. Therefore, the minimum bounding box of x must be entirely within the minimum bounding box of z, meaning x is B of z.

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW) are possible because:
- For any other relation (e.g., S, SW, etc.), the conditions would require x to be partially or fully outside z's bounding box, which contradicts the transitivity of the B relation.
- Specifically, regions in REG have positive extent (since they are homeomorphic to closed disks), so strict inequalities in the bounding box coordinates prevent equality cases that might allow other relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is B.
