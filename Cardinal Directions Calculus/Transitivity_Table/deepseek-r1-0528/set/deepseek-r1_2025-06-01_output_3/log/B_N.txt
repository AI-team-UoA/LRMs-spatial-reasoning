PROMPT: Let B and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions and the definitions of cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is \(B\) of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is \(N\) of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)

Combining these:
- **Y-axis constraints**:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\))
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
- **X-axis constraints**:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\))
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\))
  - Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)

These combined constraints satisfy the definition of \(x\) being \(N\) of \(z\):
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (y-axis condition)
- \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (x-axis conditions)

All other cardinal relations (NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to contradictions in the constraints (e.g., requiring zero width/height or violating the derived inequalities). Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is \(N\).
