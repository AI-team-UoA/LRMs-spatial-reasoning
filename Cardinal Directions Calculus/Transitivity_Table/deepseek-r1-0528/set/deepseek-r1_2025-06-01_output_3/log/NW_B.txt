PROMPT: Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. The relations S, SE, SW, E, and NE are impossible due to the positional constraints from the given relations. The possible relations are:

- **B (bounding box)**: This is possible if z's bounding box contains x's bounding box, which can occur when z extends sufficiently left, right, below, and above to encompass x.
- **W (West)**: This is possible if x is completely to the west of z and there is vertical containment (i.e., z's bottom is below or at x's bottom, and x's top is below or at z's top).
- **NW (North West)**: This is possible if x is completely to the west and north of z, which aligns with x being NW of y and z containing y.
- **N (North)**: This is possible if x is completely to the north of z, with z's bounding box starting left of or at x's left and ending right of or at x's right.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are B, W, NW, and N.

**Final Answer**  
B, W, NW, N
