PROMPT: Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are SW, W, and NW. This is derived from the bounding box constraints:

- From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining the x-axis inequalities:  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This implies that \(x\) is west of \(z\), limiting the possible relations to W, SW, or NW.

The y-axis inequalities:  
\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but the relative positions of \(\inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x)\), \(\inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z)\) can vary, allowing for three cases:
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) SW \(z\).
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) NW \(z\).
- If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) W \(z\).

All other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are impossible due to the west constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the properties of regions in REG (e.g., positive area).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
