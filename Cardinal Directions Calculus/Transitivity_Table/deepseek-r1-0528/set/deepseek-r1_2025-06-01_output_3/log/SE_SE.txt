PROMPT: Let SE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions provided:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(y\))

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:

- **Horizontal direction**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).

- **Vertical direction**:  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

For the relation of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- \(z\) is left of \(x\): satisfies the horizontal condition for SE (since \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
- \(x\) is below \(z\): satisfies the vertical condition for SE (since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).

Thus, \(x\) is SE of \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., E, S, etc.) fits, as they require different spatial arrangements (e.g., E requires vertical overlap, which is absent here).

The possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) (with \(x\) as the subject and \(z\) as the reference) is **SE**.
