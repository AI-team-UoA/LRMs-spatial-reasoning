PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(x\) is left of \(y\) in \(x\)-coordinate)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(y\) in \(y\)-coordinate)

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(z\) in \(y\)-coordinate)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (\(y\)'s \(x\)-range is contained within \(z\)'s \(x\)-range)

Combining these:
- From \(y\)-coordinates: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) in \(y\)-coordinate.
- For \(x\)-coordinates, two cases arise:
  1. **Case 1:** \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
     Then \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) in \(x\)-coordinate, and with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) SW \(z\).
  2. **Case 2:** \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)  
     Given \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (subcase), then:
     - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\))
     - With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) S \(z\).  
     The subcase \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\) is impossible under the constraints and the requirement that relations are defined by non-degenerate bounding boxes (as regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk, ensuring positive width/height).

Other relations (e.g., SE, B, etc.) are not possible due to contradictions in \(x\)- or \(y\)-constraints. Thus, the possible relations are SW and S.
