PROMPT: Let SE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, we derive:
1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\) horizontally.
2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) are south of \(y\):  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   The relative vertical positions can vary:
   - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is north of \(z\) vertically, leading to \(x\) NE of \(z\).
   - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is south of \(z\) vertically, leading to \(x\) SE of \(z\).
   - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment), then \(x\) is directly east of \(z\) (E).

The relations NE, E, and SE are possible depending on the vertical arrangement. Other relations (N, S, NW, SW, W, B) are impossible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and vertical constraints excluding other alignments.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE, E, SE.
