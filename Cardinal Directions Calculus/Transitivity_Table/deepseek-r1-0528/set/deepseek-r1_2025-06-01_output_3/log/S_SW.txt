PROMPT: Let S and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- \(x\) S \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\). 

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously without requiring additional constraints that are not necessarily met (e.g., for S, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) would conflict with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the non-degeneracy of regions).

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.
