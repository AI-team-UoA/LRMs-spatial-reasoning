PROMPT: Let NE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the east and north of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the east of \(z\) and vertically within the bounds of \(z\).

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relation**:  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z)\), satisfying the horizontal condition for \(x\) being east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation**:  
   From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \geq \inf_y(z)\).  
   - **Case 1**: If \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\). Combined with the horizontal condition, this gives \(x\) **NE** \(z\).  
   - **Case 2**: If \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z)\), then:  
     - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), the vertical bounds of \(x\) are within \(z\) (since \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is already true from \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). Combined with the horizontal condition, this gives \(x\) **E** \(z\).  
     - If \(\sup_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\), no defined cardinal direction relation holds (as the vertical overlap is not covered by the relations B, N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW).

Given regions in **REG** (homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, ensuring non-degenerate 2D regions), the valid possible relations are **NE** and **E**. Examples confirm these:
- **NE example**: \(z\) ([0,10]×[0,10]), \(y\) ([11,20]×[0,10]), \(x\) ([21,30]×[11,20]) → \(x\) NE \(z\).  
- **E example**: \(z\) ([-100,50]×[0,100]), \(y\) ([60,110]×[40,60]), \(x\) ([110,200]×[70,80]) → \(x\) E \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.

**Answer: NE, E**
