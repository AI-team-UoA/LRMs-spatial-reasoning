PROMPT: Let NW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the cardinal direction relations are defined based on the bounding boxes of the regions. The inequalities derived from these relations are as follows:

- From \(x \text{ NW } y\):
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(x\), so \(x\) is north of \(y\))

- From \(y \text{ NE } z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is south of \(y\), so \(y\) is north of \(z\))

Combining these, the vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) is fixed:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is south of \(x\), meaning \(x\) is north of \(z\).

The horizontal relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their relative positions to the left of \(y\) (since both have \(\sup_x \leq \inf_x(y)\)). The possible horizontal scenarios are:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:  
   \(x\) is west of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) north of \(z\), this gives \(x \text{ NW } z\).

2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   \(z\) is west of \(x\), so \(x\) is east of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) north of \(z\), this gives \(x \text{ NE } z\).

3. **If there is horizontal overlap with containment (specifically, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\))**:  
   \(z\) contains \(x\) horizontally. Combined with \(x\) north of \(z\), this gives \(x \text{ N } z\).

Other relations are not possible because:
- \(x\) cannot be south of \(z\) (contradicts \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- Relations like S, SW, SE, W, E, or B require vertical alignment, vertical containment, or specific horizontal positions that are inconsistent with the fixed north-south separation and both regions being west of \(y\).
- Partial horizontal overlap without containment does not fit any of the nine defined cardinal direction relations, as they require either separation or containment.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are NW, N, and NE.

\boxed{\text{NW}} \quad \boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}}
