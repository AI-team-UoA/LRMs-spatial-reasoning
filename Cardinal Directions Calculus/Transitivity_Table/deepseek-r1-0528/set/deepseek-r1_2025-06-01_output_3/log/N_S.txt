PROMPT: Let N and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, or B. This is determined by the constraints from the cardinal direction relations and the properties of the regions (closed, connected, and homeomorphic to the closed unit disk).

- The horizontal bounding box of x is contained within that of z due to the inequalities derived from x N y and y S z:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
- Vertically, both x and z are above y, but their relative vertical positions can vary:  
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then x is S of z.  
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then x is N of z.  
  - If there is vertical containment (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then x is B of z.  
- Other relations (NE, E, SE, NW, W, SW) are impossible due to the horizontal containment, which prevents horizontal separation required for these relations.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are N, S, and B.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
