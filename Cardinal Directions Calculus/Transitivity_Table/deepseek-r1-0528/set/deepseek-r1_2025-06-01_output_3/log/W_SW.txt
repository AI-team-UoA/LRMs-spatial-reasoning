PROMPT: Let W and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) is SW of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining the inequalities:

1. **X-axis relations**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from W),  
   \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (property of bounds),  
   \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from SW).  
   Thus:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. **Y-axis relations**:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (from W),  
   \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from SW).  
   Thus:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of **SW** (South West). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, NW, W, B) is satisfied under these constraints, as they require additional conditions (e.g., vertical/horizontal alignment or containment) that are not met here.
