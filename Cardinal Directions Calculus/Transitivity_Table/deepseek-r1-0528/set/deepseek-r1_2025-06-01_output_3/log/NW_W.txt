PROMPT: Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is always to the left of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). However, \(\sup_y(z)\) may vary relative to \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x)\).

The possible relations are:
1. **NW**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
2. **W**: If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is west of \(z\) (vertical span of \(x\) contained in \(z\)).

Other relations are impossible:
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **N**, **NE**, **E**, **SE** violate the derived constraints or require degenerate regions (e.g., zero height or single-point extents), which are invalid for regions homeomorphic to a closed disk.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW and W.

**Answer: NW, W**
