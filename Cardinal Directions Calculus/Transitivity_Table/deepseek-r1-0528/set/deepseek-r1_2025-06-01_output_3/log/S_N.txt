PROMPT: Let S and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions that region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are all nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B. This is because the constraints allow configurations where x and z can satisfy any of these relations relative to each other, as verified through specific examples:

- **B (bounding box)**: x and z share the same bounding box or x's box is contained within z's box.
- **S (South)**: x is entirely below z with aligned horizontal bounds.
- **SW (South West)**: x is below and to the left of z.
- **W (West)**: x is entirely to the left of z with vertical bounds within z's.
- **NW (North West)**: x is above and to the left of z.
- **N (North)**: x is entirely above z with aligned horizontal bounds.
- **NE (North East)**: x is above and to the right of z.
- **E (East)**: x is entirely to the right of z with vertical bounds within z's.
- **SE (South East)**: x is below and to the right of z.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B**
