PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

From these, we derive the following for \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical conditions** (from combining \(y\)'s relations with \(x\) and \(z\)):
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - These satisfy the vertical requirements for both B and W relations.

2. **Horizontal conditions**:
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but the relationship between \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) is not fixed.

Two mutually exclusive scenarios arise:

- **Case 1: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
  This satisfies the horizontal condition for W: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with the vertical conditions, \(x\) is W of \(z\).

- **Case 2: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
  This satisfies the first horizontal condition for B: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). The second horizontal condition for B, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), holds because \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Combined with the vertical conditions, \(x\) is B of \(z\).

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW) are impossible due to contradictions in vertical or horizontal bounds (e.g., N requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \inf_y(z)\) and non-degenerate regions ensure \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), making it impossible).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **W**.  

**Answer: B, W**
