PROMPT: Let W and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South) and SW (South West).

### Explanation:
- From x W y: 
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y).
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (vertical containment: y extends below and above x).
- From y S z: 
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z).
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (horizontal containment: z extends west and east of y).

Combining these:
- Vertically: supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is entirely below z, satisfying the vertical condition for south-related relations.
- Horizontally: 
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), so both supx(x) and infx(z) are ≤ infx(y).
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (from supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).

#### Possible relations for x relative to z:
- **S (South)**: This holds if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (horizontal containment) along with supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This is possible when x is directly south of z and horizontally contained within z's bounding box.
- **SW (South West)**: This holds if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This is possible when x is west and south of z, with no horizontal overlap.
- **SE (South East)**: Not possible because supx(z) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) ≥ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is generally impossible (except in degenerate cases, which are not considered for regions homeomorphic to disks).
- Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are not possible due to the vertical separation (x below z).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are S and SW.
