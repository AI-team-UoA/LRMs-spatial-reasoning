PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is above \(y\) and horizontally within the x-bounds of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is to the right and below \(z\) (i.e., \(z\) is to the left and above \(y\)).

From these relations, the following constraints arise for \(x\) and \(z\):  
1. **Horizontal relation**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\) and \(x\) N \(y\))  
   \(\Rightarrow \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This means \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (no horizontal overlap, and \(x\) is to the right of \(z\)).

2. **Vertical relation**:  
   \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)).  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other are not directly constrained. The possible vertical scenarios are:  
   - \(x\) **above** \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(x\) is NE of \(z\).  
   - \(x\) **below** \(z\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) → \(x\) is SE of \(z\).  
   - **Vertical containment**: The vertical span of \(x\) is contained within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)) → \(x\) is E of \(z\) (since \(x\) is to the right and vertically contained in \(z\)).

The relations NE, SE, and E satisfy the horizontal constraint (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and cover the possible vertical configurations. Other relations (N, S, NW, SW, W, B) are incompatible:  
- N or S require vertical separation but horizontal containment (not satisfied).  
- NW, SW, or W require \(x\) to be left of \(z\) (contradiction).  
- B requires full containment (impossible due to horizontal separation).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, SE, and E**.
