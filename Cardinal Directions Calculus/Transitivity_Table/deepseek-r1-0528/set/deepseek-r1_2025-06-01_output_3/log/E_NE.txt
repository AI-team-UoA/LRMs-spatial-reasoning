PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the relations impose specific spatial constraints. Analyzing the definitions:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is strictly east of y in the x-direction).
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within the bounds of y).
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is strictly east of z in the x-direction).
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (y is strictly north of z in the y-direction).

Chaining these:
- **x-direction**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\).
- **y-direction**: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\). Since \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (i.e., \(x\) is north of \(z\)).

The combination of \(x\) being east and north of \(z\) matches the definition of NE:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (east condition).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (north condition).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible:
- **N or S**: Require horizontal overlap in x, but \(x\) is strictly east of \(z\) (no overlap).
- **E**: Requires \(z\) to vertically bound \(x\), but \(x\) is above \(z\).
- **SE, S, SW, W, NW**: All require \(x\) not to be strictly east and north, contradicting the constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE.

**Answer**: NE
