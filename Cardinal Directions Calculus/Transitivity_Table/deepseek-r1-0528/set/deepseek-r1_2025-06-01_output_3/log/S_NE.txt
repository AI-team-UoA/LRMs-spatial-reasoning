PROMPT: Let S and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NE (North East) of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these constraints:

1. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
2. From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), implying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\) horizontally.
3. Vertically:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(\inf_y(y)\), but their relative vertical positions can vary.

The possible vertical alignments between \(z\) and \(x\) are:

- **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Here, \(z\) is below \(x\).
- **W (West)**: If \(\inf_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\). Here, \(z\) is vertically contained within \(x\)'s y-range.
- **NW (North West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Here, \(z\) is above \(x\).

These relations are possible under the constraints, as verified by examples:
- **SW example**: \(z\)'s bounding box is below and left of \(x\)'s.
- **W example**: \(z\)'s bounding box is left of \(x\)'s and vertically aligned within \(x\)'s y-range.
- **NW example**: \(z\)'s bounding box is above and left of \(x\)'s.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are impossible due to the horizontal separation \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which forces \(z\) to be west of \(x\), and the vertical constraints excluding other directions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, W, SW**.
