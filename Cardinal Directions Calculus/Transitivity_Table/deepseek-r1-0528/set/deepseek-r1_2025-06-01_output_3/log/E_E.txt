PROMPT: Let E and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), we analyze the relations based on the definitions:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining the inequalities:
1. \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
2. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
3. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

These conditions match the definition of E for \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z is west of x)
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Thus, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be E. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, W, NW, SW, B) satisfies all three conditions simultaneously under the given constraints.
