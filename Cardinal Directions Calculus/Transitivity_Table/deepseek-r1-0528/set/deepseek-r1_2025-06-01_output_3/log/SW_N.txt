PROMPT: Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y)
- \(y\) N \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is south of y)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (z is horizontally within y's x-bounds)

From \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) N \(z\):
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is west of z).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), but their vertical positions relative to each other vary.

Possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is south of z).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([-3, -2] \times [-4, -3]\), \(z\) in \([1, 2] \times [-2, -1]\).
2. **NW (North West)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is south of x, so x is north of z).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([-3, -2] \times [-2, -1]\), \(z\) in \([1, 2] \times [-4, -3]\).
3. **W (West)**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z's vertical span contains x's vertical span).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([-3, -2] \times [-3, -2]\), \(z\) in \([1, 2] \times [-4, -1]\).

These are the only possible relations given the constraints. Other relations (e.g., S, N, E, SE, NE, B) are not possible due to the west horizontal constraint and vertical conditions.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\): NW, W, SW**
