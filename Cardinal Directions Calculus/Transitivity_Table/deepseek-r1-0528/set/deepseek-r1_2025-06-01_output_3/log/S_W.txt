PROMPT: Let S and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Vertically: 
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but the relationship between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) is not fixed.
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Possible vertical scenarios:
1. **SW relation**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\). Combined with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies SW: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
2. **W relation**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then the vertical strip of \(x\) is contained within \(z\)'s vertical strip (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). Combined with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies W: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Other relations are impossible:
- **B**, **S**, **SE**, **E**, **NE**, **N**, **NW**: Violate horizontal or vertical constraints derived (e.g., \(x\) must be west of \(z\), not east, and vertical conditions for N, NW, etc., are unattainable).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **W**.

**Final Answer: SW, W**
