PROMPT: Let NE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) means \(x\) is northeast of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) NW \(z\) means \(y\) is northwest of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, we derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical relation**:  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), implying \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), so vertically, \(x\) is north of \(z\).

2. **Horizontal relation**:  
   \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)). Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary:
   - **Case 1: \(z\) entirely left of \(x\)** (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)):  
     Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\) (since \(z\) is left and below \(x\), so \(x\) is northeast of \(z\)).
   - **Case 2: \(x\) entirely left of \(z\)** (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)):  
     Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) NW \(z\) (since \(z\) is right and below \(x\), so \(x\) is northwest of \(z\)).
   - **Case 3: Horizontal overlap with containment of \(x\) in \(z\)**:  
     If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal span of \(x\) contained in \(z\)), and given \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\) (north relation: \(z\) below \(x\) and horizontal containment).

Configurations exist for all three cases without degeneracy, and no other relations (e.g., SE, S, E, W, SW, B) are possible under the constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, and NW.

**Possible relations**: N, NE, NW
