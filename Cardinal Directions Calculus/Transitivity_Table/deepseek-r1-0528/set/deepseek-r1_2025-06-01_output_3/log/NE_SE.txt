PROMPT: Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is north of y)

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is east of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z)

Chaining these:

1. **Horizontal direction (x-axis):**
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from y SE z)
   - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from x NE y)
   - Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - This means \(x\) is always east of \(z\) horizontally.

2. **Vertical direction (y-axis):**
   - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from x NE y)
   - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from y SE z)
   - The relative vertical position of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
     - **Case 1:** \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(x\) is north of \(z\) → **NE relation**.
     - **Case 2:** \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) → \(x\) is south of \(z\) → **SE relation**.
     - **Case 3:** \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\) → **E relation**.

Given the horizontal constraint (east), only relations with an east component are possible: NE, E, SE. Examples exist for each:
- **NE**: When \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
- **E**: When \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds.
- **SE**: When \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) violate the horizontal east constraint or vertical possibilities.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, E, SE**.
