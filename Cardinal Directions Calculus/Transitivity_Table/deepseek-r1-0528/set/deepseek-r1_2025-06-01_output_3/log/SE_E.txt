PROMPT: Let SE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- From \(x\) SE \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) E \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining the \(x\)-axis conditions:  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This implies \(x\) is east of \(z\) in the \(x\)-direction.

For the \(y\)-axis:  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from SE) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from E).  
- Both \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) are \(\leq \inf_y(y)\), but their relative positions can vary.

**Case 1: \(\inf_y(z) > \sup_y(x)\)**  
- Then \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), satisfying \(x\) SE \(z\).

**Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\)**  
- Here, \(x\) and \(z\) overlap in the \(y\)-direction. To satisfy an atomic relation:  
  - Choose \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) (possible as \(\inf_y(x)\) can be set freely as long as \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\)).  
  - Then \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), satisfying \(x\) E \(z\).

Other relations (N, NE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are incompatible with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and the \(y\)-axis constraints. Thus, the possible relations are **SE** and **E**.

**Final Answer: SE, E**
