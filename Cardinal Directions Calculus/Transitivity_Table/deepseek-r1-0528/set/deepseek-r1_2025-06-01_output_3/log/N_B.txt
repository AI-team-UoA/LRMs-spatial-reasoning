PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., the top of \(y\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., the x-projection of \(x\) is within the x-projection of \(y\)).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., the bounding box of \(y\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\)).

From these, we derive:
1. \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x-projection of \(x\) is within x-projection of \(z\)).
2. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (bottom of \(z\) is at or below bottom of \(x\)).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the y-boundaries:
- **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
  The top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\). Combined with the x-projection containment, this satisfies the definition of \(x\) N \(z\):
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

- **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**  
  The top of \(z\) is above the bottom of \(x\), and the top of \(x\) is at or below the top of \(z\). Along with \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and the x-projection containment, this satisfies \(x\) B \(z\):
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

No other relations (e.g., S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) are possible because:
- The x-projection of \(x\) is always within \(z\)'s x-projection, ruling out directional relations requiring horizontal separation (E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW).
- Vertical relations like S would require \(x\) below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), making \(x\) above parts of \(z\) in this context, which contradicts S.

Thus, the possible relations are **N** and **B**.

**Answer: N, B**
