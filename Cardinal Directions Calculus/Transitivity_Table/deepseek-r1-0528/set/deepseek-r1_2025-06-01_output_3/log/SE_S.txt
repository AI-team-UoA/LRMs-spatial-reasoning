PROMPT: Let SE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y).  
- \(y\) is S of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z), and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is within the x-range of z).

From these, derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Y-axis constraints**:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This means \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) in the y-axis, so the relation must involve a southern component (S, SW, or SE).

2. **X-axis constraints**:  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)).  
   Also, \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(x\) starts at or to the east of \(z\)'s left edge. SW is impossible because it requires \(x\) to be west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), which contradicts \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

3. **Possible relations**:  
   - **S (South)**: Requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (which holds) and \(x\) within the x-range of \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (holds) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). This is possible if \(x\) does not extend beyond \(z\)'s right edge.  
   - **SE (South East)**: Requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (holds) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This is possible if \(z\)'s right edge is at or left of \(x\)'s left edge, which can occur since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), allowing \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, SW, B) are excluded due to y-axis constraints or x-axis contradictions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S** and **SE**.
