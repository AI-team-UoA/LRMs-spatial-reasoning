PROMPT: Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, if region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, the relation between x and z must be NE.

- x NE y implies that supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- y NE z implies that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Chaining these inequalities:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

This satisfies the definition of x NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible, as the inequalities strictly enforce that x is northeast of z.

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.
