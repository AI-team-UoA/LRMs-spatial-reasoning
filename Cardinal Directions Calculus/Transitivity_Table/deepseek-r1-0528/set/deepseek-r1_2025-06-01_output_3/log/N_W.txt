PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\),
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).

- \(y\) is W of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\),
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).

From these:
- \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), so \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).
- \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (since \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) from \(x\) N \(y\)).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{supy}(z)\) relative to \(\text{infy}(x)\):

1. **If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\):**
   - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).
   - This matches the definition of NW: \(x\) is NW of \(z\).

2. **If \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\):**
   - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) holds.
   - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) holds from above.
   - Additionally, if \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), then:
     - The y-projection of \(x\) is contained in that of \(z\): \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).
     - This matches the definition of W: \(x\) is W of \(z\).
   - The condition \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) is possible under the constraints (e.g., with appropriate region placements), so W is achievable.

Other relations are not possible:
- SW requires \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), but \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(x)\), so \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\) implies \(\text{infy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), conflicting with \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and strict inequality due to positive area.
- B requires containment in both axes; \(x\) is left of \(z\) but not contained in x-projection.
- S, SE, E, NE, N are incompatible with \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) and the y-constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW and W**.
