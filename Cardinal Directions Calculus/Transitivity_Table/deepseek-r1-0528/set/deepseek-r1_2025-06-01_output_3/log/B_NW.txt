PROMPT: Let B and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is \(B\) of region \(y\):  
  This means the bounding box of \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\). Specifically:  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally contained).  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (vertically contained).  

- Region \(y\) is \(NW\) of region \(z\):  
  This means \(y\) is northwest of \(z\), so:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (\(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\)).  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (\(y\) is entirely above \(z\)).  

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  

1. **Horizontal relation (x-axis):**  
   From \(x\) \(B\) \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) \(NW\) \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  

2. **Vertical relation (y-axis):**  
   From \(x\) \(B\) \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(y\) \(NW\) \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) being \(NW\) of \(z\):  
- \(a\) \(NW\) \(b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., \(N\), \(W\), \(B\), etc.) is possible:  
- The horizontal constraint forces \(x\) left of \(z\), eliminating \(E\), \(SE\), \(NE\), and \(B\) (which requires \(z\) to contain \(x\) horizontally).  
- The vertical constraint forces \(z\) below \(x\), eliminating \(S\), \(SW\), \(SE\), and \(B\) (which requires \(z\) to contain \(x\) vertically).  
- Relations like \(W\) or \(N\) require additional constraints not satisfied (e.g., \(W\) requires vertical alignment within \(z\), which conflicts with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implying \(x\) is above \(z\)).  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is \(NW\).
