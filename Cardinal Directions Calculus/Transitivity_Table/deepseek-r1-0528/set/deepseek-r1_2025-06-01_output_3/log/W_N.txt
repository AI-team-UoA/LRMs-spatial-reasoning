PROMPT: Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W (West) of region y and region y is N (North) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the inequalities based on the definitions.

From x W y:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

From y N z:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these, particularly from the y-direction:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning z is below x. This satisfies the y-condition for x being north of z in some form (N, NE, or NW).

However, for the x-direction:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) are \(\leq \inf_x(y)\).
- \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Considering the possible cases:
- If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then x is west of z, and with z below x, x is NW of z.
- If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (which holds from the inequalities), then x is directly north of z with z's x-range containing x's, so x is N of z.
- x cannot be NE of z because \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is impossible due to \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), requiring point regions, which are invalid for areas homeomorphic to a disk.

Thus, the only possible relations between x and z are N and NW.

**Possible relations:** N, NW
