PROMPT: Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South) and SE (South East).

- **S (South)**: This occurs when the x-range of x is contained within the x-range of z. Specifically, if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then the conditions for x S z are satisfied: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  
- **SE (South East)**: This occurs when x is strictly east of z with no horizontal overlap. Specifically, if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then the conditions for x SE z are satisfied: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Other relations are not possible because:
- Vertically, x is always below z (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), so relations like N, NE, E, NW, W, or B cannot hold.
- Horizontally, x cannot be west of z because \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), ruling out SW and W.
- The case where there is horizontal overlap but x extends east beyond z (\(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\)) does not satisfy any atomic cardinal direction relation under the given definitions and is not considered a valid configuration for this problem.

Thus, the possible relations are S and SE.
