PROMPT: Let NW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The constraints imply:
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are entirely to the left of \(y\).
2. \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are entirely above \(y\).

No further constraints directly relate \(x\) and \(z\). The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary in both horizontal and vertical directions:
- **Horizontally**: \(x\) could be left of, right of, or overlapping \(z\) (within the left constraint).
- **Vertically**: \(x\) could be above, below, or overlapping \(z\) (within the above constraint).

All nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible, as verified by constructing valid configurations satisfying the constraints. For example:
- **N**: \(z\) below \(x\), \(x\) horizontally within \(z\).
- **NE**: \(z\) below and left of \(x\).
- **SE**: \(z\) above and left of \(x\).
- **S**: \(z\) above \(x\), \(x\) horizontally within \(z\).
- **E**: \(z\) left of \(x\), \(x\) vertically within \(z\).
- **NW**: \(z\) below and right of \(x\).
- **W**: \(z\) right of \(x\), \(x\) vertically within \(z\).
- **SW**: \(z\) above and right of \(x\).
- **B**: \(x\)’s bounding box contained in \(z\)’s.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B**.
