PROMPT: Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the spatial constraints imposed by these relations.

- From x NW y:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is to the left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x, so x is above y)  

- From y N z:  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z starts at or to the left of y's start)  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z ends at or to the right of y's end)  

Combining these, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means z is entirely below x vertically, so x is above z. Thus, possible relations must have x above z, which are N, NE, or NW. However, NE is impossible because \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), making \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) unattainable for regions with area.  

Horizontally:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) can vary relative to each other.  
- If \(\inf_x(z) > \sup_x(x)\), then x is completely to the left of z, and with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), x NW z holds.  
- If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (always true from above) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), x N z holds.  

Cases where \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\) but \(\inf_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) do not satisfy the conditions for N, NW, or any other relation due to vertical separation and horizontal misalignment. However, regions can be arranged such that \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or \(\inf_x(z) > \sup_x(x)\), making N and NW possible. Other relations (e.g., E, W, S, SE, SW, NE, B) are impossible due to vertical separation or horizontal constraints.  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are NW and N.
