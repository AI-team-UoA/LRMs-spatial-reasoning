PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) and horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box.

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) and \(z\) is entirely below \(y\).

From these:
- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\):**  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (no horizontal overlap).

- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\):**  
  Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  However, there is no direct constraint on the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\).

Given the horizontal constraint (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their vertical alignment:
- **SW (South West):** If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West):** If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box.
- **NW (North West):** If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as other cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are incompatible with the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) or the vertical conditions derived.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:  
**SW, W, NW**.
