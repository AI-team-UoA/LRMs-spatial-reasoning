PROMPT: Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal direction relations. This is because the constraints only require both \(x\) and \(z\) to be left and below \(y\), but within that quadrant, \(x\) and \(z\) can be arranged in any relative position to each other, allowing for all atomic relations to occur.

- **B (bounding box)**: \(x\) can be contained within the bounding box of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: \(x\) can be entirely above \(z\).
- **NE (North East)**: \(x\) can be above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) can be entirely to the right of \(z\).
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) can be below and to the right of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) can be entirely below \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) can be below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: \(x\) can be entirely to the left of \(z\).
- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) can be above and to the left of \(z\).

Thus, all nine relations are possible.

**Final Answer**: B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
