PROMPT: Let E and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, the vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as:  
\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their bounding boxes:  
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\sup_x(y)\) (since \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)).  
- Possible horizontal scenarios:  
  1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\): \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) → **NW**.  
  2. \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\): \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) → **NE**.  
  3. \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\): \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\) → **N**.

No other cardinal relations are possible:  
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **SE**, **E**, **W** are excluded due to the vertical gap (\(x\) above \(z\)) and/or horizontal constraints.  
- Horizontal overlap without containment does not fit any defined relation under the given constraints and REG properties.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N**, **NW**, and **NE**.

**Final Answer**  
**N, NW, NE**
