PROMPT: Let SE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, if region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal directions, as demonstrated by specific examples satisfying the initial constraints:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) requires \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) NW \(z\) requires \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are constrained to be to the right of \(y\) (east) and below \(y\) (south) in the coordinate system. However, their relative positions to each other can vary:

- **N (North)**: \(x\) is above \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **NE (North East)**: \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) is below and to the right of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) is below \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

Each relation is possible under specific configurations of the regions' bounding boxes that respect the initial SE and NW constraints. Therefore, all nine relations are achievable.

**Possible relations**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
