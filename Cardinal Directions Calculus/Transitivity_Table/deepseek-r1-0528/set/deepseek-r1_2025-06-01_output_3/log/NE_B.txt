PROMPT: Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- \(y\) B \(z\) implies \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by analyzing the bounding box constraints. Examples confirm the following relations are possible:

- **B (bounding box)**: When \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(z\).  
  Example: \(y = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(x = [4,5] \times [4,5]\), \(z = [1,6] \times [1,6]\). Here, \(x\) is NE of \(y\), \(y\) is B of \(z\), and \(x\) is B of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: When \(x\) is above \(z\) and horizontally within its bounds.  
  Example: \(y = [1,2] \times [1,2]\), \(x = [2.5,3.5] \times [3,4]\), \(z = [0,4] \times [0,2.5]\). Here, \(x\) is NE of \(y\), \(y\) is B of \(z\), and \(x\) is N of \(z\).
- **NE (North East)**: When \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\).  
  Example: \(y = [1,2] \times [1,2]\), \(x = [3,4] \times [3,4]\), \(z = [0,2.5] \times [0,2.5]\). Here, \(x\) is NE of \(y\), \(y\) is B of \(z\), and \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: When \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically within its bounds.  
  Example: \(y = [1,2] \times [1,2]\), \(x = [3,4] \times [3,4]\), \(z = [0,2.5] \times [0,4.5]\). Here, \(x\) is NE of \(y\), \(y\) is B of \(z\), and \(x\) is E of \(z\).

Other relations (S, SE, SW, W, NW) are not possible due to the constraints:
- \(x\) is always above \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be below \(z\) (ruling out S, SE, SW).
- \(x\) is always to the right of \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be to the left of \(z\) (ruling out W, NW).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B, N, NE, and E.
