PROMPT: Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

This is derived from the transitive nature of the inequalities defining the NW relation:
- From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Chaining these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) implies supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of x NW z. No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., N, W, B, etc.) are possible under these constraints, as the inequalities enforce strict directional separation without overlap.
