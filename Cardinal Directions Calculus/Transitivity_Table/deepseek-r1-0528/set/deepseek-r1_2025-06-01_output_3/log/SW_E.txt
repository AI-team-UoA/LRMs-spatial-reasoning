PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints:

1. **SW (South West)**: Possible when \(x\) is entirely left and below \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([5,9] \times [0,9]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [10,20]\), \(z\) in \([0,8] \times [9.5,25]\).

2. **W (West)**: Possible when \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([0,4] \times [5,9]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [10,20]\), \(z\) in \([5,9] \times [5,25]\).

3. **E (East)**: Possible when \(z\) is left of \(x\) and vertically contained:
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([8,9] \times [9,10]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [10,20]\), \(z\) in \([0,7] \times [5,25]\).

4. **SE (South East)**: Possible when \(z\) is left of \(x\) and \(x\) is below \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([7,9.5] \times [0,10]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [5,20]\), \(z\) in \([0,6] \times [4.5,25]\).

5. **S (South)**: Possible when \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally contained:
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([5,9] \times [0,10]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [11,20]\), \(z\) in \([0,10] \times [11,25]\).

6. **B (Bounding box)**: Possible when \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([5,10] \times [0,5]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [5,20]\), \(z\) in \([5,10] \times [0,20]\).

Other relations (N, NE, NW) are impossible due to the constraints:
- \(x\) is below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\).
- Vertical and horizontal constraints prevent NE and NW.

Thus, the possible relations are: **B, S, SW, W, E, SE**.
