PROMPT: Let W and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) in W and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) in NW), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of NW:  
\(a \text{ NW } b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).  
Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = z\), so \(x \text{ NW } z\).

No other relations are possible:
- Horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) rules out E, NE, SE, B, N, S (which require horizontal containment or opposite alignment).
- Vertical constraint \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), ruling out SW (which requires \(x\) below \(z\)) and W (which requires vertical containment within \(z\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NW.
