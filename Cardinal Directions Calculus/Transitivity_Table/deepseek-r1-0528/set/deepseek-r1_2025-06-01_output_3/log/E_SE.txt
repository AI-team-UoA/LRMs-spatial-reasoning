PROMPT: Let E and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NE (North East).

### Explanation:
- From y SE z: 
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is left of y)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- From x E y:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (y is left of x)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of y ≤ bottom of x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x ≤ top of y)

Combining these:
- Horizontally: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is left of x).
- Vertically: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x).

Thus, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of x NE z.

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible due to the lack of vertical or horizontal overlap and the specific positioning constraints.
