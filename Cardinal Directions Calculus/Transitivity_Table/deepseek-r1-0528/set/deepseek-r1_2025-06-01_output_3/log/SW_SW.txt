PROMPT: Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, the relations imply:

- For x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- For y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This satisfies the definition of x SW z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). 

No other cardinal direction relation is possible because:
- Relations like S, W, or B require partial or complete overlap in the x or y projections (e.g., S requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and the positive extent of regions).
- Other diagonal relations (e.g., NW, SE) require different directional alignments that are inconsistent with the combined SW chain.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
