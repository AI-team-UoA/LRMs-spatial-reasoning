PROMPT: Let N and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is N (North) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N (North) of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is analyzed as follows:

- **Definition of N**:  
  - \(a\) N \(b\) means:  
    - \(supy(b) \leq infy(a)\) (region \(a\) is entirely above \(b\) in the y-direction),  
    - \(infx(b) \leq infx(a)\) and \(supx(a) \leq supx(b)\) (the x-projection of \(a\) is contained within the x-projection of \(b\)).

- **Conditions from \(x\) N \(y\)**:  
  - \(supy(y) \leq infy(x)\)  
  - \(infx(y) \leq infx(x)\)  
  - \(supx(x) \leq supx(y)\)  

- **Conditions from \(y\) N \(z\)**:  
  - \(supy(z) \leq infy(y)\)  
  - \(infx(z) \leq infx(y)\)  
  - \(supx(y) \leq supx(z)\)  

- **Combining y-conditions**:  
  From \(supy(z) \leq infy(y)\) and \(supy(y) \leq infy(x)\), we have:  
  \[
  supy(z) \leq infy(y) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(x)
  \]  
  Thus, \(supy(z) \leq infy(x)\), which satisfies the y-condition for \(x\) N \(z\).  

- **Combining x-conditions**:  
  From \(infx(z) \leq infx(y)\) and \(infx(y) \leq infx(x)\), we have:  
  \[
  infx(z) \leq infx(y) \leq infx(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad infx(z) \leq infx(x)
  \]  
  From \(supx(x) \leq supx(y)\) and \(supx(y) \leq supx(z)\), we have:  
  \[
  supx(x) \leq supx(y) \leq supx(z) \quad \Rightarrow \quad supx(x) \leq supx(z)
  \]  
  This satisfies the x-conditions for \(x\) N \(z\).  

- **Conclusion**:  
  The conditions \(supy(z) \leq infy(x)\), \(infx(z) \leq infx(x)\), and \(supx(x) \leq supx(z)\) are exactly the definition of \(x\) N \(z\).  

- **Exclusivity**:  
  The relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are mutually exclusive for regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed disk with non-empty interior). The derived conditions match only N, and no other relation (e.g., NW or NE would require horizontal misalignment not present here).  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **N**.
