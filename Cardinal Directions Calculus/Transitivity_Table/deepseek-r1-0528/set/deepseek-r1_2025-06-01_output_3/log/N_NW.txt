PROMPT: Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\))  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is contained within \(y\))  

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is to the left of \(z\))  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertically, \(z\) is below \(y\))  

Combining these:  
- Vertically:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  

- Horizontally:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  

The relation NW is defined as:  
- \(a \text{ NW } b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).  

Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = z\) satisfies:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal condition)  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical condition)  

Thus, \(x\) is NW of \(z\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) holds under these constraints, as they require additional conditions (e.g., horizontal containment, different vertical alignments) that are not satisfied here.
