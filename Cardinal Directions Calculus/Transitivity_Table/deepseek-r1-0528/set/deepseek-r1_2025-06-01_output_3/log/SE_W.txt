PROMPT: Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

From \(x\) SE \(y\), \(x\) is to the right and below \(y\). From \(y\) W \(z\), \(z\) is to the right of \(y\) and vertically overlaps or contains \(y\)'s bounding box. Combining these:

- Vertically: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from SE) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from W). Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\). For disjoint vertical projections (required for cardinal relations), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) must hold, meaning \(x\) is below \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the right of \(y\) (\(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)). Two disjoint cases are possible:
  1. \(z\) is left of \(x\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\). Combined with \(x\) below \(z\), this gives \(x\) SE \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
  2. \(x\) is left of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). Combined with \(x\) below \(z\), this gives \(x\) SW \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

No other cardinal relations are possible, as horizontal overlap would violate the disjointness required for the defined relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and SE.
