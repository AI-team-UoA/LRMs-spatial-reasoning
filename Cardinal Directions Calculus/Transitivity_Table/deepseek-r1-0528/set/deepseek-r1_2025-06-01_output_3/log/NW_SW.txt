PROMPT: Let NW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined and the given conditions that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- The relation \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\))
- The relation \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but no direct vertical constraint between \(x\) and \(z\).

The possible vertical alignments between \(x\) and \(z\) allow multiple relations, supported by specific examples:
1. **NW (North West)**: If \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([1,2] \times [4,5]\), \(y\): \([3,4] \times [1,2]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [3,4]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(2 \leq 4\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(4 \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq 3\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(z\): \(2 \leq 5\) and \(4 \leq 4\)  

2. **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([1,2] \times [1,2]\), \(y\): \([3,4] \times [0,0.5]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [3,4]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(0.5 \leq 1\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(4 \leq 5\) and \(0.5 \leq 3\)  
   - \(x\) SW \(z\): \(2 \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq 3\)  

3. **W (West)**: If \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([1,2] \times [3,4]\), \(y\): \([3,4] \times [1,2]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [2,5]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(2 \leq 3\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(4 \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq 2\)  
   - \(x\) W \(z\): \(2 \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq 3\) and \(4 \leq 5\)  

4. **N (North)**: If \(x\) is at the left edge of \(z\) (so horizontally contained: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), and \(z\) is below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([5,5] \times [2,3]\), \(y\): \([5,5] \times [0,1]\), \(z\): \([5,10] \times [1,1.5]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(5 \leq 5\) and \(1 \leq 2\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(5 \leq 5\) and \(1 \leq 1\)  
   - \(x\) N \(z\): \(1.5 \leq 2\) and \(5 \leq 5\) and \(5 \leq 10\)  

5. **S (South)**: If \(x\) is at the left edge of \(z\) (horizontally contained), and \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([5,5] \times [1,2]\), \(y\): \([5,5] \times [0,1]\), \(z\): \([5,10] \times [3,4]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(5 \leq 5\) and \(1 \leq 1\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(5 \leq 5\) and \(1 \leq 3\)  
   - \(x\) S \(z\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(5 \leq 5\) and \(5 \leq 10\)  

Other relations (B, E, NE, SE) are impossible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which requires \(x\) to be left of or aligned at the left edge of \(z\), but not right or containing.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, SW, W, N, S**.
