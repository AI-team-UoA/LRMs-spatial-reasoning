PROMPT: Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions and the given relations \(x \text{ B } y\) and \(y \text{ E } z\), the following inequalities hold:

- From \(x \text{ B } y\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- From \(y \text{ E } z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **x-coordinate relation**:
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning the entire x-interval of \(z\) is left of the x-interval of \(x\).

2. **y-coordinate relation**:
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning the y-interval of \(x\) is contained within the y-interval of \(z\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x entirely to the right of \(z\))
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y-overlap where \(x\)'s y-interval is inside \(z\)'s)

Checking the possible cardinal direction relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):

- **E (East)**: Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). All conditions are satisfied.
- **NE (North East)**: Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). However, \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) would imply \(\inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x) = \sup_y(z)\), contradicting the positive area of regions in REG. Thus, NE is impossible.
- **SE (South East)**: Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). But \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) would imply \(\inf_y(z) = \inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x)\), again contradicting positive area. Thus, SE is impossible.
- Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) do not satisfy \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or the y-conditions.

Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **E**.
