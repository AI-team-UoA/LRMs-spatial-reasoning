PROMPT: Let NE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the north of \(y\))

- \(y\) S \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the south of \(z\))
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., the \(x\)-projection of \(y\) is within the \(x\)-projection of \(z\))

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but no direct constraint between \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z)\).
   - However, to satisfy the relations and avoid configurations that do not fit any cardinal direction, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) must hold (otherwise, horizontal overlap may occur, leading to no valid cardinal relation). Thus, \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) start above \(\sup_y(y)\), but their vertical positions relative to each other are unconstrained. Possible cases:
     - \(z\) is entirely south of \(x\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(x\) is **NE** of \(z\).
     - \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) → \(x\) is **SE** of \(z\).
     - The \(y\)-projection of \(x\) is contained within \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(x\) is **E** of \(z\).

Given \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and the vertical possibilities, the relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be:
- **NE** (if \(z\) is south of \(x\))
- **SE** (if \(x\) is south of \(z\))
- **E** (if \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\))

Other relations (N, S, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and lack of vertical containment or alignment required by those relations.

Thus, the possible relations are **NE**, **SE**, and **E**.
