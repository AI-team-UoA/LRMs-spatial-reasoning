PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the spatial constraints based on the bounding box definitions.

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is to the west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is to the south of y)

- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is to the west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is to the south of z, so z is to the north of y)

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely below \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\) (ruling out N, NE, NW).
- Horizontally: Both \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the west of \(y\). However, the relative horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is to the west and south of \(z\). This is consistent with the constraints.
2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is to the east and south of \(z\) (since \(z\) is west of \(x\), making \(x\) relatively east of \(z\)). This is consistent with the constraints.
3. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s x-range and south of \(z\). This requires horizontal containment but is possible under the constraints.

Other relations are impossible:
- N, NE, NW: Contradict \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x cannot be north of z).
- E, W: Require vertical alignment or specific horizontal relations not guaranteed here.
- B: Requires full containment in both axes, but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies vertical separation, making containment impossible except in degenerate cases (not typical for regions homeomorphic to a disk).
- NW, NE: Already ruled out by vertical position.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, SE, and S.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}}
