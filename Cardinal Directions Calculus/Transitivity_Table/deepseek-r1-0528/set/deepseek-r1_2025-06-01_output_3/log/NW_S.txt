PROMPT: Let NW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely to the west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is entirely north of y)

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely south of z)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical constraints**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - This implies both \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) are \(\geq \sup_y(y)\), but no direct relation between \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) or between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z)\) is enforced. Thus, vertical positioning between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
     - \(x\) could be entirely north of \(z\) (if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\))
     - \(x\) could be entirely south of \(z\) (if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\))
     - Or there could be vertical overlap without full containment.

2. **Horizontal constraints**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Combining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) are not directly comparable. However, \(x\) is always entirely to the west of \(y\), and \(z\) starts no farther east than \(y\)'s left edge. Thus:
     - \(x\) is always entirely to the west of \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) or there might be horizontal overlap, but the constraints ensure \(x\) is at least partially or fully west.

Considering the atomic relations and valid configurations:

- **NW (North West)**: Possible if \(x\) is entirely north and west of \(z\).
  - Example: \(x\) positioned northwest of \(y\), and \(z\) positioned such that it is north of \(y\) but \(x\) remains northwest of \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(x\) is entirely south and west of \(z\).
  - Example: \(x\) positioned northwest of \(y\), but \(z\) is sufficiently south and east, placing \(x\) southwest of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: Possible if \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-projection.
  - Example: \(x\) west of \(y\), \(z\) south of \(y\) with wide horizontal span, and \(x\) vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounds.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible due to the west constraint from \(x\) NW \(y\) and the lack of conditions allowing eastward positioning.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, SW, and W**.
