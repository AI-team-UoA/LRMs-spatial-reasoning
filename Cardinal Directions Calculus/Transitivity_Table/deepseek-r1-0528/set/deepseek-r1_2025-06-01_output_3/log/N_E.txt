PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\)
- \(y\) is E of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\)
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\)

Combining these:
- \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\).
- \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), so \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the y-boundaries:
1. **If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)**:
   - \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), and since \(z\) is left of \(x\), \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
2. **If \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\)** (which can occur when \(\text{infy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\)):
   - \(z\) is left of \(x\) and \(x\)'s y-projection is within \(z\)'s y-projection, so \(x\) is E of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations that satisfy the conditions in some configurations. Other relations (N, S, SE, NW, W, SW, B) are not possible due to the constraints derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.

- NE
- E
