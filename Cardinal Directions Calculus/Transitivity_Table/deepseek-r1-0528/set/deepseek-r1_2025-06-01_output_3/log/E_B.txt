PROMPT: Let E and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The vertical conditions between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as:
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).
Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds.

Horizontally:
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)).
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).
Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the horizontal extent of \(x\) relative to \(z\):

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   - Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **If \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   - Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\).

The condition \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\) is impossible because it would place part of \(x\) inside \(z\)'s horizontal bounds and part outside, violating the requirement that regions in REG are connected and have connected boundaries, thus must lie entirely in one cardinal tile relative to \(z\). Given the vertical constraints, \(x\) cannot be in other tiles (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **E**.
