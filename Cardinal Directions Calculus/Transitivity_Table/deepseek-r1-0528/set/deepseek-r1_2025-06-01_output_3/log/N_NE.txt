PROMPT: Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NE (North East).

### Explanation:
- **x N y** implies:
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (the left boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the right boundary of x is to the right of or aligned with the right boundary of y)

- **y NE z** implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

Combining these:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is to the left of x).
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x).

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of **x NE z**, meaning x is North East of z. No other cardinal direction relations (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible, as they would violate the given constraints or the properties of the regions (which are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries).

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.

**Final Answer: NE**
