PROMPT: Let E and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B, E, and W. 

- **B (bounding box)**: It is possible if the bounding box of \(z\) contains the bounding box of \(x\) horizontally and vertically. Specifically, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The vertical conditions are satisfied from the initial constraints, and the horizontal conditions can hold under certain configurations.
- **E (east)**: It is possible if \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\). Specifically, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The vertical conditions are satisfied, and the horizontal condition can occur when \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **W (west)**: It is possible if \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\). Specifically, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The vertical conditions are satisfied, and the horizontal condition can occur when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, SW) are impossible due to the vertical constraints derived from the initial conditions: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which prevent \(x\) from being entirely above, below, or diagonally positioned relative to \(z\) without overlap.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, E, W**.
