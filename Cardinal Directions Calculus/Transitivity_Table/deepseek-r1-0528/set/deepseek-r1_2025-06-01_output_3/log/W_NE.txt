PROMPT: Let W and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW. This is derived from the constraints on the bounding boxes:

- From y NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
- From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

Vertically, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning z is entirely below x. Horizontally, both x and z are to the west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)), but their relative horizontal positions can vary:

- If x is horizontally within the bounds of z (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then x N z.
- If z is entirely to the west of x (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), then x NE z.
- If x is entirely to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), then x NW z.

Relations such as S, SE, E, SW, W, and B are impossible due to the vertical separation (z below x) and the lack of containment or other required conditions. Thus, the possible relations are N, NE, and NW.

**Possible relations:** N, NE, NW
