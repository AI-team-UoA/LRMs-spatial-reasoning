PROMPT: Let SE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(x\) is east of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is south of \(y\))

- \(y\) SW \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (entire \(y\) is west of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(y\) is south of \(z\))

From these, we derive the vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\).

For the horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the possible alignments:

1. **SW (South West)** is possible if \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\):
   - Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([2,3] \times [-2,-1]\), \(y\) in \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) in \([4,5] \times [2,3]\). Here, \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) SW \(z\) hold, and \(x\) SW \(z\) as \(\sup_x(x)=3 \leq \inf_x(z)=4\).

2. **S (South)** is possible if \(x\) is within the horizontal bounds of \(z\):
   - Requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([1,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(y\) in \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) in \([1,3] \times [2,3]\). Here, \(x\) SE \(y\) (since \(\sup_x(y)=1 \leq \inf_x(x)=1\)) and \(y\) SW \(z\) hold, and \(x\) S \(z\) as \(\inf_x(z)=1 \leq \inf_x(x)=1\) and \(\sup_x(x)=2 \leq \sup_x(z)=3\).

3. **SE (South East)** is possible if \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\):
   - Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([2,3] \times [-2,-1]\), \(y\) in \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) in \([1.5,1.8] \times [2,3]\). Here, \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) SW \(z\) hold, and \(x\) SE \(z\) as \(\sup_x(z)=1.8 \leq \inf_x(x)=2\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Answer: SW, S, SE**
