PROMPT: Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These satisfy the definition of \(x\) being W of \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal left constraint).
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical infimum constraint).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical supremum constraint).

Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, SW, B) require conditions that contradict the non-degenerate bounding box properties (e.g., collapsing intervals for width or height, which are invalid for regions homeomorphic to a closed disk). For instance:
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies equality and degeneracy.
- Similar contradictions arise for other relations.

Thus, the only possible relation is W.
