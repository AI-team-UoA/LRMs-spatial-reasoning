PROMPT: Let B and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is W (West).

### Explanation:
- **x B y** means that the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- **y W z** means that y is to the west of z:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
  - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

These inequalities satisfy the definition of **x W z**:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) are possible, as they would require additional conditions (e.g., specific vertical alignments or containments) that conflict with the given constraints. For example:
- **B** would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), but infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z) implies infx(z) ≤ infx(x) only if equality holds, which is impossible for regions with positive area.
- **SW** would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) implies supy(x) ≥ infy(z), making supy(x) ≤ infy(z) impossible.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.
