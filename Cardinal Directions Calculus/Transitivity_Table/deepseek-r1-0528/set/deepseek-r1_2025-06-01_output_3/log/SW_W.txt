PROMPT: Let SW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is to the left of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), with \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). However, the vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the infima and suprema of their \(y\)-projections.

Possible vertical scenarios:
1. If \(\sup_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\), so \(x\) is SW of \(z\).
2. If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (which implies \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) holds as \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).

The relation NW is impossible because it would require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), leading to \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\), implying degenerate regions, which are not allowed in REG. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are inconsistent with the horizontal left constraint.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and W.
