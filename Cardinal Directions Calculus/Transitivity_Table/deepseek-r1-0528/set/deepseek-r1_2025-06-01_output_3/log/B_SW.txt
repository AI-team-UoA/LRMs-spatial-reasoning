PROMPT: Let B and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:

- **x B y**: The bounding box of y contains the bounding box of x.  
  This implies:  
  - `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (x is horizontally within y).  
  - `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)` and `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (x is vertically within y).  

- **y SW z**: y is entirely southwest of z.  
  This implies:  
  - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y is strictly left of z).  
  - `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y is strictly below z).  

Combining these:  
- From `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (from x B y) and `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (from y SW z), we get `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`.  
- From `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (from x B y) and `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (from y SW z), we get `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`.  

The conditions `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)` satisfy the definition of **x SW z**.  

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is **SW**.
