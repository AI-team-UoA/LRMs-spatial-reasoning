PROMPT: Let S and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z must be SE. This is determined by the inequalities derived from the cardinal direction relations:

- From x S y:  
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  

- From y SE z:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  

Combining these:  
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) satisfy the definition of x SE z:  
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as the inequalities prevent them. For example:  
- S would require supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) < supx(x) implies supx(x) > supx(z).  
- E would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), but infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies infy(z) ≥ infy(x).  

Thus, SE is the only possible relation.
