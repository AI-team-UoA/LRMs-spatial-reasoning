PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- From \(x\) S \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., the top of \(x\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)).  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., the \(x\)-projection of \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-projection of \(y\)).

- From \(y\) B \(z\):  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., the \(x\)-projection of \(y\) is contained within the \(x\)-projection of \(z\)).  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., the \(y\)-projection of \(y\) is contained within the \(y\)-projection of \(z\)).

Combining these:  
- The \(x\)-projection of \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-projection of \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
- For the \(y\)-direction:  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  - Two cases arise based on the relationship between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\):  
    1. **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:  
       - Then \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and combined with the \(x\)-containment, this satisfies the definition of \(x\) S \(z\).  
    2. **If \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)**:  
       - Additionally, if \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., the bottom of \(x\) is at or above the bottom of \(z\)), then the entire bounding box of \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\), satisfying \(x\) B \(z\).  
       - The case \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\) does not correspond to any of the defined nine cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) due to the \(x\)-containment and \(y\)-overlap constraints, so it is excluded.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
- **S** (when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\))  
- **B** (when \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\))

No other relations (N, NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW) are possible given the constraints.

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
