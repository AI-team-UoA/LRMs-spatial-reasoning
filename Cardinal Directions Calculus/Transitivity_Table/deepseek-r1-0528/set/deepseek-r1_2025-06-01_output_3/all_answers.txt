For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Given that region \(x\) is N (North) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N (North) of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is analyzed as follows:

- **Definition of N**:  
  - \(a\) N \(b\) means:  
    - \(supy(b) \leq infy(a)\) (region \(a\) is entirely above \(b\) in the y-direction),  
    - \(infx(b) \leq infx(a)\) and \(supx(a) \leq supx(b)\) (the x-projection of \(a\) is contained within the x-projection of \(b\)).

- **Conditions from \(x\) N \(y\)**:  
  - \(supy(y) \leq infy(x)\)  
  - \(infx(y) \leq infx(x)\)  
  - \(supx(x) \leq supx(y)\)  

- **Conditions from \(y\) N \(z\)**:  
  - \(supy(z) \leq infy(y)\)  
  - \(infx(z) \leq infx(y)\)  
  - \(supx(y) \leq supx(z)\)  

- **Combining y-conditions**:  
  From \(supy(z) \leq infy(y)\) and \(supy(y) \leq infy(x)\), we have:  
  \[
  supy(z) \leq infy(y) \leq supy(y) \leq infy(x)
  \]  
  Thus, \(supy(z) \leq infy(x)\), which satisfies the y-condition for \(x\) N \(z\).  

- **Combining x-conditions**:  
  From \(infx(z) \leq infx(y)\) and \(infx(y) \leq infx(x)\), we have:  
  \[
  infx(z) \leq infx(y) \leq infx(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad infx(z) \leq infx(x)
  \]  
  From \(supx(x) \leq supx(y)\) and \(supx(y) \leq supx(z)\), we have:  
  \[
  supx(x) \leq supx(y) \leq supx(z) \quad \Rightarrow \quad supx(x) \leq supx(z)
  \]  
  This satisfies the x-conditions for \(x\) N \(z\).  

- **Conclusion**:  
  The conditions \(supy(z) \leq infy(x)\), \(infx(z) \leq infx(x)\), and \(supx(x) \leq supx(z)\) are exactly the definition of \(x\) N \(z\).  

- **Exclusivity**:  
  The relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are mutually exclusive for regions in REG (homeomorphic to a closed disk with non-empty interior). The derived conditions match only N, and no other relation (e.g., NW or NE would require horizontal misalignment not present here).  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **N**.  

**Answer**: N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\),
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).

- \(y\) is W of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\),
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).

From these:
- \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(z)\), so \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\).
- \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (since \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) from \(x\) N \(y\)).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{supy}(z)\) relative to \(\text{infy}(x)\):

1. **If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\):**
   - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) and \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).
   - This matches the definition of NW: \(x\) is NW of \(z\).

2. **If \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\):**
   - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) holds.
   - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) holds from above.
   - Additionally, if \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), then:
     - The y-projection of \(x\) is contained in that of \(z\): \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).
     - This matches the definition of W: \(x\) is W of \(z\).
   - The condition \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\) is possible under the constraints (e.g., with appropriate region placements), so W is achievable.

Other relations are not possible:
- SW requires \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), but \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(x)\), so \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\) implies \(\text{infy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z)\), conflicting with \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and strict inequality due to positive area.
- B requires containment in both axes; \(x\) is left of \(z\) but not contained in x-projection.
- S, SE, E, NE, N are incompatible with \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z)\) and the y-constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW and W**.
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\)
- \(y\) is E of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\)
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\)

Combining these:
- \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), so \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\).
- \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) and \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), so \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the y-boundaries:
1. **If \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)**:
   - \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), and since \(z\) is left of \(x\), \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
2. **If \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\)** (which can occur when \(\text{infy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\)):
   - \(z\) is left of \(x\) and \(x\)'s y-projection is within \(z\)'s y-projection, so \(x\) is E of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations that satisfy the conditions in some configurations. Other relations (N, S, SE, NW, W, SW, B) are not possible due to the constraints derived.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.

- NE
- E
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, or B. This is determined by the constraints from the cardinal direction relations and the properties of the regions (closed, connected, and homeomorphic to the closed unit disk).

- The horizontal bounding box of x is contained within that of z due to the inequalities derived from x N y and y S z:  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
- Vertically, both x and z are above y, but their relative vertical positions can vary:  
  - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then x is S of z.  
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then x is N of z.  
  - If there is vertical containment (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then x is B of z.  
- Other relations (NE, E, SE, NW, W, SW) are impossible due to the horizontal containment, which prevents horizontal separation required for these relations.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are N, S, and B.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\))  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is contained within \(y\))  

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is to the left of \(z\))  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertically, \(z\) is below \(y\))  

Combining these:  
- Vertically:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  

- Horizontally:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  

The relation NW is defined as:  
- \(a \text{ NW } b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).  

Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = z\) satisfies:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal condition)  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical condition)  

Thus, \(x\) is NW of \(z\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, B) holds under these constraints, as they require additional conditions (e.g., horizontal containment, different vertical alignments) that are not satisfied here.  

**Possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\): NW**
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) in the y-axis, and the x-projection of \(x\) is within the x-projection of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the left and below \(z\).

Combining these:  
- **X-axis constraint**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  
- **Y-axis constraint**: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (\(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\)), but the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  
1. **NW (North West)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(z\) is below \(x\)) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (already satisfied).  
2. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
3. **W (West)**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical projection of \(x\) contained in \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

These are the only possible relations, as:  
- \(x\) must be left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), ruling out E, NE, SE, B, N, S.  
- Vertical variations lead exclusively to NW, SW, or W.

**Possible relations**: NW, W, SW.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is above \(y\) and horizontally within the x-bounds of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is to the right and below \(z\) (i.e., \(z\) is to the left and above \(y\)).

From these relations, the following constraints arise for \(x\) and \(z\):  
1. **Horizontal relation**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\) and \(x\) N \(y\))  
   \(\Rightarrow \sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This means \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (no horizontal overlap, and \(x\) is to the right of \(z\)).

2. **Vertical relation**:  
   \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) N \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)).  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other are not directly constrained. The possible vertical scenarios are:  
   - \(x\) **above** \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(x\) is NE of \(z\).  
   - \(x\) **below** \(z\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) → \(x\) is SE of \(z\).  
   - **Vertical containment**: The vertical span of \(x\) is contained within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)) → \(x\) is E of \(z\) (since \(x\) is to the right and vertically contained in \(z\)).

The relations NE, SE, and E satisfy the horizontal constraint (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and cover the possible vertical configurations. Other relations (N, S, NW, SW, W, B) are incompatible:  
- N or S require vertical separation but horizontal containment (not satisfied).  
- NW, SW, or W require \(x\) to be left of \(z\) (contradiction).  
- B requires full containment (impossible due to horizontal separation).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, SE, and E**.
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: Given that region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NE (North East).

### Explanation:
- **x N y** implies:
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (the left boundary of y is to the left of or aligned with the left boundary of x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the right boundary of x is to the right of or aligned with the right boundary of y)

- **y NE z** implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

Combining these:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is to the left of x).
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x).

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of **x NE z**, meaning x is North East of z. No other cardinal direction relations (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible, as they would violate the given constraints or the properties of the regions (which are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries).

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.

**Final Answer: NE**
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., the top of \(y\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., the x-projection of \(x\) is within the x-projection of \(y\)).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., the bounding box of \(y\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\)).

From these, we derive:
1. \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (x-projection of \(x\) is within x-projection of \(z\)).
2. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (bottom of \(z\) is at or below bottom of \(x\)).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the y-boundaries:
- **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
  The top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\). Combined with the x-projection containment, this satisfies the definition of \(x\) N \(z\):
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

- **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**  
  The top of \(z\) is above the bottom of \(x\), and the top of \(x\) is at or below the top of \(z\). Along with \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and the x-projection containment, this satisfies \(x\) B \(z\):
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

No other relations (e.g., S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) are possible because:
- The x-projection of \(x\) is always within \(z\)'s x-projection, ruling out directional relations requiring horizontal separation (E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW).
- Vertical relations like S would require \(x\) below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), making \(x\) above parts of \(z\) in this context, which contradicts S.

Thus, the possible relations are **N** and **B**.

**Answer: N, B**
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Given that region x is W (West) of region y and region y is N (North) of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the inequalities based on the definitions.

From x W y:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

From y N z:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these, particularly from the y-direction:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning z is below x. This satisfies the y-condition for x being north of z in some form (N, NE, or NW).

However, for the x-direction:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) are \(\leq \inf_x(y)\).
- \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Considering the possible cases:
- If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then x is west of z, and with z below x, x is NW of z.
- If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (which holds from the inequalities), then x is directly north of z with z's x-range containing x's, so x is N of z.
- x cannot be NE of z because \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is impossible due to \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), requiring point regions, which are invalid for areas homeomorphic to a disk.

Thus, the only possible relations between x and z are N and NW.

**Possible relations:** N, NW
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These satisfy the definition of \(x\) being W of \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal left constraint).
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical infimum constraint).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical supremum constraint).

Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, SW, B) require conditions that contradict the non-degenerate bounding box properties (e.g., collapsing intervals for width or height, which are invalid for regions homeomorphic to a closed disk). For instance:
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies equality and degeneracy.
- Similar contradictions arise for other relations.

Thus, the only possible relation is W.

**Answer: W**
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

The relations imply:
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are entirely to the left of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- The vertical intervals of \(x\) and \(z\) are contained within the vertical interval of \(y\): \([\inf_y(x), \sup_y(x)] \subseteq [\inf_y(y), \sup_y(y)]\) and \([\inf_y(z), \sup_y(z)] \subseteq [\inf_y(y), \sup_y(y)]\).

No direct constraints exist between \(x\) and \(z\) in terms of horizontal or vertical alignment. Therefore, any cardinal direction relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is possible by appropriately arranging their bounding boxes within the constraints relative to \(y\). For example:
- **W, NW, SW**: If \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) and vertically aligned as needed.
- **E, NE, SE**: If \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) and vertically aligned as needed.
- **N, S, B**: If \(x\) and \(z\) overlap horizontally but are vertically aligned as needed (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\), below \(z\), or contained within \(z\)).

All nine cardinal direction relations are possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Possible relations:** N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South) and SW (South West).

### Explanation:
- From x W y: 
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y).
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (vertical containment: y extends below and above x).
- From y S z: 
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z).
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (horizontal containment: z extends west and east of y).

Combining these:
- Vertically: supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is entirely below z, satisfying the vertical condition for south-related relations.
- Horizontally: 
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), so both supx(x) and infx(z) are ≤ infx(y).
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (from supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).

#### Possible relations for x relative to z:
- **S (South)**: This holds if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (horizontal containment) along with supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This is possible when x is directly south of z and horizontally contained within z's bounding box.
- **SW (South West)**: This holds if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This is possible when x is west and south of z, with no horizontal overlap.
- **SE (South East)**: Not possible because supx(z) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x) ≥ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is generally impossible (except in degenerate cases, which are not considered for regions homeomorphic to disks).
- Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are not possible due to the vertical separation (x below z).

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are S and SW.

**Possible relations: S, SW**
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) in W and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) in NW), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of NW:  
\(a \text{ NW } b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).  
Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = z\), so \(x \text{ NW } z\).

No other relations are possible:
- Horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) rules out E, NE, SE, B, N, S (which require horizontal containment or opposite alignment).
- Vertical constraint \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), ruling out SW (which requires \(x\) below \(z\)) and W (which requires vertical containment within \(z\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NW.

**Answer: NW**
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- \(y\) is SW of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining the inequalities:

1. **X-axis relations**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from W),  
   \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (property of bounds),  
   \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from SW).  
   Thus:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. **Y-axis relations**:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (from W),  
   \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from SW).  
   Thus:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of **SW** (South West). No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, NW, W, B) is satisfied under these constraints, as they require additional conditions (e.g., vertical/horizontal alignment or containment) that are not met here.

**Possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\): SW**
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these, we derive:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of \(y\).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their relative x-axis positions:
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) and \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
2. **SE (South East)**: If \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)) and \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
3. **S (South)**: If \(x\)'s x-interval is contained within \(z\)'s x-interval (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)) and \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).

Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are impossible due to the y-axis constraint (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)) and the lack of containment or alignment in x-axis for those cases.

Thus, the possible relations are SW, SE, and S.

**Answer: SW, SE, S**
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: Given that region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW. This is derived from the constraints on the bounding boxes:

- From y NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
- From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).

Vertically, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning z is entirely below x. Horizontally, both x and z are to the west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)), but their relative horizontal positions can vary:

- If x is horizontally within the bounds of z (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then x N z.
- If z is entirely to the west of x (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), then x NE z.
- If x is entirely to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), then x NW z.

Relations such as S, SE, E, SW, W, and B are impossible due to the vertical separation (z below x) and the lack of containment or other required conditions. Thus, the possible relations are N, NE, and NW.

**Possible relations:** N, NE, NW
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

From these, we derive the following for \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical conditions** (from combining \(y\)'s relations with \(x\) and \(z\)):
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - These satisfy the vertical requirements for both B and W relations.

2. **Horizontal conditions**:
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but the relationship between \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) is not fixed.

Two mutually exclusive scenarios arise:

- **Case 1: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
  This satisfies the horizontal condition for W: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with the vertical conditions, \(x\) is W of \(z\).

- **Case 2: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
  This satisfies the first horizontal condition for B: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). The second horizontal condition for B, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), holds because \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Combined with the vertical conditions, \(x\) is B of \(z\).

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW) are impossible due to contradictions in vertical or horizontal bounds (e.g., N requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \inf_y(z)\) and non-degenerate regions ensure \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), making it impossible).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **W**.  

**Answer: B, W**
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is constrained by:
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\)).
- \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).
- Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), meaning \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

The horizontal relation depends on the bounds:
- Let \(a_1 = \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(a_2 = \text{sup}_x(x)\), \(c_1 = \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(c_2 = \text{sup}_x(z)\).
- From \(y\) N \(z\): \(c_1 \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq c_2\).
- From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq a_1\).
- Thus, \(c_1 \leq a_1\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq a_1 \leq a_2\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq c_2\).

Possible horizontal scenarios:
1. If \(a_2 \leq c_2\):
   - \(\text{inf}_x(z) = c_1 \leq a_1 = \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) = a_2 \leq c_2 = \text{sup}_x(z)\).
   - Combined with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).
2. If \(a_1 > c_2\):
   - \(\text{sup}_x(z) = c_2 \leq a_1 = \text{inf}_x(x)\).
   - Combined with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) NE \(z\).
3. If \(a_1 = c_2\) and \(a_2 > c_2\):
   - \(\text{sup}_x(z) = c_2 = a_1 = \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(c_2 \leq a_1\) holds.
   - Combined with \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) NE \(z\).

Other relations are not possible due to the vertical separation (\(x\) above \(z\)) and horizontal constraints:
- \(x\) S \(z\), \(x\) SE \(z\), \(x\) SW \(z\), \(x\) W \(z\), \(x\) NW \(z\): Require \(x\) below \(z\) or specific horizontal alignments not satisfied.
- \(x\) E \(z\): Requires \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and vertical containment, which conflicts with \(x\) above \(z\).
- \(x\) B \(z\): Requires bounding box containment, but vertically \(z\) is below \(x\), impossible.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N and NE.

**Answer: N, NE**
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: Based on the given conditions that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B, E, and W. 

- **B (bounding box)**: It is possible if the bounding box of \(z\) contains the bounding box of \(x\) horizontally and vertically. Specifically, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The vertical conditions are satisfied from the initial constraints, and the horizontal conditions can hold under certain configurations.
- **E (east)**: It is possible if \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\). Specifically, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The vertical conditions are satisfied, and the horizontal condition can occur when \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **W (west)**: It is possible if \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\). Specifically, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The vertical conditions are satisfied, and the horizontal condition can occur when \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, SW) are impossible due to the vertical constraints derived from the initial conditions: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which prevent \(x\) from being entirely above, below, or diagonally positioned relative to \(z\) without overlap.

Thus, the possible relations are **B, E, W**.
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), we analyze the relations based on the definitions:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) E \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining the inequalities:
1. \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
2. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
3. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

These conditions match the definition of E for \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (z is west of x)
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Thus, the relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must be E. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, W, NW, SW, B) satisfies all three conditions simultaneously under the given constraints.

**Answer**: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South) and SE (South East).

- **S (South)**: This occurs when the x-range of x is contained within the x-range of z. Specifically, if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then the conditions for x S z are satisfied: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
  
- **SE (South East)**: This occurs when x is strictly east of z with no horizontal overlap. Specifically, if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then the conditions for x SE z are satisfied: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Other relations are not possible because:
- Vertically, x is always below z (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), so relations like N, NE, E, NW, W, or B cannot hold.
- Horizontally, x cannot be west of z because \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), ruling out SW and W.
- The case where there is horizontal overlap but x extends east beyond z (\(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\)) does not satisfy any atomic cardinal direction relation under the given definitions and is not considered a valid configuration for this problem.

Thus, the possible relations are S and SE.

\boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}}
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, the vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is derived as:  
\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(x\) is above \(z\) vertically.

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their bounding boxes:  
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\sup_x(y)\) (since \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)).  
- Possible horizontal scenarios:  
  1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\): \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) → **NW**.  
  2. \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\): \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) → **NE**.  
  3. \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\): \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\) → **N**.

No other cardinal relations are possible:  
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **SE**, **E**, **W** are excluded due to the vertical gap (\(x\) above \(z\)) and/or horizontal constraints.  
- Horizontal overlap without containment does not fit any defined relation under the given constraints and REG properties.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N**, **NW**, and **NE**.

**Final Answer**  
**N, NW, NE**
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SW of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
- The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their bounding boxes. Possible cases:
  1. If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\), so \(x\) is SW of \(z\).
  2. If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\), so \(x\) is SE of \(z\).
  3. If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally within \(z\), and since \(x\) is below \(z\), \(x\) is S of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations given the constraints, as the vertical separation forces a southern component (SW, S, or SE). Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are incompatible due to the vertical condition \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Answer:** SW, S, SE
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NE (North East).

### Explanation:
- From y SE z: 
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is left of y)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- From x E y:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (y is left of x)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of y ≤ bottom of x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x ≤ top of y)

Combining these:
- Horizontally: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is left of x).
- Vertically: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x).

Thus, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of x NE z.

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible due to the lack of vertical or horizontal overlap and the specific positioning constraints.

**Possible relation: NE**
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is E of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the relations impose specific spatial constraints. Analyzing the definitions:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is strictly east of y in the x-direction).
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (x is vertically within the bounds of y).
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is strictly east of z in the x-direction).
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (y is strictly north of z in the y-direction).

Chaining these:
- **x-direction**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\).
- **y-direction**: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\). Since \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (i.e., \(x\) is north of \(z\)).

The combination of \(x\) being east and north of \(z\) matches the definition of NE:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (east condition).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (north condition).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible:
- **N or S**: Require horizontal overlap in x, but \(x\) is strictly east of \(z\) (no overlap).
- **E**: Requires \(z\) to vertically bound \(x\), but \(x\) is above \(z\).
- **SE, S, SW, W, NW**: All require \(x\) not to be strictly east and north, contradicting the constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE.

**Answer**: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is B of \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The vertical conditions between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as:
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)).
Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds.

Horizontally:
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) B \(z\)).
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)).
Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on the horizontal extent of \(x\) relative to \(z\):

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   - Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) B \(z\).

2. **If \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   - Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\).

The condition \(\inf_x(x) < \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\) is impossible because it would place part of \(x\) inside \(z\)'s horizontal bounds and part outside, violating the requirement that regions in REG are connected and have connected boundaries, thus must lie entirely in one cardinal tile relative to \(z\). Given the vertical constraints, \(x\) cannot be in other tiles (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **E**.

**Answer: B, E**
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Based on the given conditions that region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are all nine relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B. This is because the constraints allow configurations where x and z can satisfy any of these relations relative to each other, as verified through specific examples:

- **B (bounding box)**: x and z share the same bounding box or x's box is contained within z's box.
- **S (South)**: x is entirely below z with aligned horizontal bounds.
- **SW (South West)**: x is below and to the left of z.
- **W (West)**: x is entirely to the left of z with vertical bounds within z's.
- **NW (North West)**: x is above and to the left of z.
- **N (North)**: x is entirely above z with aligned horizontal bounds.
- **NE (North East)**: x is above and to the right of z.
- **E (East)**: x is entirely to the right of z with vertical bounds within z's.
- **SE (South East)**: x is below and to the right of z.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B**
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Vertically: 
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but the relationship between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) is not fixed.
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Possible vertical scenarios:
1. **SW relation**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\). Combined with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies SW: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
2. **W relation**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then the vertical strip of \(x\) is contained within \(z\)'s vertical strip (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)). Combined with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies W: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Other relations are impossible:
- **B**, **S**, **SE**, **E**, **NE**, **N**, **NW**: Violate horizontal or vertical constraints derived (e.g., \(x\) must be west of \(z\), not east, and vertical conditions for N, NW, etc., are unattainable).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **W**.

**Final Answer: SW, W**
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is east of \(z\). The possible atomic relations with this x-constraint are E, NE, or SE.

- **NE** requires \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). However, from the constraints, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\) (since \(x\) has a bounding box). If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), implying \(\sup_y(x) = \inf_y(x)\), which contradicts that regions in REG have positive area bounding boxes. Thus, **NE is impossible**.

- **E** requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). The latter holds, and the former is possible (e.g., if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). Example: \(z = [0,1] \times [0,5]\), \(y = [1,3] \times [3,4]\), \(x = [2,2.5] \times [1,2]\). Then \(x\) S \(y\), \(y\) E \(z\), and \(x\) E \(z\).

- **SE** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This is possible (e.g., if \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\)). Example: \(z = [0,1] \times [3,5]\), \(y = [1,3] \times [4,4.5]\), \(x = [2,2.5] \times [1,2]\). Then \(x\) S \(y\), \(y\) E \(z\), and \(x\) SE \(z\).

Other relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N) violate \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **E and SE**.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Given that region x is S (South) of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z must be S.

This is determined by the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:
- x S y implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y vertically),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (x is horizontally within y's bounding box).
- y S z implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z vertically),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is horizontally within z's bounding box).

From these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Thus, x satisfies the conditions for being S of z:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\),
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, E, NW, W, SW, or B) is possible because:
- Vertically, x must be below z (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), ruling out N, NE, NW, E, W, and B (which requires vertical containment not satisfied).
- Horizontally, x is within z's bounding box (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), ruling out SW, SE, W, E, NW, and NE (which require horizontal misalignment).

Therefore, the only possible relation is S.

**Answer:** S
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely below \(y\) and horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box.

- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) and \(z\) is entirely below \(y\).

From these:
- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\):**  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (no horizontal overlap).

- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\):**  
  Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\):  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  However, there is no direct constraint on the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\).

Given the horizontal constraint (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their vertical alignment:
- **SW (South West):** If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
  \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West):** If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box.
- **NW (North West):** If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\).

These are the only possible relations, as other cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are incompatible with the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) or the vertical conditions derived.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are:  
**SW, W, NW**.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given relations:
- \(x\) S \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
- From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\). 

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously without requiring additional constraints that are not necessarily met (e.g., for S, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) would conflict with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the non-degeneracy of regions).

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.

**Answer**: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z must be SE. This is determined by the inequalities derived from the cardinal direction relations:

- From x S y:  
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)  
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)  

- From y SE z:  
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  

Combining these:  
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)  
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)  

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) satisfy the definition of x SE z:  
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as the inequalities prevent them. For example:  
- S would require supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) < supx(x) implies supx(x) > supx(z).  
- E would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), but infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies infy(z) ≥ infy(x).  

Thus, SE is the only possible relation.

**Possible relation between x and z: SE**
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is NE (North East) of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these constraints:

1. From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
2. From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), implying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\) horizontally.
3. Vertically:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(\inf_y(y)\), but their relative vertical positions can vary.

The possible vertical alignments between \(z\) and \(x\) are:

- **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Here, \(z\) is below \(x\).
- **W (West)**: If \(\inf_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\). Here, \(z\) is vertically contained within \(x\)'s y-range.
- **NW (North West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Here, \(z\) is above \(x\).

These relations are possible under the constraints, as verified by examples:
- **SW example**: \(z\)'s bounding box is below and left of \(x\)'s.
- **W example**: \(z\)'s bounding box is left of \(x\)'s and vertically aligned within \(x\)'s y-range.
- **NW example**: \(z\)'s bounding box is above and left of \(x\)'s.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are impossible due to the horizontal separation \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which forces \(z\) to be west of \(x\), and the vertical constraints excluding other directions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, W, SW**.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- From \(x\) S \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., the top of \(x\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)).  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., the \(x\)-projection of \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-projection of \(y\)).

- From \(y\) B \(z\):  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., the \(x\)-projection of \(y\) is contained within the \(x\)-projection of \(z\)).  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., the \(y\)-projection of \(y\) is contained within the \(y\)-projection of \(z\)).

Combining these:  
- The \(x\)-projection of \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-projection of \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
- For the \(y\)-direction:  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  - Two cases arise based on the relationship between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\):  
    1. **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:  
       - Then \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and combined with the \(x\)-containment, this satisfies the definition of \(x\) S \(z\).  
    2. **If \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)**:  
       - Additionally, if \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., the bottom of \(x\) is at or above the bottom of \(z\)), then the entire bounding box of \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\), satisfying \(x\) B \(z\).  
       - The case \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\) does not correspond to any of the defined nine cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) due to the \(x\)-containment and \(y\)-overlap constraints, so it is excluded.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
- **S** (when \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\))  
- **B** (when \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\))

No other relations (N, NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW) are possible given the constraints.

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are derived from the spatial constraints imposed by these relations.

- From x NW y:  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is to the left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x, so x is above y)  

- From y N z:  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z starts at or to the left of y's start)  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (z ends at or to the right of y's end)  

Combining these, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means z is entirely below x vertically, so x is above z. Thus, possible relations must have x above z, which are N, NE, or NW. However, NE is impossible because \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), making \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) unattainable for regions with area.  

Horizontally:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) can vary relative to each other.  
- If \(\inf_x(z) > \sup_x(x)\), then x is completely to the left of z, and with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), x NW z holds.  
- If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (always true from above) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), x N z holds.  

Cases where \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\) but \(\inf_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) do not satisfy the conditions for N, NW, or any other relation due to vertical separation and horizontal misalignment. However, regions can be arranged such that \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or \(\inf_x(z) > \sup_x(x)\), making N and NW possible. Other relations (e.g., E, W, S, SE, SW, NE, B) are impossible due to vertical separation or horizontal constraints.  

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are NW and N.

**Possible relations: NW, N**
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is always to the left of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). However, \(\sup_y(z)\) may vary relative to \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x)\).

The possible relations are:
1. **NW**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is northwest of \(z\).
2. **W**: If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is west of \(z\) (vertical span of \(x\) contained in \(z\)).

Other relations are impossible:
- **B**, **S**, **SW**, **N**, **NE**, **E**, **SE** violate the derived constraints or require degenerate regions (e.g., zero height or single-point extents), which are invalid for regions homeomorphic to a closed disk.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NW and W.

**Answer: NW, W**
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B. 

This is because specific arrangements of the bounding boxes of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) can satisfy the initial constraints (\(x\) NW \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\)) while resulting in any of the nine relations between \(x\) and \(z\). Examples include:
- **NW**: \(x\) northwest of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) west of \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) southwest of \(z\).
- **N**: \(x\) north of \(z\).
- **B**: \(x\) bounding box inside \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) south of \(z\).
- **NE**: \(x\) northeast of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) east of \(z\).
- **SE**: \(x\) southeast of \(z\).

Each relation is achievable under the given constraints by appropriately setting the bounding boxes, including degenerate cases where vertical or horizontal extents may align, while satisfying the topological requirements (regions are homeomorphic to closed disks).

Thus, the possible relations are: **N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B**.
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NW of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely to the west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is entirely north of y)

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is entirely south of z)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical constraints**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - This implies both \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) are \(\geq \sup_y(y)\), but no direct relation between \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) or between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z)\) is enforced. Thus, vertical positioning between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
     - \(x\) could be entirely north of \(z\) (if \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\))
     - \(x\) could be entirely south of \(z\) (if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\))
     - Or there could be vertical overlap without full containment.

2. **Horizontal constraints**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Combining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) are not directly comparable. However, \(x\) is always entirely to the west of \(y\), and \(z\) starts no farther east than \(y\)'s left edge. Thus:
     - \(x\) is always entirely to the west of \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)) or there might be horizontal overlap, but the constraints ensure \(x\) is at least partially or fully west.

Considering the atomic relations and valid configurations:

- **NW (North West)**: Possible if \(x\) is entirely north and west of \(z\).
  - Example: \(x\) positioned northwest of \(y\), and \(z\) positioned such that it is north of \(y\) but \(x\) remains northwest of \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(x\) is entirely south and west of \(z\).
  - Example: \(x\) positioned northwest of \(y\), but \(z\) is sufficiently south and east, placing \(x\) southwest of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: Possible if \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\) and vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-projection.
  - Example: \(x\) west of \(y\), \(z\) south of \(y\) with wide horizontal span, and \(x\) vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounds.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible due to the west constraint from \(x\) NW \(y\) and the lack of conditions allowing eastward positioning.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, SW, and W**.
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

This is derived from the transitive nature of the inequalities defining the NW relation:
- From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Chaining these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) implies supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) satisfy the definition of x NW z. No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., N, W, B, etc.) are possible under these constraints, as the inequalities enforce strict directional separation without overlap.

NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined and the given conditions that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- The relation \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\))
- The relation \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but no direct vertical constraint between \(x\) and \(z\).

The possible vertical alignments between \(x\) and \(z\) allow multiple relations, supported by specific examples:
1. **NW (North West)**: If \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([1,2] \times [4,5]\), \(y\): \([3,4] \times [1,2]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [3,4]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(2 \leq 4\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(4 \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq 3\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(z\): \(2 \leq 5\) and \(4 \leq 4\)  

2. **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([1,2] \times [1,2]\), \(y\): \([3,4] \times [0,0.5]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [3,4]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(0.5 \leq 1\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(4 \leq 5\) and \(0.5 \leq 3\)  
   - \(x\) SW \(z\): \(2 \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq 3\)  

3. **W (West)**: If \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([1,2] \times [3,4]\), \(y\): \([3,4] \times [1,2]\), \(z\): \([5,6] \times [2,5]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(2 \leq 3\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(4 \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq 2\)  
   - \(x\) W \(z\): \(2 \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq 3\) and \(4 \leq 5\)  

4. **N (North)**: If \(x\) is at the left edge of \(z\) (so horizontally contained: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), and \(z\) is below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([5,5] \times [2,3]\), \(y\): \([5,5] \times [0,1]\), \(z\): \([5,10] \times [1,1.5]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(5 \leq 5\) and \(1 \leq 2\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(5 \leq 5\) and \(1 \leq 1\)  
   - \(x\) N \(z\): \(1.5 \leq 2\) and \(5 \leq 5\) and \(5 \leq 10\)  

5. **S (South)**: If \(x\) is at the left edge of \(z\) (horizontally contained), and \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).  
   Example:  
   - \(x\): \([5,5] \times [1,2]\), \(y\): \([5,5] \times [0,1]\), \(z\): \([5,10] \times [3,4]\)  
   - \(x\) NW \(y\): \(5 \leq 5\) and \(1 \leq 1\)  
   - \(y\) SW \(z\): \(5 \leq 5\) and \(1 \leq 3\)  
   - \(x\) S \(z\): \(2 \leq 3\) and \(5 \leq 5\) and \(5 \leq 10\)  

Other relations (B, E, NE, SE) are impossible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), which requires \(x\) to be left of or aligned at the left edge of \(z\), but not right or containing.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW, SW, W, N, S**.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The constraints imply:
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are entirely to the left of \(y\).
2. \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are entirely above \(y\).

No further constraints directly relate \(x\) and \(z\). The relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary in both horizontal and vertical directions:
- **Horizontally**: \(x\) could be left of, right of, or overlapping \(z\) (within the left constraint).
- **Vertically**: \(x\) could be above, below, or overlapping \(z\) (within the above constraint).

All nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible, as verified by constructing valid configurations satisfying the constraints. For example:
- **N**: \(z\) below \(x\), \(x\) horizontally within \(z\).
- **NE**: \(z\) below and left of \(x\).
- **SE**: \(z\) above and left of \(x\).
- **S**: \(z\) above \(x\), \(x\) horizontally within \(z\).
- **E**: \(z\) left of \(x\), \(x\) vertically within \(z\).
- **NW**: \(z\) below and right of \(x\).
- **W**: \(z\) right of \(x\), \(x\) vertically within \(z\).
- **SW**: \(z\) above and right of \(x\).
- **B**: \(x\)’s bounding box contained in \(z\)’s.

Thus, the possible relations are:  
**N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B**.
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the cardinal direction relations are defined based on the bounding boxes of the regions. The inequalities derived from these relations are as follows:

- From \(x \text{ NW } y\):
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is south of \(x\), so \(x\) is north of \(y\))

- From \(y \text{ NE } z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is south of \(y\), so \(y\) is north of \(z\))

Combining these, the vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) is fixed:
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is south of \(x\), meaning \(x\) is north of \(z\).

The horizontal relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their relative positions to the left of \(y\) (since both have \(\sup_x \leq \inf_x(y)\)). The possible horizontal scenarios are:

1. **If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:  
   \(x\) is west of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) north of \(z\), this gives \(x \text{ NW } z\).

2. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   \(z\) is west of \(x\), so \(x\) is east of \(z\). Combined with \(x\) north of \(z\), this gives \(x \text{ NE } z\).

3. **If there is horizontal overlap with containment (specifically, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\))**:  
   \(z\) contains \(x\) horizontally. Combined with \(x\) north of \(z\), this gives \(x \text{ N } z\).

Other relations are not possible because:
- \(x\) cannot be south of \(z\) (contradicts \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- Relations like S, SW, SE, W, E, or B require vertical alignment, vertical containment, or specific horizontal positions that are inconsistent with the fixed north-south separation and both regions being west of \(y\).
- Partial horizontal overlap without containment does not fit any of the nine defined cardinal direction relations, as they require either separation or containment.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are NW, N, and NE.

\boxed{\text{NW}} \quad \boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}}
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. The relations S, SE, SW, E, and NE are impossible due to the positional constraints from the given relations. The possible relations are:

- **B (bounding box)**: This is possible if z's bounding box contains x's bounding box, which can occur when z extends sufficiently left, right, below, and above to encompass x.
- **W (West)**: This is possible if x is completely to the west of z and there is vertical containment (i.e., z's bottom is below or at x's bottom, and x's top is below or at z's top).
- **NW (North West)**: This is possible if x is completely to the west and north of z, which aligns with x being NW of y and z containing y.
- **N (North)**: This is possible if x is completely to the north of z, with z's bounding box starting left of or at x's left and ending right of or at x's right.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are B, W, NW, and N.

**Final Answer**  
B, W, NW, N
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y)
- \(y\) N \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is south of y)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (z is horizontally within y's x-bounds)

From \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) N \(z\):
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (x is west of z).
- Vertically: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), but their vertical positions relative to each other vary.

Possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x is south of z).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([-3, -2] \times [-4, -3]\), \(z\) in \([1, 2] \times [-2, -1]\).
2. **NW (North West)**: If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is south of x, so x is north of z).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([-3, -2] \times [-2, -1]\), \(z\) in \([1, 2] \times [-4, -3]\).
3. **W (West)**: If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (z's vertical span contains x's vertical span).  
   Example: \(x\) in \([-3, -2] \times [-3, -2]\), \(z\) in \([1, 2] \times [-4, -1]\).

These are the only possible relations given the constraints. Other relations (e.g., S, N, E, SE, NE, B) are not possible due to the west horizontal constraint and vertical conditions.

**Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\): NW, W, SW**
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is to the left of \(z\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), with \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\). However, the vertical relationship between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on the infima and suprema of their \(y\)-projections.

Possible vertical scenarios:
1. If \(\sup_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\), so \(x\) is SW of \(z\).
2. If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (which implies \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) holds as \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).

The relation NW is impossible because it would require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\), leading to \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\), implying degenerate regions, which are not allowed in REG. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are inconsistent with the horizontal left constraint.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and W.

**Answer: SW, W**
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints:

1. **SW (South West)**: Possible when \(x\) is entirely left and below \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([5,9] \times [0,9]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [10,20]\), \(z\) in \([0,8] \times [9.5,25]\).

2. **W (West)**: Possible when \(x\) is left of \(z\) and vertically contained in \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([0,4] \times [5,9]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [10,20]\), \(z\) in \([5,9] \times [5,25]\).

3. **E (East)**: Possible when \(z\) is left of \(x\) and vertically contained:
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([8,9] \times [9,10]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [10,20]\), \(z\) in \([0,7] \times [5,25]\).

4. **SE (South East)**: Possible when \(z\) is left of \(x\) and \(x\) is below \(z\):
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([7,9.5] \times [0,10]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [5,20]\), \(z\) in \([0,6] \times [4.5,25]\).

5. **S (South)**: Possible when \(x\) is below \(z\) and horizontally contained:
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([5,9] \times [0,10]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [11,20]\), \(z\) in \([0,10] \times [11,25]\).

6. **B (Bounding box)**: Possible when \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([5,10] \times [0,5]\), \(y\) in \([10,15] \times [5,20]\), \(z\) in \([5,10] \times [0,20]\).

Other relations (N, NE, NW) are impossible due to the constraints:
- \(x\) is below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\).
- Vertical and horizontal constraints prevent NE and NW.

Thus, the possible relations are: **B, S, SW, W, E, SE**.
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(x\) is left of \(y\) in \(x\)-coordinate)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(y\) in \(y\)-coordinate)

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(z\) in \(y\)-coordinate)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (\(y\)'s \(x\)-range is contained within \(z\)'s \(x\)-range)

Combining these:
- From \(y\)-coordinates: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) in \(y\)-coordinate.
- For \(x\)-coordinates, two cases arise:
  1. **Case 1:** \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
     Then \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\) in \(x\)-coordinate, and with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) SW \(z\).
  2. **Case 2:** \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)  
     Given \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and if \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (subcase), then:
     - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\))
     - With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) S \(z\).  
     The subcase \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\) is impossible under the constraints and the requirement that relations are defined by non-degenerate bounding boxes (as regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk, ensuring positive width/height).

Other relations (e.g., SE, B, etc.) are not possible due to contradictions in \(x\)- or \(y\)-constraints. Thus, the possible relations are SW and S.

**Answer: SW, S**
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are SW, W, and NW. This is derived from the bounding box constraints:

- From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining the x-axis inequalities:  
\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This implies that \(x\) is west of \(z\), limiting the possible relations to W, SW, or NW.

The y-axis inequalities:  
\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), but the relative positions of \(\inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x)\), \(\inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z)\) can vary, allowing for three cases:
- If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) SW \(z\).
- If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) NW \(z\).
- If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) W \(z\).

All other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are impossible due to the west constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and the properties of regions in REG (e.g., positive area).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, the relations imply:

- For x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- For y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ⇒ supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This satisfies the definition of x SW z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). 

No other cardinal direction relation is possible because:
- Relations like S, W, or B require partial or complete overlap in the x or y projections (e.g., S requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and the positive extent of regions).
- Other diagonal relations (e.g., NW, SE) require different directional alignments that are inconsistent with the combined SW chain.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the spatial constraints based on the bounding box definitions.

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is to the west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is to the south of y)

- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is to the west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is to the south of z, so z is to the north of y)

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely below \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\) (ruling out N, NE, NW).
- Horizontally: Both \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the west of \(y\). However, the relative horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is to the west and south of \(z\). This is consistent with the constraints.
2. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is to the east and south of \(z\) (since \(z\) is west of \(x\), making \(x\) relatively east of \(z\)). This is consistent with the constraints.
3. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\)'s x-range and south of \(z\). This requires horizontal containment but is possible under the constraints.

Other relations are impossible:
- N, NE, NW: Contradict \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (x cannot be north of z).
- E, W: Require vertical alignment or specific horizontal relations not guaranteed here.
- B: Requires full containment in both axes, but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) implies vertical separation, making containment impossible except in degenerate cases (not typical for regions homeomorphic to a disk).
- NW, NE: Already ruled out by vertical position.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, SE, and S.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}}
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal direction relations. This is because the constraints only require both \(x\) and \(z\) to be left and below \(y\), but within that quadrant, \(x\) and \(z\) can be arranged in any relative position to each other, allowing for all atomic relations to occur.

- **B (bounding box)**: \(x\) can be contained within the bounding box of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: \(x\) can be entirely above \(z\).
- **NE (North East)**: \(x\) can be above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) can be entirely to the right of \(z\).
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) can be below and to the right of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) can be entirely below \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) can be below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: \(x\) can be entirely to the left of \(z\).
- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) can be above and to the left of \(z\).

Thus, all nine relations are possible.

**Final Answer**: B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- **SW (South West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely to the left and below \(z\). For example:
  - \(x\): bounding box \([0, 1] \times [0, 1]\)
  - \(y\): bounding box \([2, 3] \times [2, 3]\)
  - \(z\): bounding box \([1.5, 3.5] \times [1.5, 3.5]\)
  Here, \(x\) is SW of \(y\) (since \(1 \leq 2\) and \(1 \leq 2\)), and \(y\) is B of \(z\) (since \(1.5 \leq 2\), \(3 \leq 3.5\), \(1.5 \leq 2\), and \(3 \leq 3.5\)). Then \(x\) is SW of \(z\) (since \(1 \leq 1.5\) and \(1 \leq 1.5\)).

- **W (West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) and within \(z\)'s y-bounds. For example:
  - \(x\): bounding box \([0, 1] \times [1.5, 2]\)
  - \(y\): bounding box \([2, 3] \times [2, 3]\)
  - \(z\): bounding box \([1.5, 3.5] \times [1.5, 3.5]\)
  Here, \(x\) is SW of \(y\) (since \(1 \leq 2\) and \(2 \leq 2\)), and \(y\) is B of \(z\) (as above). Then \(x\) is W of \(z\) (since \(1 \leq 1.5\), and \(1.5 \leq 1.5\) and \(2 \leq 3.5\) for y-bounds).

- **S (South)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) and within \(z\)'s x-bounds. For example:
  - \(x\): bounding box \([1, 2] \times [0, 1]\)
  - \(y\): bounding box \([3, 4] \times [2, 3]\)
  - \(z\): bounding box \([0, 5] \times [1.5, 4]\)
  Here, \(x\) is SW of \(y\) (since \(2 \leq 3\) and \(1 \leq 2\)), and \(y\) is B of \(z\) (since \(0 \leq 3\), \(4 \leq 5\), \(1.5 \leq 2\), and \(3 \leq 4\)). Then \(x\) is S of \(z\) (since \(1 \leq 1.5\), and \(0 \leq 1\) and \(2 \leq 5\) for x-bounds).

- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely within \(z\)'s bounding box. For example:
  - \(x\): bounding box \([1, 2] \times [1, 2]\)
  - \(y\): bounding box \([3, 4] \times [3, 4]\)
  - \(z\): bounding box \([0, 5] \times [0, 5]\)
  Here, \(x\) is SW of \(y\) (since \(2 \leq 3\) and \(2 \leq 3\)), and \(y\) is B of \(z\) (trivially). Then \(x\) is B of \(z\) (since \(0 \leq 1\), \(2 \leq 5\), \(0 \leq 1\), and \(2 \leq 5\)).

- **N (North)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) and within \(z\)'s x-bounds, in degenerate cases (e.g., regions with constant y-value). For example:
  - \(x\): bounding box \([1.6, 1.9] \times [c, c]\) (for a constant \(c\))
  - \(y\): bounding box \([2, 3] \times [c, c]\)
  - \(z\): bounding box \([1.5, 3.5] \times [c, c]\)
  Here, \(x\) is SW of \(y\) (since \(1.9 \leq 2\) and \(c \leq c\)), and \(y\) is B of \(z\). Then \(x\) is N of \(z\) (since \(c \leq c\), and \(1.5 \leq 1.6\) and \(1.9 \leq 3.5\)).

- **NW (North West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely to the left and above \(z\), in degenerate cases. For example:
  - \(x\): bounding box \([0, 1] \times [c, c]\)
  - \(y\): bounding box \([2, 3] \times [c, c]\)
  - \(z\): bounding box \([1.5, 3.5] \times [c, c]\)
  Here, \(x\) is SW of \(y\) (since \(1 \leq 2\) and \(c \leq c\)), and \(y\) is B of \(z\). Then \(x\) is NW of \(z\) (since \(1 \leq 1.5\) and \(c \leq c\)).

Other relations (NE, E, SE) are not possible due to the constraints from \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) B \(z\), which force \(x\) to be left and below \(y\), while \(z\) covers \(y\), making it impossible for \(x\) to be to the right of \(z\) in any atomic relation.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **B, S, W, SW, N, NW**.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by analyzing the constraints on their bounding boxes. The horizontal and vertical bounds from the given relations lead to the following possibilities:

1. **B (Bounding box)**: \(x\) can be inside the bounding box of \(z\) if \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
2. **S (South)**: \(x\) can be directly south of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
3. **E (East)**: \(x\) can be directly east of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
4. **N (North)**: \(x\) can be directly north of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
5. **NE (Northeast)**: \(x\) can be northeast of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). Example configurations satisfy this.
6. **SE (Southeast)**: \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) if \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\). Example configurations satisfy this.

The relations W (West), NW (Northwest), and SW (Southwest) are impossible because \(x\) must be to the east of \(z\) due to the constraints \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), ensuring \(x\) is never west of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are: **B, S, E, N, NE, SE**.

**Final Answer**  
**B, S, E, N, NE, SE**
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

From \(x\) SE \(y\), \(x\) is to the right and below \(y\). From \(y\) W \(z\), \(z\) is to the right of \(y\) and vertically overlaps or contains \(y\)'s bounding box. Combining these:

- Vertically: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from SE) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from W). Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\). For disjoint vertical projections (required for cardinal relations), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) must hold, meaning \(x\) is below \(z\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the right of \(y\) (\(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)). Two disjoint cases are possible:
  1. \(z\) is left of \(x\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\). Combined with \(x\) below \(z\), this gives \(x\) SE \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).
  2. \(x\) is left of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). Combined with \(x\) below \(z\), this gives \(x\) SW \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

No other cardinal relations are possible, as horizontal overlap would violate the disjointness required for the defined relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and SE.

**Answer:** SW, SE
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- From \(x\) SE \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) E \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining the \(x\)-axis conditions:  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This implies \(x\) is east of \(z\) in the \(x\)-direction.

For the \(y\)-axis:  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from SE) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from E).  
- Both \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) are \(\leq \inf_y(y)\), but their relative positions can vary.

**Case 1: \(\inf_y(z) > \sup_y(x)\)**  
- Then \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), satisfying \(x\) SE \(z\).

**Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\)**  
- Here, \(x\) and \(z\) overlap in the \(y\)-direction. To satisfy an atomic relation:  
  - Choose \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) (possible as \(\inf_y(x)\) can be set freely as long as \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\)).  
  - Then \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), satisfying \(x\) E \(z\).

Other relations (N, NE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are incompatible with \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and the \(y\)-axis constraints. Thus, the possible relations are **SE** and **E**.

**Final Answer: SE, E**
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is south of y).  
- \(y\) is S of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z), and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y is within the x-range of z).

From these, derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Y-axis constraints**:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   This means \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) in the y-axis, so the relation must involve a southern component (S, SW, or SE).

2. **X-axis constraints**:  
   \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)).  
   Also, \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   This implies \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(x\) starts at or to the east of \(z\)'s left edge. SW is impossible because it requires \(x\) to be west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)), which contradicts \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

3. **Possible relations**:  
   - **S (South)**: Requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (which holds) and \(x\) within the x-range of \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (holds) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). This is possible if \(x\) does not extend beyond \(z\)'s right edge.  
   - **SE (South East)**: Requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (holds) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This is possible if \(z\)'s right edge is at or left of \(x\)'s left edge, which can occur since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), allowing \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, SW, B) are excluded due to y-axis constraints or x-axis contradictions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S** and **SE**.
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, if region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be any of the nine cardinal directions, as demonstrated by specific examples satisfying the initial constraints:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) requires \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) NW \(z\) requires \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

Both \(x\) and \(z\) are constrained to be to the right of \(y\) (east) and below \(y\) (south) in the coordinate system. However, their relative positions to each other can vary:

- **N (North)**: \(x\) is above \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **NE (North East)**: \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) is below and to the right of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) is below \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

Each relation is possible under specific configurations of the regions' bounding boxes that respect the initial SE and NW constraints. Therefore, all nine relations are achievable.

**Possible relations**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(x\) is east of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is south of \(y\))

- \(y\) SW \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (entire \(y\) is west of \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(y\) is south of \(z\))

From these, we derive the vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\).

For the horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\), consider the possible alignments:

1. **SW (South West)** is possible if \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\):
   - Requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([2,3] \times [-2,-1]\), \(y\) in \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) in \([4,5] \times [2,3]\). Here, \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) SW \(z\) hold, and \(x\) SW \(z\) as \(\sup_x(x)=3 \leq \inf_x(z)=4\).

2. **S (South)** is possible if \(x\) is within the horizontal bounds of \(z\):
   - Requires \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([1,2] \times [-2,-1]\), \(y\) in \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) in \([1,3] \times [2,3]\). Here, \(x\) SE \(y\) (since \(\sup_x(y)=1 \leq \inf_x(x)=1\)) and \(y\) SW \(z\) hold, and \(x\) S \(z\) as \(\inf_x(z)=1 \leq \inf_x(x)=1\) and \(\sup_x(x)=2 \leq \sup_x(z)=3\).

3. **SE (South East)** is possible if \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\):
   - Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Example: \(x\) in \([2,3] \times [-2,-1]\), \(y\) in \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(z\) in \([1.5,1.8] \times [2,3]\). Here, \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) SW \(z\) hold, and \(x\) SE \(z\) as \(\sup_x(z)=1.8 \leq \inf_x(x)=2\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Answer: SW, S, SE**
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: Based on the definitions provided:

- \(x\) is SE of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is below \(y\))

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(z\))

Combining these:

- **Horizontal direction**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).

- **Vertical direction**:  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

For the relation of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
- \(z\) is left of \(x\): satisfies the horizontal condition for SE (since \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
- \(x\) is below \(z\): satisfies the vertical condition for SE (since \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).

Thus, \(x\) is SE of \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., E, S, etc.) fits, as they require different spatial arrangements (e.g., E requires vertical overlap, which is absent here).

The possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) (with \(x\) as the subject and \(z\) as the reference) is **SE**.

**Answer: SE**
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: Given the relations:
- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, we derive:
1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) imply \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(x\) is east of \(z\) horizontally.
2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) are south of \(y\):  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   The relative vertical positions can vary:
   - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), then \(x\) is north of \(z\) vertically, leading to \(x\) NE of \(z\).
   - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is south of \(z\) vertically, leading to \(x\) SE of \(z\).
   - If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment), then \(x\) is directly east of \(z\) (E).

The relations NE, E, and SE are possible depending on the vertical arrangement. Other relations (N, S, NW, SW, W, B) are impossible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and vertical constraints excluding other alignments.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE, E, SE.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are B, S, E, and SE. These relations can occur under specific configurations of the regions, while the other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW) are impossible due to the constraints derived from the given relations.

- **B (bounding box)**: Possible if \(z\) is sufficiently large such that \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\). For example, if \(y\) is near the top-right of \(z\) and \(x\) is positioned southeast of \(y\) but within the extent of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: Possible if \(x\) is directly below \(z\) and horizontally aligned within the bounding box of \(z\). This requires \(z\) to have a high minimum y-coordinate and sufficient width.
- **E (East)**: Possible if \(x\) is directly to the east of \(z\) and vertically within the bounding box of \(z\). This occurs when \(z\) has the same or smaller width as \(y\) and \(x\) is positioned to the right without extending below \(z\).
- **SE (South East)**: Possible if \(x\) is both to the east and south of \(z\). This can happen when \(z\) does not extend far to the east or south beyond \(y\), and \(x\) is positioned southeast of \(y\).

The relations N, NE, NW, W, and SW are impossible because:
- \(x\) must be to the east of \(y\) (since \(x\) is SE of \(y\)), and \(y\) is contained within the bounding box of \(z\) (since \(y\) is B of \(z\)), so \(x\) cannot be to the west of \(z\) (ruling out SW, W, NW).
- \(x\) must be below \(y\) (since \(x\) is SE of \(y\)), and \(y\) is above the minimum y-coordinate of \(z\) (since \(y\) is B of \(z\)), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\) (ruling out N, NE).

Thus, the possible relations are B, S, E, and SE.

\boxed{\text{B}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Given \(x\) is NE of \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is strictly east of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is strictly north of y)  

- Given \(y\) is N of \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (y is strictly north of z)  
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)  

Combining these:  
- Vertically:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This satisfies the vertical condition for \(x\) being north of \(z\) (i.e., for \(x\) N \(z\) or \(x\) NE \(z\)).  

- Horizontally:  
  From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
  However, \(\sup_x(x)\) relative to \(\sup_x(z)\) can vary:  
  - If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\)'s x-projection is within \(z\)'s, satisfying \(x\) N \(z\).  
  - If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(z\) is strictly west of \(x\), and with the vertical condition, this satisfies \(x\) NE \(z\).  

Other relations are impossible:  
- \(x\) cannot be south of \(z\) due to vertical separation.  
- \(x\) cannot be east (\(x\) E \(z\)) because it requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which conflicts with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
- Similarly, relations like SE, SW, NW, W, B, or S are excluded by the vertical and horizontal constraints derived.  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N and NE.  

**Answer: N, NE**
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints derived:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- Region \(y\) is W of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy the combined spatial constraints. After analysis, the feasible cardinal direction relations are:

1. **B (bounding box)**: The bounding box of \(z\) contains that of \(x\).  
   Example: Non-degenerate regions can be configured where \(z\)'s bounding box encloses \(x\)'s, satisfying all constraints.

2. **N (north)**: \(x\) is north of \(z\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Example: Vertical alignment with \(x\) above \(z\) and horizontal span within \(z\)'s bounds.

3. **NE (northeast)**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Example: \(x\) positioned above and to the right of \(z\).

4. **E (east)**: \(x\) is east of \(z\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Example: \(x\) to the right of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s span.

5. **W (west)**: \(x\) is west of \(z\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Example: \(x\) to the left of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\)'s span.

6. **NW (northwest)**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Example: \(x\) above and to the left of \(z\).

The relations **S (south)**, **SE (southeast)**, and **SW (southwest)** are **impossible** due to vertical contradictions when ensuring non-degenerate (2D) regions. Specifically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) cannot hold without degeneracy, as the constraints force \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), leading to \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) only if all vertical bounds collapse, violating the requirement for regions to be homeomorphic to a disk.

Thus, the possible relations are: **B, N, NE, E, W, NW**.
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the east and north of \(y\).

- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the east of \(z\) and vertically within the bounds of \(z\).

### Analysis of \(x\) relative to \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relation**:  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(z)\), satisfying the horizontal condition for \(x\) being east of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation**:  
   From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \geq \inf_y(z)\).  
   - **Case 1**: If \(\inf_y(x) \geq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely north of \(z\). Combined with the horizontal condition, this gives \(x\) **NE** \(z\).  
   - **Case 2**: If \(\inf_y(x) < \sup_y(z)\), then:  
     - If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), the vertical bounds of \(x\) are within \(z\) (since \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) is already true from \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). Combined with the horizontal condition, this gives \(x\) **E** \(z\).  
     - If \(\sup_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\), no defined cardinal direction relation holds (as the vertical overlap is not covered by the relations B, N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW).

Given regions in **REG** (homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, ensuring non-degenerate 2D regions), the valid possible relations are **NE** and **E**. Examples confirm these:
- **NE example**: \(z\) ([0,10]×[0,10]), \(y\) ([11,20]×[0,10]), \(x\) ([21,30]×[11,20]) → \(x\) NE \(z\).  
- **E example**: \(z\) ([-100,50]×[0,100]), \(y\) ([60,110]×[40,60]), \(x\) ([110,200]×[70,80]) → \(x\) E \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.

**Answer: NE, E**
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the east of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the north of \(y\))

- \(y\) S \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the south of \(z\))
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., the \(x\)-projection of \(y\) is within the \(x\)-projection of \(z\))

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but no direct constraint between \(\inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z)\).
   - However, to satisfy the relations and avoid configurations that do not fit any cardinal direction, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) must hold (otherwise, horizontal overlap may occur, leading to no valid cardinal relation). Thus, \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
   - From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) start above \(\sup_y(y)\), but their vertical positions relative to each other are unconstrained. Possible cases:
     - \(z\) is entirely south of \(x\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(x\) is **NE** of \(z\).
     - \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) → \(x\) is **SE** of \(z\).
     - The \(y\)-projection of \(x\) is contained within \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(x\) is **E** of \(z\).

Given \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and the vertical possibilities, the relations between \(x\) and \(z\) can be:
- **NE** (if \(z\) is south of \(x\))
- **SE** (if \(x\) is south of \(z\))
- **E** (if \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\))

Other relations (N, S, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and lack of vertical containment or alignment required by those relations.

Thus, the possible relations are **NE**, **SE**, and **E**.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) means \(x\) is northeast of \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) NW \(z\) means \(y\) is northwest of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, we derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical relation**:  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), implying \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), so vertically, \(x\) is north of \(z\).

2. **Horizontal relation**:  
   \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) NE \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) NW \(z\)). Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(\sup_x(y)\), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary:
   - **Case 1: \(z\) entirely left of \(x\)** (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)):  
     Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\) (since \(z\) is left and below \(x\), so \(x\) is northeast of \(z\)).
   - **Case 2: \(x\) entirely left of \(z\)** (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)):  
     Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) NW \(z\) (since \(z\) is right and below \(x\), so \(x\) is northwest of \(z\)).
   - **Case 3: Horizontal overlap with containment of \(x\) in \(z\)**:  
     If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal span of \(x\) contained in \(z\)), and given \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\) (north relation: \(z\) below \(x\) and horizontal containment).

Configurations exist for all three cases without degeneracy, and no other relations (e.g., SE, S, E, W, SW, B) are possible under the constraints. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, and NW.

**Possible relations**: N, NE, NW
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (y is left of x)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is below x)
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is below z)

The relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their relative positions, constrained only by both being northeast of \(y\) and \(y\) being southwest of \(z\). This allows various configurations:

- **N**: \(x\) is north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,2), \(z\) at (1,1), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **NE**: \(x\) is northeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (2,2), \(z\) at (1,1), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **E**: \(x\) is east of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (2,0), \(z\) at (1,0), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **SE**: \(x\) is southeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (2,1), \(z\) at (1,2), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **S**: \(x\) is south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,1), \(z\) at (1,2), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **SW**: \(x\) is southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,1), \(z\) at (2,2), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **W**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,0), \(z\) at (2,0), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **NW**: \(x\) is northwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) at (1,2), \(z\) at (2,1), \(y\) at (0,0))
- **B**: \(x\) has a bounding box inside \(z\)'s (e.g., \(y\) at [0,1]×[0,1], \(x\) at [2,3]×[2,3], \(z\) at [1,4]×[1,4])

All nine cardinal direction relations are possible between \(x\) and \(z\).

**Possible relations**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is north of y)

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (y is east of z)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z)

Chaining these:

1. **Horizontal direction (x-axis):**
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from y SE z)
   - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from x NE y)
   - Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - This means \(x\) is always east of \(z\) horizontally.

2. **Vertical direction (y-axis):**
   - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from x NE y)
   - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from y SE z)
   - The relative vertical position of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
     - **Case 1:** \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(x\) is north of \(z\) → **NE relation**.
     - **Case 2:** \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) → \(x\) is south of \(z\) → **SE relation**.
     - **Case 3:** \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\) → **E relation**.

Given the horizontal constraint (east), only relations with an east component are possible: NE, E, SE. Examples exist for each:
- **NE**: When \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
- **E**: When \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds.
- **SE**: When \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).

Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) violate the horizontal east constraint or vertical possibilities.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, E, SE**.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, if region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, the relation between x and z must be NE.

- x NE y implies that supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- y NE z implies that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Chaining these inequalities:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

This satisfies the definition of x NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

No other cardinal direction relations (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible, as the inequalities strictly enforce that x is northeast of z.

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- \(y\) B \(z\) implies \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by analyzing the bounding box constraints. Examples confirm the following relations are possible:

- **B (bounding box)**: When \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(z\).  
  Example: \(y = [2,3] \times [2,3]\), \(x = [4,5] \times [4,5]\), \(z = [1,6] \times [1,6]\). Here, \(x\) is NE of \(y\), \(y\) is B of \(z\), and \(x\) is B of \(z\).
- **N (North)**: When \(x\) is above \(z\) and horizontally within its bounds.  
  Example: \(y = [1,2] \times [1,2]\), \(x = [2.5,3.5] \times [3,4]\), \(z = [0,4] \times [0,2.5]\). Here, \(x\) is NE of \(y\), \(y\) is B of \(z\), and \(x\) is N of \(z\).
- **NE (North East)**: When \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\).  
  Example: \(y = [1,2] \times [1,2]\), \(x = [3,4] \times [3,4]\), \(z = [0,2.5] \times [0,2.5]\). Here, \(x\) is NE of \(y\), \(y\) is B of \(z\), and \(x\) is NE of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: When \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) and vertically within its bounds.  
  Example: \(y = [1,2] \times [1,2]\), \(x = [3,4] \times [3,4]\), \(z = [0,2.5] \times [0,4.5]\). Here, \(x\) is NE of \(y\), \(y\) is B of \(z\), and \(x\) is E of \(z\).

Other relations (S, SE, SW, W, NW) are not possible due to the constraints:
- \(x\) is always above \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be below \(z\) (ruling out S, SE, SW).
- \(x\) is always to the right of \(y\) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be to the left of \(z\) (ruling out W, NW).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are B, N, NE, and E.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: Based on the given conditions and the definitions of cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is \(B\) of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is \(N\) of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\)
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)

Combining these:
- **Y-axis constraints**:
  - \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\))
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
- **X-axis constraints**:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\))
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\))
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) N \(z\))
  - Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)

These combined constraints satisfy the definition of \(x\) being \(N\) of \(z\):
- \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (y-axis condition)
- \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\) (x-axis conditions)

All other cardinal relations (NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to contradictions in the constraints (e.g., requiring zero width/height or violating the derived inequalities). Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is \(N\).

**Answer: N**
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: Given that region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is W (West).

### Explanation:
- **x B y** means that the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- **y W z** means that y is to the west of z:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
  - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

These inequalities satisfy the definition of **x W z**:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) are possible, as they would require additional conditions (e.g., specific vertical alignments or containments) that conflict with the given constraints. For example:
- **B** would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), but infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z) implies infx(z) ≤ infx(x) only if equality holds, which is impossible for regions with positive area.
- **SW** would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) implies supy(x) ≥ infy(z), making supy(x) ≤ infy(z) impossible.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.

\boxed{\text{W}}
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Based on the definitions and the given relations \(x \text{ B } y\) and \(y \text{ E } z\), the following inequalities hold:

- From \(x \text{ B } y\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- From \(y \text{ E } z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **x-coordinate relation**:
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning the entire x-interval of \(z\) is left of the x-interval of \(x\).

2. **y-coordinate relation**:
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning the y-interval of \(x\) is contained within the y-interval of \(z\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) must satisfy:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (x entirely to the right of \(z\))
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (y-overlap where \(x\)'s y-interval is inside \(z\)'s)

Checking the possible cardinal direction relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):

- **E (East)**: Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). All conditions are satisfied.
- **NE (North East)**: Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). However, \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) would imply \(\inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x) = \sup_y(z)\), contradicting the positive area of regions in REG. Thus, NE is impossible.
- **SE (South East)**: Requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). But \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) would imply \(\inf_y(z) = \inf_y(x) = \sup_y(x)\), again contradicting positive area. Thus, SE is impossible.
- Other relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, B) do not satisfy \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) or the y-conditions.

Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **E**.

**Answer: E**
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(y\), so:
  \[
  \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x), \quad \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y), \quad \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x), \quad \sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y).
  \]
- \(y \text{ S } z\) means \(y\) is directly south of \(z\), so:
  \[
  \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z), \quad \inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y), \quad \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z).
  \]

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: 
  \[
  \inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x), \quad \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z),
  \]
  so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x \text{ S } z\):
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\),
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation is possible:
- **B (bounding box)**: Requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x) \geq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\), with equality only if degenerate (not allowed for regions homeomorphic to a disk). Thus, B is impossible.
- **SW, SE, W, E, NW, NE, N**: Require conditions like \(x\) being west, east, or north of \(z\), which contradict the horizontal containment and vertical south relation derived.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **S**.

**Answer: S**
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is \(B\) of region \(y\):  
  This means the bounding box of \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(y\). Specifically:  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally contained).  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (vertically contained).  

- Region \(y\) is \(NW\) of region \(z\):  
  This means \(y\) is northwest of \(z\), so:  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (\(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\)).  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (\(y\) is entirely above \(z\)).  

To determine possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):  

1. **Horizontal relation (x-axis):**  
   From \(x\) \(B\) \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) \(NW\) \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).  

2. **Vertical relation (y-axis):**  
   From \(x\) \(B\) \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(y\) \(NW\) \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).  

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) being \(NW\) of \(z\):  
- \(a\) \(NW\) \(b\) if and only if \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).  

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., \(N\), \(W\), \(B\), etc.) is possible:  
- The horizontal constraint forces \(x\) left of \(z\), eliminating \(E\), \(SE\), \(NE\), and \(B\) (which requires \(z\) to contain \(x\) horizontally).  
- The vertical constraint forces \(z\) below \(x\), eliminating \(S\), \(SW\), \(SE\), and \(B\) (which requires \(z\) to contain \(x\) vertically).  
- Relations like \(W\) or \(N\) require additional constraints not satisfied (e.g., \(W\) requires vertical alignment within \(z\), which conflicts with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implying \(x\) is above \(z\)).  

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is \(NW\).  

**Answer: NW**
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given relations:

- **x B y**: The bounding box of y contains the bounding box of x.  
  This implies:  
  - `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (x is horizontally within y).  
  - `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)` and `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (x is vertically within y).  

- **y SW z**: y is entirely southwest of z.  
  This implies:  
  - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y is strictly left of z).  
  - `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y is strictly below z).  

Combining these:  
- From `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (from x B y) and `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (from y SW z), we get `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`.  
- From `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (from x B y) and `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (from y SW z), we get `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`.  

The conditions `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)` satisfy the definition of **x SW z**.  

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is **SW**.  

**Answer: SW**
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies that \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(y\), so:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies that \(y\) is southeast of \(z\), so:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **X-axis relations**:
   - From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)

2. **Y-axis relations**:
   - From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
   - From \(y\) SE \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (east condition)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (south condition)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) satisfies both axis constraints simultaneously, as they require conflicting bounds (e.g., E requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) but also \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which is not necessarily true here). Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SE.

**Answer**: SE
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) implies that region \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of region \(y\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ NE } z\) implies that region \(y\) is northeast of region \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(z\) is south of \(y\))

Combining these:

- From \(y \text{ NE } z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(x \text{ B } y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus:
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) → \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) → \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)

These conditions match the definition of \(x \text{ NE } z\):
- \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) is west of \(x\))
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(z\) is south of \(x\))

No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is satisfied under these constraints, as they require additional spatial relationships that are not guaranteed. For example:
- \(x \text{ E } z\) would require \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), but \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) implies \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) is impossible if \(y\)-coordinates of \(x\) are above \(z\).
- Similarly, other relations fail due to mismatched horizontal or vertical bounds.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **NE**.

**Answer: NE**
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: The relation B (bounding box) is transitive based on the given definitions. If region x is B of region y, then the minimum bounding box of x is entirely within the minimum bounding box of y. Similarly, if region y is B of region z, then the minimum bounding box of y is entirely within the minimum bounding box of z. Therefore, the minimum bounding box of x must be entirely within the minimum bounding box of z, meaning x is B of z.

No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW) are possible because:
- For any other relation (e.g., S, SW, etc.), the conditions would require x to be partially or fully outside z's bounding box, which contradicts the transitivity of the B relation.
- Specifically, regions in REG have positive extent (since they are homeomorphic to closed disks), so strict inequalities in the bounding box coordinates prevent equality cases that might allow other relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is B.

B
