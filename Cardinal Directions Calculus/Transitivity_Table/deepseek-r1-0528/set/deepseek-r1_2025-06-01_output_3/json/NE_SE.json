{"prompt": "Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?", "answer": "Based on the given cardinal direction relations:\n\n- \\(x\\) is NE of \\(y\\) implies:\n  - \\(\\sup_x(y) \\leq \\inf_x(x)\\) (x is east of y)\n  - \\(\\sup_y(y) \\leq \\inf_y(x)\\) (x is north of y)\n\n- \\(y\\) is SE of \\(z\\) implies:\n  - \\(\\sup_x(z) \\leq \\inf_x(y)\\) (y is east of z)\n  - \\(\\sup_y(y) \\leq \\inf_y(z)\\) (y is south of z)\n\nChaining these:\n\n1. **Horizontal direction (x-axis):**\n   - \\(\\sup_x(z) \\leq \\inf_x(y)\\) (from y SE z)\n   - \\(\\sup_x(y) \\leq \\inf_x(x)\\) (from x NE y)\n   - Combining: \\(\\sup_x(z) \\leq \\inf_x(y) \\leq \\sup_x(y) \\leq \\inf_x(x)\\) \u2192 \\(\\sup_x(z) \\leq \\inf_x(x)\\)\n   - This means \\(x\\) is always east of \\(z\\) horizontally.\n\n2. **Vertical direction (y-axis):**\n   - \\(\\sup_y(y) \\leq \\inf_y(x)\\) (from x NE y)\n   - \\(\\sup_y(y) \\leq \\inf_y(z)\\) (from y SE z)\n   - The relative vertical position of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) can vary:\n     - **Case 1:** \\(\\sup_y(z) \\leq \\inf_y(x)\\) \u2192 \\(x\\) is north of \\(z\\) \u2192 **NE relation**.\n     - **Case 2:** \\(\\sup_y(x) \\leq \\inf_y(z)\\) \u2192 \\(x\\) is south of \\(z\\) \u2192 **SE relation**.\n     - **Case 3:** \\(\\inf_y(z) \\leq \\inf_y(x)\\) and \\(\\sup_y(x) \\leq \\sup_y(z)\\) \u2192 \\(x\\) is vertically contained within \\(z\\) \u2192 **E relation**.\n\nGiven the horizontal constraint (east), only relations with an east component are possible: NE, E, SE.
