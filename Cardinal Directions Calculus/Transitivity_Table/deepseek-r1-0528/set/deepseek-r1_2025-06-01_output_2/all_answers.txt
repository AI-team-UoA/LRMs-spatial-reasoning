For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) in the y-direction),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., the x-projection of \(x\) is contained within the x-projection of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is N of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(y\) in the y-direction),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., the x-projection of \(y\) is contained within the x-projection of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- **Y-direction**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

- **X-direction**:  
  From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  Chaining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning the x-projection of \(x\) is contained within the x-projection of \(z\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being N of \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is necessarily satisfied under these constraints, as they require additional conditions (e.g., specific alignments or non-overlapping projections in the x-direction) that are not guaranteed by the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **N**.

**Answer: N**
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the constraints on their bounding boxes.

- From \(x\) N \(y\):
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(x\) is above \(y\)).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is within the x-range of \(y\)).
- From \(y\) W \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(z\)).
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is within the y-range of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- Vertically: 
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from N and W constraints), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - The relation between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z)\) determines the vertical alignment.

Two scenarios are possible:
1. **W (West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-range. Combined with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies the definition of W.
2. **NW (North West)**: If \(\inf_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely above \(z\). With \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies NW.

Other relations are not possible:
- N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, B do not hold due to the horizontal left constraint and vertical dependencies.
- The case where \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\) does not fit any atomic relation, but scenarios exist where either W or NW holds exclusively.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW** and **W**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{NW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}}
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\) vertically),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(y\) horizontally),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(y\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box).

Combining these constraints:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).
- Vertically: 
  - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_y(z)\) relative to \(\inf_y(x)\):
1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
   - \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.
   - Combined with horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), this satisfies the conditions for \(x\) being **NE** of \(z\):
     - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal: \(z\) left of \(x\)),
     - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical: \(z\) below \(x\)).
   
2. **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\)**  
   - Here, \(z\) extends vertically to at least the bottom of \(x\).
   - Additionally, from constraints, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) holds.
   - For \(x\) to be **E** of \(z\), the vertical span of \(x\) must be contained in \(z\)'s vertical span: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). If this holds:
     - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal: \(z\) left of \(x\)),
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment).
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) being **E** of \(z\).

No other cardinal relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, SE, B) are possible under the given constraints and region properties (closed, connected, with connected boundaries). Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.

**Final Answer: NE, E**
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is north of region \(y\) (denoted \(x \text{ N } y\)) and region \(y\) is south of region \(z\) (denoted \(y \text{ S } z\)), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are N (North), S (South), and B (bounding box containment).

- **N (North)**: \(x\) can be north of \(z\) if \(z\) is positioned such that the top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) can be south of \(z\) if \(z\) is positioned such that the top of \(x\) is at or below the bottom of \(z\).
- **B (bounding box containment)**: \(x\) can have its bounding box contained within the bounding box of \(z\) if \(z\)'s bounding box encloses \(x\)'s both horizontally and vertically.

These relations are possible under the given constraints, as the horizontal bounding box of \(x\) is always within the horizontal bounding box of \(z\) due to the chaining of the relations \(x \text{ N } y\) and \(y \text{ S } z\). Other relations (e.g., NE, E, SE, NW, W, SW) are not possible because they require horizontal separation, which is not satisfied here.

Thus, the possible relations are N, S, and B.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): This implies \(x\) is directly above \(y\), so:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (the top of \(y\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): This implies \(y\) is above and to the left of \(z\), so:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (the right edge of \(y\) is at or left of the left edge of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (the top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)).

Combining these:
- **Horizontally**: 
  - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
  - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).

- **Vertically**:
  - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
  - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) being **NW** of \(z\):
- \(a\) NW \(b\) iff \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously:
- Other relations either conflict with \(x\) being left of \(z\) or \(z\) being below \(x\) (e.g., NE would require \(x\) right of \(z\), SW would require \(x\) below \(z\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **NW**.

**Answer: NW**
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW. This is derived from the constraints imposed by the relations:

- From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- From y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

These inequalities imply that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is entirely to the west of z. The y-coordinate constraints allow for three scenarios:
- If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is NW of z.
- If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is W of z.
- If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is SW of z.

All other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are impossible due to the west positioning and the specific y-coordinate bounds.

Thus, the possible relations are NW, W, and SW.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is within the bounds of \(y\))

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(z\) is entirely left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is entirely below \(z\))

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Horizontally**: From \(y\) SE \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\). From \(x\) N \(y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\). This rules out relations requiring \(x\) to be left of \(z\) (W, NW, SW) or horizontally overlapping without specific vertical alignment (N, S, B).

2. **Vertically**: The vertical position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) can vary:
   - If \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), then \(x\) is **NE** of \(z\) (satisfies NE: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
   - If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is **SE** of \(z\) (satisfies SE: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
   - If \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is **E** of \(z\) (satisfies E: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

These three cases are mutually exclusive and cover all possible atomic relations given the constraints. Examples can be constructed for each (e.g., specific bounding box arrangements satisfying \(x\) N \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) while achieving NE, SE, or E between \(x\) and \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **NE, SE, E**.
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: Given the cardinal direction relations:
- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\): 
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., the top of \(y\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\): 
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., the right of \(z\) is at or to the left of the left of \(y\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., the top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)).

Combining these:
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning the entire \(z\) is to the left of \(x\).
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - Since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (by bounding box properties), we have \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning the entire \(z\) is below \(x\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of the NE relation: \(x\) is NE of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible because:
- N requires \(x\) to be horizontally within \(z\), but \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\).
- E requires \(x\) to be vertically within \(z\), but \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
- Other relations (e.g., SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are incompatible with \(z\) being left and below \(x\).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE.

**Answer**: NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\),
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\),
  - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).

- \(y\) is B of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\),
  - \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\),
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\),
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).

Chaining these inequalities:

1. \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) → \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).
2. \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) → \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).
3. \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) → \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).
4. \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), and since \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), we have \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \min(\text{infy}(x), \text{supy}(z))\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{supy}(z)\) and \(\text{infy}(x)\):

- **Case 1: \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)**  
  Then:
  - \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (satisfies the y-condition for N),
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) (satisfy the x-conditions for N).  
  Thus, \(x\) **N** \(z\).

- **Case 2: \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\)**  
  Then the y-intervals overlap partially. For \(x\) to be B of \(z\), we additionally need \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\). If this holds:
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\),
  - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\),
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\),
  - \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) **B** \(z\).

Other relations (NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW) are impossible because:
- The x-interval of \(x\) is nested within \(z\) (contradicting E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW).
- The y-position of \(x\) starts above \(z\)'s bottom and may extend above \(z\)'s top (contradicting S, SW, SE, etc.).
- Specific conditions for these relations (e.g., \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) for E) are violated by the nested x-intervals.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **B**.

**Answer: N, B**
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Chaining horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) in \(x\) W \(y\)), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) requires:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\): \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\): \(z\) is below \(x\), meaning \(x\) is above \(z\).

Checking the definitions:
- **NW** relation: \(a\) NW \(b\) iff \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).  
  Here, \(a = x\), \(b = z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) holds.  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) holds.  

No other relations satisfy both conditions simultaneously:
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but we have \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which is incompatible.
- **W** requires vertical containment (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), contradicted by \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **N** requires horizontal containment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), not \(\leq\).
- Other relations (S, E, SE, NE, B) fail due to mismatched horizontal or vertical constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NW.

**Answer: NW**
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, if region \(x\) is W of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is W. This is determined by the constraints:

- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Chaining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These satisfy the definition of W: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) are excluded due to:
- Horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) conflicting with E, NE, SE.
- Vertical constraints requiring non-degenerate bounding boxes (preventing N, S, NW, SW).
- Bounding box conditions not met for B.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

The relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their relative horizontal and vertical positions, considering both are constrained to the left of \(y\) horizontally and within \(y\)'s vertical bounds. All nine cardinal direction relations are possible:

- **N (North)**: If \(x\) is above \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **NE (North East)**: If \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: If \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **SE (South East)**: If \(x\) is below and to the right of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: If \(x\) is contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.

Examples exist for each case, satisfying the initial constraints. Thus, all relations are possible.

**Possible relations**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these for \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Y-axis analysis**:
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - This implies \(x\) is below \(z\), so possible relations are S, SW, or SE.

2. **X-axis analysis**:
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - Two cases for \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\):
     - **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
       - Then \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\), and with \(x\) below \(z\), this matches **SW**.
     - **Case 2**: \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
       - Here, the x-intervals overlap partially.
       - For \(x\) to be S of \(z\), we need \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
         - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) holds (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
         - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then **S** holds.
       - If \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\), no cardinal relation fits (e.g., not SW, SE, or others), but regions in REG (homeomorphic to closed disk) and bounding box constraints ensure \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is possible and required for S in this case.
       - Thus, only **S** is possible when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

   SE is not possible because it requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), and equality (degenerate) is excluded for REG.

**Conclusion**: The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** (Case 1) and **S** (Case 2 with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).

**Answer: SW, S**
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **W** of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is **NW** of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

### Analysis:
1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   From \(x\) **W** \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) **NW** \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (by definition of bounds), combining:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is strictly to the west of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   From \(x\) **W** \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(y\) **NW** \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), so \(x\) is to the north of \(z\).

### Conclusion:
- The combined relation is **NW** (North West), as:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (west component) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (north component).  
- No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., N, W, SW) is satisfied under the constraints, as they require additional conditions that do not hold (e.g., specific bounding box alignments not enforced here).

**Possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\): NW**
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) W \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Chaining these constraints:

1. **X-coordinate constraint**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. **Y-coordinate constraint**:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of the SW (South West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

- \(x\) SW \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, NW, W, B) satisfies both constraints simultaneously under the given conditions. For example:
- **W requires** \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which is not necessarily true (e.g., if \(\inf_y(x) = 4\) and \(\inf_y(z) = 6\)).
- **S requires** \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), with equality only in degenerate cases (excluded for regions in REG).

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.

**Answer: SW**
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is W of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- The vertical constraint from \(x\) W \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) ensures that \(supy(x) \leq infy(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\).
- Horizontally, three scenarios are possible:
  1. If \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (\(supx(x) \leq infx(z)\)), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).
  2. If \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (\(supx(z) \leq infx(x)\)), then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).
  3. If the horizontal interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\) (\(infx(z) \leq infx(x)\) and \(supx(x) \leq supx(z)\)), then \(x\) is S of \(z\).

These scenarios are mutually exclusive and cover all possible horizontal alignments given the constraints. Thus, the possible relations are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer: SW, S, SE**
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is NE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these constraints:

1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.

2. **Horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are west of \(y\):
     - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
     - From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - The relative horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
     - **Case 1**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
       - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) NW \(z\).
     - **Case 2**: \(z\) is west of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
       - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) NE \(z\).
     - **Case 3**: Horizontal overlap (neither \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) nor \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) holds, but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
       - This means \(z\)'s bounding box horizontally contains \(x\)'s.
       - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N**, **NE**, and **NW**. These cover all scenarios derived from the constraints.

**Answer: N, NE, NW**
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining the inequalities:

1. **X-axis constraints**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   This implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but the relationship between \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) can vary.

2. **Y-axis constraints**:  
   \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

- **Case 1: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
  This satisfies the condition for \(x\) W \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Thus, **W** is possible.

- **Case 2: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (so \(\sup_x(x) > \inf_x(z)\)) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
  Here:  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)),  
  and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This satisfies the condition for \(x\) B \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Thus, **B** is possible.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW) are not possible:
- **N, S, E**: Require specific non-overlapping conditions on one axis (e.g., \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for S, or \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) for E), which conflict with the combined constraints (e.g., \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) rule out S and N; \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) do not support \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) for E).
- **Diagonal relations (NE, SE, SW, NW)**: Require non-overlapping on both axes (e.g., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for SW), but the y-axis constraints (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)) prevent the necessary vertical separation.

Thus, the only possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **W** and **B**.

**Answer: W, B**
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From these constraints:  
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This satisfies the vertical condition for \(x\) being north of \(z\) (as \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). However, the relationship between \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z)\) determines the horizontal condition.

Possible cases:  
1. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   - The horizontal condition for \(x\) NE \(z\) is satisfied: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - Thus, \(x\) NE \(z\) is possible.  
2. **If \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   - The horizontal condition for \(x\) N \(z\) is satisfied: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), along with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - Thus, \(x\) N \(z\) is possible.  

Other relations (e.g., E, SE, S, etc.) are not possible due to violations in vertical or horizontal constraints:  
- \(x\) E \(z\) requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and vertical conditions that conflict (since \(x\) is above \(z\)).  
- \(x\) SE \(z\) requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(x\) below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(z\).  
- \(x\) S \(z\) requires \(x\) below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(z\).  
- Similarly, W, NW, SW, and B are ruled out due to horizontal or vertical mismatches.  

The case where \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\) does not fit any base relation (due to lack of horizontal containment for N and insufficient western separation for NE), but it does not yield a new valid base relation. Only N and NE are achievable under the given constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N and NE**.
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(y\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **E (East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Example: \(y\) has \(x\)-interval \([0, 10]\), \(z\) has \([10, 14]\), \(x\) has \([15, 20]\). Then \(x\) E \(z\).
2. **W (West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Example: \(y\) has \([0, 10]\), \(x\) has \([10, 14]\), \(z\) has \([15, 20]\). Then \(x\) W \(z\).
3. **B (Bounding box)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (with the \(y\)-conditions already satisfied).
   - Example: \(y\) has \([0, 10]\), \(z\) has \([10, 20]\), \(x\) has \([12, 15]\). Then \(x\) B \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- **S, SW, SE, N, NW, NE**: Require vertical separation (e.g., \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) or \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), but the \(y\)-constraints force \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s span, preventing pure vertical or diagonal relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **E, W, B**.
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- If region \(x\) is E of region \(y\), then:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- If region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), then:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), leading to \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - Combining:
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
     - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of \(x\) being E of \(z\). Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, B) do not hold due to violations in horizontal or vertical constraints (e.g., insufficient horizontal overlap for B, vertical misalignment for S/N, or conflicting bounds for diagonal relations).

Thus, the only possible relation is **E**.
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(x\), with the vertical span of \(x\) contained within that of \(y\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(y\) is entirely below \(z\), with the horizontal span of \(y\) contained within that of \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)), meaning \(z\) starts west of \(x\).
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)), so \(\inf_x(x)\) is at least \(\sup_x(y)\).

The possible horizontal scenarios are:
1. **Horizontal containment of \(x\) within \(z\)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is directly below \(z\) with horizontal containment, satisfying \(x\) S \(z\).
2. **No horizontal overlap, \(x\) east of \(z\)**: If \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the east and below \(z\), satisfying \(x\) SE \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- \(B\), \(N\), \(NE\), \(NW\), \(W\), \(SW\), \(E\): These require vertical or horizontal conditions not met (e.g., \(x\) cannot be north, inside, or west of \(z\) due to vertical separation and horizontal alignment).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S** and **SE**.

**Final Answer: S, SE**
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(y\)),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (i.e., \(y\)'s y-interval contains \(x\)'s y-interval vertically).
- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(y\)).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the right of \(y\) (\(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **N (North)**: If \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (satisfied vertically) and \(z\)'s x-interval contains \(x\)'s x-interval horizontally. This occurs when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- **NE (North East)**: If \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\). This requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) left of \(x\)) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied vertically).
- **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\). This requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (entire \(x\) left of \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied vertically).

These are the only possible relations, as other directions (E, SE, S, SW, W, B) are incompatible with \(z\) being entirely below \(x\) and the horizontal constraints.

Possible relations: **N, NE, NW**
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).
- Horizontally, both \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal projection of \(x\) contained within \(z\)), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (already satisfied).  
   *Example*: \(y\) has bbox \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) has \([1,2] \times [0.2,0.8]\), \(z\) has \([1,3] \times [2,3]\). Then \(x\) is S of \(z\).

2. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (entirely west) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (satisfied).  
   *Example*: \(y\) has \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) has \([1,1.5] \times [0.2,0.8]\), \(z\) has \([1.6,3] \times [2,3]\). Then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).

3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entirely east) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (satisfied).  
   *Example*: \(y\) has \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) has \([2.5,3] \times [0.2,0.8]\), \(z\) has \([1.5,2.4] \times [2,3]\). Then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).

Other relations (N, NE, E, W, NW, B) are impossible because:
- \(x\) is below \(z\) vertically, ruling out N, NE, E, NW, W (which require north, east, or west overlaps without south).
- B requires \(z\)'s bbox contains \(x\)'s, but \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y)\) do not guarantee \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and vertical separation violates containment.

Thus, the possible relations are **S, SW, SE**.
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is SE (South East).

### Explanation:
- From y SE z: 
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
- From x E y:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (y is to the left of x)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of y is at or below the bottom of x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (the top of x is at or below the top of y)

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is to the left of x).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) satisfy the definition of SE (South East) for the relation between x and z. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible given the constraints and the requirement that regions are in REG (closed, connected, with connected boundaries).

Thus, the only possible relation is SE.

\boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), implying \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
- Also, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) holds under these constraints, as they require additional or conflicting bounds that are not met.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **NE**.
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Vertical constraints**:  
   From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), satisfying the vertical condition for both B and E relations between \(x\) and \(z\).

2. **Horizontal constraints**:  
   - From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   This gives \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) or \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\), depending on \(\sup_x(z)\).

Two cases arise for the horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

- **Case 1: \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\)**  
  Here, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) holds, satisfying the horizontal condition for E. Combined with the vertical constraints, \(x\) is E of \(z\).

- **Case 2: \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\)**  
  Here, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) holds. If additionally \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then the horizontal condition for B is satisfied. Combined with the vertical constraints, \(x\) is B of \(z\). If \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\), no defined cardinal direction relation holds under the given 9 relations, but this case does not yield a new valid relation beyond B or E in the composition.

After evaluating all possibilities, the valid relations that can occur between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **E**. No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW) are possible due to contradictions in their defining conditions with the given constraints.

**Possible relations: B, E**
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South), N (North), and B (bounding box). These relations arise due to the horizontal containment derived from the given conditions and the vertical positioning relative to y.

- **x S z (x is South of z)**: This is possible if x is vertically below z, satisfying the conditions derived from the horizontal alignment and vertical constraints.
- **x N z (x is North of z)**: This is possible if x is vertically above z, based on the relative vertical positions and horizontal containment.
- **x B z (x is within the bounding box of z)**: This is possible if z's bounding box contains x's bounding box both horizontally and vertically, which is consistent with the horizontal containment and possible vertical overlap or containment.

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., SW, W, NW, NE, E, SE) are possible because the horizontal conditions derived from x S y and y N z imply that x is horizontally within z's bounding box (i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), which prevents any diagonal or perpendicular relations that require horizontal misalignment.

Thus, the possible relations are S, N, and B.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

From these, the following inequalities are derived:
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) → \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal separation, \(x\) left of \(z\))
2. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
3. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x)\):
- **Case 1:** If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is below \(z\) (satisfies SW: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
- **Case 2:** If \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\), then:
  - If \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), then \(z\) covers \(x\) vertically (satisfies W: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).
  - If \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\), no defined atomic relation fits, but this case does not yield any of the 9 relations.

Given the constraints and possible configurations, the achievable atomic relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and W. Other relations (like S, NW, etc.) are not possible due to the derived inequalities and definitions.

Thus, the possible relations are SW and W.
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) S \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\))  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within the x-range of \(y\))  

- From \(y\) E \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(y\))  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is vertically within the y-range of \(z\))  

Combining these:  
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\)).  
- Vertically:  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(x\) S \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\))  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\))  

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\inf_y(x)\) relative to \(\inf_y(z)\):  
1. **Case 1: \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\)**  
   - Then \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) hold.  
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical)  

2. **Case 2: \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\)**  
   - Additionally, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) must hold for a valid cardinal relation.  
   - Then \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).  
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal)  
     - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertical)  

If \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\), the vertical projections overlap, but no cardinal direction relation (as defined) holds because \(x\) is not entirely in one tile relative to \(z\) (e.g., partially in SE and E tiles). However, given the constraints of the regions (homeomorphic to a closed disk) and the relations, this case does not yield a valid cardinal relation among the nine. Thus, it is excluded.  

Other relations (N, NE, S, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the horizontal and vertical constraints derived.  

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are E and SE.  

**Final Answer: SE, E**
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- \(x\) S \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertically, \(x\) is entirely below \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-bounds of \(y\))

- \(y\) S \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is entirely below \(z\))
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is contained within the \(x\)-bounds of \(z\))

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Thus, the relation \(x\) S \(z\) holds because:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (satisfies the vertical condition for S).
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (satisfies the horizontal containment for S).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, B, NW, W, SW) is possible because:
- The vertical condition requires \(x\) to be below \(z\), ruling out N, NE, NW, and B (which would require \(x\) to be above or overlapping vertically).
- The horizontal containment requires \(x\) to be within the \(x\)-bounds of \(z\), ruling out E, W, SE, SW, NE, NW (which require horizontal misalignment).

Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **S**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{S}}
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW. This is determined by the constraints from the given relations:

- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). This means x is south of y and horizontally within the x-range of y.
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y). This means y is northwest of z, so y is left and above z.

Combining these:
- Horizontally, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This implies x is always to the left of z.
- Vertically, both supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), meaning both x and z are below y, but their relative vertical positions can vary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **SW (South West)**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is below and left of z.
- **W (West)**: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x is left of z and vertically within the y-range of z.
- **NW (North West)**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), x is above and left of z.

Other relations are impossible due to the horizontal separation (x left of z) and the lack of vertical alignment required for directions like S, N, E, etc.

Thus, the possible relations are SW, W, and NW.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions and the given relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) is SW of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Chaining these constraints:

1. **Vertical direction (y-axis)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\), we have \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

2. **Horizontal direction (x-axis)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of SW:  
\(x\) is SW of \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) satisfies both constraints simultaneously:
- **S** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (which holds) but also \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which contradict \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (since \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z)\) but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) or equality, violating \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
- **W** requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (holds) but also \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which contradict \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (since \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\), violating \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- Other relations (N, NE, SE, E, NW, B) fail due to mismatched vertical/horizontal constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.

**Answer: SW**
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, the relation between x and z must be SE (South East). This is derived from the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- x S y implies:
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally aligned within y's x-range)

- y SE z implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these:
- From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), it follows that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is to the west of x).

Thus, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) satisfy the definition of x SE z. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible given the constraints and the requirement that regions have area (inf < sup for bounding box edges).

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

**Final Answer:**  
SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- **x S y**: This means region x is entirely south of region y. Specifically:
  - The supremum of the y-coordinates of x is less than or equal to the infimum of the y-coordinates of y: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
  - The x-range of x is contained within the x-range of y: \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- **y NE z**: This means region y is entirely northeast of region z. Specifically:
  - The supremum of the x-coordinates of z is less than or equal to the infimum of the x-coordinates of y: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
  - The supremum of the y-coordinates of z is less than or equal to the infimum of the y-coordinates of y: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, we derive the relationship between x and z:

1. **Horizontal relation**:
   - From **x S y**: \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - From **y NE z**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means z is entirely to the west of x (x is east of z).

2. **Vertical relation**:
   - From **x S y**: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From **y NE z**: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - Both x and z are below y, but their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed. Three cases arise:
     - **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**:  
       z is entirely below x. Combined with the horizontal, x is **NE** (northeast) of z.
     - **Case 2: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:  
       x is entirely below z. Combined with the horizontal, x is **SE** (southeast) of z.
     - **Case 3: Vertical containment of x in z**:  
       \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
       This means x is vertically within the y-range of z. Combined with the horizontal, x is **E** (east) of z.

Other relations are impossible due to the horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)). For example:
- **N**, **S**, **B** require horizontal overlap or containment, which is absent.
- **W**, **NW**, **SW** imply x is west of z, contradicting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **SW**, **NW** are excluded by the horizontal constraint.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **NE**, **E**, and **SE**.

**Answer: NE, E, SE**
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- \(y\) is B of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

### Analysis of \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relations**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning the horizontal projection of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relations**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - However, the relation between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) determines possible cases:
     - **Case 1: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:
       - This satisfies the condition for \(x\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) with horizontal containment.
       - Thus, \(x\) can be S of \(z\).
     - **Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)**:
       - Additionally, if \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), the vertical bounds satisfy \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), with horizontal containment, so \(x\) can be B of \(z\).
       - If \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\), no defined cardinal relation holds (not one of the nine), but this case is possible yet not reportable per the query.

### Possible Relations:
- \(x\) can be **S** of \(z\) (Case 1).
- \(x\) can be **B** of \(z\) (Case 2 with \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\)).

No other cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, SW) are possible due to horizontal containment and vertical constraints.

**Final Answer: S, B**
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) means \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) N \(z\) means \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From \(y\) N \(z\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). Combining with \(x\) NW \(y\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This vertical condition is common to relations where \(x\) is above \(z\), specifically N, NE, and NW.

### Analysis of horizontal conditions:
1. **Case where \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - This satisfies the west condition for NW: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it gives \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **Case where \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\)**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - For \(x\) to satisfy an atomic relation, the x-projection must be contained in \(z\)'s x-interval: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Given \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), if \(\inf_x(x) \geq \inf_x(z)\), then the containment holds.
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it gives \(x\) N \(z\).

The case where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) is impossible under the atomic relations, as it would require \(x\) to span multiple tiles (west and north of \(z\)), violating the atomicity (entire region in one tile).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **NW**: When \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- **N**: When \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(x) \geq \inf_x(z)\).

No other relations (e.g., NE, B, S, etc.) satisfy the conditions derived.

**Final Answer: NW, N**
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- **Horizontal relations**:  
  From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).  
  From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).  
  Chaining: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). This implies \(x\) is west of \(z\), restricting possible relations to W, NW, or SW.

- **Vertical relations**:  
  From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).  
  From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
  Chaining: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).  

  - **Case 1**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\) (satisfies NW definition: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).  
  - **Case 2**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) > \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\) (satisfies W definition: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)).  
  - SW is impossible because \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) would require \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), implying degeneracy (contradiction for non-degenerate regions).

**Possible relations**: NW and W.  
- **NW** occurs when the top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\).  
- **W** occurs when the top of \(z\) is above the bottom of \(x\) and the top of \(x\) is at or below the top of \(z\).  

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, B) are excluded due to horizontal west constraint and vertical incompatibility.

**Answer**: NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. The relations are determined as follows:

- **NW relation (\(x\) NW \(y\))**:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is to the left and above \(y\).

- **E relation (\(y\) E \(z\))**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\) is to the left of \(y\) and vertically overlaps or contains \(y\)'s bounding box.

Combining these:
- Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary:  
  - \(x\) left of \(z\),  
  - \(z\) left of \(x\), or  
  - overlapping horizontally.  
- Vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\) and \(z\) contains \(y\) vertically, so \(z\) can be below \(x\) or overlap vertically with \(x\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **N (North)**: If \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) and horizontally contained within \(x\).  
- **NE (Northeast)**: If \(z\) is below and to the left of \(x\).  
- **NW (Northwest)**: If \(z\) is below and to the right of \(x\).  
- **W (West)**: If \(z\) is to the right of \(x\) and vertically contains \(x\).  
- **E (East)**: If \(z\) is to the left of \(x\) and vertically contains \(x\).  
- **B (Bounding box)**: If \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(z\).

These relations are achievable under specific configurations satisfying the given constraints. Relations like S, SE, SW are not possible due to vertical contradictions from the constraints.

Thus, the possible relations are **N, NE, NW, W, E, B**.  

**Final Answer**:  
N, NE, NW, W, E, B
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible relations between x and z are derived from the constraints:

- From x NW y: 
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely left of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is entirely below x)
- From y S z:
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is entirely below z)
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

Considering these, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **NW**: x is northwest of z (if x is left and above z).
- **B**: x is within the bounding box of z (if x is horizontally and vertically contained within z).
- **SW**: x is southwest of z (if x is left and below z).
- **W**: x is west of z (if x is left of z and vertically within z).
- **S**: x is south of z (if x is below z and horizontally within z).
- **N**: x is north of z (if z is below x and x is horizontally within z).

The relations NE, SE, and E are not possible due to conflicts in horizontal and vertical constraints. Thus, the possible relations are NW, B, SW, W, S, N.

**Answer: NW, B, SW, W, S, N**
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, the cardinal direction relations are defined based on the bounding boxes of the regions. The conditions for each relation are as follows:

- x NW y: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- y NW z: \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

From these, derive the relation between x and z:

1. **x-dimension**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from x NW y)  
   \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from y NW z)  
   Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. **y-dimension**:  
   \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from x NW y)  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from y NW z)  
   Since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of x being NW of z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible, as the derived inequalities are strict and mutually exclusive with other relations due to the positive area of regions in REG (homeomorphic to closed unit disks).

Thus, the possible relation is:
- NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

- **NW (North West)**: This is possible when \(x\) is to the west and north of \(z\). For example, if the bounding boxes are positioned such that \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\), with no vertical overlap.
- **W (West)**: This is possible when \(x\) is directly to the west of \(z\) with vertical containment (i.e., the \(y\)-range of \(x\) is within the \(y\)-range of \(z\)). For example, if \(x\) and \(z\) share the same vertical alignment but \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: This is possible when \(x\) is to the west and south of \(z\). For example, if \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\), with no vertical overlap.

These relations are derived from the inequalities defining the cardinal directions:
- From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) holds, meaning \(x\) is always to the west of \(z\). The vertical relation depends on the relative positions of \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\), leading to the possible cases above.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are impossible due to the west constraint and the requirement that regions have positive area, preventing eastward, vertical, or containment relations.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is north of y)
- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z, so z is north of y)

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Horizontal arrangement** (x-axis):
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are west of \(y\), but their relative positions can vary:
     - \(x\) west of \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
     - \(z\) west of \(x\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)

2. **Vertical arrangement** (y-axis):
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are north of \(y\), but their relative positions can vary:
     - \(x\) north of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
     - \(z\) north of \(x\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these, the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **NE (Northeast)**:  
  Occurs if \(z\) is west of \(x\) and \(z\) is south of \(x\) (so \(x\) is northeast of \(z\)).
- **SE (Southeast)**:  
  Occurs if \(z\) is west of \(x\) and \(x\) is south of \(z\) (so \(x\) is southeast of \(z\)).
- **NW (Northwest)**:  
  Occurs if \(x\) is west of \(z\) and \(x\) is north of \(z\) (so \(x\) is northwest of \(z\)).
- **SW (Southwest)**:  
  Occurs if \(x\) is west of \(z\) and \(x\) is south of \(z\) (so \(x\) is southwest of \(z\)).

These four relations are possible and mutually exclusive. Other relations (B, S, W, N, E) are not possible due to the constraints and lack of containment or alignment.

Thus, the possible relations are **NE, SE, NW, SW**.
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is south of x, so x is north of y)

- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is south of y)

From these:
- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) NW \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is south of x, so x is north of z).

- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(x\) NW \(y\))
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\))
  - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are west of \(y\), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible horizontal scenarios:
1. **\(x\) is west of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) NW \(z\).
2. **\(z\) is west of \(x\)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).
3. **Horizontal containment**: The horizontal extent of \(x\) is within that of \(z\) (i.e., \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\))
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) N \(z\).

Given that \(x\) must be north of \(z\) vertically, and the horizontal relations can lead to NW, NE, or N, the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N, NW, NE**.

**Final Answer: \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{NW}} \boxed{\text{NE}}**
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: Given the cardinal direction relations where region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box constraints as follows:

- **NW (North West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) in the x-axis and \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) in the y-axis. Specifically, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  Example: \(x\) in \([0, 1] \times [5, 6]\), \(y\) in \([2, 4] \times [2, 4]\), \(z\) in \([1, 5] \times [1, 5]\). Here, \(x\) is NW of \(y\) and \(y\) is B of \(z\), leading to \(x\) NW \(z\).

- **W (West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) in the x-axis, and \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\) in the y-axis. Specifically, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Example: \(x\) in \([0, 1] \times [4.5, 4.6]\), \(y\) in \([2, 4] \times [2, 4]\), \(z\) in \([1, 5] \times [1, 5]\). Here, \(x\) is NW of \(y\) and \(y\) is B of \(z\), leading to \(x\) W \(z\).

- **N (North)**: This occurs when \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) in the y-axis, and \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\) in the x-axis. Specifically, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  Example: \(x\) in \([2, 3] \times [4, 5]\), \(y\) in \([2, 4] \times [2, 4]\), \(z\) in \([1, 4] \times [1, 3]\). Here, \(x\) is NW of \(y\) and \(y\) is B of \(z\), leading to \(x\) N \(z\).

- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely contained within the bounding box of \(z\). Specifically, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Example: \(x\) in \([1.2, 1.8] \times [4.5, 4.6]\), \(y\) in \([2, 4] \times [2, 4]\), \(z\) in \([1, 5] \times [1, 5]\). Here, \(x\) is NW of \(y\) and \(y\) is B of \(z\), leading to \(x\) B \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (S, SW, E, SE, NE) are possible given the constraints that \(x\) is northwest of \(y\) (implying \(x\) is above and left of \(y\)) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\) (implying \(z\) surrounds \(y\)).

**Possible relations: B, N, W, NW**
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), it follows that \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Vertically, both \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), but the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) are not fixed.

Possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is below \(z\), resulting in SW.
2. **NW (North West)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), then \(x\) is above \(z\), resulting in NW.
3. **W (West)**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds, resulting in W.

These are the only atomic relations possible under the constraints, as other relations (e.g., B, S, N, E, NE, SE) are incompatible with the horizontal separation (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, NW, and W.
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Horizontal constraint**:  
   \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (from \(x\) SW \(y\)) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) W \(z\)).  
   Chaining these: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraint**:  
   - From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
   This gives \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), but no direct inequality between \(\text{sup}_y(x)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z)\). Two cases arise:

   - **Case 1**: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).  
     Then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (satisfies SW condition vertically). Combined with the horizontal constraint, \(x\) is SW of \(z\).

   - **Case 2**: \(\text{inf}_y(z) < \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
     Additionally, if \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (vertical span of \(x\) contained within \(z\)), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).  
     This is achievable without violating the original constraints (e.g., with appropriate vertical alignments).

Other relations are impossible:
- **NW**: Requires \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), leading to \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), implying \(\text{inf}_y(x) = \text{sup}_y(x)\), which contradicts the region being a disk (has area).
- **S, SE, E, NE, N, B**: Violate the horizontal constraint (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) forces west-only relations) or vertical conditions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **W**.

**Answer: SW W**
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Based on the given relations:  
- \(x\) is SW of \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely to the left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely below y)  
- \(y\) is E of \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is entirely to the left of y)  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (z is vertically within y)  

From these:  
- **Vertical relation between x and z**:  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).  
- **Horizontal relations between x and z**:  
  Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their relative horizontal positions are unconstrained. Three cases arise:  

1. **x entirely to the left of z** (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)):  
   - Then \(x\) is SW of \(z\) (left and below).  
2. **x entirely to the right of z** (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)):  
   - Then \(x\) is SE of \(z\) (right and below).  
3. **x horizontally within z** (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)):  
   - Then \(x\) is S of \(z\) (below and horizontally aligned).  

The relations SW, S, and SE are possible. Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are impossible because:  
- N, NE, NW require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(x\) is below.  
- E, W require vertical alignment, but \(x\) is below.  
- B requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box, but \(x\) is entirely below.  

Thus, the possible relations are **SW, S, SE**.  

**Answer**: SW, S, SE
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) means \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) S \(z\) means \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x)\) (using \(x\) SW \(y\)), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is always below \(z\) vertically.

Horizontally, two cases arise:

1. **Case where \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\).

2. **Case where \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)** (and from \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) S \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)):
   - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)). With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) S \(z\).

In all scenarios, the relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are either SW or S. Other relations (like SE, E, W, etc.) are not possible due to the vertical constraint and horizontal conditions derived.

Thus, the possible relations are **SW** and **S**.
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)

- \(y\) NW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
   - Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other can vary.

The possible vertical arrangements lead to the following relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):

- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
- **NW (North West)**: If \(z\) is below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

These are the only possible relations consistent with the given constraints and the definitions. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible due to the left-of constraint and vertical arrangements.

**Possible relations**: SW, W, NW
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the following conditions hold based on the definition of SW:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Chaining these inequalities:

- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) is possible because:
- Relations like W or S require additional constraints (e.g., y-axis coverage for W, x-axis coverage for S) that are not met.
- Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, SE, B) have conflicting requirements (e.g., NE requires \(x\) to be northeast of \(z\), which contradicts the derived inequalities).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.

**Answer: SW**
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), placing both \(x\) and \(z\) entirely to the west of \(y\).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their horizontal alignment relative to each other:
- If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\), resulting in \(x\) SW \(z\).
- If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\), resulting in \(x\) SE \(z\).
- If neither of the above, but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(x\)'s x-interval is contained within \(z\)'s x-interval), and given \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) S \(z\).

All three scenarios are possible under the constraints, as the horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) relative to each other can vary while still satisfying \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Answer: SW, S, SE**
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) encompass all nine cardinal direction relations. The constraints derived are:

- \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

These imply both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of and below \(y\), but allow various relative positions between \(x\) and \(z\) in the plane. Examples confirm each relation is achievable:

- **SW**: \(x\) southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) entirely left and below \(z\)).
- **W**: \(x\) west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\) with \(z\)'s y-interval containing \(x\)'s).
- **NW**: \(x\) northwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left and above \(z\)).
- **N**: \(x\) north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\) with \(z\)'s x-interval containing \(x\)'s).
- **NE**: \(x\) northeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right and above \(z\)).
- **E**: \(x\) east of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right of \(z\) with \(z\)'s y-interval containing \(x\)'s).
- **SE**: \(x\) southeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right and below \(z\)).
- **S**: \(x\) south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) below \(z\) with \(z\)'s x-interval containing \(x\)'s).
- **B**: \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box (e.g., \(x\) and \(z\) coincident or \(x\) contained in \(z\)).

Thus, all relations are possible: **N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B**.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Given that region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are SW, S, W, and B. These relations are derived from the definitions and the constraints imposed by the given relations, considering the bounding box properties and the positions of the regions.

- **SW (South West)**: Possible if the supremum x-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the infimum x-coordinate of z, and the supremum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the infimum y-coordinate of z. This can occur when z's bounding box does not extend significantly left or down beyond y.
- **S (South)**: Possible if the supremum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the infimum y-coordinate of z, and the infimum x-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the infimum x-coordinate of x. This can occur when z extends left but x is directly south of z.
- **W (West)**: Possible if the supremum x-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the infimum x-coordinate of z, and the infimum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the infimum y-coordinate of x. This can occur when z extends down but x is directly west of z.
- **B (bounding box)**: Possible if the infimum x-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the infimum x-coordinate of x, and the infimum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the infimum y-coordinate of x. This can occur when z extends sufficiently left and down to contain x's bounding box.

Relations such as N, NE, E, SE, and NW are impossible because they would require conditions that contradict the given relations (e.g., x being north or east of z, which conflicts with x being southwest of y and y being contained within z's bounding box).

Thus, the possible relations are SW, S, W, and B.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. The relations are determined by the relative positions based on the definitions provided.

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), meaning \(x\) is to the right and below \(y\).
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning \(y\) is above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds.

Considering these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **N (North)**: \(x\) can be north of \(z\) if \(z\) is low vertically and \(x\) is within \(z\)'s horizontal bounds.
- **NE (Northeast)**: \(x\) can be northeast of \(z\) if \(x\) is to the right and above \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) can be east of \(z\) if \(x\) is to the right and vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounds.
- **SE (Southeast)**: \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) if \(x\) is to the right and below \(z\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) can be south of \(z\) if \(x\) is below and within \(z\)'s horizontal bounds.
- **B (Bounding box)**: \(x\) can be within \(z\)'s bounding box if \(z\) is large enough to contain \(x\) horizontally and vertically.

The relations SW, W, and NW are impossible because \(x\) is always to the right of \(y\) (due to \(x\) SE \(y\)), and \(y\) is not left of \(z\) (due to \(y\) N \(z\)), so \(x\) cannot be west of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes.

- From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These inequalities imply that \(x\) is always southeast of \(y\) and below \(y\) in the y-direction, while \(z\) is east of \(y\) and contains or extends beyond \(y\) in the y-direction. Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- **S (South)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- **SE (South East)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **W (West)**: Possible if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) (y-overlap), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **E (East)**: Possible if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) (y-overlap), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: Possible if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) (y-overlap), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The relations N, NE, and NW are impossible because \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(z\) contains or is at least as north as \(y\), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, SE, W, E, and B.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are E (East) and SE (South East).

- **E (East)**: This relation is possible when the vertical conditions allow the bounding box of \(x\) to be contained within the vertical range of \(z\)'s bounding box, specifically \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), while the horizontal condition \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is satisfied from the given constraints.
- **SE (South East)**: This relation is possible when \(x\) is completely below \(z\) vertically, specifically \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), while the horizontal condition \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is satisfied.

Other relations, such as NE (North East), are impossible because the vertical constraints derived from \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\) prevent \(x\) from being north of \(z\). Similarly, relations like N, S, SW, W, NW, and B are not possible due to the horizontal separation where \(x\) is east of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), which rules out west and overlapping horizontal projections.

Thus, the possible relations are E and SE.

**Final Answer: E, SE**
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S (South) and SE (South East).

- **S (South)**: This relation holds if \(x\) is directly south of \(z\) and horizontally within the x-range of \(z\)'s bounding box. This occurs when \(z\) is wide enough to contain \(x\) in the x-direction, satisfying the conditions \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

- **SE (South East)**: This relation holds if \(x\) is southeast of \(z\), meaning \(x\) is completely east and south of \(z\). This occurs when \(z\) does not extend far enough east to contain \(x\), satisfying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Other relations are not possible:
- SW, W, NW are not possible because \(x\) is east of \(y\) and \(y\) is within the x-range of \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be west of \(z\).
- N, NE are not possible because \(x\) is south of \(y\) and \(y\) is south of \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\).
- E is not possible because it requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but the given relations imply \(\inf_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which is the opposite.
- B is not possible because \(x\) is south of \(z\), so \(z\) cannot contain \(x\)'s bounding box vertically.

Thus, the possible relations are S and SE.

\boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: The given relations are \(x \text{ SE } y\) and \(y \text{ NW } z\). This implies:

- \(x \text{ SE } y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y \text{ NW } z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are east of \(y\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are south of \(y\), but their relative vertical positions can vary.

All nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible, as the constraints allow any combination of horizontal and vertical arrangements. Examples for each relation:

- **SE**: \(x\) east and south of \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) south of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) west and south of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) east of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\).
- **B**: Bounding box of \(x\) inside that of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) west of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\).
- **NE**: \(x\) east and north of \(z\).
- **N**: \(x\) north of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
- **NW**: \(x\) west and north of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are all: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}}
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are SW, S, and SE. This is derived from the constraints on the bounding boxes:

- From x SE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is below z with no y-overlap. Thus, only relations where x is south of z are possible: SW, S, or SE.

- **SW (x is southwest of z)**: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z). For example, with supx(y) = 10, infx(x) = 12, supx(x) = 13, infx(z) = 13, supy(x) ≤ 5, infy(z) ≥ 6.
- **S (x is south of z)**: Possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). For example, with supx(y) = 10, infx(z) = 10, supx(z) = 15, infx(x) = 11, supx(x) = 14, supy(x) ≤ 5, infy(z) ≥ 6.
- **SE (x is southeast of z)**: Possible if infx(x) ≥ supx(z). For example, with supx(y) = 10, infx(z) = 10.5, supx(z) = 11, infx(x) = 11.5, supx(x) = 12, supy(x) ≤ 5, infy(z) ≥ 6.

No other relations are possible due to the vertical separation (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), which precludes relations requiring y-overlap (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) or x being above z.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **East condition for \(x\) relative to \(z\)**:  
   \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)) and \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), satisfying the east component of a direction relation.

2. **South condition for \(x\) relative to \(z\)**:  
   \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)) and \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)).  
   Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), satisfying the south component of a direction relation.

The conditions \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) match the definition of **SE (South East)**. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) satisfies both requirements simultaneously.

**Answer: SE**
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes.

- From \(x\) SE \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is to the west of \(x\))  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is below \(y\))  

- From \(y\) NE \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is to the west of \(y\))  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is below \(y\))  

Combining the \(x\)-coordinate constraints:  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\), so \(x\) must be to the east of \(z\) in the relation between \(x\) and \(z\). Thus, the possible relations are limited to those where \(x\) is east of \(z\): E (east), SE (southeast), or NE (northeast).

The \(y\)-coordinate constraints are:  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)  

Let \(C = \inf_y(y)\). Then \(\sup_y(z) \leq C\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq C\), meaning both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\). The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their infimum and supremum \(y\)-values relative to each other:

- **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**: Then \(x\) SE \(z\) holds, as \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
- **If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**: Then \(x\) NE \(z\) holds, as \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
- **If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**: Then \(x\) E \(z\) holds, as \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment of \(x\) within \(z\)).  

All three cases are possible under the given constraints, depending on the specific positions of the regions. No other relations (N, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible because the \(x\)-coordinate constraint \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) excludes west-oriented relations, and the vertical positioning relative to \(y\) allows for the above scenarios.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are E, SE, and NE.

\boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}}
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(x\) is east of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (entire \(x\) is south of \(y\))
- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (bounding box of \(z\) contains \(y\) in x-direction)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (bounding box of \(z\) contains \(y\) in y-direction)

Analyzing possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **SE (South East)**: Possible.  
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\): Ensured if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\): Ensured by \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and setting \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\).  
   Example: \(z = [0, 4] \times [0, 3]\), \(y = [1, 2] \times [1, 2]\), \(x = [4, 5] \times [-2, -1]\).

2. **E (East)**: Possible.  
   - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\): As above.  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\): Set \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) (e.g., \(x\) starts above bottom of \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (given \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  
   Example: \(z = [0, 4] \times [0, 3]\), \(y = [1, 2] \times [1, 2]\), \(x = [5, 6] \times [0.5, 0.8]\).

3. **S (South)**: Possible.  
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\): Set \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\) (using \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)).  
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\): Set \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).  
   Example: \(z = [0, 4] \times [1.5, 3]\), \(y = [1, 2] \times [2, 2.5]\), \(x = [2, 3] \times [0, 1]\).

4. **B (Bounding box)**: Possible.  
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\): Set \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\): Set \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (given \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).  
   Example: \(z = [0, 4] \times [0, 3]\), \(y = [1, 2] \times [1, 2]\), \(x = [2, 3] \times [0.5, 0.8]\).

Other relations (N, NE, NW, W, SW) are impossible:
- **W, SW, NW**: Require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(z)\) forces a vertical line (invalid for disk-homeomorphic regions).
- **N, NE**: Require \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) forces a horizontal line (invalid).

Thus, the possible relations are **B, S, E, SE**.

\boxed{\text{B}} \boxed{\text{S}} \boxed{\text{E}} \boxed{\text{SE}}
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- **Vertical Constraint**: From \(y\) N \(z\), \(z\) is entirely below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)). From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), implying \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). This restricts possible relations to those where \(x\) is above \(z\): N, NE, or NW.

- **Horizontal Constraints**:
  - From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(y\) is entirely left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
  - From \(y\) N \(z\), \(z\) horizontally contains \(y\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
  - Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_x(z)\):
1. **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)  
   The entire \(z\) is left of \(x\), and with \(z\) below \(x\), the relation \(x\) NE \(z\) holds (satisfies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
2. **Case 2**: \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\)  
   Here, \(z\) extends rightward at least to the start of \(x\). For \(x\) to be N of \(z\), the horizontal projection of \(x\) must be contained in \(z\)'s (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)). We have \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) from above, and if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) N \(z\) holds. If \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\), no defined relation fits, but the condition \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) is achievable, making N possible.

- **NW Consideration**: \(x\) NW \(z\) requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies equality and degenerate bounding boxes, which are invalid for regions homeomorphic to a disk. Thus, NW is impossible.

**Conclusion**: The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **NE** (if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\))
- **N** (if \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\), ensuring horizontal containment)

Thus, the possible relations are **N** and **NE**.

**Answer**: N, NE
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) constraints:

- **Horizontal constraints**: \(\text{inf}_x(x) \geq \text{sup}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). This allows:
  - \(x\) entirely west of \(z\) (W relation) if \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).
  - \(x\) entirely east of \(z\) (E relation) if \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
  - Overlap horizontally (possible B or N if other conditions hold).

- **Vertical constraints**: \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{sup}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). This implies \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). This allows:
  - \(x\) entirely north of \(z\) (N or part of NW/NE) if \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
  - Vertical overlap (possible B, W, or E if additional conditions hold).

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

1. **NW**: If \(x\) is west of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)) and north of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).
2. **W**: If \(x\) is west of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)) and vertically overlaps with \(z\), but with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (required for W relation).
3. **NE**: If \(x\) is east of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) and north of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).
4. **E**: If \(x\) is east of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) and vertically overlaps with \(z\), but with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (required for E relation).
5. **N**: If horizontally, \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)), and vertically \(x\) is north of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).
6. **B**: If \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s in both axes: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

Relations S, SE, and SW are impossible due to vertical constraints ensuring \(x\) is not south of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are B, E, N, NE, NW, W.

**Answer**: B, E, N, NE, NW, W
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\))
- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical extent of \(z\) covers \(y\))

Combining the constraints:
- From \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(x\)).
- For the \(y\)-axis:
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) from \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\)).
  - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- The relation between \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) determines possible vertical relations:
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\):
    - \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
    - Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\), this implies \(x\) is NE of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) NE \(z\)).
  - If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\):
    - The vertical extent of \(z\) must cover \(x\) for consistency with the connected regions and bounding boxes.
    - Specifically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) must hold (as \(z\)'s bounding box vertically contains \(x\)).
    - Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this implies \(x\) is E of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) E \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE and E.

**Answer: NE, E**
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Given \(x\) is NE of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is strictly northeast of \(y\) (right and above).

- Given \(y\) is S of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is strictly south of \(z\) (below and horizontally within).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by considering the constraints on their bounding boxes:

1. **Horizontal Constraints**:  
   From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   The relation between \(\sup_x(z)\) and \(\inf_x(x)\) can vary, allowing horizontal separation or overlap.

2. **Vertical Constraints**:  
   From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\), but their relative vertical positions can vary (e.g., \(z\) above \(x\), \(x\) above \(z\), or overlap).

By constructing specific examples satisfying the given relations, the following relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:
- **N**: \(z\) is below \(x\) (vertical separation, \(x\) north of \(z\)).
- **S**: \(x\) is below \(z\) (vertical separation, \(x\) south of \(z\)).
- **B**: The bounding box of \(x\) is inside that of \(z\).
- **NE**: \(z\) is southwest of \(x\) (horizontal and vertical separation).
- **NW**: \(z\) is southeast of \(x\) (horizontal separation and vertical separation with \(z\) above).
- **E**: \(z\) is west of \(x\) (horizontal separation with vertical containment).
- **SE**: \(z\) is northwest of \(x\) (horizontal separation and vertical separation with \(x\) below).

The relations **W**, **SW** are impossible due to contradictions in horizontal constraints (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) is infeasible).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
**N, S, B, NE, NW, E, SE**.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Given \(x\) is NE of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the east and north of \(y\).

- Given \(y\) is NW of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the west and north of \(z\).

From these, we derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical relation (y-axis):**  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) from \(y\) NW \(z\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) from \(x\) NE \(y\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This implies \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (north).

2. **Horizontal relation (x-axis):**  
   \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) from \(x\) NE \(y\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) from \(y\) NW \(z\).  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the east of \(y\)'s east boundary. The relative horizontal positioning between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible horizontal scenarios:

- **\(x\) is east of \(z\) (disjoint):**  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) **NE** of \(z\).
- **\(x\) is west of \(z\) (disjoint):**  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) **NW** of \(z\).
- **\(x\) is horizontally within \(z\):**  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) **N** of \(z\).

Other relations are impossible due to the vertical constraint (\(x\) above \(z\)) and the definitions:
- **S, SE, SW, E, W, B** require conditions contradicted by \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (e.g., \(x\) below \(z\) or specific vertical alignments not met).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, NW, N**.

**Final Answer**  
**NE, NW, N**
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Given the relations:  
- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(x\))  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))  
- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\))  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(z\))  

The constraints imply that both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned above and to the right of \(y\), but there are no direct constraints between \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, all nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible, as verified by constructing examples satisfying the given relations and yielding each specific relation between \(x\) and \(z\):  

- **B (bounding box)**: \(x\) can be contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.  
- **S (South)**: \(x\) can be below \(z\) with horizontal overlap.  
- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) can be below and to the left of \(z\).  
- **W (West)**: \(x\) can be to the left of \(z\) with vertical overlap.  
- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) can be above and to the left of \(z\).  
- **N (North)**: \(x\) can be above \(z\) with horizontal overlap.  
- **NE (North East)**: \(x\) can be above and to the right of \(z\).  
- **E (East)**: \(x\) can be to the right of \(z\) with vertical overlap.  
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) can be below and to the right of \(z\).  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all nine cardinal directions.  

**Answer: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE**
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\) means:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (x is north of y)

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) means:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (y is east of z)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (y is south of z)

Chaining the horizontal constraints:
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) imply \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(x\) is east of \(z\).

For the vertical direction between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (since \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{sup}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \geq \text{sup}_y(y)\)), but their vertical positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible vertical scenarios:
1. **NE (North East)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (z is entirely below x).  
   Example: \(z\) vertical [2, 4], \(y\) vertical [1, 1.5], \(x\) vertical [4.5, 5.5]. Constraints hold, and \(x\) is NE of \(z\).

2. **E (East)**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (x is vertically within z's bounds).  
   Example: \(z\) vertical [2, 4], \(y\) vertical [1, 1.5], \(x\) vertical [2.5, 3.5]. Constraints hold, and \(x\) is E of \(z\).

3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x is entirely below z).  
   Example: \(z\) vertical [2, 4], \(y\) vertical [1, 1.5], \(x\) vertical [1.5, 1.8]. Constraints hold, and \(x\) is SE of \(z\).

Other relations (N, S, NW, SW, W, B) are impossible due to the east constraint (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) and vertical dependencies. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, E, SE**.

**Final Answer: NE, E, SE**
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE. This is determined as follows:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the south of \(x\))
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the south of \(y\))

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) by transitivity.
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) by transitivity.

These conditions (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)) satisfy the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., N, E, S, W, NW, SW, SE, B) holds under these constraints, as they require additional or conflicting spatial conditions not guaranteed by the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\))

- \(y\) B \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (\(z\)'s bounding box contains \(y\)'s in x-direction)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(z\)'s bounding box contains \(y\)'s in y-direction)

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

1. **B (bounding box)**: Possible if \(z\) is large enough to contain both \(y\) and \(x\). For example:
   - \(y\): \([2, 3] \times [2, 3]\)
   - \(x\): \([4, 5] \times [4, 5]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - \(z\): \([1, 6] \times [1, 6]\) (satisfies \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) B \(z\))

2. **N (North)**: Possible if \(z\) extends sufficiently in the x-direction but not above \(x\) in y-direction. For example:
   - \(y\): \([1, 2] \times [1, 2]\)
   - \(x\): \([3, 4] \times [3, 4]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - \(z\): \([0, 4] \times [0, 3]\) (satisfies \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) N \(z\))

3. **NE (North East)**: Possible if \(z\) does not extend beyond \(x\) in either direction. For example:
   - \(y\): \([1, 2] \times [1, 2]\)
   - \(x\): \([3, 4] \times [3, 4]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - \(z\): \([1, 2] \times [1, 2]\) (same as \(y\), satisfies \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) NE \(z\))

4. **E (East)**: Possible if \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) and tall enough to cover \(x\) in y-direction. For example:
   - \(y\): \([1, 2] \times [1, 2]\)
   - \(x\): \([3, 4] \times [3, 4]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - \(z\): \([0, 2.5] \times [0, 5]\) (satisfies \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(z\))

Other relations (SE, S, SW, W, NW) are impossible due to the constraints:
- \(x\) must be right and above \(y\), and \(z\) contains \(y\), so \(x\) cannot be south or west of \(z\).
- Specific conditions for SE, S, SW, W, NW conflict with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, NE, E**.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means that the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\). This implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ N } z\) means that \(y\) is north of \(z\), so:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these inequalities:

1. From \(y \text{ N } z\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). From \(x \text{ B } y\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

2. From \(y \text{ N } z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\). From \(x \text{ B } y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

3. From \(x \text{ B } y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\). From \(y \text{ N } z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) satisfy the definition of \(x \text{ N } z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) is possible, as they would require different combinations of inequalities that contradict the derived conditions (e.g., NE would require \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which conflicts with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is N.

**Answer:** N
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\):  
  \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these constraints:

1. **Horizontal constraint for \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) W \(z\)) imply:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraint for \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so:  
   \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). This means the vertical extent of \(x\) is contained within the vertical extent of \(z\).

The relation \(x\) W \(z\) requires:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (satisfied by the horizontal constraint),  
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied),  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (satisfied).  

Thus, \(x\) W \(z\) is possible.  

Other relations are not possible:  
- **N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW**: Require specific vertical alignments (e.g., \(x\) entirely above, below, or diagonal to \(z\)) that contradict the vertical containment \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
- **E**: Requires \(x\) to be east of \(z\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) forces \(x\) west of \(z\).  
- **B**: Requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s, but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) prevents horizontal containment.  

Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **W**.  

**Answer: W**
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- **x B y**: This means region x is contained within the bounding box of region y. Thus:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (left edge of y is left of or equal to left edge of x)
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (right edge of x is right of or equal to right edge of y)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (bottom edge of y is below or equal to bottom edge of x)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (top edge of x is above or equal to top edge of y)

- **y E z**: This means region y is East of region z. Thus:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (right edge of z is left of or equal to left edge of y)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (bottom edge of z is below or equal to bottom edge of y)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (top edge of y is above or equal to top edge of z)

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

### Horizontal Analysis:
- From y E z: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\)
- From x B y: \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
- Combining: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
- This implies the entire region z is to the left of region x, as the rightmost point of z is left of the leftmost point of x.

### Vertical Analysis:
- From y E z: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)
- From x B y: \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)
- Combining:
  - \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) → \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) → \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)
- This implies the vertical span of x is contained within the vertical span of z.

### Resulting Relation:
- The horizontal condition (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) matches the requirement for x being East of z (E relation).
- The vertical conditions (\(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)) match the vertical containment required for the E relation.
- Thus, **x E z** must hold.

### Why Other Relations Are Impossible:
- **B, N, S, NE, NW, SE, SW, W**: These either require overlap in x-axis (e.g., B, W), vertical misalignment (e.g., N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW), or specific positioning that contradicts the derived conditions. For example:
  - **B**: Requires \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), but \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), impossible.
  - **N**: Requires \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x)\) imply \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) forces degeneracy.
  - **NE, SE, NW, SW**: Require vertical separation (e.g., \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) for NE), which conflicts with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) and non-degeneracy.
  - **W**: Requires x to be left of z, contradicting \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).

### Conclusion:
The only possible relation between region x and region z is **E**. 

**Answer: E**
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies that the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies that \(y\) is directly south of \(z\):
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraints for \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

2. **Vertical constraints for \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) exactly match the definition of \(x\) being directly south of \(z\) (\(x\) S \(z\)).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, SW, B) is possible because:
- Relations like SW, W, NW would require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), contradicting \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (unless degenerate, but regions are non-degenerate).
- Relations like SE, E, NE would require \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), contradicting \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- Relations like N, B, NE, NW require vertical conditions incompatible with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (e.g., \(z\) above \(x\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **S**.

**Answer: S**
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: Given that region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

- x B y implies that the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y:
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

- y NW z implies that y is northwest of z:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

Combining these:
- From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), it follows that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z.
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning z is below x.

Therefore, x is to the left and above z, which corresponds to x NW z. The definition of NW is satisfied:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

No other cardinal direction relations are possible given the constraints, as other relations would require conflicting positional relationships (e.g., x cannot be south or east of z due to the left and above positioning).

\boxed{\text{NW}}
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions:

- **x B y**:  
  - `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)`, `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`  
  - `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)`, `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)`  

- **y SW z**:  
  - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`  
  - `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)`  

Combining these:  
1. From `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (x B y) and `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y SW z), we get `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`.  
2. From `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (x B y) and `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y SW z), we get `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`.  

The conditions `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)` match the definition of **x SW z**.  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, B) satisfies these constraints without requiring additional conditions that are not guaranteed by the given relations. For example:  
- **S** requires `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(z)`, but `infx(z) ≥ supx(x)` (from above) does not imply `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)`.  
- **W** requires `infy(z) ≤ infy(x)` and `supy(x) ≤ supy(z)`, but `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)` (from above) does not imply `infy(z) ≤ infy(x)`.  
- Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW, B) similarly fail due to mismatched bounds.  

Thus, the only possible relation is **SW**.  

**Answer**: SW
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is \(B\) of region \(y\):  
  \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\),  
  \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is \(SE\) of region \(z\):  
  \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

Combining these:  
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) → \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).  
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) → \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

These inequalities satisfy the definition of \(x\) being \(SE\) of \(z\):  
\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as they require conditions that contradict the above (e.g., \(E\) requires \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) implies \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), violating \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) unless degenerate, which is excluded as regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk and non-degenerate).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is \(SE\).

**Answer: SE**
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: Given that region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE (north-east) of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is NE (north-east).

### Explanation:
- The relation \(x\) B \(y\) means that \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(y\). Specifically:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- The relation \(y\) NE \(z\) means that \(y\) is north-east of \(z\), so:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these:
- From \(y\) NE \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and from \(x\) B \(y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- From \(y\) NE \(z\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and from \(x\) B \(y\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) define the NE relation between \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, \(x\) must be NE of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) is possible, as they would require additional or conflicting conditions (e.g., for E, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) would conflict with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which implies regions cannot have area, contradicting the definition of regions in REG).

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.

\boxed{\text{NE}}
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, specifically the B relation:

- \(x \, \text{B} \, y\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \, \text{B} \, z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these inequalities:

1. \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
2. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
3. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
4. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

This results in:
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

These conditions satisfy the definition of the B relation for \(x\) and \(z\). Specifically, the minimum bounding box of \(x\) is contained within the minimum bounding box of \(z\), meaning \(x \, \text{B} \, z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW) is possible under these constraints, as they require additional spatial conditions (e.g., one region being entirely above, below, left, or right of another) that are not guaranteed by the given B relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **B**.

**Final Answer**  
B
