PROMPT: Let NE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\) means:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (x is east of y)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (x is north of y)

- \(y\) is SE of \(z\) means:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (y is east of z)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (y is south of z)

Chaining the horizontal constraints:
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) imply \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(x\) is east of \(z\).

For the vertical direction between \(x\) and \(z\):
- Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\) (since \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{sup}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \geq \text{sup}_y(y)\)), but their vertical positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible vertical scenarios:
1. **NE (North East)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (z is entirely below x).  
   Example: \(z\) vertical [2, 4], \(y\) vertical [1, 1.5], \(x\) vertical [4.5, 5.5]. Constraints hold, and \(x\) is NE of \(z\).

2. **E (East)**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (x is vertically within z's bounds).  
   Example: \(z\) vertical [2, 4], \(y\) vertical [1, 1.5], \(x\) vertical [2.5, 3.5]. Constraints hold, and \(x\) is E of \(z\).

3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (x is entirely below z).  
   Example: \(z\) vertical [2, 4], \(y\) vertical [1, 1.5], \(x\) vertical [1.5, 1.8]. Constraints hold, and \(x\) is SE of \(z\).

Other relations (N, S, NW, SW, W, B) are impossible due to the east constraint (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) and vertical dependencies. Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, E, SE**.

**Final Answer: NE, E, SE**
