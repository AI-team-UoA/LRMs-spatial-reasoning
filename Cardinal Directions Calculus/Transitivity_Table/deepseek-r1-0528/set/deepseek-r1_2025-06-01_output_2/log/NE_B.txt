PROMPT: Let NE and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\))

- \(y\) B \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (\(z\)'s bounding box contains \(y\)'s in x-direction)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(z\)'s bounding box contains \(y\)'s in y-direction)

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

1. **B (bounding box)**: Possible if \(z\) is large enough to contain both \(y\) and \(x\). For example:
   - \(y\): \([2, 3] \times [2, 3]\)
   - \(x\): \([4, 5] \times [4, 5]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - \(z\): \([1, 6] \times [1, 6]\) (satisfies \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) B \(z\))

2. **N (North)**: Possible if \(z\) extends sufficiently in the x-direction but not above \(x\) in y-direction. For example:
   - \(y\): \([1, 2] \times [1, 2]\)
   - \(x\): \([3, 4] \times [3, 4]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - \(z\): \([0, 4] \times [0, 3]\) (satisfies \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) N \(z\))

3. **NE (North East)**: Possible if \(z\) does not extend beyond \(x\) in either direction. For example:
   - \(y\): \([1, 2] \times [1, 2]\)
   - \(x\): \([3, 4] \times [3, 4]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - \(z\): \([1, 2] \times [1, 2]\) (same as \(y\), satisfies \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) NE \(z\))

4. **E (East)**: Possible if \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\) and tall enough to cover \(x\) in y-direction. For example:
   - \(y\): \([1, 2] \times [1, 2]\)
   - \(x\): \([3, 4] \times [3, 4]\) (satisfies \(x\) NE \(y\))
   - \(z\): \([0, 2.5] \times [0, 5]\) (satisfies \(y\) B \(z\) and \(x\) E \(z\))

Other relations (SE, S, SW, W, NW) are impossible due to the constraints:
- \(x\) must be right and above \(y\), and \(z\) contains \(y\), so \(x\) cannot be south or west of \(z\).
- Specific conditions for SE, S, SW, W, NW conflict with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

Thus, the possible relations are **B, N, NE, E**.
