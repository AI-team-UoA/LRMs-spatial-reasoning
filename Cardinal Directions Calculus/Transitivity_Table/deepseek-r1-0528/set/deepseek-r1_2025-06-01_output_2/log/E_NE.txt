PROMPT: Let E and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is NE of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), implying \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
- Also, \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)), so \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) NE \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\). No other cardinal direction relation (N, S, E, W, NW, SW, SE, B) holds under these constraints, as they require additional or conflicting bounds that are not met.

Thus, the only possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is **NE**.
