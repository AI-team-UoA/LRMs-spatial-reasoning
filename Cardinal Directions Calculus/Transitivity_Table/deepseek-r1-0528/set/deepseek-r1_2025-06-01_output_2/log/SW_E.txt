PROMPT: Let SW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:  
- \(x\) is SW of \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is entirely to the left of y)  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is entirely below y)  
- \(y\) is E of \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is entirely to the left of y)  
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (z is vertically within y)  

From these:  
- **Vertical relation between x and z**:  
  \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).  
- **Horizontal relations between x and z**:  
  Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)), but their relative horizontal positions are unconstrained. Three cases arise:  

1. **x entirely to the left of z** (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)):  
   - Then \(x\) is SW of \(z\) (left and below).  
2. **x entirely to the right of z** (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)):  
   - Then \(x\) is SE of \(z\) (right and below).  
3. **x horizontally within z** (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)):  
   - Then \(x\) is S of \(z\) (below and horizontally aligned).  

The relations SW, S, and SE are possible. Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) are impossible because:  
- N, NE, NW require \(x\) above \(z\), but \(x\) is below.  
- E, W require vertical alignment, but \(x\) is below.  
- B requires \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box, but \(x\) is entirely below.  

Thus, the possible relations are **SW, S, SE**.  

**Answer**: SW, S, SE
