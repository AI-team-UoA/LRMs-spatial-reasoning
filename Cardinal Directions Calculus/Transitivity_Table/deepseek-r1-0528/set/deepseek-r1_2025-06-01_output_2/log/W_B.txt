PROMPT: Let W and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is W of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining the inequalities:

1. **X-axis constraints**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   This implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), but the relationship between \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\) can vary.

2. **Y-axis constraints**:  
   \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

- **Case 1: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**  
  This satisfies the condition for \(x\) W \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Thus, **W** is possible.

- **Case 2: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (so \(\sup_x(x) > \inf_x(z)\)) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**  
  Here:  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)),  
  and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This satisfies the condition for \(x\) B \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Thus, **B** is possible.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW) are not possible:
- **N, S, E**: Require specific non-overlapping conditions on one axis (e.g., \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for S, or \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) for E), which conflict with the combined constraints (e.g., \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) rule out S and N; \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) do not support \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) for E).
- **Diagonal relations (NE, SE, SW, NW)**: Require non-overlapping on both axes (e.g., \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) for SW), but the y-axis constraints (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)) prevent the necessary vertical separation.

Thus, the only possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **W** and **B**.
