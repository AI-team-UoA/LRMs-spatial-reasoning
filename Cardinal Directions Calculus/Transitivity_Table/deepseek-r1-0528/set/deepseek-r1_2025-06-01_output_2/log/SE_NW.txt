PROMPT: Let SE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

The given relations are \(x \text{ SE } y\) and \(y \text{ NW } z\). This implies:

- \(x \text{ SE } y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y \text{ NW } z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are east of \(y\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) are south of \(y\), but their relative vertical positions can vary.

All nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible, as the constraints allow any combination of horizontal and vertical arrangements. Examples for each relation:

- **SE**: \(x\) east and south of \(z\).
- **S**: \(x\) south of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
- **SW**: \(x\) west and south of \(z\).
- **E**: \(x\) east of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\).
- **B**: Bounding box of \(x\) inside that of \(z\).
- **W**: \(x\) west of \(z\) and vertically within \(z\).
- **NE**: \(x\) east and north of \(z\).
- **N**: \(x\) north of \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\).
- **NW**: \(x\) west and north of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are all: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}}
