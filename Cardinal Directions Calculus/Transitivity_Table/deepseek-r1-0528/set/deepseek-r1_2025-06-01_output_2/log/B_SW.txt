PROMPT: Let B and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- **x B y**:  
  - `infx(y) ≤ infx(x)`, `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`  
  - `infy(y) ≤ infy(x)`, `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)`  

- **y SW z**:  
  - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`  
  - `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)`  

Combining these:  
1. From `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)` (x B y) and `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y SW z), we get `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`.  
2. From `supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (x B y) and `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y SW z), we get `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`.  

The conditions `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)` match the definition of **x SW z**.  

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, W, NW, B) satisfies these constraints without requiring additional conditions that are not guaranteed by the given relations. For example:  
- **S** requires `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(z)`, but `infx(z) ≥ supx(x)` (from above) does not imply `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)`.  
- **W** requires `infy(z) ≤ infy(x)` and `supy(x) ≤ supy(z)`, but `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)` (from above) does not imply `infy(z) ≤ infy(x)`.  
- Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW, B) similarly fail due to mismatched bounds.  

Thus, the only possible relation is **SW**.
