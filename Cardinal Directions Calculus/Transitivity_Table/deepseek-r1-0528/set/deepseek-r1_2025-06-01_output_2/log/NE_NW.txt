PROMPT: Let NE and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Given \(x\) is NE of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is entirely to the east and north of \(y\).

- Given \(y\) is NW of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
  This means \(y\) is entirely to the west and north of \(z\).

From these, we derive the relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Vertical relation (y-axis):**  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) from \(y\) NW \(z\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) from \(x\) NE \(y\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   This implies \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (north).

2. **Horizontal relation (x-axis):**  
   \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) from \(x\) NE \(y\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) from \(y\) NW \(z\).  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the east of \(y\)'s east boundary. The relative horizontal positioning between \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible horizontal scenarios:

- **\(x\) is east of \(z\) (disjoint):**  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) **NE** of \(z\).
- **\(x\) is west of \(z\) (disjoint):**  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) **NW** of \(z\).
- **\(x\) is horizontally within \(z\):**  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) **N** of \(z\).

Other relations are impossible due to the vertical constraint (\(x\) above \(z\)) and the definitions:
- **S, SE, SW, E, W, B** require conditions contradicted by \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (e.g., \(x\) below \(z\) or specific vertical alignments not met).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE, NW, N**.

**Final Answer**  
**NE, NW, N**
