PROMPT: Let NE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the relations:  
- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(x\))  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))  
- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\))  
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(z\))  

The constraints imply that both \(x\) and \(z\) are positioned above and to the right of \(y\), but there are no direct constraints between \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, all nine cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible, as verified by constructing examples satisfying the given relations and yielding each specific relation between \(x\) and \(z\):  

- **B (bounding box)**: \(x\) can be contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.  
- **S (South)**: \(x\) can be below \(z\) with horizontal overlap.  
- **SW (South West)**: \(x\) can be below and to the left of \(z\).  
- **W (West)**: \(x\) can be to the left of \(z\) with vertical overlap.  
- **NW (North West)**: \(x\) can be above and to the left of \(z\).  
- **N (North)**: \(x\) can be above \(z\) with horizontal overlap.  
- **NE (North East)**: \(x\) can be above and to the right of \(z\).  
- **E (East)**: \(x\) can be to the right of \(z\) with vertical overlap.  
- **SE (South East)**: \(x\) can be below and to the right of \(z\).  

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) include all nine cardinal directions.  

**Answer: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE**
