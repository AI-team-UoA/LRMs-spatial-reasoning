PROMPT: Let W and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, if region \(x\) is W of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is W. This is determined by the constraints:

- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Chaining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- Vertically: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These satisfy the definition of W: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, NW, B) are excluded due to:
- Horizontal constraint \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) conflicting with E, NE, SE.
- Vertical constraints requiring non-degenerate bounding boxes (preventing N, S, NW, SW).
- Bounding box conditions not met for B.

Thus, the only possible relation is **W**.
