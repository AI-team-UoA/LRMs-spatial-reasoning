PROMPT: Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. The relations are determined as follows:

- **NW relation (\(x\) NW \(y\))**:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is to the left and above \(y\).

- **E relation (\(y\) E \(z\))**:  
  \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  This means \(z\) is to the left of \(y\) and vertically overlaps or contains \(y\)'s bounding box.

Combining these:
- Horizontally, both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the left of \(y\), but their relative horizontal positions can vary:  
  - \(x\) left of \(z\),  
  - \(z\) left of \(x\), or  
  - overlapping horizontally.  
- Vertically, \(y\) is below \(x\) and \(z\) contains \(y\) vertically, so \(z\) can be below \(x\) or overlap vertically with \(x\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **N (North)**: If \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) and horizontally contained within \(x\).  
- **NE (Northeast)**: If \(z\) is below and to the left of \(x\).  
- **NW (Northwest)**: If \(z\) is below and to the right of \(x\).  
- **W (West)**: If \(z\) is to the right of \(x\) and vertically contains \(x\).  
- **E (East)**: If \(z\) is to the left of \(x\) and vertically contains \(x\).  
- **B (Bounding box)**: If \(x\) is entirely within the bounding box of \(z\).

These relations are achievable under specific configurations satisfying the given constraints. Relations like S, SE, SW are not possible due to vertical contradictions from the constraints.

Thus, the possible relations are **N, NE, NW, W, E, B**.  

**Final Answer**:  
N, NE, NW, W, E, B
