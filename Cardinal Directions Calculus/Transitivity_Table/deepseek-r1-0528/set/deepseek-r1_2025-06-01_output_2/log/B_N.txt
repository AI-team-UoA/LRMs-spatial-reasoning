PROMPT: Let B and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x \text{ B } y\) means that the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\). This implies:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y \text{ N } z\) means that \(y\) is north of \(z\), so:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these inequalities:

1. From \(y \text{ N } z\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). From \(x \text{ B } y\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

2. From \(y \text{ N } z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\). From \(x \text{ B } y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

3. From \(x \text{ B } y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\). From \(y \text{ N } z\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) satisfy the definition of \(x \text{ N } z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) is possible, as they would require different combinations of inequalities that contradict the derived conditions (e.g., NE would require \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), which conflicts with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is N.
