PROMPT: Let N and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\): This implies \(x\) is directly above \(y\), so:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (the top of \(y\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within the bounds of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is NW of \(z\): This implies \(y\) is above and to the left of \(z\), so:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (the right edge of \(y\) is at or left of the left edge of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (the top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)).

Combining these:
- **Horizontally**: 
  - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
  - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).

- **Vertically**:
  - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
  - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of \(x\) being **NW** of \(z\):
- \(a\) NW \(b\) iff \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) satisfies both conditions simultaneously:
- Other relations either conflict with \(x\) being left of \(z\) or \(z\) being below \(x\) (e.g., NE would require \(x\) right of \(z\), SW would require \(x\) below \(z\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **NW**.
