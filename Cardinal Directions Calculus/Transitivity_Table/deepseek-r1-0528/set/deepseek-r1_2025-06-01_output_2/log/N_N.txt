PROMPT: Let N and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) in the y-direction),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., the x-projection of \(x\) is contained within the x-projection of \(y\)).

- \(y\) is N of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(y\) in the y-direction),
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., the x-projection of \(y\) is contained within the x-projection of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- **Y-direction**:  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)  
  Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).

- **X-direction**:  
  From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).  
  Chaining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning the x-projection of \(x\) is contained within the x-projection of \(z\).

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) being N of \(z\):
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is necessarily satisfied under these constraints, as they require additional conditions (e.g., specific alignments or non-overlapping projections in the x-direction) that are not guaranteed by the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **N**.
