PROMPT: Let NE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE. This is determined as follows:

- \(x\) NE \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the south of \(x\))
- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the south of \(y\))

Combining these:
- From \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) by transitivity.
- From \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) by transitivity.

These conditions (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)) satisfy the definition of \(x\) being NE of \(z\). No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., N, E, S, W, NW, SW, SE, B) holds under these constraints, as they require additional or conflicting spatial conditions not guaranteed by the given relations.

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.
