PROMPT: Let NW and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the cardinal direction relations where region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is B of region \(z\), the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the bounding box constraints as follows:

- **NW (North West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) in the x-axis and \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) in the y-axis. Specifically, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  Example: \(x\) in \([0, 1] \times [5, 6]\), \(y\) in \([2, 4] \times [2, 4]\), \(z\) in \([1, 5] \times [1, 5]\). Here, \(x\) is NW of \(y\) and \(y\) is B of \(z\), leading to \(x\) NW \(z\).

- **W (West)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) in the x-axis, and \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\) in the y-axis. Specifically, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Example: \(x\) in \([0, 1] \times [4.5, 4.6]\), \(y\) in \([2, 4] \times [2, 4]\), \(z\) in \([1, 5] \times [1, 5]\). Here, \(x\) is NW of \(y\) and \(y\) is B of \(z\), leading to \(x\) W \(z\).

- **N (North)**: This occurs when \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) in the y-axis, and \(x\) is horizontally contained within \(z\) in the x-axis. Specifically, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  Example: \(x\) in \([2, 3] \times [4, 5]\), \(y\) in \([2, 4] \times [2, 4]\), \(z\) in \([1, 4] \times [1, 3]\). Here, \(x\) is NW of \(y\) and \(y\) is B of \(z\), leading to \(x\) N \(z\).

- **B (Bounding box)**: This occurs when \(x\) is entirely contained within the bounding box of \(z\). Specifically, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
  Example: \(x\) in \([1.2, 1.8] \times [4.5, 4.6]\), \(y\) in \([2, 4] \times [2, 4]\), \(z\) in \([1, 5] \times [1, 5]\). Here, \(x\) is NW of \(y\) and \(y\) is B of \(z\), leading to \(x\) B \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relations (S, SW, E, SE, NE) are possible given the constraints that \(x\) is northwest of \(y\) (implying \(x\) is above and left of \(y\)) and \(y\) is contained in \(z\) (implying \(z\) surrounds \(y\)).
