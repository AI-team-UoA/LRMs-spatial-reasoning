PROMPT: Let SW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the following conditions hold based on the definition of SW:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Chaining these inequalities:

- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

These conditions satisfy the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\):
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) is possible because:
- Relations like W or S require additional constraints (e.g., y-axis coverage for W, x-axis coverage for S) that are not met.
- Other relations (N, NE, E, NW, SE, B) have conflicting requirements (e.g., NE requires \(x\) to be northeast of \(z\), which contradicts the derived inequalities).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is SW.
