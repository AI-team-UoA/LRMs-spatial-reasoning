PROMPT: Let E and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the conditions:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is B of region \(z\):  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Vertical constraints**:  
   From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), satisfying the vertical condition for both B and E relations between \(x\) and \(z\).

2. **Horizontal constraints**:  
   - From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   This gives \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) or \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\), depending on \(\sup_x(z)\).

Two cases arise for the horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

- **Case 1: \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\)**  
  Here, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) holds, satisfying the horizontal condition for E. Combined with the vertical constraints, \(x\) is E of \(z\).

- **Case 2: \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\)**  
  Here, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) holds. If additionally \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then the horizontal condition for B is satisfied. Combined with the vertical constraints, \(x\) is B of \(z\). If \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\), no defined cardinal direction relation holds under the given 9 relations, but this case does not yield a new valid relation beyond B or E in the composition.

After evaluating all possibilities, the valid relations that can occur between \(x\) and \(z\) are **B** and **E**. No other cardinal direction relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW) are possible due to contradictions in their defining conditions with the given constraints.

**Possible relations: B, E**
