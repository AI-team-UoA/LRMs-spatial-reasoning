PROMPT: Let NE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is NE of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by analyzing the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) constraints:

- **Horizontal constraints**: \(\text{inf}_x(x) \geq \text{sup}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). This allows:
  - \(x\) entirely west of \(z\) (W relation) if \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).
  - \(x\) entirely east of \(z\) (E relation) if \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).
  - Overlap horizontally (possible B or N if other conditions hold).

- **Vertical constraints**: \(\text{inf}_y(x) \geq \text{sup}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). This implies \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\). This allows:
  - \(x\) entirely north of \(z\) (N or part of NW/NE) if \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).
  - Vertical overlap (possible B, W, or E if additional conditions hold).

Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

1. **NW**: If \(x\) is west of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)) and north of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).
2. **W**: If \(x\) is west of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)) and vertically overlaps with \(z\), but with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (required for W relation).
3. **NE**: If \(x\) is east of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) and north of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).
4. **E**: If \(x\) is east of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) and vertically overlaps with \(z\), but with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (required for E relation).
5. **N**: If horizontally, \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s (\(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\)), and vertically \(x\) is north of \(z\) (\(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).
6. **B**: If \(z\)'s bounding box contains \(x\)'s in both axes: \(\text{inf}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

Relations S, SE, and SW are impossible due to vertical constraints ensuring \(x\) is not south of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations are B, E, N, NE, NW, W.

**Answer**: B, E, N, NE, NW, W
