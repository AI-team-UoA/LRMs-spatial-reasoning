PROMPT: Let NW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined, given that region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible relations between x and z are derived from the constraints:

- From x NW y: 
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely left of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is entirely below x)
- From y S z:
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is entirely below z)
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

Considering these, the possible relations between x and z are:
- **NW**: x is northwest of z (if x is left and above z).
- **B**: x is within the bounding box of z (if x is horizontally and vertically contained within z).
- **SW**: x is southwest of z (if x is left and below z).
- **W**: x is west of z (if x is left of z and vertically within z).
- **S**: x is south of z (if x is below z and horizontally within z).
- **N**: x is north of z (if z is below x and x is horizontally within z).

The relations NE, SE, and E are not possible due to conflicts in horizontal and vertical constraints. Thus, the possible relations are NW, B, SW, W, S, N.

**Answer: NW, B, SW, W, S, N**
