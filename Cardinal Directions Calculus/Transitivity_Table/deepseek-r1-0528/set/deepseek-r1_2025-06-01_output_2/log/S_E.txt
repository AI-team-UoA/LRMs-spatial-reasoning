PROMPT: Let S and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is S of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- From \(x\) S \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(y\))  
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within the x-range of \(y\))  

- From \(y\) E \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(y\))  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is vertically within the y-range of \(z\))  

Combining these:  
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\)).  
- Vertically:  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (from \(x\) S \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\))  
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) E \(z\))  

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\inf_y(x)\) relative to \(\inf_y(z)\):  
1. **Case 1: \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\)**  
   - Then \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) hold.  
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) E \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal)  
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical)  

2. **Case 2: \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\)**  
   - Additionally, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) must hold for a valid cardinal relation.  
   - Then \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).  
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) SE \(z\):  
     - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal)  
     - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertical)  

If \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) > \inf_y(z)\), the vertical projections overlap, but no cardinal direction relation (as defined) holds because \(x\) is not entirely in one tile relative to \(z\) (e.g., partially in SE and E tiles). However, given the constraints of the regions (homeomorphic to a closed disk) and the relations, this case does not yield a valid cardinal relation among the nine. Thus, it is excluded.  

Other relations (N, NE, S, NW, W, SW, B) are impossible due to the horizontal and vertical constraints derived.  

Therefore, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are E and SE.  

**Final Answer: SE, E**
