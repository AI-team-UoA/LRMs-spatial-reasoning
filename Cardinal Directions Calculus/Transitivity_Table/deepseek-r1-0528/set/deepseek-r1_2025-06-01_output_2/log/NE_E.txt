PROMPT: Let NE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints provided:

- Region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(y\) is left of \(x\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\))
- Region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(y\))
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical extent of \(z\) covers \(y\))

Combining the constraints:
- From \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(x\)).
- For the \(y\)-axis:
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (since \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) from \(x\) NE \(y\) and \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\)).
  - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- The relation between \(\sup_y(z)\) and \(\inf_y(x)\) determines possible vertical relations:
  - If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\):
    - \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
    - Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\), this implies \(x\) is NE of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) NE \(z\)).
  - If \(\sup_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\):
    - The vertical extent of \(z\) must cover \(x\) for consistency with the connected regions and bounding boxes.
    - Specifically, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) must hold (as \(z\)'s bounding box vertically contains \(x\)).
    - Combined with \(z\) left of \(x\) and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this implies \(x\) is E of \(z\) (i.e., \(x\) E \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are NE and E.
