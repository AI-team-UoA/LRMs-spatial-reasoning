PROMPT: Let NE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints that region \(x\) is NE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- **Vertical Constraint**: From \(y\) N \(z\), \(z\) is entirely below \(y\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)). From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(y\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), implying \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)). This restricts possible relations to those where \(x\) is above \(z\): N, NE, or NW.

- **Horizontal Constraints**:
  - From \(x\) NE \(y\), \(y\) is entirely left of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
  - From \(y\) N \(z\), \(z\) horizontally contains \(y\) (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
  - Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

The horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_x(z)\):
1. **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)  
   The entire \(z\) is left of \(x\), and with \(z\) below \(x\), the relation \(x\) NE \(z\) holds (satisfies \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
2. **Case 2**: \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\)  
   Here, \(z\) extends rightward at least to the start of \(x\). For \(x\) to be N of \(z\), the horizontal projection of \(x\) must be contained in \(z\)'s (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)). We have \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) from above, and if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) N \(z\) holds. If \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\), no defined relation fits, but the condition \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) is achievable, making N possible.

- **NW Consideration**: \(x\) NW \(z\) requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies equality and degenerate bounding boxes, which are invalid for regions homeomorphic to a disk. Thus, NW is impossible.

**Conclusion**: The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **NE** (if \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\))
- **N** (if \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\), ensuring horizontal containment)

Thus, the possible relations are **N** and **NE**.

**Answer**: N, NE
