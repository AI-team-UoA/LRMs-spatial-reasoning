PROMPT: Let W and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From \(y\) N \(z\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- Chaining horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) in \(x\) W \(y\)), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) requires:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\): \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\): \(z\) is below \(x\), meaning \(x\) is above \(z\).

Checking the definitions:
- **NW** relation: \(a\) NW \(b\) iff \(\sup_x(a) \leq \inf_x(b)\) and \(\sup_y(b) \leq \inf_y(a)\).  
  Here, \(a = x\), \(b = z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) holds.  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) holds.  

No other relations satisfy both conditions simultaneously:
- **SW** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), but we have \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which is incompatible.
- **W** requires vertical containment (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), contradicted by \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **N** requires horizontal containment (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), not \(\leq\).
- Other relations (S, E, SE, NE, B) fail due to mismatched horizontal or vertical constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NW.
