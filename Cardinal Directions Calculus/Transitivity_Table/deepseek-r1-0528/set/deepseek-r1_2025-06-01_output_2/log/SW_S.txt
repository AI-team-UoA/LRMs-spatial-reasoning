PROMPT: Let SW and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) means \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) S \(z\) means \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From \(y\) S \(z\), \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \inf_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x)\) (using \(x\) SW \(y\)), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is always below \(z\) vertically.

Horizontally, two cases arise:

1. **Case where \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies the definition of \(x\) SW \(z\).

2. **Case where \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(x)\)** (and from \(x\) SW \(y\) and \(y\) S \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)):
   - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)). With \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), this satisfies \(x\) S \(z\).

In all scenarios, the relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are either SW or S. Other relations (like SE, E, W, etc.) are not possible due to the vertical constraint and horizontal conditions derived.

Thus, the possible relations are **SW** and **S**.
