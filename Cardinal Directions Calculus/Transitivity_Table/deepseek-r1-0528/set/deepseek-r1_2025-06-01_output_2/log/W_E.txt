PROMPT: Let W and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

The relations between \(x\) and \(z\) depend on their relative horizontal and vertical positions, considering both are constrained to the left of \(y\) horizontally and within \(y\)'s vertical bounds. All nine cardinal direction relations are possible:

- **N (North)**: If \(x\) is above \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **NE (North East)**: If \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\).
- **E (East)**: If \(x\) is to the right of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **SE (South East)**: If \(x\) is below and to the right of \(z\).
- **S (South)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) with horizontal containment.
- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\).
- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is to the left of \(z\) with vertical containment.
- **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: If \(x\) is contained within \(z\)'s bounding box.

Examples exist for each case, satisfying the initial constraints. Thus, all relations are possible.

**Possible relations**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
