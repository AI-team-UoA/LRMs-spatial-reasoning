PROMPT: Let S and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- \(y\) is B of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

### Analysis of \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **Horizontal relations**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning the horizontal projection of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relations**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(y\) B \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
   - However, the relation between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\) determines possible cases:
     - **Case 1: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:
       - This satisfies the condition for \(x\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) with horizontal containment.
       - Thus, \(x\) can be S of \(z\).
     - **Case 2: \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)**:
       - Additionally, if \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), the vertical bounds satisfy \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), with horizontal containment, so \(x\) can be B of \(z\).
       - If \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\), no defined cardinal relation holds (not one of the nine), but this case is possible yet not reportable per the query.

### Possible Relations:
- \(x\) can be **S** of \(z\) (Case 1).
- \(x\) can be **B** of \(z\) (Case 2 with \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\)).

No other cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, SW) are possible due to horizontal containment and vertical constraints.

**Final Answer: S, B**
