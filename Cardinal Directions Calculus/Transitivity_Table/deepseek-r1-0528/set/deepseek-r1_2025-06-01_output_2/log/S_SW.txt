PROMPT: Let S and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions and the given relations:

- \(x\) is S of \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
- \(y\) is SW of \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Chaining these constraints:

1. **Vertical direction (y-axis)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
   - Since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\), we have \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

2. **Horizontal direction (x-axis)**:
   - From \(x\) S \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of SW:  
\(x\) is SW of \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, B) satisfies both constraints simultaneously:
- **S** requires \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (which holds) but also \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), which contradict \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (since \(\inf_x(z) \leq \sup_x(z)\) but \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(x)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) or equality, violating \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).
- **W** requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (holds) but also \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), which contradict \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (since \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(x)\) implies \(\inf_y(z) > \inf_y(x)\), violating \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- Other relations (N, NE, SE, E, NW, B) fail due to mismatched vertical/horizontal constraints.

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.
