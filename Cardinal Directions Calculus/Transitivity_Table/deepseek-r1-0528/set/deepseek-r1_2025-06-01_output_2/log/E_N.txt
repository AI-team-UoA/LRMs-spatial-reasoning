PROMPT: Let E and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is N of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),  
  \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From these constraints:  
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This satisfies the vertical condition for \(x\) being north of \(z\) (as \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).  
- Horizontally: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). However, the relationship between \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(z)\) determines the horizontal condition.

Possible cases:  
1. **If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)**:  
   - The horizontal condition for \(x\) NE \(z\) is satisfied: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - Thus, \(x\) NE \(z\) is possible.  
2. **If \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\)**:  
   - The horizontal condition for \(x\) N \(z\) is satisfied: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), along with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   - Thus, \(x\) N \(z\) is possible.  

Other relations (e.g., E, SE, S, etc.) are not possible due to violations in vertical or horizontal constraints:  
- \(x\) E \(z\) requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and vertical conditions that conflict (since \(x\) is above \(z\)).  
- \(x\) SE \(z\) requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(x\) below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(z\).  
- \(x\) S \(z\) requires \(x\) below \(z\), but \(x\) is above \(z\).  
- Similarly, W, NW, SW, and B are ruled out due to horizontal or vertical mismatches.  

The case where \(\sup_x(z) > \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) > \sup_x(z)\) does not fit any base relation (due to lack of horizontal containment for N and insufficient western separation for NE), but it does not yield a new valid base relation. Only N and NE are achievable under the given constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N and NE**.
