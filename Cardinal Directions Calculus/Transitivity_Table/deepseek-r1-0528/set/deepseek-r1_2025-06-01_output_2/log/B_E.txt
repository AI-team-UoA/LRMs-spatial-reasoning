PROMPT: Let B and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- **x B y**: This means region x is contained within the bounding box of region y. Thus:
  - \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (left edge of y is left of or equal to left edge of x)
  - \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\) (right edge of x is right of or equal to right edge of y)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) (bottom edge of y is below or equal to bottom edge of x)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\) (top edge of x is above or equal to top edge of y)

- **y E z**: This means region y is East of region z. Thus:
  - \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (right edge of z is left of or equal to left edge of y)
  - \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (bottom edge of z is below or equal to bottom edge of y)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (top edge of y is above or equal to top edge of z)

To determine the possible relations between x and z:

### Horizontal Analysis:
- From y E z: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\)
- From x B y: \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
- Combining: \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)
- This implies the entire region z is to the left of region x, as the rightmost point of z is left of the leftmost point of x.

### Vertical Analysis:
- From y E z: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)
- From x B y: \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\)
- Combining:
  - \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) → \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)
  - \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) → \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)
- This implies the vertical span of x is contained within the vertical span of z.

### Resulting Relation:
- The horizontal condition (\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\)) matches the requirement for x being East of z (E relation).
- The vertical conditions (\(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)) match the vertical containment required for the E relation.
- Thus, **x E z** must hold.

### Why Other Relations Are Impossible:
- **B, N, S, NE, NW, SE, SW, W**: These either require overlap in x-axis (e.g., B, W), vertical misalignment (e.g., N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW), or specific positioning that contradicts the derived conditions. For example:
  - **B**: Requires \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(z)\), but \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), impossible.
  - **N**: Requires \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x)\) imply \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) forces degeneracy.
  - **NE, SE, NW, SW**: Require vertical separation (e.g., \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) for NE), which conflicts with \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) and non-degeneracy.
  - **W**: Requires x to be left of z, contradicting \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).

### Conclusion:
The only possible relation between region x and region z is **E**.
