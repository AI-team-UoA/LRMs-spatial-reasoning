PROMPT: Let E and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is E of \(y\): \(y\) is entirely to the west of \(x\), with the vertical span of \(x\) contained within that of \(y\) (i.e., \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)).
- \(y\) is S of \(z\): \(y\) is entirely below \(z\), with the horizontal span of \(y\) contained within that of \(z\) (i.e., \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(x\) is entirely below \(z\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\) and \(x\) E \(y\)), meaning \(z\) starts west of \(x\).
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) E \(y\)), so \(\inf_x(x)\) is at least \(\sup_x(y)\).

The possible horizontal scenarios are:
1. **Horizontal containment of \(x\) within \(z\)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), then \(x\) is directly below \(z\) with horizontal containment, satisfying \(x\) S \(z\).
2. **No horizontal overlap, \(x\) east of \(z\)**: If \(\sup_x(z) < \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely to the east and below \(z\), satisfying \(x\) SE \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- \(B\), \(N\), \(NE\), \(NW\), \(W\), \(SW\), \(E\): These require vertical or horizontal conditions not met (e.g., \(x\) cannot be north, inside, or west of \(z\) due to vertical separation and horizontal alignment).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **S** and **SE**.

**Final Answer: S, SE**
