PROMPT: Let SW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is W of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Horizontal constraint**:  
   \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (from \(x\) SW \(y\)) and \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) (from \(y\) W \(z\)).  
   Chaining these: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraint**:  
   - From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
   This gives \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), but no direct inequality between \(\text{sup}_y(x)\) and \(\text{inf}_y(z)\). Two cases arise:

   - **Case 1**: \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).  
     Then \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (satisfies SW condition vertically). Combined with the horizontal constraint, \(x\) is SW of \(z\).

   - **Case 2**: \(\text{inf}_y(z) < \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).  
     Additionally, if \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\) (vertical span of \(x\) contained within \(z\)), then \(x\) is W of \(z\).  
     This is achievable without violating the original constraints (e.g., with appropriate vertical alignments).

Other relations are impossible:
- **NW**: Requires \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), leading to \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), implying \(\text{inf}_y(x) = \text{sup}_y(x)\), which contradicts the region being a disk (has area).
- **S, SE, E, NE, N, B**: Violate the horizontal constraint (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) forces west-only relations) or vertical conditions.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** and **W**.
