PROMPT: Let NW and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are analyzed as follows:

- **Horizontal relations**:  
  From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\).  
  From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\).  
  Chaining: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), so \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). This implies \(x\) is west of \(z\), restricting possible relations to W, NW, or SW.

- **Vertical relations**:  
  From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).  
  From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\).  
  Chaining: \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), so \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\).  

  - **Case 1**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), then \(x\) is NW of \(z\) (satisfies NW definition: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\)).  
  - **Case 2**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) > \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is W of \(z\) (satisfies W definition: \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\)).  
  - SW is impossible because \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) would require \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), implying degeneracy (contradiction for non-degenerate regions).

**Possible relations**: NW and W.  
- **NW** occurs when the top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\).  
- **W** occurs when the top of \(z\) is above the bottom of \(x\) and the top of \(x\) is at or below the top of \(z\).  

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, B) are excluded due to horizontal west constraint and vertical incompatibility.

**Answer**: NW, W
