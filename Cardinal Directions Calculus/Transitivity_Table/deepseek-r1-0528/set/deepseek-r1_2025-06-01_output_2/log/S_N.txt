PROMPT: Let S and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are S (South), N (North), and B (bounding box). These relations arise due to the horizontal containment derived from the given conditions and the vertical positioning relative to y.

- **x S z (x is South of z)**: This is possible if x is vertically below z, satisfying the conditions derived from the horizontal alignment and vertical constraints.
- **x N z (x is North of z)**: This is possible if x is vertically above z, based on the relative vertical positions and horizontal containment.
- **x B z (x is within the bounding box of z)**: This is possible if z's bounding box contains x's bounding box both horizontally and vertically, which is consistent with the horizontal containment and possible vertical overlap or containment.

No other cardinal direction relations (e.g., SW, W, NW, NE, E, SE) are possible because the horizontal conditions derived from x S y and y N z imply that x is horizontally within z's bounding box (i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), which prevents any diagonal or perpendicular relations that require horizontal misalignment.

Thus, the possible relations are S, N, and B.
