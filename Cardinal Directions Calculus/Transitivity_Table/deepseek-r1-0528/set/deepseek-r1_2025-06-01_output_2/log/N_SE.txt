PROMPT: Let N and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the constraints:

- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(y\) is entirely below \(x\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is within the bounds of \(y\))

- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(z\) is entirely left of \(y\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is entirely below \(z\))

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Horizontally**: From \(y\) SE \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\). From \(x\) N \(y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(z\). This rules out relations requiring \(x\) to be left of \(z\) (W, NW, SW) or horizontally overlapping without specific vertical alignment (N, S, B).

2. **Vertically**: The vertical position of \(x\) relative to \(z\) can vary:
   - If \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), then \(x\) is **NE** of \(z\) (satisfies NE: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
   - If \(x\) is entirely below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is **SE** of \(z\) (satisfies SE: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
   - If \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)), then \(x\) is **E** of \(z\) (satisfies E: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

These three cases are mutually exclusive and cover all possible atomic relations given the constraints. Examples can be constructed for each (e.g., specific bounding box arrangements satisfying \(x\) N \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) while achieving NE, SE, or E between \(x\) and \(z\)).

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are **NE, SE, E**.
