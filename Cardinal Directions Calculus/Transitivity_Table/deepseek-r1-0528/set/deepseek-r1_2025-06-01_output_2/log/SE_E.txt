PROMPT: Let SE and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are E (East) and SE (South East).

- **E (East)**: This relation is possible when the vertical conditions allow the bounding box of \(x\) to be contained within the vertical range of \(z\)'s bounding box, specifically \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), while the horizontal condition \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is satisfied from the given constraints.
- **SE (South East)**: This relation is possible when \(x\) is completely below \(z\) vertically, specifically \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), while the horizontal condition \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is satisfied.

Other relations, such as NE (North East), are impossible because the vertical constraints derived from \(x\) SE \(y\) and \(y\) E \(z\) prevent \(x\) from being north of \(z\). Similarly, relations like N, S, SW, W, NW, and B are not possible due to the horizontal separation where \(x\) is east of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), which rules out west and overlapping horizontal projections.

Thus, the possible relations are E and SE.

**Final Answer: E, SE**
