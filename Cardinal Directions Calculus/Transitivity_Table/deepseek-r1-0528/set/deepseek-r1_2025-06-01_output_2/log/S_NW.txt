PROMPT: Let S and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW. This is determined by the constraints from the given relations:

- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). This means x is south of y and horizontally within the x-range of y.
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y). This means y is northwest of z, so y is left and above z.

Combining these:
- Horizontally, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This implies x is always to the left of z.
- Vertically, both supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), meaning both x and z are below y, but their relative vertical positions can vary.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- **SW (South West)**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is below and left of z.
- **W (West)**: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x is left of z and vertically within the y-range of z.
- **NW (North West)**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), x is above and left of z.

Other relations are impossible due to the horizontal separation (x left of z) and the lack of vertical alignment required for directions like S, N, E, etc.

Thus, the possible relations are SW, W, and NW.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
