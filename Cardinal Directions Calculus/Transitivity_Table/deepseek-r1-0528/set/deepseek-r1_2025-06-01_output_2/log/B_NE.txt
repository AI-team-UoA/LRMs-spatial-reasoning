PROMPT: Let B and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE (north-east) of region \(z\), the possible relation between region \(x\) and region \(z\) is NE (north-east).

### Explanation:
- The relation \(x\) B \(y\) means that \(x\) is contained within the bounding box of \(y\). Specifically:
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- The relation \(y\) NE \(z\) means that \(y\) is north-east of \(z\), so:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these:
- From \(y\) NE \(z\), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and from \(x\) B \(y\), \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- From \(y\) NE \(z\), \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and from \(x\) B \(y\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) define the NE relation between \(x\) and \(z\). Therefore, \(x\) must be NE of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) is possible, as they would require additional or conflicting conditions (e.g., for E, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) would conflict with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which implies regions cannot have area, contradicting the definition of regions in REG).

Thus, the only possible relation is NE.
