PROMPT: Let SE and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes.

- From \(x\) SE \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

These inequalities imply that \(x\) is always southeast of \(y\) and below \(y\) in the y-direction, while \(z\) is east of \(y\) and contains or extends beyond \(y\) in the y-direction. Combining these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **SW (South West)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- **S (South)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- **SE (South East)**: Possible if \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **W (West)**: Possible if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) (y-overlap), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **E (East)**: Possible if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) (y-overlap), \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- **B (Bounding box)**: Possible if \(\inf_y(z) \leq \sup_y(x)\) (y-overlap), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The relations N, NE, and NW are impossible because \(x\) is below \(y\) and \(z\) contains or is at least as north as \(y\), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, SE, W, E, and B.
