PROMPT: Let B and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- Region \(x\) is \(B\) of region \(y\):  
  \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\),  
  \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is \(SE\) of region \(z\):  
  \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\), \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

Combining these:  
- \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) → \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\).  
- \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) → \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

These inequalities satisfy the definition of \(x\) being \(SE\) of \(z\):  
\(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible, as they require conditions that contradict the above (e.g., \(E\) requires \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), but \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) implies \(\text{inf}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), violating \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) unless degenerate, which is excluded as regions are homeomorphic to a closed disk and non-degenerate).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is \(SE\).
