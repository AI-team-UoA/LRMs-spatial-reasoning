PROMPT: Let S and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations and the definitions provided:

- \(x\) S \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (vertically, \(x\) is entirely below \(y\))
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is contained within the \(x\)-bounds of \(y\))

- \(y\) S \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is entirely below \(z\))
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is contained within the \(x\)-bounds of \(z\))

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).
- Horizontally: 
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

Thus, the relation \(x\) S \(z\) holds because:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (satisfies the vertical condition for S).
- \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (satisfies the horizontal containment for S).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, B, NW, W, SW) is possible because:
- The vertical condition requires \(x\) to be below \(z\), ruling out N, NE, NW, and B (which would require \(x\) to be above or overlapping vertically).
- The horizontal containment requires \(x\) to be within the \(x\)-bounds of \(z\), ruling out E, W, SE, SW, NE, NW (which require horizontal misalignment).

Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **S**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{S}}
