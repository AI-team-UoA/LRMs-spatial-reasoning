PROMPT: Let E and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) E \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
- \(y\) W \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

Combining these:
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
- \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so both \(x\) and \(z\) start to the right of \(y\).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **E (East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Example: \(y\) has \(x\)-interval \([0, 10]\), \(z\) has \([10, 14]\), \(x\) has \([15, 20]\). Then \(x\) E \(z\).
2. **W (West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Example: \(y\) has \([0, 10]\), \(x\) has \([10, 14]\), \(z\) has \([15, 20]\). Then \(x\) W \(z\).
3. **B (Bounding box)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (with the \(y\)-conditions already satisfied).
   - Example: \(y\) has \([0, 10]\), \(z\) has \([10, 20]\), \(x\) has \([12, 15]\). Then \(x\) B \(z\).

Other relations are impossible:
- **S, SW, SE, N, NW, NE**: Require vertical separation (e.g., \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) or \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)), but the \(y\)-constraints force \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s span, preventing pure vertical or diagonal relations.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **E, W, B**.
