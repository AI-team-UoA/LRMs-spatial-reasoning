PROMPT: Let N and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW. This is derived from the constraints imposed by the relations:

- From x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- From y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

These inequalities imply that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), meaning x is entirely to the west of z. The y-coordinate constraints allow for three scenarios:
- If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is NW of z.
- If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is W of z.
- If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is SW of z.

All other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are impossible due to the west positioning and the specific y-coordinate bounds.

Thus, the possible relations are NW, W, and SW.
