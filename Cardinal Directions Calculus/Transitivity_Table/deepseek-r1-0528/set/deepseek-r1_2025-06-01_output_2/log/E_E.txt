PROMPT: Let E and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- If region \(x\) is E of region \(y\), then:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\),
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- If region \(y\) is E of region \(z\), then:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\),
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), leading to \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
   - From \(x\) E \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).
   - Combining:
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
     - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) satisfy the definition of \(x\) being E of \(z\). Other relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW, B) do not hold due to violations in horizontal or vertical constraints (e.g., insufficient horizontal overlap for B, vertical misalignment for S/N, or conflicting bounds for diagonal relations).

Thus, the only possible relation is **E**.
