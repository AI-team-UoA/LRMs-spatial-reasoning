PROMPT: Let E and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely to the right of \(y\)),
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (i.e., \(y\)'s y-interval contains \(x\)'s y-interval vertically).
- Region \(y\) is NW of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (i.e., \(y\) is entirely to the left of \(z\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is entirely below \(y\)).

Combining these:
- Vertically: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
- Horizontally: Both \(x\) and \(z\) are to the right of \(y\) (\(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\)), but their relative horizontal positions can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **N (North)**: If \(x\) is entirely above \(z\) (satisfied vertically) and \(z\)'s x-interval contains \(x\)'s x-interval horizontally. This occurs when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- **NE (North East)**: If \(x\) is above and to the right of \(z\). This requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entire \(z\) left of \(x\)) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied vertically).
- **NW (North West)**: If \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\). This requires \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (entire \(x\) left of \(z\)) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied vertically).

These are the only possible relations, as other directions (E, SE, S, SW, W, B) are incompatible with \(z\) being entirely below \(x\) and the horizontal constraints.

Possible relations: **N, NE, NW**
