PROMPT: Let NW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (x is north of y)
- Region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (y is south of z, so z is north of y)

The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

1. **Horizontal arrangement** (x-axis):
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are west of \(y\), but their relative positions can vary:
     - \(x\) west of \(z\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
     - \(z\) west of \(x\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)

2. **Vertical arrangement** (y-axis):
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are north of \(y\), but their relative positions can vary:
     - \(x\) north of \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
     - \(z\) north of \(x\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Combining these, the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:

- **NE (Northeast)**:  
  Occurs if \(z\) is west of \(x\) and \(z\) is south of \(x\) (so \(x\) is northeast of \(z\)).
- **SE (Southeast)**:  
  Occurs if \(z\) is west of \(x\) and \(x\) is south of \(z\) (so \(x\) is southeast of \(z\)).
- **NW (Northwest)**:  
  Occurs if \(x\) is west of \(z\) and \(x\) is north of \(z\) (so \(x\) is northwest of \(z\)).
- **SW (Southwest)**:  
  Occurs if \(x\) is west of \(z\) and \(x\) is south of \(z\) (so \(x\) is southwest of \(z\)).

These four relations are possible and mutually exclusive. Other relations (B, S, W, N, E) are not possible due to the constraints and lack of containment or alignment.

Thus, the possible relations are **NE, SE, NW, SW**.
