PROMPT: Let B and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is B (bounding box) of region \(y\):  
  \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\),  
  \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\),  
  \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).

Combining these constraints:

1. **Horizontal constraint for \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from \(y\) W \(z\)) imply:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical constraint for \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   - From \(x\) B \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
   - From \(y\) W \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\), so:  
   \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). This means the vertical extent of \(x\) is contained within the vertical extent of \(z\).

The relation \(x\) W \(z\) requires:  
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (satisfied by the horizontal constraint),  
- \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (satisfied),  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (satisfied).  

Thus, \(x\) W \(z\) is possible.  

Other relations are not possible:  
- **N, S, NE, SE, NW, SW**: Require specific vertical alignments (e.g., \(x\) entirely above, below, or diagonal to \(z\)) that contradict the vertical containment \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
- **E**: Requires \(x\) to be east of \(z\), but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) forces \(x\) west of \(z\).  
- **B**: Requires \(z\)'s bounding box to contain \(x\)'s, but \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) prevents horizontal containment.  

Therefore, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **W**.
