PROMPT: Let SE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is N of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes. The relations are determined by the relative positions based on the definitions provided.

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\), meaning \(x\) is to the right and below \(y\).
- \(y\) N \(z\) implies \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), meaning \(y\) is above \(z\) and horizontally within \(z\)'s bounds.

Considering these, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:
- **N (North)**: \(x\) can be north of \(z\) if \(z\) is low vertically and \(x\) is within \(z\)'s horizontal bounds.
- **NE (Northeast)**: \(x\) can be northeast of \(z\) if \(x\) is to the right and above \(z\).
- **E (East)**: \(x\) can be east of \(z\) if \(x\) is to the right and vertically aligned within \(z\)'s bounds.
- **SE (Southeast)**: \(x\) can be southeast of \(z\) if \(x\) is to the right and below \(z\).
- **S (South)**: \(x\) can be south of \(z\) if \(x\) is below and within \(z\)'s horizontal bounds.
- **B (Bounding box)**: \(x\) can be within \(z\)'s bounding box if \(z\) is large enough to contain \(x\) horizontally and vertically.

The relations SW, W, and NW are impossible because \(x\) is always to the right of \(y\) (due to \(x\) SE \(y\)), and \(y\) is not left of \(z\) (due to \(y\) N \(z\)), so \(x\) cannot be west of \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

\boxed{\text{N}} \quad \boxed{\text{NE}} \quad \boxed{\text{E}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{B}}
