PROMPT: Let N and B be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\),
  - \(\text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\),
  - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y)\).

- \(y\) is B of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y)\),
  - \(\text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\),
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y)\),
  - \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).

Chaining these inequalities:

1. \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) → \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\).
2. \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) → \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\).
3. \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) → \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\).
4. \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z)\), and since \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(x)\), we have \(\text{supy}(y) \leq \min(\text{infy}(x), \text{supy}(z))\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\text{supy}(z)\) and \(\text{infy}(x)\):

- **Case 1: \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\)**  
  Then:
  - \(\text{supy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\) (satisfies the y-condition for N),
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) and \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\) (satisfy the x-conditions for N).  
  Thus, \(x\) **N** \(z\).

- **Case 2: \(\text{supy}(z) > \text{infy}(x)\)**  
  Then the y-intervals overlap partially. For \(x\) to be B of \(z\), we additionally need \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\). If this holds:
  - \(\text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\),
  - \(\text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z)\),
  - \(\text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(x)\),
  - \(\text{supy}(x) \leq \text{supy}(z)\).  
  Thus, \(x\) **B** \(z\).

Other relations (NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW) are impossible because:
- The x-interval of \(x\) is nested within \(z\) (contradicting E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW).
- The y-position of \(x\) starts above \(z\)'s bottom and may extend above \(z\)'s top (contradicting S, SW, SE, etc.).
- Specific conditions for these relations (e.g., \(\text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x)\) for E) are violated by the nested x-intervals.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N** and **B**.
