PROMPT: Let SW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is N of \(z\): \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), and \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{sup}_x(y)\).

Combining these:
- From \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\), it follows that \(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\). This means \(x\) is entirely to the west of \(z\).
- Vertically, both \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\), but the relative vertical positions of \(x\) and \(z\) are not fixed.

Possible vertical relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **SW (South West)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is below \(z\), resulting in SW.
2. **NW (North West)**: If \(\text{sup}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\), then \(x\) is above \(z\), resulting in NW.
3. **W (West)**: If \(\text{inf}_y(z) \leq \text{inf}_y(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{sup}_y(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounds, resulting in W.

These are the only atomic relations possible under the constraints, as other relations (e.g., B, S, N, E, NE, SE) are incompatible with the horizontal separation (\(\text{sup}_x(x) \leq \text{inf}_x(z)\)).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, NW, and W.
