PROMPT: Let E and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is E of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relation between region x and region z is SE (South East).

### Explanation:
- From y SE z: 
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
- From x E y:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (y is to the left of x)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of y is at or below the bottom of x)
  - supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (the top of x is at or below the top of y)

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is to the left of x).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).

The conditions supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) satisfy the definition of SE (South East) for the relation between x and z. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible given the constraints and the requirement that regions are in REG (closed, connected, with connected boundaries).

Thus, the only possible relation is SE.

\boxed{\text{SE}}
