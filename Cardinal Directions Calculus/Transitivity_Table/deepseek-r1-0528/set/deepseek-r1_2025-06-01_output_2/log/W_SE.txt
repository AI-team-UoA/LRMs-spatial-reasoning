PROMPT: Let W and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is W of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SE of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived as follows:

- The vertical constraint from \(x\) W \(y\) and \(y\) SE \(z\) ensures that \(supy(x) \leq infy(z)\), meaning \(x\) is below \(z\).
- Horizontally, three scenarios are possible:
  1. If \(x\) is entirely to the left of \(z\) (\(supx(x) \leq infx(z)\)), then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).
  2. If \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\) (\(supx(z) \leq infx(x)\)), then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).
  3. If the horizontal interval of \(x\) is contained within that of \(z\) (\(infx(z) \leq infx(x)\) and \(supx(x) \leq supx(z)\)), then \(x\) is S of \(z\).

These scenarios are mutually exclusive and cover all possible horizontal alignments given the constraints. Thus, the possible relations are SW, S, and SE.

**Final Answer: SW, S, SE**
