PROMPT: Let W and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) W \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) SW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)

Chaining these constraints:

1. **X-coordinate constraint**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. **Y-coordinate constraint**:  
   \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) match the definition of the SW (South West) relation between \(x\) and \(z\):

- \(x\) SW \(z\) if and only if \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, S, NW, W, B) satisfies both constraints simultaneously under the given conditions. For example:
- **W requires** \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), which is not necessarily true (e.g., if \(\inf_y(x) = 4\) and \(\inf_y(z) = 6\)).
- **S requires** \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\inf_x(x) \leq \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) implies \(\inf_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), with equality only in degenerate cases (excluded for regions in REG).

Thus, the only possible relation is SW.
