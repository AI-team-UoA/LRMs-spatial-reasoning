PROMPT: Let E and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Region \(x\) is E of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).

- Region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (i.e., \(x\) is entirely below \(z\)).
- Horizontally, both \(\inf_x(x) \geq \sup_x(y)\) and \(\inf_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y)\), but the relative positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary.

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
1. **S (South)**: If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (horizontal projection of \(x\) contained within \(z\)), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (already satisfied).  
   *Example*: \(y\) has bbox \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) has \([1,2] \times [0.2,0.8]\), \(z\) has \([1,3] \times [2,3]\). Then \(x\) is S of \(z\).

2. **SW (South West)**: If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (entirely west) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (satisfied).  
   *Example*: \(y\) has \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) has \([1,1.5] \times [0.2,0.8]\), \(z\) has \([1.6,3] \times [2,3]\). Then \(x\) is SW of \(z\).

3. **SE (South East)**: If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (entirely east) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (satisfied).  
   *Example*: \(y\) has \([0,1] \times [0,1]\), \(x\) has \([2.5,3] \times [0.2,0.8]\), \(z\) has \([1.5,2.4] \times [2,3]\). Then \(x\) is SE of \(z\).

Other relations (N, NE, E, W, NW, B) are impossible because:
- \(x\) is below \(z\) vertically, ruling out N, NE, E, NW, W (which require north, east, or west overlaps without south).
- B requires \(z\)'s bbox contains \(x\)'s, but \(\inf_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y) \geq \sup_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(y)\) do not guarantee \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and vertical separation violates containment.

Thus, the possible relations are **S, SW, SE**.
