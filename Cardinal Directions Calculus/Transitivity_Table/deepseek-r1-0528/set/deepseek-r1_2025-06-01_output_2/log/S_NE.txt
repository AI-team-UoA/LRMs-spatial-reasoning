PROMPT: Let S and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- **x S y**: This means region x is entirely south of region y. Specifically:
  - The supremum of the y-coordinates of x is less than or equal to the infimum of the y-coordinates of y: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
  - The x-range of x is contained within the x-range of y: \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\).

- **y NE z**: This means region y is entirely northeast of region z. Specifically:
  - The supremum of the x-coordinates of z is less than or equal to the infimum of the x-coordinates of y: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
  - The supremum of the y-coordinates of z is less than or equal to the infimum of the y-coordinates of y: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

From these, we derive the relationship between x and z:

1. **Horizontal relation**:
   - From **x S y**: \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - From **y NE z**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - Combining: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means z is entirely to the west of x (x is east of z).

2. **Vertical relation**:
   - From **x S y**: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - From **y NE z**: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
   - Both x and z are below y, but their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed. Three cases arise:
     - **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**:  
       z is entirely below x. Combined with the horizontal, x is **NE** (northeast) of z.
     - **Case 2: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**:  
       x is entirely below z. Combined with the horizontal, x is **SE** (southeast) of z.
     - **Case 3: Vertical containment of x in z**:  
       \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\).  
       This means x is vertically within the y-range of z. Combined with the horizontal, x is **E** (east) of z.

Other relations are impossible due to the horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)). For example:
- **N**, **S**, **B** require horizontal overlap or containment, which is absent.
- **W**, **NW**, **SW** imply x is west of z, contradicting \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
- **SW**, **NW** are excluded by the horizontal constraint.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are **NE**, **E**, and **SE**.

**Answer: NE, E, SE**
