PROMPT: Let NW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, the cardinal direction relations are defined based on the bounding boxes of the regions. The conditions for each relation are as follows:

- x NW y: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
- y NW z: \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

From these, derive the relation between x and z:

1. **x-dimension**:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from x NW y)  
   \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (from y NW z)  
   Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).

2. **y-dimension**:  
   \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from x NW y)  
   \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from y NW z)  
   Since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\). Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of x being NW of z. Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, SE, S, E, W, SW, B) is possible, as the derived inequalities are strict and mutually exclusive with other relations due to the positive area of regions in REG (homeomorphic to closed unit disks).

Thus, the possible relation is:
- NW
