PROMPT: Let N and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is N of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is W of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are determined by the constraints on their bounding boxes.

- From \(x\) N \(y\):
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertically, \(x\) is above \(y\)).
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (horizontally, \(x\) is within the x-range of \(y\)).
- From \(y\) W \(z\):
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontally, \(y\) is left of \(z\)).
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertically, \(y\) is within the y-range of \(z\)).

Combining these:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- Vertically: 
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from N and W constraints), so \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - The relation between \(\sup_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z)\) determines the vertical alignment.

Two scenarios are possible:
1. **W (West)**: If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is vertically contained within \(z\)'s y-range. Combined with \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies the definition of W.
2. **NW (North West)**: If \(\inf_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely above \(z\). With \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), this satisfies NW.

Other relations are not possible:
- N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, B do not hold due to the horizontal left constraint and vertical dependencies.
- The case where \(\inf_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) > \sup_y(z)\) does not fit any atomic relation, but scenarios exist where either W or NW holds exclusively.

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NW** and **W**.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\text{NW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}}
