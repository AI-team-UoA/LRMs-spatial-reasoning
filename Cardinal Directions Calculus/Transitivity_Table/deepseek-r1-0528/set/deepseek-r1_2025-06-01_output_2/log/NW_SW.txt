PROMPT: Let NW and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is NW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is SW of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, W, and NW.

- **NW (North West)**: This is possible when \(x\) is to the west and north of \(z\). For example, if the bounding boxes are positioned such that \(x\) is above and to the left of \(z\), with no vertical overlap.
- **W (West)**: This is possible when \(x\) is directly to the west of \(z\) with vertical containment (i.e., the \(y\)-range of \(x\) is within the \(y\)-range of \(z\)). For example, if \(x\) and \(z\) share the same vertical alignment but \(x\) is left of \(z\).
- **SW (South West)**: This is possible when \(x\) is to the west and south of \(z\). For example, if \(x\) is below and to the left of \(z\), with no vertical overlap.

These relations are derived from the inequalities defining the cardinal directions:
- From \(x\) NW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- From \(y\) SW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Combining these, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) holds, meaning \(x\) is always to the west of \(z\). The vertical relation depends on the relative positions of \(\inf_y(x)\) and \(\inf_y(z)\), leading to the possible cases above.

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are impossible due to the west constraint and the requirement that regions have positive area, preventing eastward, vertical, or containment relations.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{W}} \quad \boxed{\text{NW}}
