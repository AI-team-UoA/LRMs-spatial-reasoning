PROMPT: Let W and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) means:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is S of \(z\) means:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these for \(x\) and \(z\):

1. **Y-axis analysis**:
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
   - This implies \(x\) is below \(z\), so possible relations are S, SW, or SE.

2. **X-axis analysis**:
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)
   - Thus, \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - Two cases for \(\sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(z)\):
     - **Case 1**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
       - Then \(x\) is entirely left of \(z\), and with \(x\) below \(z\), this matches **SW**.
     - **Case 2**: \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
       - Here, the x-intervals overlap partially.
       - For \(x\) to be S of \(z\), we need \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
         - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) holds (since \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)).
         - If \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then **S** holds.
       - If \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\), no cardinal relation fits (e.g., not SW, SE, or others), but regions in REG (homeomorphic to closed disk) and bounding box constraints ensure \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) is possible and required for S in this case.
       - Thus, only **S** is possible when \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).

   SE is not possible because it requires \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), but \(\sup_x(z) \geq \sup_x(y) \geq \inf_x(y) \geq \sup_x(x) \geq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \geq \inf_x(x)\), and equality (degenerate) is excluded for REG.

**Conclusion**: The possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **SW** (Case 1) and **S** (Case 2 with \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)).

**Answer: SW, S**
