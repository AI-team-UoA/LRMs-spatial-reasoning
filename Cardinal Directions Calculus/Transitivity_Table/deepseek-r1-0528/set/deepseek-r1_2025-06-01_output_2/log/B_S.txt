PROMPT: Let B and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) B \(y\) implies that the bounding box of \(y\) contains the bounding box of \(x\):
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) S \(z\) implies that \(y\) is directly south of \(z\):
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\)
  - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\)

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal constraints for \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)) and \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
   - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)), so \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

2. **Vertical constraints for \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (from \(x\) B \(y\)) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (from \(y\) S \(z\)), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

The conditions \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) exactly match the definition of \(x\) being directly south of \(z\) (\(x\) S \(z\)).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, SE, NW, W, SW, B) is possible because:
- Relations like SW, W, NW would require \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), contradicting \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (unless degenerate, but regions are non-degenerate).
- Relations like SE, E, NE would require \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), contradicting \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
- Relations like N, B, NE, NW require vertical conditions incompatible with \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\) (e.g., \(z\) above \(x\)).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is **S**.
