PROMPT: Let SE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is S of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are S (South) and SE (South East).

- **S (South)**: This relation holds if \(x\) is directly south of \(z\) and horizontally within the x-range of \(z\)'s bounding box. This occurs when \(z\) is wide enough to contain \(x\) in the x-direction, satisfying the conditions \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

- **SE (South East)**: This relation holds if \(x\) is southeast of \(z\), meaning \(x\) is completely east and south of \(z\). This occurs when \(z\) does not extend far enough east to contain \(x\), satisfying \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

Other relations are not possible:
- SW, W, NW are not possible because \(x\) is east of \(y\) and \(y\) is within the x-range of \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be west of \(z\).
- N, NE are not possible because \(x\) is south of \(y\) and \(y\) is south of \(z\), so \(x\) cannot be north of \(z\).
- E is not possible because it requires \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), but the given relations imply \(\inf_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), which is the opposite.
- B is not possible because \(x\) is south of \(z\), so \(z\) cannot contain \(x\)'s bounding box vertically.

Thus, the possible relations are S and SE.
