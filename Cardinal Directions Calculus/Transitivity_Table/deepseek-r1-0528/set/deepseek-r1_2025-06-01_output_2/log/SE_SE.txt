PROMPT: Let SE and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions:

- \(x\) SE \(y\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\).
- \(y\) SE \(z\) implies \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\).

Combining these:

1. **East condition for \(x\) relative to \(z\)**:  
   \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(y)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)) and \(\text{inf}_x(y) \leq \text{sup}_x(y) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)).  
   Thus, \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\), satisfying the east component of a direction relation.

2. **South condition for \(x\) relative to \(z\)**:  
   \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(y)\) (from \(x\) SE \(y\)) and \(\text{inf}_y(y) \leq \text{sup}_y(y) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) (from \(y\) SE \(z\)).  
   Thus, \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\), satisfying the south component of a direction relation.

The conditions \(\text{sup}_x(z) \leq \text{inf}_x(x)\) and \(\text{sup}_y(x) \leq \text{inf}_y(z)\) match the definition of **SE (South East)**. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, E, S, SW, W, NW, B) satisfies both requirements simultaneously.
