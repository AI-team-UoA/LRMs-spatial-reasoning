PROMPT: Let NE and S be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- Given \(x\) is NE of \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
  This means \(x\) is strictly northeast of \(y\) (right and above).

- Given \(y\) is S of \(z\):  
  \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
  This means \(y\) is strictly south of \(z\) (below and horizontally within).

Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are derived by considering the constraints on their bounding boxes:

1. **Horizontal Constraints**:  
   From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).  
   From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   Combining: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).  
   The relation between \(\sup_x(z)\) and \(\inf_x(x)\) can vary, allowing horizontal separation or overlap.

2. **Vertical Constraints**:  
   From \(y\) S \(z\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
   From \(x\) NE \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Both \(x\) and \(z\) are above \(y\), but their relative vertical positions can vary (e.g., \(z\) above \(x\), \(x\) above \(z\), or overlap).

By constructing specific examples satisfying the given relations, the following relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are possible:
- **N**: \(z\) is below \(x\) (vertical separation, \(x\) north of \(z\)).
- **S**: \(x\) is below \(z\) (vertical separation, \(x\) south of \(z\)).
- **B**: The bounding box of \(x\) is inside that of \(z\).
- **NE**: \(z\) is southwest of \(x\) (horizontal and vertical separation).
- **NW**: \(z\) is southeast of \(x\) (horizontal separation and vertical separation with \(z\) above).
- **E**: \(z\) is west of \(x\) (horizontal separation with vertical containment).
- **SE**: \(z\) is northwest of \(x\) (horizontal separation and vertical separation with \(x\) below).

The relations **W**, **SW** are impossible due to contradictions in horizontal constraints (\(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) implies \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) is infeasible).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are:  
**N, S, B, NE, NW, E, SE**.
