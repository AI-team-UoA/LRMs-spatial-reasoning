PROMPT: Let NW and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) means \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
- \(y\) N \(z\) means \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), and \(\sup_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\).

From \(y\) N \(z\), it follows that \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\). Combining with \(x\) NW \(y\), \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\). This vertical condition is common to relations where \(x\) is above \(z\), specifically N, NE, and NW.

### Analysis of horizontal conditions:
1. **Case where \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)**:
   - This satisfies the west condition for NW: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it gives \(x\) NW \(z\).

2. **Case where \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\)**:
   - From \(x\) NW \(y\), \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - From \(y\) N \(z\), \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), so \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
   - For \(x\) to satisfy an atomic relation, the x-projection must be contained in \(z\)'s x-interval: \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\). Given \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(z)\), if \(\inf_x(x) \geq \inf_x(z)\), then the containment holds.
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), it gives \(x\) N \(z\).

The case where \(\inf_x(x) < \inf_x(z)\) and \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) is impossible under the atomic relations, as it would require \(x\) to span multiple tiles (west and north of \(z\)), violating the atomicity (entire region in one tile).

### Possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\):
- **NW**: When \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
- **N**: When \(\inf_x(z) < \sup_x(x)\) and \(\inf_x(x) \geq \inf_x(z)\).

No other relations (e.g., NE, B, S, etc.) satisfy the conditions derived.

**Final Answer: NW, N**
