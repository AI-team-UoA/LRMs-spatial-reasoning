PROMPT: Let SE and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region \(x\) is SE of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible cardinal direction relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are derived from the constraints on their bounding boxes.

- From \(x\) SE \(y\):  
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (i.e., \(y\) is to the west of \(x\))  
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is below \(y\))  

- From \(y\) NE \(z\):  
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is to the west of \(y\))  
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., \(z\) is below \(y\))  

Combining the \(x\)-coordinate constraints:  
\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). This means \(z\) is entirely to the west of \(x\), so \(x\) must be to the east of \(z\) in the relation between \(x\) and \(z\). Thus, the possible relations are limited to those where \(x\) is east of \(z\): E (east), SE (southeast), or NE (northeast).

The \(y\)-coordinate constraints are:  
- \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)  
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)  

Let \(C = \inf_y(y)\). Then \(\sup_y(z) \leq C\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq C\), meaning both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\). The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their infimum and supremum \(y\)-values relative to each other:

- **If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)**: Then \(x\) SE \(z\) holds, as \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\).  
- **If \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**: Then \(x\) NE \(z\) holds, as \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
- **If \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)**: Then \(x\) E \(z\) holds, as \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment of \(x\) within \(z\)).  

All three cases are possible under the given constraints, depending on the specific positions of the regions. No other relations (N, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible because the \(x\)-coordinate constraint \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) excludes west-oriented relations, and the vertical positioning relative to \(y\) allows for the above scenarios.

Thus, the possible relations between region \(x\) and region \(z\) are E, SE, and NE.
