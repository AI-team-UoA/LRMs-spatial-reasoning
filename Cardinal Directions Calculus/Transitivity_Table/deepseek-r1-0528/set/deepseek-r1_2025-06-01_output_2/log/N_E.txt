PROMPT: Let N and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is N of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (entire \(y\) is below \(x\) vertically),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (\(x\) is horizontally within \(y\)'s bounding box).
- \(y\) is E of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (entire \(z\) is left of \(y\) horizontally),
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (\(y\) is vertically within \(z\)'s bounding box).

Combining these constraints:
- Horizontally: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\), so \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\). Thus, \(z\) is entirely left of \(x\).
- Vertically: 
  - From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - From \(y\) E \(z\): \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\).
  - Thus, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(z) \geq \sup_y(y)\).

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\sup_y(z)\) relative to \(\inf_y(x)\):
1. **Case 1: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)**  
   - \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.
   - Combined with horizontal separation (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)), this satisfies the conditions for \(x\) being **NE** of \(z\):
     - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal: \(z\) left of \(x\)),
     - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (vertical: \(z\) below \(x\)).
   
2. **Case 2: \(\sup_y(z) \geq \inf_y(x)\)**  
   - Here, \(z\) extends vertically to at least the bottom of \(x\).
   - Additionally, from constraints, \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) holds.
   - For \(x\) to be **E** of \(z\), the vertical span of \(x\) must be contained in \(z\)'s vertical span: \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\). If this holds:
     - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) (horizontal: \(z\) left of \(x\)),
     - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\) (vertical containment).
   - This satisfies the definition of \(x\) being **E** of \(z\).

No other cardinal relations (N, S, W, NW, SW, SE, B) are possible under the given constraints and region properties (closed, connected, with connected boundaries). Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **NE** and **E**.

**Final Answer: NE, E**
