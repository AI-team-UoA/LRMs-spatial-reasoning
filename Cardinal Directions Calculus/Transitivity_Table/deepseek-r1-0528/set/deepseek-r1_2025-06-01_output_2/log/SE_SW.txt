PROMPT: Let SE and SW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are SW, S, and SE. This is derived from the constraints on the bounding boxes:

- From x SE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is below z with no y-overlap. Thus, only relations where x is south of z are possible: SW, S, or SE.

- **SW (x is southwest of z)**: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z). For example, with supx(y) = 10, infx(x) = 12, supx(x) = 13, infx(z) = 13, supy(x) ≤ 5, infy(z) ≥ 6.
- **S (x is south of z)**: Possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). For example, with supx(y) = 10, infx(z) = 10, supx(z) = 15, infx(x) = 11, supx(x) = 14, supy(x) ≤ 5, infy(z) ≥ 6.
- **SE (x is southeast of z)**: Possible if infx(x) ≥ supx(z). For example, with supx(y) = 10, infx(z) = 10.5, supx(z) = 11, infx(x) = 11.5, supx(x) = 12, supy(x) ≤ 5, infy(z) ≥ 6.

No other relations are possible due to the vertical separation (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), which precludes relations requiring y-overlap (N, NE, E, NW, W, B) or x being above z.

\boxed{\text{SW}} \quad \boxed{\text{S}} \quad \boxed{\text{SE}}
