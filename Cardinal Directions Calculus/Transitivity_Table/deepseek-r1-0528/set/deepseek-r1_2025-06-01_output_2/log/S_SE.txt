PROMPT: Let S and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given that region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, the relation between x and z must be SE (South East). This is derived from the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- x S y implies:
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally aligned within y's x-range)

- y SE z implies:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these:
- From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), it follows that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z is to the west of x).

Thus, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) satisfy the definition of x SE z. No other cardinal direction relation (N, NE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B) is possible given the constraints and the requirement that regions have area (inf < sup for bounding box edges).

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

**Final Answer:**  
SE
