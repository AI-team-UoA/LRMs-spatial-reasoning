PROMPT: Let W and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) is W of \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\)

- \(y\) is NE of \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

Combining these constraints:

1. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)
   - This means \(z\) is entirely below \(x\) vertically.

2. **Horizontal relations between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are west of \(y\):
     - From \(x\) W \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
     - From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - The relative horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) can vary:
     - **Case 1**: \(x\) is west of \(z\) (\(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\).
       - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) NW \(z\).
     - **Case 2**: \(z\) is west of \(x\) (\(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
       - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) NE \(z\).
     - **Case 3**: Horizontal overlap (neither \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) nor \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) holds, but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\).
       - This means \(z\)'s bounding box horizontally contains \(x\)'s.
       - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this satisfies \(x\) N \(z\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N**, **NE**, and **NW**. These cover all scenarios derived from the constraints.

**Answer: N, NE, NW**
