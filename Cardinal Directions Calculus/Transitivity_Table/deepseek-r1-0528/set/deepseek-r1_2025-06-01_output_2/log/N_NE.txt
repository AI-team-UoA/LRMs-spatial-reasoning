PROMPT: Let N and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Given the cardinal direction relations:
- Region \(x\) is N of region \(y\): 
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (i.e., the top of \(y\) is at or below the bottom of \(x\)),
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (i.e., \(x\) is horizontally within the bounding box of \(y\)).
- Region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\): 
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (i.e., the right of \(z\) is at or to the left of the left of \(y\)),
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (i.e., the top of \(z\) is at or below the bottom of \(y\)).

Combining these:
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).
- From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\).
  - Thus, \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), meaning the entire \(z\) is to the left of \(x\).
- From \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- From \(x\) N \(y\): \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - Since \(\inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y)\) (by bounding box properties), we have \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning the entire \(z\) is below \(x\).

The conditions \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) match the definition of the NE relation: \(x\) is NE of \(z\).

No other cardinal direction relation (N, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible because:
- N requires \(x\) to be horizontally within \(z\), but \(z\) is entirely to the left of \(x\).
- E requires \(x\) to be vertically within \(z\), but \(z\) is entirely below \(x\).
- Other relations (e.g., SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are incompatible with \(z\) being left and below \(x\).

Thus, the only possible relation between \(x\) and \(z\) is NE.
