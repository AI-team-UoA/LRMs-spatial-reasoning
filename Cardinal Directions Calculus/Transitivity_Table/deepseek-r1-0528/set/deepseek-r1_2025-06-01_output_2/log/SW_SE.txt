PROMPT: Let SW and SE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- \(x\) is SW of \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\).
- \(y\) is SE of \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\).

From these, we derive:
- \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\), placing both \(x\) and \(z\) entirely to the west of \(y\).
- \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(z)\), so \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), meaning \(x\) is entirely south of \(z\).

The relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on their horizontal alignment relative to each other:
- If \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), then \(x\) is entirely west of \(z\), resulting in \(x\) SW \(z\).
- If \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\), then \(x\) is entirely east of \(z\), resulting in \(x\) SE \(z\).
- If neither of the above, but \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\) (i.e., \(x\)'s x-interval is contained within \(z\)'s x-interval), and given \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) S \(z\).

All three scenarios are possible under the constraints, as the horizontal positions of \(x\) and \(z\) relative to each other can vary while still satisfying \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\).

Thus, the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW, S, and SE.

**Answer: SW, S, SE**
