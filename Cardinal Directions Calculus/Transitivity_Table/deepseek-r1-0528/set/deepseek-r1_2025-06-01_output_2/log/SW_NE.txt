PROMPT: Let SW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations, where region \(x\) is SW of region \(y\) and region \(y\) is NE of region \(z\), the possible relations between \(x\) and \(z\) encompass all nine cardinal direction relations. The constraints derived are:

- \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
- \(y\) NE \(z\): \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

These imply both \(x\) and \(z\) are left of and below \(y\), but allow various relative positions between \(x\) and \(z\) in the plane. Examples confirm each relation is achievable:

- **SW**: \(x\) southwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) entirely left and below \(z\)).
- **W**: \(x\) west of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left of \(z\) with \(z\)'s y-interval containing \(x\)'s).
- **NW**: \(x\) northwest of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) left and above \(z\)).
- **N**: \(x\) north of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) above \(z\) with \(z\)'s x-interval containing \(x\)'s).
- **NE**: \(x\) northeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right and above \(z\)).
- **E**: \(x\) east of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right of \(z\) with \(z\)'s y-interval containing \(x\)'s).
- **SE**: \(x\) southeast of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) right and below \(z\)).
- **S**: \(x\) south of \(z\) (e.g., \(x\) below \(z\) with \(z\)'s x-interval containing \(x\)'s).
- **B**: \(x\) inside \(z\)'s bounding box (e.g., \(x\) and \(z\) coincident or \(x\) contained in \(z\)).

Thus, all relations are possible: **N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B**.
