PROMPT: Let W and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is **W** of region \(y\):  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\), \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(y)\).  
- Region \(y\) is **NW** of region \(z\):  
  \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).

### Analysis:
1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   From \(x\) **W** \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\).  
   From \(y\) **NW** \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\) (by definition of bounds), combining:  
   \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), meaning \(x\) is strictly to the west of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:  
   From \(x\) **W** \(y\): \(\inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   From \(y\) **NW** \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\).  
   Combining: \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\).  
   Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), meaning \(z\) is entirely below \(x\), so \(x\) is to the north of \(z\).

### Conclusion:
- The combined relation is **NW** (North West), as:  
  \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (west component) and \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (north component).  
- No other cardinal direction relation (e.g., N, W, SW) is satisfied under the constraints, as they require additional conditions that do not hold (e.g., specific bounding box alignments not enforced here).
