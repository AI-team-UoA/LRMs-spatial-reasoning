PROMPT: Let SW and NW be cardinal direction relations. If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations defined:

- \(x\) SW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is left of y)
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (x is below y)

- \(y\) NW \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (y is left of z)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is below y)

Combining these:

1. **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\)
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
   - Since \(\inf_x(y) \leq \sup_x(y)\), it follows that \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\). Thus, \(x\) is left of \(z\).

2. **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
   - From \(x\) SW \(y\): \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - From \(y\) NW \(z\): \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
   - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are below \(y\), but their vertical positions relative to each other can vary.

The possible vertical arrangements lead to the following relations for \(x\) relative to \(z\):

- **SW (South West)**: If \(x\) is below \(z\) (\(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
- **NW (North West)**: If \(z\) is below \(x\) (\(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\)).
- **W (West)**: If \(x\) is vertically within \(z\) (\(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).

These are the only possible relations consistent with the given constraints and the definitions. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible due to the left-of constraint and vertical arrangements.

**Possible relations**: SW, W, NW
