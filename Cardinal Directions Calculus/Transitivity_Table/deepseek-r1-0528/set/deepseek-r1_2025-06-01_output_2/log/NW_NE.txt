PROMPT: Let NW and NE be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction relations provided:

- \(x\) NW \(y\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (x is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (y is south of x, so x is north of y)

- \(y\) NE \(z\) implies:
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (z is west of y)
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (z is south of y)

From these:
- **Vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\))
  - \(\sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (from \(x\) NW \(y\))
  - Thus, \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \inf_y(x)\), so \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\) (z is south of x, so x is north of z).

- **Horizontal relation between \(x\) and \(z\)**:
  - \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(x\) NW \(y\))
  - \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(y)\) (from \(y\) NE \(z\))
  - Both \(x\) and \(z\) are west of \(y\), but their horizontal positions relative to each other can vary.

Possible horizontal scenarios:
1. **\(x\) is west of \(z\)**: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) NW \(z\).
2. **\(z\) is west of \(x\)**: \(\sup_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\)
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) NE \(z\).
3. **Horizontal containment**: The horizontal extent of \(x\) is within that of \(z\) (i.e., \(\inf_x(z) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(z)\))
   - Combined with \(\sup_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), this gives \(x\) N \(z\).

Given that \(x\) must be north of \(z\) vertically, and the horizontal relations can lead to NW, NE, or N, the possible cardinal direction relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are **N, NW, NE**.

**Final Answer: \boxed{\text{N}} \boxed{\text{NW}} \boxed{\text{NE}}**
