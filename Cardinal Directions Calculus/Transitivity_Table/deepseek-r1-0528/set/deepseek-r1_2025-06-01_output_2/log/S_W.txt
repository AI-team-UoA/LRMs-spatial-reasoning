PROMPT: Let S and W be cardinal direction relations. If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given cardinal direction relations:

- Region \(x\) is S (South) of region \(y\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y)\)
  - \(\inf_x(y) \leq \inf_x(x)\) and \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y)\)
- Region \(y\) is W (West) of region \(z\), meaning:
  - \(\sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\)
  - \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\) and \(\sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\)

From these, the following inequalities are derived:
1. \(\sup_x(x) \leq \sup_x(y) \leq \inf_x(z)\) → \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) (horizontal separation, \(x\) left of \(z\))
2. \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(y) \leq \sup_y(y) \leq \sup_y(z)\) → \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)
3. \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(y)\)

The vertical relation between \(x\) and \(z\) depends on \(\inf_y(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x)\):
- **Case 1:** If \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\), then \(x\) is below \(z\) (satisfies SW: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\) and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \inf_y(z)\)).
- **Case 2:** If \(\inf_y(z) < \sup_y(x)\), then:
  - If \(\inf_y(x) \geq \inf_y(z)\), then \(z\) covers \(x\) vertically (satisfies W: \(\sup_x(x) \leq \inf_x(z)\), \(\inf_y(z) \leq \inf_y(x)\), and \(\sup_y(x) \leq \sup_y(z)\)).
  - If \(\inf_y(x) < \inf_y(z)\), no defined atomic relation fits, but this case does not yield any of the 9 relations.

Given the constraints and possible configurations, the achievable atomic relations between \(x\) and \(z\) are SW and W. Other relations (like S, NW, etc.) are not possible due to the derived inequalities and definitions.

Thus, the possible relations are SW and W.
