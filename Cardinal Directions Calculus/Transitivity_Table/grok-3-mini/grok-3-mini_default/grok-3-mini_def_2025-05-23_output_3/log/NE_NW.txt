PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

x is NE of y and y is NW of z, so x is above z. Depending on their x-positions, x could be:

- North (N) of z if x is within z's x-range.
- Northeast (NE) of z if x is to the right of z.
- Northwest (NW) of z if x is to the left of z.

Thus, the possible relations are N, NE, NW.
