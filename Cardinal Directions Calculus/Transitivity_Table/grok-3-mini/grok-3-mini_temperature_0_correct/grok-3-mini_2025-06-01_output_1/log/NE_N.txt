PROMPT: Let NE and N be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

Based on the given conditions:

- Region x is NE of region y, meaning x is to the right and above y.
- Region y is N of region z, meaning y is above z, and y's x-range is inside z's x-range.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, B.
