PROMPT: Let NW and E be cardinal direction relations. If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?

ANSWER:

Based on the given conditions:

- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

The possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, NW, W, B
