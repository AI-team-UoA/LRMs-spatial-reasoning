background information: 
Given a region a, the greatest lower bound or infimum of the projection of a on the x-axis (resp. on the y-axis) is denoted by infx(a) (resp. infy(a)). The least upper bound or the supremum of the projection of a on the x-axis (resp. on the y-axis) is denoted by supx(a) (resp. supy(a)). These bounds define the minimum bounding box of a region a, which is the box formed by the straight lines x=infx(a), x=supx(a), y=infy(a) and y=supy(a). Let us now consider regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk {(x, y): x^2 + y^2 <= 1}. The set of these regions will be denoted by REG. Regions in REG are closed, connected and have connected boundaries. 
A cardinal direction relation between regions in REG is one of the following relations: B (bounding box), S (South), SW (South West), W (West), NW (North West), N (North), NE (North East), E (East) and SE (South East). These relations are defined as follows: a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b). a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a). a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a). a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b). You are a helpful assistant. I will now give you a question regarding the cardinal direction relations I defined above. The possible answer can be one or more of N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B. No yapping.

question:
Let " + r1 + " and " + r2 + " be cardinal direction relations. If region x is " + r1 + " of region y and region y is " + r2 + " of region z, then which could the possible relations between region x and region z be?"
