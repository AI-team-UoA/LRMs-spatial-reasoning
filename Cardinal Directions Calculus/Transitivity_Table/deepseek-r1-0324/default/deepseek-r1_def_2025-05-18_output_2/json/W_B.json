{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The possible relations between x and z are W and B. If x's bounding box is entirely to the west of z's, then x W z. If x's bounding box is entirely within z's, then x B z. These are the only possibilities given the constraints.\n\n**Answer:** B, W", "elapsed-time": 436.0339283943176, "reasoning-tokens": 9723, "completion-tokens": 9787}
