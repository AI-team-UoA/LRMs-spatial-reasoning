For r1: N, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are NW and W. 

**NW**: If x's vertical projection is entirely above z's (infy(x) ≥ supy(z)), then x is northwest of z.  
**W**: If x's vertical projection is within z's vertical bounds (supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), then x is west of z.  

**Answer:** NW, W

**Answer:** NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**SW**: If x is vertically below z's bottom edge (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), it's southwest.  
**W**: If x is vertically within z's bounds (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), it's west.  
**NW**: If x is vertically above z's top edge (infy(x) ≥ supy(z)), it's northwest.

**N**: If x's entire bounding box is above z's.  
**B**: If x's bounding box is entirely within z's.  

These are the only valid single-tile relations since x's horizontal projection is within z's, and vertically it can be either entirely above or contained within z's bounds.

For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: SW, S, SE
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x W y:** x is west of y, meaning x's right boundary ≤ y's left boundary, and x is vertically within y's bounds.
   - **y NE z:** y is northeast of z, meaning y is right and above z.

2. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - y is above z (from y NE z), so x is also above z (since x is vertically within y's bounds). Thus, vertically, x is **N** of z.

3. **Horizontal Scenarios:**
   - **Case 1: x's right boundary ≤ z's left boundary (NW):**  
     If x is entirely west of z, x is **NW** of z.
   - **Case 2: x's x-projection within z's (N):**  
     If x's horizontal bounds are contained within z's, x is **N** of z.
   - **Case 3: x's left boundary ≥ z's right boundary (NE):**  
     If x is east of z (but still west of y), x is **NE** of z.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   All three relations (N, NE, NW) are possible based on x's horizontal positioning relative to z.

**Answer:** N, NE, NW
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between x and z are W and B. If x's bounding box is entirely to the west of z's, then x W z. If x's bounding box is entirely within z's, then x B z. These are the only possibilities given the constraints.

For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x S y implies:**
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is entirely below y).
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y).

2. **y NW z implies:**
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is left of z).
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y).

3. **Combining these:**
   - x is left of z (since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).
   - Both x and z are below y.

4. **Vertical possibilities between x and z:**
   - **SW:** If x is below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).
   - **W:** If x's vertical range is within z's (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).
   - **NW:** If z is below x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are NW and W. 

NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are: **B, N, NE, E, W, NW**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NW y**: x is west and north of y.
   - **y E z**: y is east of z, meaning z is west of y and contains y vertically.

2. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - **Horizontal**: Both x and z are west of y. Their horizontal positions relative to each other are flexible (x can be west, east, or overlapping with z).
   - **Vertical**: x is north of y, and z contains y vertically. Thus, z's vertical span includes y's, which is entirely below x.

3. **Possible Configurations:**
   - **B (Bounding Box)**: If z’s bounding box fully contains x’s.
   - **N (North)**: If z is horizontally wider and vertically below x.
   - **NE (Northeast)**: If z is southwest of x (z west and south).
   - **E (East)**: If z is west of x with overlapping vertical bounds.
   - **W (West)**: If x is west of z with overlapping vertical bounds.
   - **NW (Northwest)**: If x is west and north of z.

4. **Eliminated Relations:**
   - **SE, S, SW**: Impossible due to x being north of y (and thus z) and vertical constraints.

**Answer:** B, N, NE, E, W, NW.
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are B, N, S, W, NW, SW.

**Answer:** B, N, S, W, NW, SW
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are all cardinal directions and the bounding box relation because the constraints allow x and z to be positioned in any relative arrangement (north, south, east, west, etc.) while both remaining northwest and southeast of y respectively. Thus, every single-tile relation is feasible.

**Answer:** B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are N, NW, and NE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Given Relations:**  
   - x is NW of y:  
     - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)  
     - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is south of x).  
   - y is NE of z:  
     - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is west of y)  
     - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y).  

2. **Vertical Relation (y-axis):**  
   From the above, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so z is **south of x**.  

3. **Horizontal Relation (x-axis):**  
   Both x and z are west of y (supx(x), supx(z) ≤ infx(y)), but their mutual x-projections can vary:  
   - If **x is west of z** (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)): **x NW z**.  
   - If **x is east of z** (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)): **x NE z**.  
   - If **x's x-projection is within z's** (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)): **x N z**.
