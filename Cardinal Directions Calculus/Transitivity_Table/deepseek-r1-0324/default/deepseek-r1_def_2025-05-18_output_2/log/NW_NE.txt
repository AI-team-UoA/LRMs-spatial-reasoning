PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are N, NW, and NE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Given Relations:**  
   - x is NW of y:  
     - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)  
     - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is south of x).  
   - y is NE of z:  
     - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is west of y)  
     - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y).  

2. **Vertical Relation (y-axis):**  
   From the above, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so z is **south of x**.  

3. **Horizontal Relation (x-axis):**  
   Both x and z are west of y (supx(x), supx(z) ≤ infx(y)), but their mutual x-projections can vary:  
   - If **x is west of z** (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)): **x NW z**.  
   - If **x is east of z** (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)): **x NE z**.  
   - If **x's x-projection is within z's** (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)): **x N z**.  

**Answer:** N, NW, NE.
