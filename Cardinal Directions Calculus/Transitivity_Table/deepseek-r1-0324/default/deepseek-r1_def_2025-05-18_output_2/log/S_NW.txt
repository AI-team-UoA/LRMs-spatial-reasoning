PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x S y implies:**
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is entirely below y).
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y).

2. **y NW z implies:**
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is left of z).
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y).

3. **Combining these:**
   - x is left of z (since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)).
   - Both x and z are below y.

4. **Vertical possibilities between x and z:**
   - **SW:** If x is below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).
   - **W:** If x's vertical range is within z's (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).
   - **NW:** If z is below x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

**Answer:** NW, W, SW
