PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are all cardinal directions and the bounding box relation because the constraints allow x and z to be positioned in any relative arrangement (north, south, east, west, etc.) while both remaining northwest and southeast of y respectively. Thus, every single-tile relation is feasible.

**Answer:** B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
