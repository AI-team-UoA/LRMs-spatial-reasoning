PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are N and B. 

**N**: If x's entire bounding box is above z's.  
**B**: If x's bounding box is entirely within z's.  

These are the only valid single-tile relations since x's horizontal projection is within z's, and vertically it can be either entirely above or contained within z's bounds.

**Answer:** B, N
