PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between x and z are W and B. If x's bounding box is entirely to the west of z's, then x W z. If x's bounding box is entirely within z's, then x B z. These are the only possibilities given the constraints.

**Answer:** B, W
