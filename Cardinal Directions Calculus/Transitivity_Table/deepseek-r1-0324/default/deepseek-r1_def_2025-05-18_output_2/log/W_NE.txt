PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x W y:** x is west of y, meaning x's right boundary ≤ y's left boundary, and x is vertically within y's bounds.
   - **y NE z:** y is northeast of z, meaning y is right and above z.

2. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - y is above z (from y NE z), so x is also above z (since x is vertically within y's bounds). Thus, vertically, x is **N** of z.

3. **Horizontal Scenarios:**
   - **Case 1: x's right boundary ≤ z's left boundary (NW):**  
     If x is entirely west of z, x is **NW** of z.
   - **Case 2: x's x-projection within z's (N):**  
     If x's horizontal bounds are contained within z's, x is **N** of z.
   - **Case 3: x's left boundary ≥ z's right boundary (NE):**  
     If x is east of z (but still west of y), x is **NE** of z.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   All three relations (N, NE, NW) are possible based on x's horizontal positioning relative to z.

**Answer:** N, NE, NW
