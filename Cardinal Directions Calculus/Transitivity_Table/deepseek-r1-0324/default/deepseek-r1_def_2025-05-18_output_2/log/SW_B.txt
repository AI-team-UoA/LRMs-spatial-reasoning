PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, S, and B. 

**SW**: If x is entirely southwest of z's bounding box.  
**W**: If x is west of z but within z's y-projection.  
**S**: If x is south of z but within z's x-projection.  
**B**: If x's bounding box is entirely within z's bounding box.
