PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and W. 

**SW**: If the vertical projection of x is entirely below z, fulfilling supy(x) ≤ infy(z) along with supx(x) ≤ infx(z).  
**W**: If x's vertical projection overlaps with z's but x's entire horizontal extent is west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and z's vertical bounds contain x's (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)). 

Thus, the answer is **SW, W**.

**Answer:** SW, W
