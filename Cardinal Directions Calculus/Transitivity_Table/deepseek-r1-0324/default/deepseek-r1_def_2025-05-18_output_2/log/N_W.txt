PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are NW and W. 

**NW**: If x's vertical projection is entirely above z's (infy(x) ≥ supy(z)), then x is northwest of z.  
**W**: If x's vertical projection is within z's vertical bounds (supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), then x is west of z.  

**Answer:** NW, W
