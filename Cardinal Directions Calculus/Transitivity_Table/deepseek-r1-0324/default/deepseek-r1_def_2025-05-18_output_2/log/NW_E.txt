PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are: **B, N, NE, E, W, NW**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NW y**: x is west and north of y.
   - **y E z**: y is east of z, meaning z is west of y and contains y vertically.

2. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - **Horizontal**: Both x and z are west of y. Their horizontal positions relative to each other are flexible (x can be west, east, or overlapping with z).
   - **Vertical**: x is north of y, and z contains y vertically. Thus, z's vertical span includes y's, which is entirely below x.

3. **Possible Configurations:**
   - **B (Bounding Box)**: If z’s bounding box fully contains x’s.
   - **N (North)**: If z is horizontally wider and vertically below x.
   - **NE (Northeast)**: If z is southwest of x (z west and south).
   - **E (East)**: If z is west of x with overlapping vertical bounds.
   - **W (West)**: If x is west of z with overlapping vertical bounds.
   - **NW (Northwest)**: If x is west and north of z.

4. **Eliminated Relations:**
   - **SE, S, SW**: Impossible due to x being north of y (and thus z) and vertical constraints.

**Answer:** B, N, NE, E, W, NW.
