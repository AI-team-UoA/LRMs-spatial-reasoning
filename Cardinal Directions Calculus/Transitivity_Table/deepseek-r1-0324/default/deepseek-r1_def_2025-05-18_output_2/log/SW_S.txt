PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and S. 

**SW**: If the x-projection of x is entirely to the west of z's x-projection (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) while both are below z.  
**S**: If the x-projection of x is within z's x-projection (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) and x is below z. 

Answer: SW, S
