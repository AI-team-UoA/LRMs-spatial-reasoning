PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SE and S. 

**SE**: If x's x-projection starts entirely to the east of z's x-projection (infx(x) ≥ supx(z)), then x is SE of z.  
**S**: If x's x-projection is entirely within z's x-projection (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then x is S of z.  

Thus, the answer is **SE, S**.  

**Answer:** SE, S
