PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**SW**: If x is vertically below z's bottom edge (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), it's southwest.  
**W**: If x is vertically within z's bounds (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), it's west.  
**NW**: If x is vertically above z's top edge (infy(x) ≥ supy(z)), it's northwest.  

**Answer**: NW, W, SW
