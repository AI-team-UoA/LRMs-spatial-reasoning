PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and S. 

**SW**: If x is entirely to the west and south of z.  
**S**: If x is directly south of z with its x-projection within z's x-bounds.  

Other relations are excluded due to y-axis constraints (e.g., x canâ€™t be E or W) or x-axis overlaps not fitting any basic relation. 

Answer: SW, S
