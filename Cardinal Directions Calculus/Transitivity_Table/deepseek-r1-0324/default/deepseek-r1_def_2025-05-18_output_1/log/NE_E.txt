PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are NE and E. 

NE: If x's bounding box is entirely northeast of z's, which can occur if y is positioned such that x's y-interval starts above z's maximum y.  
E: If x's y-interval remains within z's y-bounds while being east of z.  

**Answer:** NE, E
