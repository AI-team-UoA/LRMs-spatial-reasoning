PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are B and E. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x E y:** x is entirely east of y, with vertical bounds within y's.
   - **y B z:** y's bounding box is inside z's bounding box.

2. **Key Implications:**
   - **From x E y:**  
     - `infx(x) ≥ supx(y)` (x starts east of y's right edge).  
     - Vertically, `infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (x is within y's vertical bounds).
   - **From y B z:**  
     - z's bounding box contains y's:  
       - `infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)` (horizontally).  
       - `infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)` (vertically).

3. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - Since x is vertically within y and y is within z, **x is vertically within z** (`infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)`).

4. **Horizontal Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** If `infx(x) ≥ supx(z)` (x starts east of z's right edge), then **x E z**.  
   - **Case 2:** If `infx(x) < supx(z)` (x starts inside z's horizontal bounds), and x’s entire bounding box is horizontally within z (`supx(x) ≤ supx(z)`), then **x B z**.  

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Depending on whether x’s horizontal bounds are fully inside or fully east of z, the possible relations are **B** (if x is inside z’s box) or **E** (if x is east of z’s box). Partial overlaps (e.g., x spans part of z’s box and extends east) are not expressible with single-tile relations under the given definitions.  

**Answer:** B, E
