PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **x NE y**: x is northeast of y, so x is entirely right and above y.
2. **y NW z**: y is northwest of z, so z is entirely right and below y.
3. **Combining Positions**:
   - **N (North)**: If x's x-projection is within z's x-projection while x is above z.
   - **NE (Northeast)**: If x is entirely right of z (x's x starts after z's x ends) while above z.
   - **NW (Northwest)**: If x is entirely left of z (x's x ends before z's x starts) while above z.

**Answer:** N, NE, NW
