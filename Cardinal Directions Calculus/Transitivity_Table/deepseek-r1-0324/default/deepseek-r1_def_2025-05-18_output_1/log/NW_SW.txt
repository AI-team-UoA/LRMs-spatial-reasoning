PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x NW y** implies:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

2. **y SW z** implies:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)

3. **Combining x-axis:**
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ x is west (W) of z.

4. **Analyzing y-axis possibilities:**
   - **NW:** If z’s top (supy(z)) ≤ x’s bottom (infy(x)), x is north of z ⇒ **NW**.
   - **SW:** If x’s top (supy(x)) ≤ z’s bottom (infy(z)), x is south of z ⇒ **SW**.
   - **W:** If z’s y-projection contains x’s y-projection (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) ⇒ **W**.

5. **Excluding others:**
   - **B, N, S, E, NE, SE** are impossible due to x being strictly west and y-axis constraints.

**Answer:** NW, W, SW
