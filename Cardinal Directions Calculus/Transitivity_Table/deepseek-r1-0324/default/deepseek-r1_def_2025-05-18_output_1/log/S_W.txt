PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW and W. 

**SW**: If x is both south and west of z, satisfying supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
**W**: If x is west of z with vertical inclusion (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), aligning within z's vertical bounds.  

Answer: SW, W
