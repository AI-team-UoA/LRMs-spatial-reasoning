PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relation between region x and region z is **W**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **x is W of y:** This implies supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and y's y-interval contains x's vertically.
2. **y is B of z:** Thus, z's bounding box contains y's, meaning infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and similarly for y-axis.
3. **Combining these:** supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z). For x to relate to z via single-tile relations:
   - Horizontally: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), x is **W** of z.
   - If supx(x) > infx(z), no valid single-tile relation exists (overlap isn't covered by other relations).
4. **Vertically:** x's y-interval is within z's, but this alone doesn't justify B (requires full containment in x-axis, which fails if supx(x) > infx(z)).
5. **Conclusion:** Only valid single-tile relation is **W** when supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Overlap cases don't fit any other relations, making **W** the sole answer.
