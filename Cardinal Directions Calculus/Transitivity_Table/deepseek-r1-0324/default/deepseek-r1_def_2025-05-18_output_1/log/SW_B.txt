PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, S, and B. 

**SW**: If z's bounding box does not extend beyond y's southwest, x remains southwest of z.  
**W**: If z extends west past y, x can be west of z with y-projection within z's.  
**S**: If z extends south past y, x can be south of z with x-projection within z's.  
**B**: If z's bounding box is large enough to enclose x, x is within z's bounds.  

Answer: SW, W, S, B
