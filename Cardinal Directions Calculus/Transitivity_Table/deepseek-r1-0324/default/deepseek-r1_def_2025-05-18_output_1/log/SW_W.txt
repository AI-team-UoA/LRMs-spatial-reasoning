PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW and W. 

SW: If x's y-projection is entirely below z's, then x is SW of z.  
W: If x's y-projection overlaps with z's but x is to the west, then x is W of z.  

Answer: SW, W
