PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between x and z are N and B. 

**N**: If z's bounding box does not extend above y's, x must be entirely above z.  
**B**: If z's bounding box extends above y, x can be within z's vertical bounds while still being above y.  

Answer: N, B
