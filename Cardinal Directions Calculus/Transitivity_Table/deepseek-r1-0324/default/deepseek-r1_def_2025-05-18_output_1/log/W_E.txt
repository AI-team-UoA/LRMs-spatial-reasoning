PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are W, E, or B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - x is W of y: 
     - Horizontally: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
     - Vertically: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
   - y is E of z: 
     - Horizontally: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
     - Vertically: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

2. **Combined Horizontal Constraints:**
   - Both x and z lie west of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
   - No direct horizontal constraint between x and z; they can be ordered as x < z, z < x, or overlap.

3. **Vertical Constraints:**
   - Vertically, x is contained within z: infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

4. **Possible Horizontal Scenarios:**
   - **x W z:** If supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - **x E z:** If supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - **x B z:** If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x horizontally within z).

5. **Exclusion of Other Directions:**
   - Diagonals (NW, NE, SW, SE), N, S are invalid due to vertical containment of x in z.

**Answer:** B, W, E
