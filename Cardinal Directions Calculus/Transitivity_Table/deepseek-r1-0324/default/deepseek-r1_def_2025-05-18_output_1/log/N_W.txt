PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are NW and W. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x N y** implies:
   - x is above y (`supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`).
   - x is horizontally within y (`infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`).

2. **y W z** implies:
   - y is to the left of z (`supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`).
   - y is vertically within z (`infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`).

3. **Combining x-axis projections**:
   - From x N y: `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`.
   - From y W z: `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`.
   - Thus, `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` → **x is to the left of z**.

4. **Combining y-axis projections**:
   - From x N y: `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`.
   - From y W z: `supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`.
   - Hence, `infy(x) ≥ supy(y)` and `supy(y) ≤ supy(z)` → **x's y-position depends on z's bounds**.

5. **Possible y-axis scenarios**:
   - **Case 1**: If `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)` → **x is above z** → **NW** (x left and above z).
   - **Case 2**: If `supy(z) > infy(x)` → **x overlaps vertically with z** → **W** (x left and vertically within z).

6. **Excluding other directions**:
   - **SW/S/SE/E/NE/N/B** are incompatible due to x being left of z and not below, overlapping fully, or within z.
