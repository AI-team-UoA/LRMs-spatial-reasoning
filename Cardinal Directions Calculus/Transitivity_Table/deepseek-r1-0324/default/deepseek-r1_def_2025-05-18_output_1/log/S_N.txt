PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B. 

**N**: If x's vertical interval is entirely above z's.  
**S**: If x's vertical interval is entirely below z's.  
**B**: If x's vertical interval is within z's.  

Thus, the answer is:  
B, N, S
