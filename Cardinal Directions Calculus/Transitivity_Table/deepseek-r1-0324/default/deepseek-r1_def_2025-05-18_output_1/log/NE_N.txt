PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are NE and N. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NE y:** x is entirely northeast of y, meaning `supx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`.
   - **y N z:** y is entirely north of z, meaning `supy(z) ≤ infy(y)`, with y's x-projection within z's x-projection (`infx(z) ≤ infx(y)`, `supx(y) ≤ supx(z)`).

2. **Spatial Implications:**
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** Since `infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≥ supy(z)`, x is north of z (`supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`).
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** From `supx(y) ≤ supx(z)` and `supx(y) ≤ infx(x)`, x starts east of y. Depending on whether `infx(x)` exceeds `supx(z)`:
     - **If `infx(x) > supx(z):** x is entirely east of z, making x **NE** of z.
     - **If `infx(x) ≤ supx(z):** x's x-projection overlaps/aligns with z's x-projection (as y's x is within z's x), making x **N** of z.

3. **Conclusion:** x must be either **N** (if x's x-projection stays within z's x) or **NE** (if x extends east beyond z's x). Other relations are invalid due to constraints on y-axis alignment and bounding box overlaps.

**Answer:** NE, N
