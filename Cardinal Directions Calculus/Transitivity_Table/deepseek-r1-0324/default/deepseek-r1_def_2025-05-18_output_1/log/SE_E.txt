PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SE and E. 

**SE**: If x's vertical projection is entirely below z (supy(x) â‰¤ infy(z)), then x is SE of z.  
**E**: If x's vertical projection overlaps with z (supy(x) > infy(z) but x remains east of z), then x is E of z.  

No other relations satisfy the bounding box constraints derived from x being SE of y and y being E of z.  

Answer: SE, E
