PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are all single-tile cardinal directions. Since both x and z are positioned northwest of y, their relative positions to each other can vary freely within the northwest quadrant of y, allowing any possible arrangement. This includes all directions and containment (B).

NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE
