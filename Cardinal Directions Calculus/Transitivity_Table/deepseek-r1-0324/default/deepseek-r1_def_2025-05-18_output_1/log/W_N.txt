PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between x and z are N and NW. 

NW occurs when x's horizontal projection is entirely to the west of z's (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), while N occurs when x's horizontal projection is within z's bounds (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)). These are the only valid single-tile relations given the constraints of x being west of y and y being north of z.

**Answer:** NW, N
