PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. 

**NE**: If x is east of z and entirely above it.  
**E**: If x is east of z and vertically within z's bounds.  
**SE**: If x is east of z and entirely below it (since x can be between y and z vertically).  

Answer: NE, E, SE
