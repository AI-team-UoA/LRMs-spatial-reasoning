For r1: N, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are NW and W. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x N y** implies:
   - x is above y (`supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`).
   - x is horizontally within y (`infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`).

2. **y W z** implies:
   - y is to the left of z (`supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`).
   - y is vertically within z (`infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`).

3. **Combining x-axis projections**:
   - From x N y: `supx(x) ≤ supx(y)`.
   - From y W z: `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`.
   - Thus, `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` → **x is to the left of z**.

4. **Combining y-axis projections**:
   - From x N y: `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`.
   - From y W z: `supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`.
   - Hence, `infy(x) ≥ supy(y)` and `supy(y) ≤ supy(z)` → **x's y-position depends on z's bounds**.

5. **Possible y-axis scenarios**:
   - **Case 1**: If `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)` → **x is above z** → **NW** (x left and above z).
   - **Case 2**: If `supy(z) > infy(x)` → **x overlaps vertically with z** → **W** (x left and vertically within z).

6. **Excluding other directions**:
   - **SW/S/SE/E/NE/N/B** are incompatible due to x being left of z and not below, overlapping fully, or within z.

**NE**: If x is east of z and entirely above it.

For r1: N, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between x and z are N and B. 

**N**: If z's bounding box does not extend above y's, x must be entirely above z.

Answer: N, B
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: The possible relations between x and z are N and NW. 

NW occurs when x's horizontal projection is entirely to the west of z's (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), while N occurs when x's horizontal projection is within z's bounds (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)). These are the only valid single-tile relations given the constraints of x being west of y and y being north of z.

**Answer:** NW, N
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are W, E, or B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - x is W of y: 
     - Horizontally: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
     - Vertically: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
   - y is E of z: 
     - Horizontally: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
     - Vertically: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

2. **Combined Horizontal Constraints:**
   - Both x and z lie west of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
   - No direct horizontal constraint between x and z; they can be ordered as x < z, z < x, or overlap.

3. **Vertical Constraints:**
   - Vertically, x is contained within z: infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

4. **Possible Horizontal Scenarios:**
   - **x W z:** If supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - **x E z:** If supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - **x B z:** If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x horizontally within z).

5. **Exclusion of Other Directions:**
   - Diagonals (NW, NE, SW, SE), N, S are invalid due to vertical containment of x in z.

For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are N, NW, and NE. 

**N**: If x is horizontally within z's bounds and vertically above.  
**NW**: If x is west of z and above.  
**NE**: If x is east of z and above.  

Answer: N, NW, NE
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: The possible relation between region x and region z is **W**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **x is W of y:** This implies supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and y's y-interval contains x's vertically.
2. **y is B of z:** Thus, z's bounding box contains y's, meaning infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and similarly for y-axis.
3. **Combining these:** supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z). For x to relate to z via single-tile relations:
   - Horizontally: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), x is **W** of z.
   - If supx(x) > infx(z), no valid single-tile relation exists (overlap isn't covered by other relations).
4. **Vertically:** x's y-interval is within z's, but this alone doesn't justify B (requires full containment in x-axis, which fails if supx(x) > infx(z)).
5. **Conclusion:** Only valid single-tile relation is **W** when supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Overlap cases don't fit any other relations, making **W** the sole answer.

For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are B and E. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x E y:** x is entirely east of y, with vertical bounds within y's.
   - **y B z:** y's bounding box is inside z's bounding box.

2. **Key Implications:**
   - **From x E y:**  
     - `infx(x) ≥ supx(y)` (x starts east of y's right edge).  
     - Vertically, `infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)` (x is within y's vertical bounds).
   - **From y B z:**  
     - z's bounding box contains y's:  
       - `infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)` (horizontally).  
       - `infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)` (vertically).

3. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - Since x is vertically within y and y is within z, **x is vertically within z** (`infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)`).

4. **Horizontal Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** If `infx(x) ≥ supx(z)` (x starts east of z's right edge), then **x E z**.  
   - **Case 2:** If `infx(x) < supx(z)` (x starts inside z's horizontal bounds), and x’s entire bounding box is horizontally within z (`supx(x) ≤ supx(z)`), then **x B z**.  

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Depending on whether x’s horizontal bounds are fully inside or fully east of z, the possible relations are **B** (if x is inside z’s box) or **E** (if x is east of z’s box). Partial overlaps (e.g., x spans part of z’s box and extends east) are not expressible with single-tile relations under the given definitions.

**Answer:** N, S, W, SW, NW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: The possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x NW y** implies:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

2. **y SW z** implies:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)

3. **Combining x-axis:**
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ x is west (W) of z.

4. **Analyzing y-axis possibilities:**
   - **NW:** If z’s top (supy(z)) ≤ x’s bottom (infy(x)), x is north of z ⇒ **NW**.
   - **SW:** If x’s top (supy(x)) ≤ z’s bottom (infy(z)), x is south of z ⇒ **SW**.
   - **W:** If z’s y-projection contains x’s y-projection (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) ⇒ **W**.

5. **Excluding others:**
   - **B, N, S, E, NE, SE** are impossible due to x being strictly west and y-axis constraints.

For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are all single-tile cardinal directions.

**Answer:** NE, E, SE
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: SE, E, S, B
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are NE and N. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NE y:** x is entirely northeast of y, meaning `supx(y) ≤ infx(x)` and `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`.
   - **y N z:** y is entirely north of z, meaning `supy(z) ≤ infy(y)`, with y's x-projection within z's x-projection (`infx(z) ≤ infx(y)`, `supx(y) ≤ supx(z)`).

2. **Spatial Implications:**
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** Since `infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≥ supy(z)`, x is north of z (`supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`).
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** From `supx(y) ≤ supx(z)` and `supx(y) ≤ infx(x)`, x starts east of y. Depending on whether `infx(x)` exceeds `supx(z)`:
     - **If `infx(x) > supx(z):** x is entirely east of z, making x **NE** of z.
     - **If `infx(x) ≤ supx(z):** x's x-projection overlaps/aligns with z's x-projection (as y's x is within z's x), making x **N** of z.

3. **Conclusion:** x must be either **N** (if x's x-projection stays within z's x) or **NE** (if x extends east beyond z's x). Other relations are invalid due to constraints on y-axis alignment and bounding box overlaps.
