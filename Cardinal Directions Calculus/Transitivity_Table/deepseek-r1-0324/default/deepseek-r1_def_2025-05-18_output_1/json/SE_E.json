{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The possible relations between region x and z are SE and E. \n\n**SE**: If x's vertical projection is entirely below z (supy(x) \u2264 infy(z)), then x is SE of z.  \n**E**: If x's vertical projection overlaps with z (supy(x) > infy(z) but x remains east of z), then x is E of z.  \n\nNo other relations satisfy the bounding box constraints derived from x being SE of y and y being E of z.  \n\nAnswer: SE, E", "elapsed-time": 172.19643235206604, "reasoning-tokens": 4994, "completion-tokens": 5104}
