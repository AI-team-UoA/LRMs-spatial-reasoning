{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, S, and B. \n\n**SW**: If z's bounding box does not extend beyond y's southwest, x remains southwest of z.  \n**W**: If z extends west past y, x can be west of z with y-projection within z's.  \n**S**: If z extends south past y, x can be south of z with x-projection within z's.  \n**B**: If z's bounding box is large enough to enclose x, x is within z's bounds.  \n\nAnswer: SW, W, S, B", "elapsed-time": 365.05798721313477, "reasoning-tokens": 10999, "completion-tokens": 11127}
