{"prompt": "If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. \n\n**NE**: If x is east of z and entirely above it.  \n**E**: If x is east of z and vertically within z's bounds.  \n**SE**: If x is east of z and entirely below it (since x can be between y and z vertically).  \n\nAnswer: NE, E, SE", "elapsed-time": 370.1654772758484, "reasoning-tokens": 10310, "completion-tokens": 10394}
