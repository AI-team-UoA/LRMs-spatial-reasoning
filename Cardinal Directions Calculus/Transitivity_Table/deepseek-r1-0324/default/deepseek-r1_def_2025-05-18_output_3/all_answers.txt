For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Given Relations:**
   - **x N y:** x is entirely above y, with x's x-projection within y's.
   - **y SW z:** y is southwest of z, meaning y is entirely left and below z.

2. **Analyzing x's Position Relative to z:**
   - **x's x-projection:** Since x is within y's x and y is left of z, x is entirely left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
   - **x's y-projection:** x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), and y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)), so infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

3. **Determining Possible y-Projections:**
   - **Case 1 (SW):** If x's y-projection ends at or below z's bottom (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), x is SW of z.
   - **Case 2 (W):** If x's y-projection is within z's y (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), x is W of z.
   - **Case 3 (NW):** If x's y-projection starts above z's top (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), x is NW of z.

SE: If x is east and south of z.  

**Answer:** SW, S, SE
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, NW, S, SW, SE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x W y:** x is entirely west of y with x's vertical projection within y's.
   - **y NE z:** y is northeast of z, so z is southwest of y.

2. **Spatial Constraints:**
   - **x-axis:** Both x and z are west of y (supx(x), supx(z) ≤ infx(y)).
   - **y-axis:** z is entirely south of x (supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)).

3. **Possible x-axis Relationships Between x and z:**
   - **Case 1:** z's x-projection contained within x's → **z S x** (x N z).
   - **Case 2:** z entirely west of x → **z SW x** (x NE z).
   - **Case 3:** z entirely east of x → **z SE x** (x NW z).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - All six directional relations (N, NE, NW, S, SW, SE) are possible based on the relative positions of x and z's projections.

**Answer:** E, W, B
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are S (South) and SE (South East). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Vertical Relationship:** Since y is S of z, y's top (supy(y)) is below z's bottom (infy(z)). x is E of y, so x's vertical bounds are within y's, making x also entirely south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

2. **Horizontal Relationship:**
   - **Case 1 (x horizontally within z):** If x's horizontal projection (infx(x) to supx(x)) is entirely within z's horizontal bounds (infx(z) to supx(z)), then x is **S** of z.
   - **Case 2 (x horizontally east of z):** If x starts east of z's rightmost point (infx(x) ≥ supx(z)), x is **SE** of z (entirely east and south).

**Answer:** B, E
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Given Relations**:
   - **x S y**: x is directly below y, within y's x-bounds.
   - **y N z**: y is directly above z, with z's x-bounds encompassing y's (and thus x's).

2. **Horizontal Alignment**:
   - x's x-projection is within y's, which is within z's. Hence, x is horizontally centered within z.

   - **x S z**: If x is positioned below z (x's top ≤ z's bottom).
   - **x B z**: If x's y-bounds are entirely within z's y-bounds.

**Answer:** SE, E
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Horizontal Relation:** Since x is S of y, it's horizontally within y. As y is NW of z, y is left of z. Thus, x is left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
2. **Vertical Possibilities:**
   - **NW:** If x's bottom (infy(x)) ≥ z's top (supy(z)), x is above z.
   - **W:** If x's vertical interval is within z's (z's bottom ≤ x's bottom and x's top ≤ z's top).
   - **SW:** If x's top (supy(x)) ≤ z's bottom (infy(z)), x is below z.

**Answer:** NW, W, SW
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. 

**NE**: If x is positioned such that it is entirely above z vertically while being to the right.  
**E**: If x's vertical bounds are entirely within z's vertical bounds while being to the right.  
**SE**: If x is entirely below z vertically while being to the right.  

Answer: NE, E, SE.  
**Final Answer**
\boxed{NE}, \boxed{E}, \boxed{SE}
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are S and B. 

**Answer:** B, S
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are N and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NW y**: x is entirely west and north of y.
     - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is left of y)
     - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
   - **y N z**: y is entirely north of z with y's horizontal projection within z's.
     - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)
     - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's horizontal span is within z's).

2. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - From **x NW y** and **y N z**, we derive:
     - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ⇒ **x is entirely above z** (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

3. **Horizontal Analysis:**
   - From **x NW y**: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - From **y N z**: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
   - Combining these: **supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z)**. This implies two cases:
     - **Case 1: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)** ⇒ x is entirely west of z (**x NW z**).
     - **Case 2: infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y)** ⇒ x's horizontal projection is within z's horizontal bounds (**x N z**).

4. **Eliminating Other Directions:**
   - **W, E, S, SE, SW, NE, B** are impossible because x is strictly above z and cannot overlap vertically or extend southward. Overlapping horizontally (outside strict west/within bounds) would violate single-tile constraints.

**Answer:** B, S, SW, W, E, SE
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between x and z are SW and S. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **x SW y implies:**
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

2. **y S z implies:**
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x within z's x)

3. **Combining y's constraints into x's:**
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is south of z via y)
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z) (x's east ≤ y's west, which is ≥ z's west)

4. **Possible x-z relations:**
   - **SW:** If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x entirely west of z)
   - **S:** If supx(x) > infx(z) but x's x within z's x (infx(x) ≥ infx(z))

**Answer:** SW, S
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW.

**Answer:** SW, W, NW
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, S, and SE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x SW y:** x's east ≤ y's west (`supx(x) ≤ infx(y)`) and x's north ≤ y's south (`supy(x) ≤ infy(y)`).
   - **y SE z:** y's east ≤ z's west (`supx(z) ≤ infx(y)`) and y's north ≤ z's south (`supy(y) ≤ infy(z)`).

2. **Infer Vertical (y-axis) Relationship:**
   - From `supy(x) ≤ infy(y)` (x SW y) and `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y SE z), we get `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`. Thus, **x is entirely south of z**.

3. **Infer Horizontal (x-axis) Relationships:**
   - Both `supx(x) ≤ infx(y)` (x SW y) and `supx(z) ≤ infx(y)` (y SE z) imply **x and z are west of y**. However, their relative x-projections can vary:
     - **Case 1:** `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` → **x is west of z** → **SW**.
     - **Case 2:** `supx(z) ≤ infx(x)` → **x is east of z** → **SE**.
     - **Case 3:** Overlapping x-projections (`infx(z) ≤ supx(x)` and `infx(x) ≤ supx(z)`) with x contained within z's x-projection → **S**.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The vertical constraint forces x to be south of z, and horizontal variations allow **SW, S, SE**.

**Answer:** SE, E, B, S, W, SW.

**SE, E**
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: SE, S
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are SE, E, and NE. 

**SE**: If x is southeast of z, which can happen when x's y-projection is entirely below z's.  
**E**: If x is directly east of z with overlapping y-projections.  
**NE**: If x is northeast of z, which occurs when x's y-projection is entirely above z's.  

Each scenario satisfies the bounding box conditions derived from the given relations x SE y and y NW z. 

ANSWER: NE, E, SE
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, S, and SE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Given Relations:**
   - **x SE y:** x is southeast of y, so x is east (right) and south (below) of y.
   - **y SW z:** y is southwest of z, so z is northeast (right and above) of y.

2. **Vertical Relationship (North-South):**
   - From **x SE y**, x is entirely below y: \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \).
   - From **y SW z**, z is entirely above y: \( \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z) \).
   - Combining these: \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z) \), so \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z) \). This means **x is entirely south of z**, ruling out all northern relations (N, NE, NW, B).

3. **Horizontal Relationship (East-West):**
   - Both x and z are east of y (from x SE y and z NE of y). Their horizontal positions relative to each other depend on their bounding boxes:
     - **x could be west of z** (SW relation): \( \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z) \).
     - **x could be east of z** (SE relation): \( \text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x) \).
     - **x could be horizontally within z** (S relation): \( \text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z) \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The vertical constraint forces x to be south of z.
   - The horizontal constraints allow three possibilities: SW (west and south), S (directly south), SE (east and south).

**Answer:** SW, S, SE

**Answer:** N, NE, E, SE, S, B
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are N, NE, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NE y**: x is northeast of y, so x is east and north of y.
   - **y NW z**: y is northwest of z, so y is west and north of z.

2. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - **y is west of z** (y's right edge ≤ z's left edge).
   - **y is north of z** (z's top ≤ y's bottom).
   - **x is east of y** (y's right edge ≤ x's left edge).
   - **x is north of y** (y's top ≤ x's bottom).

3. **Combined Constraints for x and z:**
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** Since z is below y and x is above y, **x is always north of z** (z's top ≤ x's bottom).
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** 
     - x starts east of y, and y starts west of z. This allows three possibilities:
       - **x's x-interval aligns within z's** → **N**.
       - **x is entirely east of z** → **NE**.
       - **x is entirely west of z** (if x doesn’t extend past z’s left edge) → **NW**.

4. **Verification via Definitions:**
   - **N (x N z):** Valid if x's x-interval is within z's (x horizontally aligned with z).
   - **NE (x NE z):** Valid if x's left edge ≥ z's right edge (x fully east of z).
   - **NW (x NW z):** Valid if x's right edge ≤ z's left edge (x fully west of z).

**Answer:** N, NE, NW

**Answer:** NE, E, SE
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are NE, E, N, and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Given Relations:**
   - **x NE y:** x is entirely northeast of y, meaning x starts right of y's right edge and above y's top edge.
   - **y B z:** y is entirely within z's bounding box.

2. **Constraints from y B z:**
   - y's bounding box is inside z's:  
     - `infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)`  
     - `infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`.

3. **Constraints from x NE y:**
   - `supx(y) ≤ infx(x)` (x starts right of y)  
   - `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)` (x starts above y).

4. **Possible Positions of x Relative to z:**
   - **Case 1 (x NE z):** If y is at z's northeast corner (`supx(y) = supx(z)`, `supy(y) = supy(z)`), x starts right of z and above z → **NE**.
   - **Case 2 (x E z):** If y's right edge aligns with z's (`supx(y) = supx(z)`), x starts right of z but vertically within z → **E**.
   - **Case 3 (x N z):** If y's top edge aligns with z's (`supy(y) = supy(z)`), x starts above z but horizontally within z → **N**.
   - **Case 4 (x B z):** If x stays entirely within z's bounding box (e.g., y is interior, and x is small) → **B**.

5. **Eliminate Impossible Relations:**
   - Directions like S, SW, W, NW, SE require x to be south/west of z, which contradicts x being northeast of y (inside z).
