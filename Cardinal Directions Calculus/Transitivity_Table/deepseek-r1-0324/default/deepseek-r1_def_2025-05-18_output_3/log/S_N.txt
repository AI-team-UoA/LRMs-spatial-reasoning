PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Given Relations**:
   - **x S y**: x is directly below y, within y's x-bounds.
   - **y N z**: y is directly above z, with z's x-bounds encompassing y's (and thus x's).

2. **Horizontal Alignment**:
   - x's x-projection is within y's, which is within z's. Hence, x is horizontally centered within z.

3. **Vertical Possibilities**:
   - **x N z**: If x is positioned above z (x's bottom ≥ z's top).
   - **x S z**: If x is positioned below z (x's top ≤ z's bottom).
   - **x B z**: If x's y-bounds are entirely within z's y-bounds.

**Answer:**  
N, S, B
