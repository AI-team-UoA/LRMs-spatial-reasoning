PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are S (South) and SE (South East). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Vertical Relationship:** Since y is S of z, y's top (supy(y)) is below z's bottom (infy(z)). x is E of y, so x's vertical bounds are within y's, making x also entirely south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

2. **Horizontal Relationship:**
   - **Case 1 (x horizontally within z):** If x's horizontal projection (infx(x) to supx(x)) is entirely within z's horizontal bounds (infx(z) to supx(z)), then x is **S** of z.
   - **Case 2 (x horizontally east of z):** If x starts east of z's rightmost point (infx(x) ≥ supx(z)), x is **SE** of z (entirely east and south).

**Answer:** SE, S
