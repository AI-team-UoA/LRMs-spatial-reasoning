PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, S, and SE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Given Relations:**
   - **x SE y:** x is southeast of y, so x is east (right) and south (below) of y.
   - **y SW z:** y is southwest of z, so z is northeast (right and above) of y.

2. **Vertical Relationship (North-South):**
   - From **x SE y**, x is entirely below y: \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \).
   - From **y SW z**, z is entirely above y: \( \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z) \).
   - Combining these: \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{infy}(z) \), so \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z) \). This means **x is entirely south of z**, ruling out all northern relations (N, NE, NW, B).

3. **Horizontal Relationship (East-West):**
   - Both x and z are east of y (from x SE y and z NE of y). Their horizontal positions relative to each other depend on their bounding boxes:
     - **x could be west of z** (SW relation): \( \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{infx}(z) \).
     - **x could be east of z** (SE relation): \( \text{supx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x) \).
     - **x could be horizontally within z** (S relation): \( \text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z) \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The vertical constraint forces x to be south of z.
   - The horizontal constraints allow three possibilities: SW (west and south), S (directly south), SE (east and south).

**Answer:** SW, S, SE
