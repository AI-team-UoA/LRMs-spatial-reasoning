PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. 

**NE**: If x is positioned such that it is entirely above z vertically while being to the right.  
**E**: If x's vertical bounds are entirely within z's vertical bounds while being to the right.  
**SE**: If x is entirely below z vertically while being to the right.  

Answer: NE, E, SE.  
**Final Answer**
\boxed{NE}, \boxed{E}, \boxed{SE}
