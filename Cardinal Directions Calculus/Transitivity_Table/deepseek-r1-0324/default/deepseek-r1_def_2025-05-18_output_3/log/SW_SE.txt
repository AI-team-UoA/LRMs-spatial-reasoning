PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, S, and SE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x SW y:** x's east ≤ y's west (`supx(x) ≤ infx(y)`) and x's north ≤ y's south (`supy(x) ≤ infy(y)`).
   - **y SE z:** y's east ≤ z's west (`supx(z) ≤ infx(y)`) and y's north ≤ z's south (`supy(y) ≤ infy(z)`).

2. **Infer Vertical (y-axis) Relationship:**
   - From `supy(x) ≤ infy(y)` (x SW y) and `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y SE z), we get `supy(x) ≤ infy(z)`. Thus, **x is entirely south of z**.

3. **Infer Horizontal (x-axis) Relationships:**
   - Both `supx(x) ≤ infx(y)` (x SW y) and `supx(z) ≤ infx(y)` (y SE z) imply **x and z are west of y**. However, their relative x-projections can vary:
     - **Case 1:** `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` → **x is west of z** → **SW**.
     - **Case 2:** `supx(z) ≤ infx(x)` → **x is east of z** → **SE**.
     - **Case 3:** Overlapping x-projections (`infx(z) ≤ supx(x)` and `infx(x) ≤ supx(z)`) with x contained within z's x-projection → **S**.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The vertical constraint forces x to be south of z, and horizontal variations allow **SW, S, SE**.

**Answer:** SW, S, SE
