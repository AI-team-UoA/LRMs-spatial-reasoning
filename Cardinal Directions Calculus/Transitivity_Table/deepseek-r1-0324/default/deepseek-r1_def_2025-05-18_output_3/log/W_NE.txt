PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are N, NE, NW, S, SW, SE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x W y:** x is entirely west of y with x's vertical projection within y's.
   - **y NE z:** y is northeast of z, so z is southwest of y.

2. **Spatial Constraints:**
   - **x-axis:** Both x and z are west of y (supx(x), supx(z) ≤ infx(y)).
   - **y-axis:** z is entirely south of x (supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)).

3. **Possible x-axis Relationships Between x and z:**
   - **Case 1:** z's x-projection contained within x's → **z S x** (x N z).
   - **Case 2:** z entirely west of x → **z SW x** (x NE z).
   - **Case 3:** z entirely east of x → **z SE x** (x NW z).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - All six directional relations (N, NE, NW, S, SW, SE) are possible based on the relative positions of x and z's projections.

**Answer:** N, NE, NW, S, SW, SE
