PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Given Relations:**
   - **x N y:** x is entirely above y, with x's x-projection within y's.
   - **y SW z:** y is southwest of z, meaning y is entirely left and below z.

2. **Analyzing x's Position Relative to z:**
   - **x's x-projection:** Since x is within y's x and y is left of z, x is entirely left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
   - **x's y-projection:** x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)), and y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)), so infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

3. **Determining Possible y-Projections:**
   - **Case 1 (SW):** If x's y-projection ends at or below z's bottom (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), x is SW of z.
   - **Case 2 (W):** If x's y-projection is within z's y (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), x is W of z.
   - **Case 3 (NW):** If x's y-projection starts above z's top (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), x is NW of z.

**Answer:** NW, W, SW
