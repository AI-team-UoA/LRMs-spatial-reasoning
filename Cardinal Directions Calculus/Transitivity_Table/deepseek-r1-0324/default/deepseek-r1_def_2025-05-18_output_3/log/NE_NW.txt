PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are N, NE, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NE y**: x is northeast of y, so x is east and north of y.
   - **y NW z**: y is northwest of z, so y is west and north of z.

2. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - **y is west of z** (y's right edge ≤ z's left edge).
   - **y is north of z** (z's top ≤ y's bottom).
   - **x is east of y** (y's right edge ≤ x's left edge).
   - **x is north of y** (y's top ≤ x's bottom).

3. **Combined Constraints for x and z:**
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** Since z is below y and x is above y, **x is always north of z** (z's top ≤ x's bottom).
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** 
     - x starts east of y, and y starts west of z. This allows three possibilities:
       - **x's x-interval aligns within z's** → **N**.
       - **x is entirely east of z** → **NE**.
       - **x is entirely west of z** (if x doesn’t extend past z’s left edge) → **NW**.

4. **Verification via Definitions:**
   - **N (x N z):** Valid if x's x-interval is within z's (x horizontally aligned with z).
   - **NE (x NE z):** Valid if x's left edge ≥ z's right edge (x fully east of z).
   - **NW (x NW z):** Valid if x's right edge ≤ z's left edge (x fully west of z).

**Answer:** N, NE, NW
