PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between x and z are SW and S. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **x SW y implies:**
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

2. **y S z implies:**
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x within z's x)

3. **Combining y's constraints into x's:**
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is south of z via y)
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z) (x's east ≤ y's west, which is ≥ z's west)

4. **Possible x-z relations:**
   - **SW:** If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x entirely west of z)
   - **S:** If supx(x) > infx(z) but x's x within z's x (infx(x) ≥ infx(z))

**Answer:** SW, S
