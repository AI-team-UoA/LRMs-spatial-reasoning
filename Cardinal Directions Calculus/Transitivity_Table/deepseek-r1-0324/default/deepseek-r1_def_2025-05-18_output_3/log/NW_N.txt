PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are N and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NW y**: x is entirely west and north of y.
     - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is left of y)
     - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
   - **y N z**: y is entirely north of z with y's horizontal projection within z's.
     - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)
     - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's horizontal span is within z's).

2. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - From **x NW y** and **y N z**, we derive:
     - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ⇒ **x is entirely above z** (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).

3. **Horizontal Analysis:**
   - From **x NW y**: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - From **y N z**: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
   - Combining these: **supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z)**. This implies two cases:
     - **Case 1: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)** ⇒ x is entirely west of z (**x NW z**).
     - **Case 2: infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y)** ⇒ x's horizontal projection is within z's horizontal bounds (**x N z**).

4. **Eliminating Other Directions:**
   - **W, E, S, SE, SW, NE, B** are impossible because x is strictly above z and cannot overlap vertically or extend southward. Overlapping horizontally (outside strict west/within bounds) would violate single-tile constraints.

**Answer:** NW, N
