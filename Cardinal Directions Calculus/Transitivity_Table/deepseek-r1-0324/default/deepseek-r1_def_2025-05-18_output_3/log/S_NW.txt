PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Horizontal Relation:** Since x is S of y, it's horizontally within y. As y is NW of z, y is left of z. Thus, x is left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
2. **Vertical Possibilities:**
   - **NW:** If x's bottom (infy(x)) ≥ z's top (supy(z)), x is above z.
   - **W:** If x's vertical interval is within z's (z's bottom ≤ x's bottom and x's top ≤ z's top).
   - **SW:** If x's top (supy(x)) ≤ z's bottom (infy(z)), x is below z.

**Answer:** NW, W, SW
