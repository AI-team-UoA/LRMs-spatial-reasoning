PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SE, E, and NE. 

**SE**: If x is southeast of z, which can happen when x's y-projection is entirely below z's.  
**E**: If x is directly east of z with overlapping y-projections.  
**NE**: If x is northeast of z, which occurs when x's y-projection is entirely above z's.  

Each scenario satisfies the bounding box conditions derived from the given relations x SE y and y NW z. 

ANSWER: NE, E, SE
