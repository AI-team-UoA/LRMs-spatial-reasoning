PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are N and NE. 

**N**: If x's horizontal projection is entirely within z's horizontal bounds while being vertically above.  
**NE**: If x is entirely to the right of z's horizontal bounds and entirely above vertically. 

Thus, the answer is **N, NE**.
