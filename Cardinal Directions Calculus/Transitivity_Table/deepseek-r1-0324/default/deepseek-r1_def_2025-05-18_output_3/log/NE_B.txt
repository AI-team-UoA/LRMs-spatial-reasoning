PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are NE, E, N, and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Given Relations:**
   - **x NE y:** x is entirely northeast of y, meaning x starts right of y's right edge and above y's top edge.
   - **y B z:** y is entirely within z's bounding box.

2. **Constraints from y B z:**
   - y's bounding box is inside z's:  
     - `infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)`  
     - `infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`.

3. **Constraints from x NE y:**
   - `supx(y) ≤ infx(x)` (x starts right of y)  
   - `supy(y) ≤ infy(x)` (x starts above y).

4. **Possible Positions of x Relative to z:**
   - **Case 1 (x NE z):** If y is at z's northeast corner (`supx(y) = supx(z)`, `supy(y) = supy(z)`), x starts right of z and above z → **NE**.
   - **Case 2 (x E z):** If y's right edge aligns with z's (`supx(y) = supx(z)`), x starts right of z but vertically within z → **E**.
   - **Case 3 (x N z):** If y's top edge aligns with z's (`supy(y) = supy(z)`), x starts above z but horizontally within z → **N**.
   - **Case 4 (x B z):** If x stays entirely within z's bounding box (e.g., y is interior, and x is small) → **B**.

5. **Eliminate Impossible Relations:**
   - Directions like S, SW, W, NW, SE require x to be south/west of z, which contradicts x being northeast of y (inside z).

**Answer:** NE, E, N, B.
