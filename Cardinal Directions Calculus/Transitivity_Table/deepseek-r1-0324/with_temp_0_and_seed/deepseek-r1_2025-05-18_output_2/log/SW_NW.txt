PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Horizontal Analysis:**
   - Given x is SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - Given y is NW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
   - Combining these: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Thus, x is **west** of z horizontally.

2. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - From x SW y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
   - From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
   - Both x and z lie entirely **below** y. Their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed and can vary:
     - **SW of z**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).
     - **NW of z**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x).
     - **W of z**: If x’s vertical bounds are within z’s (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

**Possible Relations:**  
- **SW**: x is west and south of z.  
- **NW**: x is west and north of z.  
- **W**: x is west of z with vertical overlap (contained within z’s vertical bounds).  

Thus, the answer is **SW, W, NW**.
