PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between x and z are B, W, and E. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Given Relations:**
   - **x is W of y:** x is entirely to the west of y, vertically within y's bounds.
   - **y is E of z:** y is entirely to the east of z, vertically within z's bounds.

2. **Deriving Constraints:**
   - **Horizontally:** Both x and z are west of y (their right edges ≤ y's left edge).
   - **Vertically:** x's vertical interval is contained within z's vertical interval (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

3. **Analyzing Possible Horizontal Arrangements:**
   - **x west of z (W):** supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - **x east of z (E):** supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - **x within z's x-interval (B):** infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

4. **Vertical Constraints:**
   - Vertical containment ensures only B, W, or E are possible (diagonals like NW, SW require impossible vertical alignments).

**Answer:** B, W, E
