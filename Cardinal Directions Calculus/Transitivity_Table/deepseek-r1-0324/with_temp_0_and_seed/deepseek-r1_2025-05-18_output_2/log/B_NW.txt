PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are B and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Relations:**
   - **x B y:** x's bounding box contains y's bounding box.
   - **y NW z:** y is entirely to the **North West** of z, meaning:
     - y's rightmost x-coordinate ≤ z's leftmost x-coordinate (`supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`).
     - z's topmost y-coordinate ≤ y's bottommost y-coordinate (`supy(z) ≤ infy(y)`).

2. **Spatial Implications:**
   - Since **x contains y**, x's bounding box extends at least as far as y's in all directions.
   - Since **y is NW of z**, z lies **South East** of y.

3. **Possible Configurations for x and z:**
   - **Case 1: x's bounding box contains z's box.**
     - If x extends far enough **East** and **South** to fully enclose z, then **x B z**.
   - **Case 2: x's bounding box matches y's box.**
     - If x's box is exactly equal to y's (no extension), then **x inherits y's NW relation to z**, so **x NW z**.
   - **Other Cases (Overlap/Partial Containment):**
     - If x's box overlaps with z's box but does **not fully contain** it, no single-tile directional relation applies (e.g., overlapping but not directional). These are excluded as per the problem constraints.

4. **Eliminating Impossible Relations:**
   - **N, S, E, W, NE, SE, SW:** All require strict directional alignment without overlap, which is impossible here due to x's containment of y and z's position relative to y. For example:
     - **S, SW, SE:** Require x to be below z, but z is already below y, and x contains y.
     - **E, NE:** Require x to be East of z, but z is East of y, and x's East boundary depends on how much it extends beyond y (can overlap or contain, but not strictly East).

**Final Answer:**  
The possible relations are **B** (if x contains z) and **NW** (if x’s box matches y’s box). 

**Answer:**  
B, NW
