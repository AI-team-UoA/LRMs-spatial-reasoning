PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and S. 

**SW**: If x is entirely west of z (x's eastern boundary ≤ z's western boundary) while being south, satisfying supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
**S**: If x's horizontal projection is within z's (z's western boundary ≤ x's western boundary and x's eastern boundary ≤ z's eastern boundary) while being vertically south (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  

**Answer**: SW, S
