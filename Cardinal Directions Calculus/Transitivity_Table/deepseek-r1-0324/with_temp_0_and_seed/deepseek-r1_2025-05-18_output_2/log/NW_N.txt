PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

The possible relations between region x and z are **N** and **NW**. 

- **N** is possible if x's horizontal projection is within z's horizontal projection, making x entirely above z.
- **NW** is possible if x's horizontal projection is entirely to the west of z's horizontal projection, placing x northwest of z.

**Answer:** N, NW
