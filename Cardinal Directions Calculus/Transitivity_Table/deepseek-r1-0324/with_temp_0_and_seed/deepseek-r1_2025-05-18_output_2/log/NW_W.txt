PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are NW and W. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Positioning from x NW y:**
   - **x-axis:** supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is left of y).
   - **y-axis:** supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y).

2. **Positioning from y W z:**
   - **x-axis:** supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is left of z).
   - **y-axis:** infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z's y-interval contains y's).

3. **Combining x-axis:**
   - From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
   - **Result:** supx(x) ≤ infx(z) → **x is left of z**.

4. **Combining y-axis:**
   - From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   - From y W z: supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - **Possible Cases:**
     - **Case 1:** supy(z) ≤ infy(x) → x is **NW** of z (entirely above z).
     - **Case 2:** supy(z) > infy(x) → x's y-interval overlaps with z's. If supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x is **W** of z (vertically overlapping).

5. **Conclusion:** Depending on z's y-bound relative to x's, x can be **NW** (if z's y-sup ≤ x's y-inf) or **W** (if z's y-sup > x's y-inf and x's y-sup ≤ z's y-sup).

**Answer:** NW, W
