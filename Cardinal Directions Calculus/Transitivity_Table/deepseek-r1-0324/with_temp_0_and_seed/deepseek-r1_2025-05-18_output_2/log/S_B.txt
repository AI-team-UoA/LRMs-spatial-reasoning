PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are S and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  
1. **Given Relations:**  
   - x is S of y:  
     - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  
     - x is horizontally within y's bounds.  
   - y is B of z:  
     - y's bounding box is within z's.  

2. **Horizontal Analysis:**  
   - x is horizontally within y, which is within z. Thus, x is horizontally within z.  

3. **Vertical Analysis:**  
   - **Case 1:** If supy(x) ≤ infy(z):  
     - x is entirely below z vertically.  
     - Relation: **x S z**.  
   - **Case 2:** If supy(x) > infy(z):  
     - x's vertical projection overlaps with z's.  
     - If x's bounding box is entirely within z's (infy(z) ≤ infy(x)), relation: **x B z**.  

4. **Exclusion of Other Relations:**  
   - x cannot be N, NE, NW, E, W, SE, or SW due to horizontal containment and vertical positioning below y (and z).  

**Answer:** B, S
