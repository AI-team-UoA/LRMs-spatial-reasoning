PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SE and E. 

SE: If x is entirely south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), then x is SE of z.  
E: If x's vertical projection is within z's vertical bounds (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), then x is E of z.  

**Answer:** SE, E
