PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are N, NW, and NE. 

**N**: If x's horizontal projection is within z's, x is directly above z.  
**NW**: If x is to the left and above z.  
**NE**: If x is to the right and above z.  

These satisfy the constraints derived from x being west of y and y northeast of z, ensuring x is vertically above z with horizontal positioning varying as described.

**Answer:** N, NW, NE
