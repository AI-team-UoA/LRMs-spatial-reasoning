PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and S. 

SW occurs when x's horizontal projection is entirely west of z's, satisfying supx(x) ≤ infx(z) along with the vertical condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z). S applies when x's horizontal projection is within z's horizontal bounds (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) while x remains vertically south of z. These are the only valid configurations under the given constraints.

**Answer:** SW, S
