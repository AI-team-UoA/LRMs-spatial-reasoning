PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are W and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x W y**: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), and y-projection of x is within y's.
   - **y B z**: y's bounding box is within z's, so infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), and similarly for y-axis.

2. **Infer x-axis for x and z:**
   - From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - From y B z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
   - Thus, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z) → supx(x) could be ≤ infx(z) (x W z) or between infx(z) and infx(y) (check if B applies).

3. **Case 1: supx(x) ≤ infx(z):**
   - x's x-projection is entirely to the left of z's → **x W z**.

4. **Case 2: supx(x) > infx(z):**
   - x's x-projection overlaps with z's. For B relation, x's x-projection must be within z's (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).
   - Since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(z), if infx(x) ≥ infx(z), then x's x-projection is within z's → **x B z**.

5. **Vertical Projection:**
   - From y B z and x W y, y's y-projection is within z's, and x's y-projection is within y's. Hence, x's y-projection is within z's, satisfying conditions for W and B.

6. **Exclusion of Other Relations:**
   - Other directions (N, S, E, NE, NW, SE, SW) require y-axis or x-axis conditions incompatible with the inferred projections.

**Answer:** W, B
