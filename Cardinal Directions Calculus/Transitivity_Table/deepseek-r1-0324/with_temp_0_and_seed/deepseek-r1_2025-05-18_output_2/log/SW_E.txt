PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, S, B, SE, E. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  
1. **Given Relations:**  
   - x SW y: x is southwest of y ⇒ x is left and below y.  
   - y E z: y is east of z ⇒ y is right of z, vertically within z.  

2. **Horizontal Analysis (x vs. z):**  
   - x is west of y, and y is east of z.  
   - x can be:  
     - **West of z** (SW, W),  
     - **Overlapping/within z** horizontally (S, B),  
     - **East of z** but still west of y (SE, E).  

3. **Vertical Analysis (x vs. z):**  
   - x is below y, and y is vertically within z.  
   - x can be:  
     - **Below z** (SW, S, SE),  
     - **Vertically within z** (W, B, E).  

4. **Valid Combinations:**  
   - **SW:** x west and below z.  
   - **W:** x west of z, vertically aligned.  
   - **S:** x below z, horizontally within z.  
   - **B:** x entirely inside z.  
   - **SE:** x east of z and below.  
   - **E:** x east of z, vertically aligned.  

**Answer:** SW, W, S, B, SE, E.
