PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are N and B. 

**N**: If z's bounding box does not extend north enough to include x, then x remains entirely above z.  
**B**: If z's bounding box extends north to fully contain x, then x is within z's bounds.  

Answer: N, B
