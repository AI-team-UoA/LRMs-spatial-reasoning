PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are S (South) and SE (South East). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **y S z**: y is entirely below z and within z's horizontal bounds.
2. **x E y**: x is to the east of y, within y's vertical bounds (thus below z).
3. **Horizontal Analysis**:
   - If x's horizontal bounds are entirely within z's (supx(x) â‰¤ supx(z)), x is **S** of z.
   - If x's horizontal bounds extend beyond z's (supx(x) > supx(z)), x is **SE** of z.
4. **Vertical Analysis**: x is always below z due to y's position.

**Answer:** SE, S
