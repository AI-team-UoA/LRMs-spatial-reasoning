PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and W. 

**SW**: If x's top boundary is at or below z's bottom boundary (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), x is southwest of z.  
**W**: If x's vertical projection overlaps with z's but x is entirely to the west (infy(z) ≤ infy(x)), x is west of z.  

**Answer:** SW, W
