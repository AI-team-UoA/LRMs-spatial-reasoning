PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are NE, E, and SE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding x S y:**
   - x is entirely below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).
   - x's x-projection is within y's x-projection (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).

2. **Understanding y NE z:**
   - y is northeast of z, meaning z's x and y maxima are ≤ y's minima (supx(z) ≤ infx(y), supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).

3. **Determining x's Position Relative to z:**
   - **x-axis:** x's x-projection starts at infx(x) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(z), so x is entirely east of z.
   - **y-axis:** x's y-projection supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y), and z's supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NE z). Thus:
     - If x's y-projection is **above z's top** (infy(x) ≥ supy(z)), x is **NE** of z.
     - If x's y-projection is **within z's y-bounds**, x is **E** of z.
     - If x's y-projection is **below z's bottom** (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), x is **SE** of z.

**Answer:** NE, E, SE
