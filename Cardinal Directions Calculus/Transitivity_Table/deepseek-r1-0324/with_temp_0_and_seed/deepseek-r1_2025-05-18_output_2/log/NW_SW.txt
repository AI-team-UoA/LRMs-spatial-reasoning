PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW. 

**NW**: If x's vertical projection is entirely above z's.  
**W**: If x's vertical projection is within z's.  
**SW**: If x's vertical projection is entirely below z's.  

These satisfy the horizontal west alignment from the given relations and the possible vertical alignments based on overlapping projections.

**Answer:** NW, W, SW
