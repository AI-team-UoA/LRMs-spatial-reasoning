PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

NW, N, W, B, NE, E

The possible relations between x and z are NW, N, W, B, NE, and E.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x NW y** implies:
   - x is left of y (`supx(x) ≤ infx(y)`).
   - x is above y (`supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`).

2. **y E z** implies:
   - y is right of z (`supx(z) ≤ infx(y)`).
   - y's vertical bounds are within z's (`infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`).

3. **Horizontal Analysis (x vs. z):**
   - Both x and z are left of y (`supx(x), supx(z) ≤ infx(y)`), so x and z can be arranged:
     - x left of z (`supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` → **W** or **NW**).
     - z left of x (`supx(z) ≤ infx(x)` → **E** or **NE**).
     - Overlapping x-projections (x within z's x-bounds → **N** or **B**).

4. **Vertical Analysis (x vs. z):**
   - x is above y (`supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`), and y's bounds are within z's (`infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`).
   - x's vertical position relative to z:
     - If `infy(x) ≥ supy(z)` → x is **N** or **NW/NE**.
     - If `infy(x) < supy(z)` and x's y-bounds within z's → **W/E/B**.

5. **Valid Combinations:**
   - **NW**: x left of z and above (`supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`).
   - **W**: x left of z with y-projection within z's.
   - **N**: x's x-projection within z's and above.
   - **NE**: x right of z and above.
   - **E**: x right of z with y-projection within z's.
   - **B**: x's bounding box fully within z's.

**Answer:** NW, N, W, B, NE, E
