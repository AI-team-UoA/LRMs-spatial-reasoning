PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Horizontal Placement:** Since x is N of y, it's within y's horizontal bounds. As y is SW of z, y is left of z. Thus, x is entirely left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
2. **Vertical Scenarios:**
   - **SW:** If x's top is ≤ z's bottom (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), x is left and below z.
   - **W:** If x's vertical bounds are within z's (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), x is left and vertically aligned with z.
   - **NW:** If x's bottom is ≥ z's top (infy(x) ≥ supy(z)), x is left and above z.

**Answer:** NW, W, SW
