**Answer:** N, S, B
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Horizontal Placement:** Since x is N of y, it's within y's horizontal bounds. As y is SW of z, y is left of z. Thus, x is entirely left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
2. **Vertical Scenarios:**
   - **SW:** If x's top is ≤ z's bottom (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), x is left and below z.
   - **W:** If x's vertical bounds are within z's (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), x is left and vertically aligned with z.
   - **NW:** If x's bottom is ≥ z's top (infy(x) ≥ supy(z)), x is left and above z.

**Answer:** NW, W, SW
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are NE and E.

**Answer:** N, NW
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: The possible relations between x and z are B, W, and E. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Given Relations:**
   - **x is W of y:** x is entirely to the west of y, vertically within y's bounds.
   - **y is E of z:** y is entirely to the east of z, vertically within z's bounds.

2. **Deriving Constraints:**
   - **Horizontally:** Both x and z are west of y (their right edges ≤ y's left edge).
   - **Vertically:** x's vertical interval is contained within z's vertical interval (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

3. **Analyzing Possible Horizontal Arrangements:**
   - **x west of z (W):** supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - **x east of z (E):** supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - **x within z's x-interval (B):** infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

4. **Vertical Constraints:**
   - Vertical containment ensures only B, W, or E are possible (diagonals like NW, SW require impossible vertical alignments).

**Answer:** B, W, E
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and S. 

SW occurs when x's horizontal projection is entirely west of z's, satisfying supx(x) ≤ infx(z) along with the vertical condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z). S applies when x's horizontal projection is within z's horizontal bounds (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) while x remains vertically south of z. These are the only valid configurations under the given constraints.

**Answer:** SW, S

For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are N, NW, and NE. 

**N**: If x's horizontal projection is within z's, x is directly above z.  
**NW**: If x is to the left and above z.  
**NE**: If x is to the right and above z.  

These satisfy the constraints derived from x being west of y and y northeast of z, ensuring x is vertically above z with horizontal positioning varying as described.

**Answer:** N, NW, NE
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are W and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x W y**: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), and y-projection of x is within y's.
   - **y B z**: y's bounding box is within z's, so infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), and similarly for y-axis.

2. **Infer x-axis for x and z:**
   - From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - From y B z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
   - Thus, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z) → supx(x) could be ≤ infx(z) (x W z) or between infx(z) and infx(y) (check if B applies).

3. **Case 1: supx(x) ≤ infx(z):**
   - x's x-projection is entirely to the left of z's → **x W z**.

4. **Case 2: supx(x) > infx(z):**
   - x's x-projection overlaps with z's. For B relation, x's x-projection must be within z's (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).
   - Since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(z), if infx(x) ≥ infx(z), then x's x-projection is within z's → **x B z**.

5. **Vertical Projection:**
   - From y B z and x W y, y's y-projection is within z's, and x's y-projection is within y's. Hence, x's y-projection is within z's, satisfying conditions for W and B.

6. **Exclusion of Other Relations:**
   - Other directions (N, S, E, NE, NW, SE, SW) require y-axis or x-axis conditions incompatible with the inferred projections.

**Answer:** W, B

For r1: E, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are S (South) and SE (South East). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **y S z**: y is entirely below z and within z's horizontal bounds.
2. **x E y**: x is to the east of y, within y's vertical bounds (thus below z).
3. **Horizontal Analysis**:
   - If x's horizontal bounds are entirely within z's (supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), x is **S** of z.
   - If x's horizontal bounds extend beyond z's (supx(x) > supx(z)), x is **SE** of z.
4. **Vertical Analysis**: x is always below z due to y's position.

**Answer:** SE, S
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are NE, N, and NW. 

**NE**: If x is east of z and north.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding x S y:**
   - x is entirely below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)).
   - x's x-projection is within y's x-projection (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).

2. **Understanding y NE z:**
   - y is northeast of z, meaning z's x and y maxima are ≤ y's minima (supx(z) ≤ infx(y), supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).

3. **Determining x's Position Relative to z:**
   - **x-axis:** x's x-projection starts at infx(x) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(z), so x is entirely east of z.
   - **y-axis:** x's y-projection supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y), and z's supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NE z). Thus:
     - If x's y-projection is **above z's top** (infy(x) ≥ supy(z)), x is **NE** of z.
     - If x's y-projection is **within z's y-bounds**, x is **E** of z.
     - If x's y-projection is **below z's bottom** (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), x is **SE** of z.

**Answer:** NE, E, SE
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are S and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  
1. **Given Relations:**  
   - x is S of y:  
     - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)  
     - x is horizontally within y's bounds.  
   - y is B of z:  
     - y's bounding box is within z's.  

2. **Horizontal Analysis:**  
   - x is horizontally within y, which is within z. Thus, x is horizontally within z.  

3. **Vertical Analysis:**  
   - **Case 1:** If supy(x) ≤ infy(z):  
     - x is entirely below z vertically.  
     - Relation: **x S z**.  
   - **Case 2:** If supy(x) > infy(z):  
     - x's vertical projection overlaps with z's.  
     - If x's bounding box is entirely within z's (infy(z) ≤ infy(x)), relation: **x B z**.  

4. **Exclusion of Other Relations:**  
   - x cannot be N, NE, NW, E, W, SE, or SW due to horizontal containment and vertical positioning below y (and z).  

**Answer:** B, S
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are **N** and **NW**. 

- **N** is possible if x's horizontal projection is within z's horizontal projection, making x entirely above z.
- **NW** is possible if x's horizontal projection is entirely to the west of z's horizontal projection, placing x northwest of z.

**Answer:** N, NW
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are NW and W. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Positioning from x NW y:**
   - **x-axis:** supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is left of y).
   - **y-axis:** supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y).

2. **Positioning from y W z:**
   - **x-axis:** supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is left of z).
   - **y-axis:** infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z's y-interval contains y's).

3. **Combining x-axis:**
   - From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
   - **Result:** supx(x) ≤ infx(z) → **x is left of z**.

4. **Combining y-axis:**
   - From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   - From y W z: supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - **Possible Cases:**
     - **Case 1:** supy(z) ≤ infy(x) → x is **NW** of z (entirely above z).
     - **Case 2:** supy(z) > infy(x) → x's y-interval overlaps with z's. If supy(x) ≤ supy(z), x is **W** of z (vertically overlapping).

5. **Conclusion:** Depending on z's y-bound relative to x's, x can be **NW** (if z's y-sup ≤ x's y-inf) or **W** (if z's y-sup > x's y-inf and x's y-sup ≤ z's y-sup).

**Answer:** NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: NW, N, W, B, NE, E

The possible relations between x and z are NW, N, W, B, NE, and E.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x NW y** implies:
   - x is left of y (`supx(x) ≤ infx(y)`).
   - x is above y (`supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`).

2. **y E z** implies:
   - y is right of z (`supx(z) ≤ infx(y)`).
   - y's vertical bounds are within z's (`infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`).

3. **Horizontal Analysis (x vs. z):**
   - Both x and z are left of y (`supx(x), supx(z) ≤ infx(y)`), so x and z can be arranged:
     - x left of z (`supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` → **W** or **NW**).
     - z left of x (`supx(z) ≤ infx(x)` → **E** or **NE**).
     - Overlapping x-projections (x within z's x-bounds → **N** or **B**).

4. **Vertical Analysis (x vs. z):**
   - x is above y (`supy(y) ≤ infy(x)`), and y's bounds are within z's (`infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)`).
   - x's vertical position relative to z:
     - If `infy(x) ≥ supy(z)` → x is **N** or **NW/NE**.
     - If `infy(x) < supy(z)` and x's y-bounds within z's → **W/E/B**.

5. **Valid Combinations:**
   - **NW**: x left of z and above (`supx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supy(z) ≤ infy(x)`).
   - **W**: x left of z with y-projection within z's.
   - **N**: x's x-projection within z's and above.
   - **NE**: x right of z and above.
   - **E**: x right of z with y-projection within z's.
   - **B**: x's bounding box fully within z's.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  
1. **Given Relations:**  
   - x SW y: x is southwest of y ⇒ x is left and below y.  
   - y E z: y is east of z ⇒ y is right of z, vertically within z.  

2. **Horizontal Analysis (x vs. z):**

     - **West of z** (SW, W),  
     - **Overlapping/within z** horizontally (S, B),

**SW**: If x is entirely west of z (x's eastern boundary ≤ z's western boundary) while being south, satisfying supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).  
**S**: If x's horizontal projection is within z's (z's western boundary ≤ x's western boundary and x's eastern boundary ≤ z's eastern boundary) while being vertically south (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).  

**Answer**: SW, S
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Horizontal Analysis:**
   - Given x is SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - Given y is NW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
   - Combining these: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) ⇒ supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Thus, x is **west** of z horizontally.

2. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - From x SW y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
   - From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
   - Both x and z lie entirely **below** y. Their vertical positions relative to each other are not fixed and can vary:
     - **SW of z**: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).
     - **NW of z**: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x).
     - **W of z**: If x’s vertical bounds are within z’s (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

- **SW**: x is west and south of z.  
- **NW**: x is west and north of z.

For r1: B, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are B and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Relations:**
   - **x B y:** x's bounding box contains y's bounding box.
   - **y NW z:** y is entirely to the **North West** of z, meaning:
     - y's rightmost x-coordinate ≤ z's leftmost x-coordinate (`supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`).
     - z's topmost y-coordinate ≤ y's bottommost y-coordinate (`supy(z) ≤ infy(y)`).

2. **Spatial Implications:**
   - Since **x contains y**, x's bounding box extends at least as far as y's in all directions.
   - Since **y is NW of z**, z lies **South East** of y.

3. **Possible Configurations for x and z:**
   - **Case 1: x's bounding box contains z's box.**
     - If x extends far enough **East** and **South** to fully enclose z, then **x B z**.
   - **Case 2: x's bounding box matches y's box.**
     - If x's box is exactly equal to y's (no extension), then **x inherits y's NW relation to z**, so **x NW z**.
   - **Other Cases (Overlap/Partial Containment):**
     - If x's box overlaps with z's box but does **not fully contain** it, no single-tile directional relation applies (e.g., overlapping but not directional). These are excluded as per the problem constraints.

4. **Eliminating Impossible Relations:**
   - **N, S, E, W, NE, SE, SW:** All require strict directional alignment without overlap, which is impossible here due to x's containment of y and z's position relative to y. For example:
     - **S, SW, SE:** Require x to be below z, but z is already below y, and x contains y.
     - **E, NE:** Require x to be East of z, but z is East of y, and x's East boundary depends on how much it extends beyond y (can overlap or contain, but not strictly East).

**Final Answer:**  
The possible relations are **B** (if x contains z) and **NW** (if x’s box matches y’s box).
