For r1: N, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are **NW** and **W**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **x is N of y**: x is entirely above y with x's x-interval within y's.
2. **y is W of z**: y is entirely west of z with y's y-interval within z's.
3. **x's Position Relative to z**:
   - **West (W)**: If z's y-interval contains x's y-interval, x is west of z.
   - **Northwest (NW)**: If z's y-top ≤ x's y-bottom, x is northwest of z.

**Answer:** NE, E, SE
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are S (South) and B (bounding box). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x S y**: x is entirely south of y, with x's x-projection within y's.
   - **y B z**: y's bounding box is entirely within z's.

2. **X-Axis Analysis:**
   - From **x S y**: \( \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \).
   - From **y B z**: \( \text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z) \).
   - Combining these: \( \text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z) \).  
   **Conclusion:** x's x-projection is entirely within z's x-projection.

3. **Y-Axis Analysis:**
   - From **x S y**: \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \).
   - From **y B z**: \( \text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z) \).
   - Combining these: \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \geq \text{infy}(z) \).

4. **Possible Cases for Y-Axis:**
   - **Case 1:** \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z) \).  
     **Result:** x is entirely south of z (**x S z**).
   - **Case 2:** \( \text{infy}(z) < \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \).  
     Here, x's y-projection overlaps with z's. If \( \text{infy}(x) \geq \text{infy}(z) \), x's bounding box is entirely within z's (**x B z**). If \( \text{infy}(x) < \text{infy}(z) \), no single-tile relation exists, but regions in REG ensure valid configurations where \( \text{infy}(x) \geq \text{infy}(z) \) holds for **B** to apply.

**Final Answer:**

For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are NW and N. 

**NW**: If x's x-projection is entirely to the left of z's x-projection (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), then x is **NW** of z.  
**N**: If x's x-projection is within z's x-projection (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) and x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), then x is **N** of z.  

**Answer**: NW, N

NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are NW, N, and NE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NW y**: x's eastern boundary ≤ y's western boundary, and y's northern boundary ≤ x's southern boundary.
   - **y E z**: y's western boundary ≥ z's eastern boundary, and y's vertical bounds are within z's.

2. **Spatial Implications:**
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** Both x and z are west of y. x can be west, overlapping, or east of z.
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** x is north of y, which is within z's vertical bounds. z's vertical extent can be below or overlap with x's.

3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **x West of z (NW):** If x's east ≤ z's west and z's north ≤ x's south.
   - **x North of z (N):** If z's south ≤ x's south and x's horizontal bounds overlap with z's.
   - **x Northeast of z (NE):** If z's east ≤ x's west and z's north ≤ x's south.

**NW, W, SW**
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are all single-tile cardinal directions. This is because both x and z are positioned northwest of y, allowing their relative positions to vary widely within the western and northern areas of y's bounding box. Their exact arrangement can satisfy any of the defined cardinal directions, including containment (B). 

**Answer:** N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are N and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Understanding the Relations:**
   - **x NW y:** x is northwest of y, meaning x is entirely west and north of y.
   - **y NE z:** y is northeast of z, meaning y is entirely east and north of z.

2. **Analyzing Spatial Relationships:**
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** Since x is north of y and y is north of z, x must be north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** x is west of y, and y is east of z. This means x could be either:
     - **West of z** (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), leading to **NW**.
     - **Overlapping/within z's x-projection** (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), leading to **N**.

3. **Eliminating Other Relations:**
   - **B, S, SE, E, SW, W, NE** are invalid due to the vertical/horizontal constraints derived from the given relations (x cannot be south, east, or inside z’s bounding box).

For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW and W. 

SW: If x is entirely south of z's vertical projection while being west.  
W: If x's vertical projection is within z's vertical bounds while being west.  

**Answer:** SW, W
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, S, and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x SW y:** x is southwest of y, meaning x's maximum x ≤ y's minimum x, and x's maximum y ≤ y's minimum y.
   - **y E z:** y is east of z, meaning y's minimum x ≥ z's maximum x, and y's vertical bounds are within z's.

2. **Spatial Constraints:**
   - y is east of z, so y starts at z's eastern boundary.
   - x is southwest of y, so x is left and below y.

3. **Horizontal Analysis:**
   - x's maximum x ≤ y's minimum x (from x SW y).
   - y's minimum x ≥ z's maximum x (from y E z), so x's maximum x ≤ z's maximum x.
   - Thus, x can be **west of z** (if x's maximum x ≤ z's minimum x) or **overlap horizontally** with z (if x's maximum x > z's minimum x but ≤ z's maximum x).

4. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - x's maximum y ≤ y's minimum y (from x SW y).
   - y's minimum y ≥ z's minimum y (from y E z), so x's maximum y ≥ z's minimum y.
   - Thus, x can be **entirely below z** (if x's maximum y ≤ z's minimum y) or **overlap vertically** with z (if x's maximum y > z's minimum y).

5. **Combining Possibilities:**
   - **SW:** x is entirely west and south of z.
   - **W:** x is west of z and vertically within z's bounds.
   - **S:** x is south of z and horizontally within z's bounds.
   - **B:** x's bounding box is entirely inside z's.

**Answer:** SW, W, S, B
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW and S.

Answer: SW, S
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x SW y implies:**
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

2. **y NW z implies:**
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y)

3. **Combining horizontal positions:**
   - x is west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and y is west of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)). 
   - Thus, **supx(x) ≤ infx(z)**, meaning x is west of z.

4. **Vertical analysis:**
   - x and z are both south of y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y), supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).
   - Their vertical projections relative to each other can vary:
     - **x entirely above z** → x NW z.
     - **x entirely below z** → x SW z.
     - **x vertically within z** → x W z.
