PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are all cardinal directions and B. This is because both x and z are located southwest of y, allowing various relative positions within that quadrant. Their bounding boxes can be arranged such that x can be in any direction relative to z, including overlapping (B). 

**Answer:** B, N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW
