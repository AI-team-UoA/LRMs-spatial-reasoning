PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SE and S. 

**SE**: If z's eastern boundary does not extend past the start of x's eastern boundary, making x both South and East of z.  
**S**: If z's x-interval fully contains x's x-interval, positioning x directly South of z.

**Answer**: SE, S
