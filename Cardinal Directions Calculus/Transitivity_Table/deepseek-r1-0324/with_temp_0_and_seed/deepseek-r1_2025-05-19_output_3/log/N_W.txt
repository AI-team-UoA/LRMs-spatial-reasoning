PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are **NW** and **W**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **x is N of y**: x is entirely above y with x's x-interval within y's.
2. **y is W of z**: y is entirely west of z with y's y-interval within z's.
3. **x's Position Relative to z**:
   - **West (W)**: If z's y-interval contains x's y-interval, x is west of z.
   - **Northwest (NW)**: If z's y-top â‰¤ x's y-bottom, x is northwest of z.

**Answer:** NW, W
