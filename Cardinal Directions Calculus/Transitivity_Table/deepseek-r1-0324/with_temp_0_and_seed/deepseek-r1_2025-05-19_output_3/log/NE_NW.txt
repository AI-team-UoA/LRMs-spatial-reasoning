PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

The possible relations between region x and z are N, NE, and NW. 

**N**: If x is entirely above z and within z's horizontal bounds.  
**NE**: If x is entirely above and to the right of z.  
**NW**: If x is entirely above and to the left of z.  

Thus, the answer is **N, NE, NW**.
