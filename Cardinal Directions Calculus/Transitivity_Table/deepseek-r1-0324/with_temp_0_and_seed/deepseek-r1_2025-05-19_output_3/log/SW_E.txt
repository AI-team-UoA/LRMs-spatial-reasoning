PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, S, and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x SW y:** x is southwest of y, meaning x's maximum x ≤ y's minimum x, and x's maximum y ≤ y's minimum y.
   - **y E z:** y is east of z, meaning y's minimum x ≥ z's maximum x, and y's vertical bounds are within z's.

2. **Spatial Constraints:**
   - y is east of z, so y starts at z's eastern boundary.
   - x is southwest of y, so x is left and below y.

3. **Horizontal Analysis:**
   - x's maximum x ≤ y's minimum x (from x SW y).
   - y's minimum x ≥ z's maximum x (from y E z), so x's maximum x ≤ z's maximum x.
   - Thus, x can be **west of z** (if x's maximum x ≤ z's minimum x) or **overlap horizontally** with z (if x's maximum x > z's minimum x but ≤ z's maximum x).

4. **Vertical Analysis:**
   - x's maximum y ≤ y's minimum y (from x SW y).
   - y's minimum y ≥ z's minimum y (from y E z), so x's maximum y ≥ z's minimum y.
   - Thus, x can be **entirely below z** (if x's maximum y ≤ z's minimum y) or **overlap vertically** with z (if x's maximum y > z's minimum y).

5. **Combining Possibilities:**
   - **SW:** x is entirely west and south of z.
   - **W:** x is west of z and vertically within z's bounds.
   - **S:** x is south of z and horizontally within z's bounds.
   - **B:** x's bounding box is entirely inside z's.

**Answer:** SW, W, S, B
