PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are NW and N. 

**NW**: If x's x-projection is entirely to the left of z's x-projection (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), then x is **NW** of z.  
**N**: If x's x-projection is within z's x-projection (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) and x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), then x is **N** of z.  

**Answer**: NW, N
