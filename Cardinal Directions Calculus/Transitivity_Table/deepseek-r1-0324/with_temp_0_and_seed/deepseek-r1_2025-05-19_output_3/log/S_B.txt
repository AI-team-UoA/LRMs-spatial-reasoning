PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are S (South) and B (bounding box). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x S y**: x is entirely south of y, with x's x-projection within y's.
   - **y B z**: y's bounding box is entirely within z's.

2. **X-Axis Analysis:**
   - From **x S y**: \( \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(y) \).
   - From **y B z**: \( \text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(y) \leq \text{supx}(z) \).
   - Combining these: \( \text{infx}(z) \leq \text{infx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(x) \leq \text{supx}(z) \).  
   **Conclusion:** x's x-projection is entirely within z's x-projection.

3. **Y-Axis Analysis:**
   - From **x S y**: \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \).
   - From **y B z**: \( \text{infy}(z) \leq \text{infy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(y) \leq \text{supy}(z) \).
   - Combining these: \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \geq \text{infy}(z) \).

4. **Possible Cases for Y-Axis:**
   - **Case 1:** \( \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(z) \).  
     **Result:** x is entirely south of z (**x S z**).
   - **Case 2:** \( \text{infy}(z) < \text{supy}(x) \leq \text{infy}(y) \).  
     Here, x's y-projection overlaps with z's. If \( \text{infy}(x) \geq \text{infy}(z) \), x's bounding box is entirely within z's (**x B z**). If \( \text{infy}(x) < \text{infy}(z) \), no single-tile relation exists, but regions in REG ensure valid configurations where \( \text{infy}(x) \geq \text{infy}(z) \) holds for **B** to apply.

**Final Answer:**  
B, S
