PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are all single-tile cardinal directions. This is because both x and z are positioned northwest of y, allowing their relative positions to vary widely within the western and northern areas of y's bounding box. Their exact arrangement can satisfy any of the defined cardinal directions, including containment (B). 

**Answer:** N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
