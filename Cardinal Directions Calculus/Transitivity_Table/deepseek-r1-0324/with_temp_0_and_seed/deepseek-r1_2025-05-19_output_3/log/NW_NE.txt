PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are N and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Understanding the Relations:**
   - **x NW y:** x is northwest of y, meaning x is entirely west and north of y.
   - **y NE z:** y is northeast of z, meaning y is entirely east and north of z.

2. **Analyzing Spatial Relationships:**
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** Since x is north of y and y is north of z, x must be north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** x is west of y, and y is east of z. This means x could be either:
     - **West of z** (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), leading to **NW**.
     - **Overlapping/within z's x-projection** (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), leading to **N**.

3. **Eliminating Other Relations:**
   - **B, S, SE, E, SW, W, NE** are invalid due to the vertical/horizontal constraints derived from the given relations (x cannot be south, east, or inside z’s bounding box).

**Answer:** NW, N
