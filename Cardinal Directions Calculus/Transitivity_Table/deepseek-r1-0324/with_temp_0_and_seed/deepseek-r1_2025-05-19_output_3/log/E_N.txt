PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are NE and N. 

**NE** occurs when x is entirely northeast of z, meaning x's bounding box is east and north of z's. **N** happens when x is directly north of z with overlapping x-projections. These are the only single-tile relations possible given the constraints. 

NE, N
