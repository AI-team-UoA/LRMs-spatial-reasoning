PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x SW y implies:**
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

2. **y NW z implies:**
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y)

3. **Combining horizontal positions:**
   - x is west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and y is west of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)). 
   - Thus, **supx(x) ≤ infx(z)**, meaning x is west of z.

4. **Vertical analysis:**
   - x and z are both south of y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y), supy(z) ≤ infy(y)).
   - Their vertical projections relative to each other can vary:
     - **x entirely above z** → x NW z.
     - **x entirely below z** → x SW z.
     - **x vertically within z** → x W z.

**Answer:** SW, W, NW
