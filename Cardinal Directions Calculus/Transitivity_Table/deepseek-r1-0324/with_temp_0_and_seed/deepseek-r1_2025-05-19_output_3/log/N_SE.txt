PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. 

**NE**: If x is both to the right (East) and above (North) z.  
**E**: If x is to the right (East) and vertically within z's bounds.  
**SE**: If x is to the right (East) and below (South) z.  

These arise because x must be east of z (due to y's position) and can vary vertically relative to z.  

**Answer:** NE, E, SE
