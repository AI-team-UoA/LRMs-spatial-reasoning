PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are NW, N, and NE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x NW y**: x's eastern boundary ≤ y's western boundary, and y's northern boundary ≤ x's southern boundary.
   - **y E z**: y's western boundary ≥ z's eastern boundary, and y's vertical bounds are within z's.

2. **Spatial Implications:**
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** Both x and z are west of y. x can be west, overlapping, or east of z.
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** x is north of y, which is within z's vertical bounds. z's vertical extent can be below or overlap with x's.

3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **x West of z (NW):** If x's east ≤ z's west and z's north ≤ x's south.
   - **x North of z (N):** If z's south ≤ x's south and x's horizontal bounds overlap with z's.
   - **x Northeast of z (NE):** If z's east ≤ x's west and z's north ≤ x's south.

**Answer:** N, NE, NW
