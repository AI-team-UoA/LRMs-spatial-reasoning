PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are N and B. 

**N**: If the bounding box of z does not extend above the infimum y-coordinate of x, making x entirely north of z.  
**B**: If the bounding box of z extends sufficiently to contain the entire bounding box of x, meaning x is within z's bounding box.

Answer: N, B
