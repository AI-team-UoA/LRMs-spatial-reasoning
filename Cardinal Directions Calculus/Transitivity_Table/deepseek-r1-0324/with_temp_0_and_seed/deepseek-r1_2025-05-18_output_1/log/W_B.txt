PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are W and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **x W y**: x is entirely west of y, with x's right bound ≤ y's left bound, and vertically within y's bounds.
2. **y B z**: y's bounding box is within z's, so z's left bound ≤ y's left bound and z's right bound ≥ y's right bound. Vertically, z contains y.
3. **Horizontal Analysis**:
   - If x's right bound ≤ z's left bound, x is **W** of z.
   - If x's right bound > z's left bound but ≤ y's left bound (which is ≥ z's left bound), x's bounding box may still be entirely within z's (if x's left bound ≥ z's left bound), making x **B** of z.
4. **Vertical Analysis**: x is vertically within y's bounds, which are within z's, so vertically x is always within z's bounds.
5. **Conclusion**: x can be **W** (if entirely left of z) or **B** (if within z's bounds horizontally and vertically).

**Answer:** B, W
