PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are NE, N, E, and B. 

**NE**: If z's bounding box does not extend beyond y's in the east or north, x remains northeast of z.  
**N**: If z extends north beyond y but not east, x is north of z.  
**E**: If z extends east beyond y but not north, x is east of z.  
**B**: If z's bounding box sufficiently extends to encompass x, x is within z's bounds.  

Answer: NE, N, E, B.  

\boxed{B}, \boxed{N}, \boxed{E}, \boxed{NE}
