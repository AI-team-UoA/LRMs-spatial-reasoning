PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, S, and B.

**SW**: If z's bounding box starts just at x's right and top edges.  
**W**: If z's left edge aligns with x's right edge and x's vertical span fits within z's.  
**S**: If z's bottom edge aligns with x's top edge and x's horizontal span fits within z's.  
**B**: If z's bounding box fully encloses x's.  

Answer: SW, W, S, B
