PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are NW, N, W, and B. 

**NW**: If z's bounding box does not extend left or up beyond y's, x remains northwest of z.  
**N**: If z's bounding box extends upward enough such that x's x-projection is within z's, x is north of z.  
**W**: If z's bounding box extends left past y, x can be west of z with y-projection within z's.  
**B**: If z's bounding box is sufficiently large to encompass both y and x, x's bounding box is within z's.  

Answer: NW, N, W, B
