PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are N, NE, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Understanding the Relations:**
   - **x NE y** means x is entirely to the right and above y.
   - **y NW z** means y is entirely to the left and above z.

2. **Projection Analysis:**
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** x is above y, and y is above z ⇒ x is above z.
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** x is right of y, and z is right of y. The horizontal alignment between x and z can vary:
     - **x entirely left of z** ⇒ **NW**.
     - **x entirely right of z** ⇒ **NE**.
     - **x horizontally within z** ⇒ **N**.

3. **Eliminating Other Directions:**
   - Directions involving south (S, SE, SW) are impossible since x is above z.
   - Directions like E, W, B require invalid vertical or containment relations.

**Answer:** N, NE, NW
