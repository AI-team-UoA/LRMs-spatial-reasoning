PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW and W. 

SW occurs when x's y-interval is entirely below z's, satisfying supy(x) ≤ infy(z). W occurs when x's y-interval is within z's, requiring infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given the constraints from x S y and y W z, both scenarios are feasible.

**Answer:** SW, W
