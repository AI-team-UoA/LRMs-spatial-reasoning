PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are N and NE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - x is NE of y: 
     - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
     - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)
   - y is N of z: 
     - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)
     - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

2. **Vertical Relation (x to z):**
   - From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - From x NE y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - Combining: supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ⇒ x is north of z (vertical condition for N or NE).

3. **Horizontal Relation (x to z):**
   - From x NE y: infx(x) ≥ supx(y)
   - From y N z: supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (since y is within z's x-bounds)
   - Thus, infx(x) ≥ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so infx(x) could be:
     - **Case 1:** infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ⇒ x's horizontal projection is within z's ⇒ **N** relation.
     - **Case 2:** infx(x) > supx(z) ⇒ x is entirely east of z ⇒ **NE** relation.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - x must be north of z (vertical).
   - Horizontally, x can either be within z (N) or entirely east (NE). 

**Answer:** N, NE
