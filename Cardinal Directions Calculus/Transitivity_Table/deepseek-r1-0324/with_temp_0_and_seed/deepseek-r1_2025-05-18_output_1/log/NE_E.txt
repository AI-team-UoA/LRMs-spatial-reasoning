PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are NE and E. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Relations:**
   - **x NE y:** x is strictly northeast of y, meaning x's entire bounding box is east and north of y's.
   - **y E z:** y is strictly east of z, with y's vertical bounds within z's.

2. **Transitivity Analysis:**
   - From **y E z**, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z).
   - From **x NE y**, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y).

3. **Combining x and z's Horizontal (x-axis) Relationship:**
   - Combining supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x NE y), we get **supx(z) ≤ infx(x)**. This means **x is east of z**.

4. **Vertical (y-axis) Relationship Possibilities:**
   - From y E z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - From x NE y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x).
   - Combining these: **infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x)**.

   - **Case 1:** If **supy(z) ≤ infy(x)**, x is entirely north of z. Combined with x being east of z, this gives **x NE z**.
   - **Case 2:** If **supy(z) > infy(x)** but **supy(x) ≤ supy(z)**, x's vertical bounds are within z's. Since x is east of z, this gives **x E z**.

5. **Eliminating Other Directions:**
   - **N, S, SW, W, NW, SE, B** are impossible due to constraints on x-axis (x is strictly east of z) and vertical bounds (either x is north or overlaps vertically but not enough to satisfy other single-tile relations).

**Final Answer:**  
NE, E
