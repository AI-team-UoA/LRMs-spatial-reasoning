PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between x and z are NW, N, and NE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x W y**: x is west of y, meaning x's east boundary (supx) ≤ y's west boundary (infx), and x is within y's vertical bounds.
   - **y NE z**: y is northeast of z, meaning z's east boundary (supx) ≤ y's west boundary (infx) and z's north boundary (supy) ≤ y's south boundary (infy).

2. **Vertical Relationship:**
   - From **y NE z**, z's top (supy(z)) ≤ y's bottom (infy(y)).
   - From **x W y**, y's bottom (infy(y)) ≤ x's bottom (infy(x)).
   - Combining these: **z's top ≤ x's bottom**, so x is entirely above z vertically.

3. **Horizontal Possibilities:**
   - Both x and z are west of y, but their horizontal positions relative to each other are flexible:
     - **x west of z** (x's east ≤ z's west) → **NW**.
     - **x overlaps z horizontally with x within z's horizontal bounds** → **N**.
     - **x east of z** (z's east ≤ x's west) → **NE**.

4. **Eliminating Other Directions:**
   - **S, SE, SW, E, W, B** are impossible because x is always above z and cannot be south, overlap (B), or align east/west without violating vertical constraints.

**Answer:** NW, N, NE
