PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between x and z are NW and W. 

**NW**: If z does not extend vertically above y's upper bound, x being north of y and west of z places x northwest of z.  
**W**: If z's vertical projection includes x's, x being west of z with y-projection within z's makes x west of z.  

Answer: NW, W
