PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are NW, W, SW, and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x is NW of y**:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

2. **y is S of z**:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-interval within z's)

3. **Analyzing x's Position Relative to z**:
   - **x-axis**: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) → x can be west of or overlap with z.
   - **y-axis**: infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) → x's y-position relative to z varies.

4. **Possible Relations**:
   - **B (Bounding Box)**: If x's entire box is within z's.
   - **W (West)**: x's x-interval west of z, y-interval within z's.
   - **NW (Northwest)**: x west and north of z.
   - **SW (Southwest)**: x west and south of z.

**Answer:** B, W, NW, SW
