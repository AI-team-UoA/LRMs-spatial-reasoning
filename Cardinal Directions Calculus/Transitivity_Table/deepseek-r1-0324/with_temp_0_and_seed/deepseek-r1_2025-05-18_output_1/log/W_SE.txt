PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and S. 

SW occurs when x's entire x-projection is west of z's, making x southwest of z. S happens when x's x-projection is within z's, positioning x directly south. 

**Answer:** SW, S
