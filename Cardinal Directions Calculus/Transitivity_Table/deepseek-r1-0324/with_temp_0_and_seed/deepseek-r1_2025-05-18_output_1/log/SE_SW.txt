PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and S. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Given Relations:**
   - **x SE y:** x is southeast of y. This means:
     - `infx(x) ≥ supx(y)` (x starts east of y's end).
     - `supy(x) ≤ infy(y)` (x is entirely south of y).
   - **y SW z:** y is southwest of z. This means:
     - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y ends west of z's start).
     - `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y is entirely south of z).

2. **Combining Constraints:**
   - From **x SE y**, `infx(x) ≥ supx(y)`.
   - From **y SW z**, `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`.
   - Combining these: `infx(x) ≥ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`, so `infx(x)` can range from `supx(y)` up to `infx(z)` or beyond.
   - Vertically, `supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)`, so x is always **south of z**.

3. **Horizontal Positioning:**
   - **Case 1:** If `infx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`:
     - x is entirely to the **west** of z’s x-interval. Combined with being south, x is **SW of z**.
   - **Case 2:** If `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(z)`:
     - x’s x-interval is within z’s x-interval. Combined with being south, x is **S of z**.

4. **Overlap or Other Relations:**
   - Overlapping x-projections (e.g., x starts west of z but ends inside z’s x-interval) do not fit any single-tile relation (like B, E, etc.), so these are excluded by the problem’s constraints. Only **SW** and **S** satisfy the bounding box definitions. 

**Answer:** SW, S
