PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Horizontal Analysis (x-axis):**
   - From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
   - Combining: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is strictly west of z.

2. **Vertical Analysis (y-axis):**
   - From x SW y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
   - From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
   - Both x and z are below y, but their vertical positions relative to each other are unconstrained beyond this.

3. **Possible Vertical Configurations:**
   - **x below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)):** x is SW of z.
   - **x above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)):** x is NW of z.
   - **x vertically within z (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)):** x is W of z.

**Answer:** SW, W, NW
