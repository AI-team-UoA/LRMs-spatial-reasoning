PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are SW, S, and SE. 

**SW**: If x is to the west and south of z.  
**S**: If x is directly south of z with overlapping x-projections.  
**SE**: If x is to the east and south of z.  

Thus, the answer is:  
SW, S, SE  

Answer: \boxed{SW}, \boxed{S}, \boxed{SE}
