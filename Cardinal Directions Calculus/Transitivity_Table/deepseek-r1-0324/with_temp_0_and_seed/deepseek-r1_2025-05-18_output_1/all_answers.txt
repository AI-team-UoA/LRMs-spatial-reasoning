**Answer:** SW, S
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between x and z are NW, N, and NE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - **x W y**: x is west of y, meaning x's east boundary (supx) ≤ y's west boundary (infx), and x is within y's vertical bounds.
   - **y NE z**: y is northeast of z, meaning z's east boundary (supx) ≤ y's west boundary (infx) and z's north boundary (supy) ≤ y's south boundary (infy).

2. **Vertical Relationship:**
   - From **y NE z**, z's top (supy(z)) ≤ y's bottom (infy(y)).
   - From **x W y**, y's bottom (infy(y)) ≤ x's bottom (infy(x)).
   - Combining these: **z's top ≤ x's bottom**, so x is entirely above z vertically.

3. **Horizontal Possibilities:**
   - Both x and z are west of y, but their horizontal positions relative to each other are flexible:
     - **x west of z** (x's east ≤ z's west) → **NW**.
     - **x overlaps z horizontally with x within z's horizontal bounds** → **N**.
     - **x east of z** (z's east ≤ x's west) → **NE**.

4. **Eliminating Other Directions:**
   - **S, SE, SW, E, W, B** are impossible because x is always above z and cannot be south, overlap (B), or align east/west without violating vertical constraints.

**Answer:** NW, N, NE
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are W and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **x W y**: x is entirely west of y, with x's right bound ≤ y's left bound, and vertically within y's bounds.
2. **y B z**: y's bounding box is within z's, so z's left bound ≤ y's left bound and z's right bound ≥ y's right bound. Vertically, z contains y.
3. **Horizontal Analysis**:
   - If x's right bound ≤ z's left bound, x is **W** of z.
   - If x's right bound > z's left bound but ≤ y's left bound (which is ≥ z's left bound), x's bounding box may still be entirely within z's (if x's left bound ≥ z's left bound), making x **B** of z.
4. **Vertical Analysis**: x is vertically within y's bounds, which are within z's, so vertically x is always within z's bounds.
5. **Conclusion**: x can be **W** (if entirely left of z) or **B** (if within z's bounds horizontally and vertically).

For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are NW, W, SW, and B. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **x is NW of y**:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

2. **y is S of z**:

   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-interval within z's)

3. **Analyzing x's Position Relative to z**:
   - **x-axis**: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) → x can be west of or overlap with z.
   - **y-axis**: infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) → x's y-position relative to z varies.

4. **Possible Relations**:
   - **B (Bounding Box)**: If x's entire box is within z's.
   - **W (West)**: x's x-interval west of z, y-interval within z's.

For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SW, W, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Horizontal Analysis (x-axis):**
   - From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   - From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
   - Combining: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is strictly west of z.

2. **Vertical Analysis (y-axis):**
   - From x SW y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
   - From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
   - Both x and z are below y, but their vertical positions relative to each other are unconstrained beyond this.

For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: The possible relation between region x and z is B. 

**Answer:** B
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and S. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Given Relations:**
   - **x SE y:** x is southeast of y. This means:
     - `infx(x) ≥ supx(y)` (x starts east of y's end).
     - `supy(x) ≤ infy(y)` (x is entirely south of y).
   - **y SW z:** y is southwest of z. This means:
     - `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)` (y ends west of z's start).
     - `supy(y) ≤ infy(z)` (y is entirely south of z).

2. **Combining Constraints:**
   - From **x SE y**, `infx(x) ≥ supx(y)`.
   - From **y SW z**, `supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`.
   - Combining these: `infx(x) ≥ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)`, so `infx(x)` can range from `supx(y)` up to `infx(z)` or beyond.
   - Vertically, `supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)`, so x is always **south of z**.

3. **Horizontal Positioning:**
   - **Case 1:** If `infx(x) ≤ infx(z)` and `supx(x) ≤ infx(z)`:
     - x is entirely to the **west** of z’s x-interval. Combined with being south, x is **SW of z**.
   - **Case 2:** If `infx(z) ≤ infx(x)` and `supx(x) ≤ supx(z)`:
     - x’s x-interval is within z’s x-interval. Combined with being south, x is **S of z**.

4. **Overlap or Other Relations:**
   - Overlapping x-projections (e.g., x starts west of z but ends inside z’s x-interval) do not fit any single-tile relation (like B, E, etc.), so these are excluded by the problem’s constraints. Only **SW** and **S** satisfy the bounding box definitions. 

**Answer:** SW, S
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SE, E, and NE.

**NE**: If x is above z.  

Answer: SE, E, NE
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are SE, S, E, and B. 

**SE**: If x is entirely Southeast of z's bounding box.  
**S**: If x is within z's horizontal bounds but entirely South.  
**E**: If x is entirely East of z's vertical bounds but within z's vertical range.  
**B**: If x is entirely within z's bounding box.  

Answer: SE, S, E, B
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are N and NE. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Relations:**
   - x is NE of y: 
     - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
     - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)
   - y is N of z: 
     - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)
     - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

2. **Vertical Relation (x to z):**
   - From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - From x NE y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - Combining: supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ⇒ x is north of z (vertical condition for N or NE).

3. **Horizontal Relation (x to z):**
   - From x NE y: infx(x) ≥ supx(y)
   - From y N z: supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (since y is within z's x-bounds)
   - Thus, infx(x) ≥ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so infx(x) could be:
     - **Case 1:** infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ⇒ x's horizontal projection is within z's ⇒ **N** relation.
     - **Case 2:** infx(x) > supx(z) ⇒ x is entirely east of z ⇒ **NE** relation.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - x must be north of z (vertical).
   - Horizontally, x can either be within z (N) or entirely east (NE). 

**Answer:** N, NE
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are B, N, E, NE.

**Answer:** B, N, E, NE
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are NE and E. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Relations:**
   - **x NE y:** x is strictly northeast of y, meaning x's entire bounding box is east and north of y's.
   - **y E z:** y is strictly east of z, with y's vertical bounds within z's.

2. **Transitivity Analysis:**
   - From **y E z**, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z).
   - From **x NE y**, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y).

3. **Combining x and z's Horizontal (x-axis) Relationship:**
   - Combining supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x NE y), we get **supx(z) ≤ infx(x)**. This means **x is east of z**.

4. **Vertical (y-axis) Relationship Possibilities:**
   - From y E z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - From x NE y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x).
   - Combining these: **infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x)**.

   - **Case 1:** If **supy(z) ≤ infy(x)**, x is entirely north of z. Combined with x being east of z, this gives **x NE z**.
   - **Case 2:** If **supy(z) > infy(x)** but **supy(x) ≤ supy(z)**, x's vertical bounds are within z's. Since x is east of z, this gives **x E z**.

5. **Eliminating Other Directions:**
   - **N, S, SW, W, NW, SE, B** are impossible due to constraints on x-axis (x is strictly east of z) and vertical bounds (either x is north or overlaps vertically but not enough to satisfy other single-tile relations).

**Final Answer:**

**Answer:** N, NE, E, SE, S, B
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and z are N, NE, and NW. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Understanding the Relations:**
   - **x NE y** means x is entirely to the right and above y.
   - **y NW z** means y is entirely to the left and above z.

2. **Projection Analysis:**
   - **Vertical (y-axis):** x is above y, and y is above z ⇒ x is above z.
   - **Horizontal (x-axis):** x is right of y, and z is right of y. The horizontal alignment between x and z can vary:
     - **x entirely left of z** ⇒ **NW**.
     - **x entirely right of z** ⇒ **NE**.
     - **x horizontally within z** ⇒ **N**.

3. **Eliminating Other Directions:**
   - Directions involving south (S, SE, SW) are impossible since x is above z.
   - Directions like E, W, B require invalid vertical or containment relations.
