{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The possible relations between region x and region z are NW, N, W, and B. \n\n**NW**: If z's bounding box does not extend left or up beyond y's, x remains northwest of z.  \n**N**: If z's bounding box extends upward enough such that x's x-projection is within z's, x is north of z.  \n**W**: If z's bounding box extends left past y, x can be west of z with y-projection within z's.  \n**B**: If z's bounding box is sufficiently large to encompass both y and x, x's bounding box is within z's.  \n\nAnswer: NW, N, W, B", "elapsed-time": 405.1139693260193, "reasoning-tokens": 9052, "completion-tokens": 9194}
