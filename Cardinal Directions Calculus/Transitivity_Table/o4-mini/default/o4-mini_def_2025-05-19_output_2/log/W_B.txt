PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only possible single‐tile relations are  
W (if z’s left edge still lies to the right of x)  
or  
B (if z happens to extend far enough left to fully contain x).
