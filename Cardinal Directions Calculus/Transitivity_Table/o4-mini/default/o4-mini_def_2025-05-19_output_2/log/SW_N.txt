PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible relations are exactly the six “west‐ward” ones.  In fact one can show that under  
    x SW y and y N z  
the only cardinal‐direction relations that x can have to z are  
    SW, W, NW, N, S  or  B.
