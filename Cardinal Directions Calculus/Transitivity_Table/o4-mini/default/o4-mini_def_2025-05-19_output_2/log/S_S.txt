PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only way to satisfy  
  x S y  and  y S z  
is that x also lies entirely below z while staying horizontally inside z’s span.  Hence the only single‐tile cardinal relation possible between x and z is

  x S z.
