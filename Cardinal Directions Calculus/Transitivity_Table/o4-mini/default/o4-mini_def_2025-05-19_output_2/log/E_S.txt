PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only single‐tile directions that can ever result are South (S) or South–East (SE).  In particular, from  
   x E y   and   y S z  
you can get either  
   x S z  
or  
   x SE z  
(and no other of the nine basic relations).
