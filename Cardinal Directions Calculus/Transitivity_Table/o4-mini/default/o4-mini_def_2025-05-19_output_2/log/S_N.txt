PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only constraint is that both x and z lie below y but within y’s x‐span – so x and z can stand in any of the nine cardinal‐box relations.  Hence

Possible relations between x and z:  
B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
