PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only non‐empty intersections of the constraints are

– x W z always, and  
– in the special (boundary‐touching) case supy(z)=supy(y)=infy(x) one also has x NW z.

No other of the nine can occur.
