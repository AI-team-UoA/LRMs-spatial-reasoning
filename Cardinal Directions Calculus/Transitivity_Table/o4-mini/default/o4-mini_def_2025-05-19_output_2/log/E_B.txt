PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

The only two that can occur are  
  x B z  (if x’s entire box lies inside z’s)  
or  
  x E z  (if z’s right‐hand boundary lies at or to the left of x’s left‐hand boundary)
