PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only four cardinal‐direction relations that x can have to z consistent with  
    
  (1) x NE y  ⇒  supₓ(y)≤infₓ(x)  and  supᵧ(y)≤infᵧ(x)  
  (2) y B z  ⇒  infₓ(z)≤infₓ(y)≤supₓ(y)≤supₓ(z),  infᵧ(z)≤infᵧ(y)≤supᵧ(y)≤supᵧ(z)  
  
are

  B    (x’s bbox lies inside z’s)  
  N    (x lies entirely north of z but shares an x‐interval)  
  E    (x lies entirely east of z but shares a y‐interval)  
  NE   (x lies to the north‐east of z)  

No other of the nine basic directions is possible.
