PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only possible single‐tile direction relating x to z is “B.” In fact, B is transitive, and none of the other eight (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) can ever occur. So x B z.
