PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

All nine are possible.  Depending on how far “to the NE of y” and “to the SW of z” you push x and z, you can get any one of  
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW or B between x and z.
