For r1: N, r2: N, answer: The only possible cardinal‐direction relation is N.
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: The only non‐empty intersections of the constraints are

– x W z always, and  
– in the special (boundary‐touching) case supy(z)=supy(y)=infy(x) one also has x NW z.

No other of the nine can occur.

or  
  x B z.

SW, S or SE.
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: NW, N, NE
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: The only possible single‐tile relations are

For r1: E, r2: W, answer: The only non‐degenerate possibilities are

x E z, x W z or x B z.
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: The only single‐tile directions that can ever result are South (S) or South–East (SE).  In particular, from  
   x E y   and   y S z  
you can get either  
   x S z  
or  
   x SE z  
(and no other of the nine basic relations).

or  
  x E z  (if z’s right‐hand boundary lies at or to the left of x’s left‐hand boundary)
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: The only constraint is that both x and z lie below y but within y’s x‐span – so x and z can stand in any of the nine cardinal‐box relations.  Hence

   x S y  and  y E z  
are  
   x E z  or  x SE z.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: The only way to satisfy  
  x S y  and  y S z

  x S z.
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: SW, W or NW
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: The only way the inequalities can stack up is that x lies both to the east of z (infx(x)≥supx(z)) and below z (supy(x)≤infy(z)), i.e. x SE z.

For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: NW, W, SW
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: The composition NW ◦ SE is totally unconstrained – x and z can stand in any of the nine base‐relations.  In other words
   { N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B }
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: The only single‐tile cardinal directions consistent with

For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Possible relations are exactly the six “west‐ward” ones.  In fact one can show that under

For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Possible relations are exactly B, N, NE, E or SE.  In no case can x be S, SW, W or NW of z.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: The only single‐tile direction that can ever hold is “north.”  In other words  
x N z.
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: All nine are possible.  Depending on how far “to the NE of y” and “to the SW of z” you push x and z, you can get any one of  
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW or B between x and z.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: The only possible RDC‐relations from x to z are  
NE, E or SE.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: The only four cardinal‐direction relations that x can have to z consistent with  
    
  (1) x NE y  ⇒  supₓ(y)≤infₓ(x)  and  supᵧ(y)≤infᵧ(x)  
  (2) y B z  ⇒  infₓ(z)≤infₓ(y)≤supₓ(y)≤supₓ(z),  infᵧ(z)≤infᵧ(y)≤supᵧ(y)≤supᵧ(z)

  B    (x’s bbox lies inside z’s)  
  N    (x lies entirely north of z but shares an x‐interval)  
  E    (x lies entirely east of z but shares a y‐interval)  
  NE   (x lies to the north‐east of z)  

No other of the nine basic directions is possible.

For r1: B, r2: B, answer: The only possible single‐tile direction relating x to z is “B.” In fact, B is transitive, and none of the other eight (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) can ever occur. So x B z.
