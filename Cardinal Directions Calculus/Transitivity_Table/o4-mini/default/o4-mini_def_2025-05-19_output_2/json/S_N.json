{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The only constraint is that both x and z lie below y but within y\u2019s x\u2010span \u2013 so x and z can stand in any of the nine cardinal\u2010box relations.  Hence\r\n\r\nPossible relations between x and z:  \r\nB, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW", "elapsed-time": 39.32121777534485, "reasoning-tokens": 4224, "completion-tokens": 4307}
