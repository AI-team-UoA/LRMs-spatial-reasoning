For r1: N, r2: N, answer: The only single‐tile relation that can hold is N.  In fact, from  
   x N y  ⇒  supᵧ(z)≤infᵧ(y)≤infᵧ(x)  
and  
   y N z  ⇒  infₓ(z)≤infₓ(y)≤infₓ(x),  supₓ(x)≤supₓ(y)≤supₓ(z),  
one immediately checks that x N z is satisfied and none of the other eight basic directions (NE, E, SE, …, B) can.
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: W or NW
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Possible relations are just E or NE.
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: The only single‐tile directions that can ever hold between x and z under    
    
    x N y    and    y S z    
are    
      
    • x N z  
    • x B z  
    • x S z    
  
No other of the nine (E/W/NE/NW/SE/SW) can arise.
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: The only two directions you can get are  
   x W z   or   x NW z
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: The only way to place x “north‐of” y and y “south‐east‐of” z is to have x entirely to the right of z, with its vertical span either below, overlapping or above z.  Hence x – z can only be one of

SE, E or NE.
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: The only single‐tile CDCs consistent with  
    x N y and y B z  
are  
    x N z  
(or, if x lies entirely inside z’s box,  
    x B z)
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: NW
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: W, E or B
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Possible relations are S or SW.
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: The only way to keep supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z) while varying y‐overlap is to land in one of  
SW, W or NW.  
So x R z can be SW, W or NW.
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: The only possible relations are  
S, SW or SE.
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: NW, N, NE
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: W, B
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: The only two single‐tile cardinal‐directions consistent with  
 x E y and y N z  
are  
 x N z  
and  
 x NE z.
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: The only possible single‐tile CD‐relations x R z consistent with x E y and y W z are

  B  (x inside z),  
  E  (x strictly east of z), or  
  W  (x strictly west of z).
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: {S, SE}
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: The only possible 1‐tile directions from x to z are

  N, NE or NW.
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: The only ways to satisfy  
  x E y (so x lies strictly to y’s east, vertically overlapping y)  
and  
  y SW z (so y lies to z’s south‐west)  
are that x ends up somewhere directly south of z (or slightly to z’s south–west or south–east).  
Hence the only possible single‐tile relations between x and z are  
   SW, S, SE
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: Possible relations are E or B.
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: The composition S∘N turns out to be the universal relation on the 3×3‐grid, i.e. all nine atoms.  Hence x R z may be any of  
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW or B.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: The only two that can ever hold are  
  x W z  
or  
  x SW z
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: The only single‐tile cardinal relations that can arise are  
  x E z  or  x SE z.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: The only relation entailed is again S.  In fact from  
  x S y and y S z  
you get  
  supᵧ(x)≤infᵧ(y)≤infᵧ(z)  
and  
  infₓ(z)≤infₓ(y)≤infₓ(x)≤supₓ(x)≤supₓ(y)≤supₓ(z),  
so x’s box lies completely south (and horizontally inside) z’s box.  Hence x S z.
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: The only possible basic‐tile relations are  
x SW z,  x W z  or  x NW z.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: The only possible cardinal‐direction relation is  
  x SE z.
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: NE, E or SE
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: The only atomic directions you can get are “S” or “B.”  In fact  
  x S y and y B z ⇒ x is either still entirely south of z (x S z) or (if its top just pokes into z) wholly inside z (x B z).
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: The only possibilities are  
NW  
or  
N  
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: W or NW
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: The only single‐tile relations that can arise (S, SW, SE all fail) are  
NW, W, N, NE, E and B.
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: {NW, W, SW, N, B, S}
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: The only way to chain “x NW y” and “y SW z” is to force x entirely to the left of z, but with no fixed ordering in y‐direction.  Hence x R z can be exactly one of  
SW, W or NW.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Any of the nine basic relations.  In other words, knowing x NW y and y SE z does not constrain x vs. z to fewer than all of  
{B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW}.
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: NW, N, NE
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: NW, N, W or B
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: The only ones you can still get are  
   B, N, NW, W, SW, or S  
(i.e. all but E, NE and SE are realizable)
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: The only possible relations are  
SW  
W
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Possible single‐tile relations from x to z are exactly these six:  
SW, W, B, E, SE, S
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: The only single‐tile directions you can get are SW or S.  In the “mixed‐case” (when x’s box straddles z’s left‐edge) you recover the 2–tile relation SW :S.  No other of the 9 basic directions (nor B) can occur.
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: Possible relations are SW, W or NW.
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: SW, S or SE
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Any of the nine single‐tile relations can occur.  In other words, knowing only that  
  x SW y  and  y NE z  
imposes no further restriction on the relative positions of x and z, so their relation can be any one of  
  {SW, W, NW, S, B, N, SE, E, NE}.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Possible relations are exactly the “south‐westish” ones:  
SW, S, W or B.
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: N, NE, E, SE, S, B
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: The only CARDs you can get are

   B, S, SW, W, SE or E

No other single‐tile direction between x and z is possible.
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: The only compositions consistent with  
 x SE y and y E z  
are  
 x E z  
or  
 x SE z.
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: Possible relations from x to z are exactly S or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: The composition SE ∘ NW is unconstrained – depending on how you choose x, y and z you can make x lie in any one of the nine single‐tile relations to z.  In other words  
x R z can be any of  
   B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W or NW.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: The only possible single‐tile relations between x and z are SW, S or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: The only directions compatible with  
supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)  (→ x is east of z)  
and the unconstrained vertical order (x may lie above, across or below z)  
are  
  NE, E or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: The only non‐contradictory single‐tile relations xRz are  
B, S, E and SE.
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: {x N z, x NE z}
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Possible relations are exactly  
NW, N, NE, W, B, E
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Possible single‐tile relations from x to z are exactly  
E (East)  or  NE (North‐East). No other of the nine can arise.
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: The only single‐tile relations that can ever occur are those “to the east” or “around” it:  

Possible x–z relations ⊆ {N, NE, E, SE, S, B}  

No W‐side relation (W, SW, NW) can arise.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: Possible atoms are only the “north‐type” ones.  In fact one shows from  
  x NE y  and  y NW z  
that x lies strictly above z, but its horizontal order w.r.t. z is undetermined.  Hence x z can be any of  
  NW, N or NE.
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: The only thing you can say for sure is that ​any​ of the nine basic relations is still logically possible.  In other words x ? z may be one of  
B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W or NW.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: The only possible relations are  
x NE z,  x E z  or  x SE z
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: The only possible x–z relations are

 B, N, E or NE.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: The only possible cardinal‐direction you can get is  
 x N z.
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: The only way x can relate to z is as SW (z), since
   supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)
and
   supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z)
together entail x SW z.
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: SW
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: The only relation that is guaranteed to hold is the bounding‐box relation B. In symbols: from x B y and y B z it follows x B z—and no other single‐tile direction can be forced.
