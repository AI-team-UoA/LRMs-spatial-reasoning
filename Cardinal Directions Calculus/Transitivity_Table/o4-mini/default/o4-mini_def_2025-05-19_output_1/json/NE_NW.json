{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "Possible atoms are only the \u201cnorth\u2010type\u201d ones.  In fact one shows from  \n  x NE y  and  y NW z  \nthat x lies strictly above z, but its horizontal order w.r.t. z is undetermined.  Hence x z can be any of  \n  NW, N or NE.", "elapsed-time": 35.863080739974976, "reasoning-tokens": 2816, "completion-tokens": 2907}
