PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only way to place x “north‐of” y and y “south‐east‐of” z is to have x entirely to the right of z, with its vertical span either below, overlapping or above z.  Hence x – z can only be one of

SE, E or NE.
