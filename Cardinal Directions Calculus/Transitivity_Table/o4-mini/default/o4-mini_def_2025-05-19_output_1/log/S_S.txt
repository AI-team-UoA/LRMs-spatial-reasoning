PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only relation entailed is again S.  In fact from  
  x S y and y S z  
you get  
  supᵧ(x)≤infᵧ(y)≤infᵧ(z)  
and  
  infₓ(z)≤infₓ(y)≤infₓ(x)≤supₓ(x)≤supₓ(y)≤supₓ(z),  
so x’s box lies completely south (and horizontally inside) z’s box.  Hence x S z.
