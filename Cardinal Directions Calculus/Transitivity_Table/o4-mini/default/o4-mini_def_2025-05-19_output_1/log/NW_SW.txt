PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only way to chain “x NW y” and “y SW z” is to force x entirely to the left of z, but with no fixed ordering in y‐direction.  Hence x R z can be exactly one of  
SW, W or NW.
