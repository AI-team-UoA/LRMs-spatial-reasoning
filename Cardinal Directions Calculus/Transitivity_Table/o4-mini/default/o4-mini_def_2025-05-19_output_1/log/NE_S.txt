PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only single‐tile relations that can ever occur are those “to the east” or “around” it:  

Possible x–z relations ⊆ {N, NE, E, SE, S, B}  

No W‐side relation (W, SW, NW) can arise.
