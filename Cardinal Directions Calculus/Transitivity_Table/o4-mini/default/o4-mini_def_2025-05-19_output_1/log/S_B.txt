PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only atomic directions you can get are “S” or “B.”  In fact  
  x S y and y B z ⇒ x is either still entirely south of z (x S z) or (if its top just pokes into z) wholly inside z (x B z).
