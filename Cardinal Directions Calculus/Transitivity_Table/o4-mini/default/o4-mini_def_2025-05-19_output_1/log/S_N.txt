PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

The composition S∘N turns out to be the universal relation on the 3×3‐grid, i.e. all nine atoms.  Hence x R z may be any of  
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW or B.
