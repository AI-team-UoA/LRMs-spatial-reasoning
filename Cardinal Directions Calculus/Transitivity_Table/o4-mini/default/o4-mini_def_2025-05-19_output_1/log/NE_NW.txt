PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Possible atoms are only the “north‐type” ones.  In fact one shows from  
  x NE y  and  y NW z  
that x lies strictly above z, but its horizontal order w.r.t. z is undetermined.  Hence x z can be any of  
  NW, N or NE.
