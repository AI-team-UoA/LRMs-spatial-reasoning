PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only directions compatible with  
supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x)  (→ x is east of z)  
and the unconstrained vertical order (x may lie above, across or below z)  
are  
  NE, E or SE.
