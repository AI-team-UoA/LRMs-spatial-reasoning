PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only single‐tile relation that can hold is N.  In fact, from  
   x N y  ⇒  supᵧ(z)≤infᵧ(y)≤infᵧ(x)  
and  
   y N z  ⇒  infₓ(z)≤infₓ(y)≤infₓ(x),  supₓ(x)≤supₓ(y)≤supₓ(z),  
one immediately checks that x N z is satisfied and none of the other eight basic directions (NE, E, SE, …, B) can.
