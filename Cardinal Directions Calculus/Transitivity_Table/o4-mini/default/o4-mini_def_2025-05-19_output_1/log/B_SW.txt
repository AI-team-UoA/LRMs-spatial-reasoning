PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only way x can relate to z is as SW (z), since
   supₓ(x) ≤ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(z)
and
   supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z)
together entail x SW z.
