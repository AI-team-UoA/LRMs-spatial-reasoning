PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only ways to satisfy  
  x E y (so x lies strictly to y’s east, vertically overlapping y)  
and  
  y SW z (so y lies to z’s south‐west)  
are that x ends up somewhere directly south of z (or slightly to z’s south–west or south–east).  
Hence the only possible single‐tile relations between x and z are  
   SW, S, SE
