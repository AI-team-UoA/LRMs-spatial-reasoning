PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only single‐tile directions that can ever hold between x and z under    
    
    x N y    and    y S z    
are    
      
    • x N z  
    • x B z  
    • x S z    
  
No other of the nine (E/W/NE/NW/SE/SW) can arise.
