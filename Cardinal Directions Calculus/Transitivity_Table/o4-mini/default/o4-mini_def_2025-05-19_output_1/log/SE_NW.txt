PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The composition SE ∘ NW is unconstrained – depending on how you choose x, y and z you can make x lie in any one of the nine single‐tile relations to z.  In other words  
x R z can be any of  
   B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W or NW.
