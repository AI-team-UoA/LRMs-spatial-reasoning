PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only single‐tile directions you can get are SW or S.  In the “mixed‐case” (when x’s box straddles z’s left‐edge) you recover the 2–tile relation SW :S.  No other of the 9 basic directions (nor B) can occur.
