PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

Any of the nine single‚Äêtile relations can occur.  In other words, knowing only that  
  x SW y  and  y NE z  
imposes no further restriction on the relative positions of x and z, so their relation can be any one of  
  {SW, W, NW, S, B, N, SE, E, NE}.
