{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The only ones that can still hold are the \u201csouthern\u201d ones.  In fact one shows  \n  sup y(x) \u2264 inf y(z)  \nand no fixed order on x\u2010 vs. z\u2010intervals, so x must lie entirely below z and may lie to its left, right or overlap horizontally.  Hence  \n    x SW z   or   x S z   or   x SE z.", "elapsed-time": 14.292069911956787, "reasoning-tokens": 1280, "completion-tokens": 1385}
