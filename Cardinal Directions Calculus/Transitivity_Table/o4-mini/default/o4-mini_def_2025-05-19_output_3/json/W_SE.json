{"prompt": "If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The only possible directions are the \u201csouth\u2010ward\u201d ones.  In fact one shows from  \nx W y and y SE z that sup\u2006y(x) \u2264 inf\u2006y(z), so x lies entirely below z, and on the x\u2013axis its interval may lie to the left, right or overlap that of z.  Hence the only admissible relations x ? z are\n\nSW, S or SE.", "elapsed-time": 33.55166530609131, "reasoning-tokens": 3776, "completion-tokens": 3889}
