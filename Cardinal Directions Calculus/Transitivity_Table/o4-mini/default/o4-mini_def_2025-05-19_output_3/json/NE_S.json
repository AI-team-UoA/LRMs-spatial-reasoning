{"prompt": "If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The only directions that cannot occur are those putting x to the west of z (i.e. W, SW, NW).  All others remain possible.  Hence  \nx R z \u2208 {B, N, NE, E, SE, S}.", "elapsed-time": 33.27991819381714, "reasoning-tokens": 3008, "completion-tokens": 3091}
