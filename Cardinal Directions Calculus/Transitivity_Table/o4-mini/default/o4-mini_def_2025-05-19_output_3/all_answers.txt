For r1: N, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: The only two that can occur are  
x W z  
or

For r1: N, r2: E, answer: The only two non‐empty compositions you can get are  
– x E z  
– x NE z
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: Possible relations are exactly N, B or S.
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: The only way to satisfy both x N y (x directly north of y) and y NW z is that x also lies northwest of z.  So the only possible relation is

NW.
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: The only three compass‐relations that can ever be made to hold between x and z (consistent with x N y and y SW z) are

SW, W or NW.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Possible relations are exactly the three “east‐of” sectors:
NE, E or SE.

For r1: N, r2: B, answer: The only two that can hold are  
  x N z  
or  
  x B z
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: The only possible compositions of W then N are  

– N  
– NW
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: The only possible single‐tile relations between x and z are  
W, B or E.
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Possible relations are exactly those “south‐of” directions.  Namely, x could be SW z, S z or SE z.
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: The only possible directions are the “south‐ward” ones.  In fact one shows from  
x W y and y SE z that sup y(x) ≤ inf y(z), so x lies entirely below z, and on the x–axis its interval may lie to the left, right or overlap that of z.  Hence the only admissible relations x ? z are

x NW z,  x N z  or  x NE z.
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: W, SW, NW, B, S or N
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: Possible relations are N or NE.
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: The only directions that can still hold between x and z are

  • x E z

No other cardinal‐direction (N, NE, SE, S, SW, NW) is consistent with x E y and y W z.
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: The only two single‐tile CDRs that can arise are

  S, N or B.

  x W z    or    x SW z
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: The only possible single‐tile relations are E or SE.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: The only way that 
  x S y and y S z can both hold is that x also lies entirely south of z.  
Hence the sole resulting relation is  
  x S z.
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: The only possible relations are  
NW, W or SW.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: SE

NE, E or SE.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: The only two base‐relations that can arise are

  • x S z  
  • x B z

No other of the nine can be forced by “x S y” + “y B z.”
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: The only two non‐degenerate possibilities are  
x NW z  or  x N z.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: The only two possibilities are  
  x NW z  
or  
  x W z
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: NW, N, NE, W or B
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: NW, N, W or B
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: The only possible cardinal‐direction links from x to z are  
SW, W or NW.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: {B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW}
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: NW, N or NE
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: Possible relations are exactly B, W, NW or N.
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Possible relations are exactly  
B, N, NW, W, SW, S
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: The only two possibilities are  
x SW z  (if x lies entirely south‐west of z)  
or  
x W z   (if x overlaps z in the y–direction but still lies to its west)
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: The only direction‐atoms that can ever arise between x and z under

  x SW y  
  y E z

are exactly

  SW, S, SE, W, B, E.

No “north‐ward” atom (N, NE or NW) can ever occur.
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: The only possible relations are  
x S z  
or  
x SW z
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: The only three cardinal‐box relations consistent with  
 x SW y  and  y NW z  
are  
   x SW z, x W z or x NW z.
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Any of them. Given x SW y and y NE z, x and z can stand in any one of the nine single‐tile relations:  
B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W or NW.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Possible relations are exactly those four:

SW, S, W, or B
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: The only possible relations are the “easterly” and “vertical” ones (plus containment).  In fact one can show  
x ? z ∈ {B, N, NE, E, SE, S}.
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: The only single‐tile relations that can arise between x and z are

   SW, S, W, B, E, SE

(no N, NE or NW are possible).
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: Possible non‐degenerate cases are

x E z  or  x SE z
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: The only two single‐tile relations possible between x and z are

S  (x is strictly south of z)  
SW (x is south–west of z)
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: Any of the nine basic relations can occur.  In fact there are examples with

 x B z, x N z, x NE z, x E z, x SE z, x S z, x SW z, x W z or x NW z.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: The only ones that can still hold are the “southern” ones.  In fact one shows  
  sup y(x) ≤ inf y(z)  
and no fixed order on x‐ vs. z‐intervals, so x must lie entirely below z and may lie to its left, right or overlap horizontally.  Hence  
    x SW z   or   x S z   or   x SE z.
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: The only way to satisfy  
  x SE y  and  y SE z  
is to have  
  x SE z.  
No other of the nine basic box‐relations can occur.
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: The only possible compass‐relations from x to z are  
NE, E or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: The only non‐empty ways to “go southeast of y” and then still stay (or go out) relative to z are

  x B z or x S z or x E z or x SE z.
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: The only non‐degenerate way to satisfy

    x NE y  and  y N z

is that x also lies to the Northeast of z.  Hence the only possible single‐tile cardinal relation is

    x NE z
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: B, W, NW, N, NE, E
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: The only possible outcomes are that x is either NE or E of z.
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: The only directions that cannot occur are those putting x to the west of z (i.e. W, SW, NW).  All others remain possible.  Hence  
x R z ∈ {B, N, NE, E, SE, S}.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: The only directions consistent with  
  x NE y and y NW z  
are  
  x NE z, x N z or x NW z.
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: All nine are possible.  Depending on how far/non‐symmetrically you place x and z you can realize any of  
B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W or NW.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: The only possible x–z relations are the three “east‐ward” ones, namely  
NE, E or SE.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: Possible relations are exactly those in which x lies somewhere in the northeast quadrant of z (including on its bounding‐box), namely  
B, N, NE or E.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: W
