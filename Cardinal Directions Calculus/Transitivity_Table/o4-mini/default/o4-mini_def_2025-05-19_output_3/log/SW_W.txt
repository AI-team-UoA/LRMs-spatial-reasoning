PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only two possibilities are  
x SW z  (if x lies entirely south‐west of z)  
or  
x W z   (if x overlaps z in the y–direction but still lies to its west)
