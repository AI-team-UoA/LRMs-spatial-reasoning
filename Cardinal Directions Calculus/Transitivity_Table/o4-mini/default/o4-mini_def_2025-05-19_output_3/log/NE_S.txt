PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only directions that cannot occur are those putting x to the west of z (i.e. W, SW, NW).  All others remain possible.  Hence  
x R z âˆˆ {B, N, NE, E, SE, S}.
