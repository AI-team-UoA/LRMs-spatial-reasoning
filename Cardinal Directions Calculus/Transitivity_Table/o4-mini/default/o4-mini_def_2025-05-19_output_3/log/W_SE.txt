PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only possible directions are the “south‐ward” ones.  In fact one shows from  
x W y and y SE z that sup y(x) ≤ inf y(z), so x lies entirely below z, and on the x–axis its interval may lie to the left, right or overlap that of z.  Hence the only admissible relations x ? z are

SW, S or SE.
