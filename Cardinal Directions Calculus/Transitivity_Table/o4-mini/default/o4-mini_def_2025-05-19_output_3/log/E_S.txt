PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only two single‐tile CDRs that can arise are  
   x S z  (when x’s x–span stays within z’s)  
or  
   x SE z (when x lies entirely to z’s right as well as below it)
