PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only non‐degenerate way to satisfy

    x NE y  and  y N z

is that x also lies to the Northeast of z.  Hence the only possible single‐tile cardinal relation is

    x NE z
