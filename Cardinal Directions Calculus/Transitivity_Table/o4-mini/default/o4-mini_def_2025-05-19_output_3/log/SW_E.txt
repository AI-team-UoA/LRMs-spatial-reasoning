PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only direction‐atoms that can ever arise between x and z under

  x SW y  
  y E z

are exactly

  SW, S, SE, W, B, E.

No “north‐ward” atom (N, NE or NW) can ever occur.
