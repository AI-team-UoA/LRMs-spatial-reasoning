PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only directions that can still hold between x and z are

  • x E z  
  • x W z  
  • x B z  

No other cardinal‐direction (N, NE, SE, S, SW, NW) is consistent with x E y and y W z.
