PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only ones that can still hold are the “southern” ones.  In fact one shows  
  sup y(x) ≤ inf y(z)  
and no fixed order on x‐ vs. z‐intervals, so x must lie entirely below z and may lie to its left, right or overlap horizontally.  Hence  
    x SW z   or   x S z   or   x SE z.
