For r1: N, r2: N, answer: The only way to satisfy both x N y and y N z is that x lies strictly above z (with x’s x–span inside z’s).  Hence the only possible cardinal‐direction between x and z is

N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: NW, W, SW

NE, E or SE.

For r1: W, r2: N, answer: NW, N, NE
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: W, B or E
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: The only possibilities are  
  x S z  
or  
  x SW z
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: The only possibilities are  
SW, S or SE.  
Indeed one shows that from x W y and y SE z it follows that supy(x)≤infy(z) (so x is south of z) while along x the intervals may lie left, overlapping, or right, giving SW, S or SE.
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: The only possible cardinal‐direction relations are  
 x NW z,  x N z  or  x NE z.
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: The only two that can arise are  
  x W z  (x still lies entirely to the west of z)  
or  
  x B z  (x’s bounding‐box sits entirely inside z’s).
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: N or NE
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: Possible relations are exactly W, B or E. That is, x can be west of z, inside z’s bounding‐box, or east of z.
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: E
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: The only possible links are  
   x S z  
or  
   x SE z
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: NW, N or NE
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: SW, S, SE
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: The only possible resulting relation is SE. 

Reason (using the bounding‐box definitions):

1. x E y ⇒ supₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x) and y‘s y‐interval contains x‘s.
2. y SE z ⇒ supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) and supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z).

Chaining the x–interval inequalities gives
   supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) ≤ infₓ(x),
so supₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(x).

Chaining the y–interval inequalities gives
   supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(z),
so supᵧ(x) ≤ infᵧ(z).

But “a SE b” is exactly supₓ(b) ≤ infₓ(a) and supᵧ(a) ≤ infᵧ(b), so x SE z.
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: The only two basic‐tile relations that can hold are  
  x B z   or   x E z.  
No other of the nine (N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, NW) is consistent with x E y and y B z.
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Possible relations between x and z are exactly the “vertical‐only” ones:  
S, B or N.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Possible relations are W or SW.
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: The only two feasible compositions are  
x E z  or  x SE z.
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: S
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: The only way to satisfy  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)  
(and have x entirely to the west of z) while letting their vertical‐ranges be in any order is that x falls into one of  
  SW, W or NW of z.  
So the possible relations are  
  {SW, W, NW}.
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: The only way to satisfy  
  x S y  (so x lies strictly below y, but horizontally inside y)  
  y NE z (so y lies strictly to the north‐east of z)  
is that x lies strictly to the east of z, with its y‐interval either above, overlapping or below z.  Hence the only single‐tile CD‐relations possible between x and z are  
   NE, E or SE.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: The only two base‐relations that can ever hold between x and z are  
  S  (x south of z)  
  B  (x’s bounding box inside z’s)
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Possible relations are NW or N.
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: The only possibilities are  
  x NW z  
or  
  x W z
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: The only non‐degenerate results you can get when you compose   
    x NW y    and    y E z   
are that x lies north of z but horizontally could be west, aligned or east of it.  In the single‐tile calculus those three are exactly  
    x NW z,   x N z   or   x NE z.
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Possible atomic relations between x and z are exactly these four:  
B, S, SW, W
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: The only feasible direction is still NW. In fact under the box‐constraints

  x NW y  and  y NW z 

one deduces

  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)  and  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x)

so x NW z. No other of the nine can occur for disk‐like regions.
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: The only possible basic‐tile relations are SW, W or NW.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: {B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW}
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: The only possibilities are  
NW, N or NE.
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: Possible relations are exactly those “to the NW‐side or inside” of z.  In fact the only cardinal directions x could bear to z are

NW, N, W or B.
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: B, NW, N, W
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Possible(x,z) ⊆ {SW, W}
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: B, S, SW, W, E, SE
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: The only two possible outcomes are  
x S z or x SW z
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: The only possibilities are  
x SW z,  x W z  or  x NW z.
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: The only way to maintain   
 (i) x SW y ⇒ x entirely below y,  
(ii) y SE z ⇒ y entirely below z  
is that x is also entirely below z.  Horizontally x can lie to the left of z, overlap it or lie to its right.  Hence the only possible single‐tile relations x ? z are  
   
   SW, S or SE.
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: The composition SW(x,y) ∧ NE(y,z) imposes only that both x and z lie in y’s SW‐quadrant.  Nothing further forces a particular ordering between x and z, so in fact any of the nine basic cardinal‐direction relations (including B) can occur.  Hence the possible relations x R z are

B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: The only possibilities are  
SW, W, S or B
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: The only possible composites are  
x NE z,  x E z  or  x SE z.
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: The only forbidden compass‐directions turn out to be the northern ones.  In fact from  
    x SE y  
and  
    y W z  
you can derive that x and z may stand in exactly these six possible single‐tile relations:  
    B, W, SW, S, SE, E  
and no others.
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: The only single‐tile directions consistent with  
  x SE y and y E z  
are  
  x S z,  x SE z  or  x E z.
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: The only two that can ever be realized are  
  x S z  (x lies entirely below z but overlaps it in x)  
or  
  x SE z  (x lies below and to the right of z).
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: The composition SE ∘ NW is unconstrained – x and z can stand in any of the nine basic relations.  In other words the possible relations x R z are

B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: The only possible single‐tile relations are  
  x SW z,  x S z  or  x SE z.
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: SE
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: The only possible relations are NE, E or SE.
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: The only four you can get are  
  x B z,  x E z,  x S z  or  x SE z.
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: The only two base‐directions that can arise from “x NE y” followed by “y N z” are

   x NE z   or   x N z.
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: The only possible x–z relations are

  B, N, NE, NW, E or W
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: The only two you can get are  
 x NE z  
or  
 x E z
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: The only directions x → z that can occur are

   B, N, NE, E, SE, S

—all others (NW, W, SW) are ruled out.
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: NW, N or NE
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: The only thing you can say in general is “no information”:  x and z can stand in any of the nine single‐tile relations.  In symbols  
NE∘SW = {B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW}.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: The only possibilities are  
x NE z,  x E z  or  x SE z.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: NE
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: The only possible single‐tile relations x can have to z are  
B, N, E or NE.
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: N
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: W
