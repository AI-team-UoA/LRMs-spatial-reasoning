{"prompt": "If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The only forbidden compass\u2010directions turn out to be the northern ones.  In fact from  \n    x SE y  \nand  \n    y W z  \nyou can derive that x and z may stand in exactly these six possible single\u2010tile relations:  \n    B, W, SW, S, SE, E  \nand no others.", "elapsed-time": 44.81721830368042, "reasoning-tokens": 5056, "completion-tokens": 5152}
