PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only feasible direction is still NW. In fact under the box‐constraints

  x NW y  and  y NW z 

one deduces

  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)  and  supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(x)

so x NW z. No other of the nine can occur for disk‐like regions.
