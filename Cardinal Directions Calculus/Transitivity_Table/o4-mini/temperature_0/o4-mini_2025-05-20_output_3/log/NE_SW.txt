PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only thing you can say in general is “no information”:  x and z can stand in any of the nine single‐tile relations.  In symbols  
NE∘SW = {B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW}.
