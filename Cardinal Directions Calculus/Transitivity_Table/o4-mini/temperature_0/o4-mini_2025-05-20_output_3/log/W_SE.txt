PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only possibilities are  
SW, S or SE.  
Indeed one shows that from x W y and y SE z it follows that supy(x)â‰¤infy(z) (so x is south of z) while along x the intervals may lie left, overlapping, or right, giving SW, S or SE.
