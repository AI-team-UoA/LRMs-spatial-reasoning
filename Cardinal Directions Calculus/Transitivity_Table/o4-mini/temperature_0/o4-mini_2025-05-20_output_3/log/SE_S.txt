PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only two that can ever be realized are  
  x S z  (x lies entirely below z but overlaps it in x)  
or  
  x SE z  (x lies below and to the right of z).
