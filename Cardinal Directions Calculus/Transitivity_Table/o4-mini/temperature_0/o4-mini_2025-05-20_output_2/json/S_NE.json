{"prompt": "If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The only way to satisfy  \n  x S y  (so x lies strictly below y, but horizontally inside y)  \n  y NE z (so y lies strictly to the north\u2010east of z)  \nis that x lies strictly to the east of z, with its y\u2010interval either above, overlapping or below z.  Hence the only single\u2010tile CD\u2010relations possible between x and z are  \n   NE, E or SE.", "elapsed-time": 38.50009536743164, "reasoning-tokens": 3968, "completion-tokens": 4083}
