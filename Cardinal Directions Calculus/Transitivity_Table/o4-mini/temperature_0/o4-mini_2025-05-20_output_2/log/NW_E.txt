PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only non‐degenerate results you can get when you compose   
    x NW y    and    y E z   
are that x lies north of z but horizontally could be west, aligned or east of it.  In the single‐tile calculus those three are exactly  
    x NW z,   x N z   or   x NE z.
