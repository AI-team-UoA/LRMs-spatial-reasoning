PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only two basic‚Äêtile relations that can hold are  
  x B z   or   x E z.  
No other of the nine (N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, NW) is consistent with x E y and y B z.
