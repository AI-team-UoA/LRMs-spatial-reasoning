PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The composition SW(x,y) ∧ NE(y,z) imposes only that both x and z lie in y’s SW‐quadrant.  Nothing further forces a particular ordering between x and z, so in fact any of the nine basic cardinal‐direction relations (including B) can occur.  Hence the possible relations x R z are

B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.
