PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only way to satisfy  
  supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(z)  
(and have x entirely to the west of z) while letting their vertical‐ranges be in any order is that x falls into one of  
  SW, W or NW of z.  
So the possible relations are  
  {SW, W, NW}.
