{"prompt": "If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The only way to maintain   \n (i) x SW y \u21d2 x entirely below y,  \n(ii) y SE z \u21d2 y entirely below z  \nis that x is also entirely below z.  Horizontally x can lie to the left of z, overlap it or lie to its right.  Hence the only possible single\u2010tile relations x ? z are  \n   \n   SW, S or SE.", "elapsed-time": 35.698089599609375, "reasoning-tokens": 2880, "completion-tokens": 2989}
