{"prompt": "If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", "answer": "The only non\u2010degenerate results you can get when you compose   \n    x NW y    and    y E z   \nare that x lies north of z but horizontally could be west, aligned or east of it.  In the single\u2010tile calculus those three are exactly  \n    x NW z,   x N z   or   x NE z.", "elapsed-time": 68.07044339179993, "reasoning-tokens": 7872, "completion-tokens": 7972}
