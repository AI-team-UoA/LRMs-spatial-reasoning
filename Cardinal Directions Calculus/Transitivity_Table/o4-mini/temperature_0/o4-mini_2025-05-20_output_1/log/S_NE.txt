PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only way to satisfy  
  x S y  (so x lies strictly below y, but horizontally inside y)  
  y NE z (so y lies strictly to the north‐east of z)  
is that x lies strictly to the east of z, with its y‐interval either above, overlapping or below z.  Hence the only single‐tile CD‐relations possible between x and z are  
   NE, E or SE.
