PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

The only way to satisfy both x N y and y N z is that x lies strictly above z (with x’s x–span inside z’s).  Hence the only possible cardinal‐direction between x and z is

N
