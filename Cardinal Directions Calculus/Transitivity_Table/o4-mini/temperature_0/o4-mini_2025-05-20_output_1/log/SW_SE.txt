PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only way to maintain   
 (i) x SW y ⇒ x entirely below y,  
(ii) y SE z ⇒ y entirely below z  
is that x is also entirely below z.  Horizontally x can lie to the left of z, overlap it or lie to its right.  Hence the only possible single‐tile relations x ? z are  
   
   SW, S or SE.
