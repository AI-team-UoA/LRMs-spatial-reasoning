PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

ANSWER:

The only forbidden compass‐directions turn out to be the northern ones.  In fact from  
    x SE y  
and  
    y W z  
you can derive that x and z may stand in exactly these six possible single‐tile relations:  
    B, W, SW, S, SE, E  
and no others.
