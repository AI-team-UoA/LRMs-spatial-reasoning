For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the given constraints:
- x is N of y
- y is SW of z

From these constraints, I can determine that:
- x is north of y, so supy(y) ≤ infx(x)
- y is southwest of z, so supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these facts, we know that x must be north of y, and y must be southwest of z. This means x could be in various positions relative to z.

For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of SW and N.

Given:
- x is SW of y (x SW y)
- y is N of z (y N z)

When composing these relations:
- x SW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, we can determine:
- For x and z, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't establish a direct constraint between supy(x) and supy(z)
- For the x-coordinate, supx(x) ≤ infx(y), but the relationship between infx(y) and infx(z) doesn't give us a definitive constraint

The possible relations between x and z are:

For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of SW and W.

Given:
- x is SW of y (x SW y)
- y is W of z (y W z)

When composing these relations:
- x SW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y W z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, we can determine:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) < infx(z), so x is to the west of z
- For the y-coordinate, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but the relationship between infy(y) and infy(z) is not fixed

SW, W, NW
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given:

When x is SW of y:

- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

When y is E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)

Combining these constraints, we can determine:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't establish a definite relation between x and z on the x-axis
- For the y-axis, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't establish a definite relation with z

For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is W of z.

Given:
- x SE y (region x is Southeast of region y)
- y W z (region y is West of region z)

When analyzing cardinal direction compositions, I need to consider all possible positions that satisfy both constraints.

If x is SE of y, then x is in the lower-right quadrant relative to y.
If y is W of z, then y is to the left of z.

Combining these constraints, region x could be in the following positions relative to z:
- S (South)
- SE (Southeast)
- E (East)
- SW (Southwest)
- W (West)
