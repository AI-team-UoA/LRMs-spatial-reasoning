PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the given constraints:
- x is N of y
- y is SW of z

From these constraints, I can determine that:
- x is north of y, so supy(y) ≤ infx(x)
- y is southwest of z, so supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these facts, we know that x must be north of y, and y must be southwest of z. This means x could be in various positions relative to z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
NW, N, NE, W, B, E
