PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of SW and W.

Given:
- x is SW of y (x SW y)
- y is W of z (y W z)

When composing these relations:
- x SW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y W z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, we can determine:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) < infx(z), so x is to the west of z
- For the y-coordinate, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but the relationship between infy(y) and infy(z) is not fixed

The possible relations between x and z are:
SW, W, NW
