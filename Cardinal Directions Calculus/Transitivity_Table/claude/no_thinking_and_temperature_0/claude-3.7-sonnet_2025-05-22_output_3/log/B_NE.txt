PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given that:
- x B y (x is in the bounding box of y)
- y NE z (y is northeast of z)

Since x B y, region x is contained within the bounding box of y.
Since y NE z, we know that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

The possible relations between x and z are:
N, NE, E, B, NW, SE
