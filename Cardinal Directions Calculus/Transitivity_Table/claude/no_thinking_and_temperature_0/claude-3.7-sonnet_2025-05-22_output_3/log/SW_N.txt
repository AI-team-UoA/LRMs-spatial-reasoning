PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of SW and N.

Given:
- x is SW of y (x SW y)
- y is N of z (y N z)

When composing these relations:
- x SW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, we can determine:
- For x and z, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't establish a direct constraint between supy(x) and supy(z)
- For the x-coordinate, supx(x) ≤ infx(y), but the relationship between infx(y) and infx(z) doesn't give us a definitive constraint

The possible relations between x and z are:
NW, W, SW
