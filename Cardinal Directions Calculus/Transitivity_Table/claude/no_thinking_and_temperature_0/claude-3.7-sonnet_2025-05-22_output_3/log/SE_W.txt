PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is W of z.

Given:
- x SE y (region x is Southeast of region y)
- y W z (region y is West of region z)

When analyzing cardinal direction compositions, I need to consider all possible positions that satisfy both constraints.

If x is SE of y, then x is in the lower-right quadrant relative to y.
If y is W of z, then y is to the left of z.

Combining these constraints, region x could be in the following positions relative to z:
- S (South)
- SE (Southeast)
- E (East)
- SW (Southwest)
- W (West)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SE, E, SW, W.
