PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the given constraints:
- x is NE of y
- y is S of z

From these constraints, I can determine that:
- x is in the northeast direction from y
- y is in the south direction from z

The possible relations between x and z are:
NE, E, SE, S
