PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given that:
- x is SW of y
- y is E of z

When x is SW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

When y is E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)

Combining these constraints, we can determine:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't establish a definite relationship between x and z on the x-axis
- For the y-axis, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't establish a definite relationship with z

The possible relations between x and z are:
SW, S, W, B
