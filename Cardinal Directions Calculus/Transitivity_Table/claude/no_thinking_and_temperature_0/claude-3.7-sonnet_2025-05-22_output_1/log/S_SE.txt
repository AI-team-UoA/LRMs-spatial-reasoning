PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of S and SE.

Given:
- x is S of y (x S y)
- y is SE of z (y SE z)

From the definitions:
- x S y means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Analyzing the possible positions of x relative to z, the possible relations are:
S, SE, SW

These are the only possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given the constraints.
