PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given that x is SW of y and y is W of z.

Given:
- x SW y (region x is southwest of region y)
- y W z (region y is west of region z)

Analyzing the constraints:
- When x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- When y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) < infx(z), which means x is to the west of z
- For the y-coordinate, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but the relationship between infy(y) and infy(z) can vary

The possible relations between x and z are:
SW, W, NW
