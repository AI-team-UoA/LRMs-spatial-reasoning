PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given that:
- x B y (x is in the bounding box of y)
- y SW z (y is southwest of z)

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
SW, W, NW, S, B
