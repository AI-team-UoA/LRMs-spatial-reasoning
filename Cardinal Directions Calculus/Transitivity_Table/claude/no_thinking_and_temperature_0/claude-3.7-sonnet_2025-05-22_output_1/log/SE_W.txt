PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is W of z.

Given:
- x SE y (x is Southeast of y)
- y W z (y is West of z)

Analyzing the constraints:
- When x SE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- When y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints, we can determine that:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means x could be in any of these positions relative to z:
S, SE, E
