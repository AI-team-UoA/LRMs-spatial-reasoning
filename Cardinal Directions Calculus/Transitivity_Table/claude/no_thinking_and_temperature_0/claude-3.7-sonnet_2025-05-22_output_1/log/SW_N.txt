PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the given constraints:
- x is SW of y
- y is N of z

From these constraints:
- x is in the southwest tile of y, meaning x is both west and south of y
- y is in the north tile of z, meaning y is north of z

The possible relations between x and z are:
NW, W, SW, N, B, S
