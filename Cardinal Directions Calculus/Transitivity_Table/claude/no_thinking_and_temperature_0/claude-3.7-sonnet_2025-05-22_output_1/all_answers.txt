For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the given constraints:
- x is N of y
- y is SW of z

From these constraints, I can determine that:
- x is north of y, so supy(y) ≤ infx(x)
- y is southwest of z, so supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these facts, we know that x must be north of y, and y must be southwest of z. This means x could be in several possible positions relative to z:

- y is N of z

For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given that x is SW of y and y is W of z.

Given:
- x SW y (region x is southwest of region y)
- y W z (region y is west of region z)

Analyzing the constraints:
- When x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- When y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) < infx(z), which means x is to the west of z
- For the y-coordinate, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but the relationship between infy(y) and infy(z) can vary

The possible relations between x and z are:
SW, W, NW
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given that:
- x is SW of y
- y is E of z

When x is SW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

When y is E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)

Combining these constraints, we can determine:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't establish a definite relationship between x and z on the x-axis
- For the y-axis, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't establish a definite relationship with z
