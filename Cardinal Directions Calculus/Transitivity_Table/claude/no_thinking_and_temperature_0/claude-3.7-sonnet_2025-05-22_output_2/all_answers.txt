For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the given constraints:
- x is N of y
- y is SW of z

From these constraints, I can determine that:
- x is north of y, so supy(y) ≤ infx(x)
- y is southwest of z, so supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these facts, we know that x must be north of y, and y must be southwest of z. This means x could be in several possible positions relative to z:

For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of SW and N.

Given:
- x is SW of y (x SW y)
- y is N of z (y N z)

When composing these relations, I need to consider all possible positions of x relative to z.

From the definitions:
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Analyzing the possible positions, region x could be:

For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of SW(y,x) and W(z,y).

- y is W of z (or z is W of y)

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
SW, W, NW
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z given:
- x is SW of y
- y is E of z

When x is SW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

When y is E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)

Combining these constraints, we can determine:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't establish a definite relationship between x and z on the x-axis
- For the y-axis, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't establish a definite relationship with z

For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of the given relations:

For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is W of z.

Given:
- x SE y (region x is Southeast of region y)
- y W z (region y is West of region z)

When analyzing cardinal direction compositions, I need to consider all possible positions that satisfy both constraints.

If x is SE of y, then x is in the lower-right quadrant relative to y.
If y is W of z, then y is to the left of z.

Combining these constraints, region x could be in the following positions relative to z:
- S (South)
- SE (Southeast)
- E (East)

When y SE z, region y is southeast of z, meaning:
