PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of SW and N.

Given:
- x is SW of y (x SW y)
- y is N of z (y N z)

When composing these relations, I need to consider all possible positions of x relative to z.

From the definitions:
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y N z means: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Analyzing the possible positions, region x could be:
NW, W, SW, N, B, S
