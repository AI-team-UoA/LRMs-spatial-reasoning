PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of S and NE.

Given:
- x is S of y (x S y)
- y is NE of z (y NE z)

The possible relations between x and z are:
S
SE
E
NE
