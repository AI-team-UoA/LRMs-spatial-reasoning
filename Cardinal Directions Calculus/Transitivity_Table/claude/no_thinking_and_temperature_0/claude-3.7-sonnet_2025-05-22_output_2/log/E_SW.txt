PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of cardinal direction relations.

Given:
- x is E of y
- y is SW of z

Analyzing the composition of E and SW:
When region y is SW of z, it means y is both to the south and west of z.
When region x is E of y, it means x is to the east of y.

The possible relations between x and z are:
S
SW
W
B
SE
