PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of SW(y,x) and W(z,y).

Given:
- x is SW of y (or y is SW of x)
- y is W of z (or z is W of y)

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
SW, W, NW
