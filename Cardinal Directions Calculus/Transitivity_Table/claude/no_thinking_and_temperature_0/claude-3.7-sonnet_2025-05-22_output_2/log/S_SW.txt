PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:



ANSWER:

To determine the possible relations between region x and region z, I need to analyze the composition of S and SW.

Given:

- y SW z (y is Southwest of z)

The possible relations between x and z are:
S, SW, W
