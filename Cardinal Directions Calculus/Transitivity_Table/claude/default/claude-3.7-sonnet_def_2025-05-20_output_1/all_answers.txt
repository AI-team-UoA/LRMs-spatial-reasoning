For r1: N, r2: N, answer: Based on the definitions provided, I'll analyze what relation(s) could exist between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the definition of the N (North) relation:
- For x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- For y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can deduce:
1. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

These deduced constraints exactly match the definition for the N relation between x and z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is North of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's East-West extent is contained within z's)

No other cardinal direction relation is possible because:
- NE and E would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicting supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- NW and W would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z), contradicting infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- S, SE, and SW would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), contradicting supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- B would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), contradicting supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: N
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: The cardinal direction relations between regions x and z can be determined by analyzing the constraints we're given.

From "x is N of y":
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

From "y is W of z":
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)

Combining these constraints:
1. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) - this means x is completely to the left of z
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) - this means x starts at or above where y ends, and z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom

Given these constraints, x must be to the left of z, but their vertical relationship can vary. The possible relations are:

NW, W

NW occurs when x is completely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
W occurs when x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is E of region z

Let me determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the first condition, for x to be N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally bounded by y)

From the second condition, for y to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically bounded by z)

From these constraints, I can determine:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z

For the vertical relationship:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

This gives us two possible scenarios:
1. If supy(z) < infy(x): x is completely above z → NE relation
2. If infy(x) <= supy(z): x has some vertical overlap with z → E relation

The possible relations between x and z are: E, NE
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is S of region z

To solve this, I need to analyze what these constraints tell us about the relative positioning.

From x N y:
- x is above y
- x's horizontal extent is contained within y's horizontal extent

From y S z:
- y is below z
- y's horizontal extent is contained within z's horizontal extent

Combining these constraints:
- y is below both x and z
- x's horizontal extent is contained within z's horizontal extent (since x's extent is within y's, which is within z's)

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. N (North): x could be completely above z
2. S (South): x could be below z (but still above y)
3. B (Bounding box): x could be inside z's bounding box

The other cardinal directions (NE, NW, E, W, SE, SW) are not possible because x's horizontal extent must be contained within z's horizontal extent, which contradicts these relations.
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x N y (x is North of y)
- y NW z (y is Northwest of z)

Let's analyze the constraints:

For x N y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y)

For y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

From these, I can determine:

1. Vertical relation between x and z:
   From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   This means x is above z.

2. Horizontal relation between x and z:
   From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   This means x is to the left of z.

Since x is both above and to the left of z, the only possible cardinal direction relation is NW.

The answer is: NW
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, let's analyze what we know:

1) x N y means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y's projection)

2) y SW z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
- x is to the left of z because: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Both x and z are above y

The vertical relationship between x and z is not fixed by the constraints, so we have three possibilities:
- NW: if x is above z
- W: if x overlaps vertically with z (according to the definition)
- SW: if x is below z

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, SW.
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z given the constraints.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

From x N y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is within the x-range of y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right of z

This immediately rules out relations NW, W, SW, S, N, and B, as they all require x to not be strictly to the right of z.

For the vertical relationship, we have:
- x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

But these don't directly constrain the vertical relationship between x and z. Therefore:
- x could be above z (NE relation)
- x could be at the same height as z (E relation)
- x could be below z (SE relation)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z based on the given conditions.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Let me analyze what these relations mean:

1. x is N of y means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection)

2. y is NE of z means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

From these, I can deduce:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means z is below x
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means z is to the left of x's leftmost point

Let me check all possible cardinal directions:
- For NE: Region x needs to be above and to the right of z
  * supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
  * supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓

- For N: Would require x to be directly above z with x-projection contained within z's x-projection
  * But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts this requirement

- For all other cardinal directions (NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, B): Each requires conditions that contradict our deductions

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

- N (North): This occurs when x is completely to the north of z
- B (Bounding box): This occurs when x is completely inside z
- B:N: This occurs when part of x is inside z and part of x extends north of z

The relation cannot involve E, W, NE, NW, S, SE, or SW because:
- From x N y and y B z, we can derive that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- This means x's x-coordinate projection must be contained within z's x-coordinate projection
- This constraint eliminates any cardinal direction that would require x to extend beyond z in the east or west directions
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W (West) of region y
- Region y is N (North) of region z

To solve this problem, I'll analyze what these constraints mean:

1. x W y means:
   - supₓ(x) ≤ infₓ(y) (x is to the left of y)
   - infᵧ(y) ≤ infᵧ(x) (x's bottom is not above y's bottom)
   - supᵧ(x) ≤ supᵧ(y) (x's top is not above y's top)

2. y N z means:
   - supᵧ(z) ≤ infᵧ(y) (y is above z)
   - infₓ(z) ≤ infₓ(y) (z is not completely to the right of y)
   - supₓ(y) ≤ supₓ(z) (z is not completely to the left of y)

Examining the possible relations between x and z:

1. NW (Northwest): 
   - From x W y and y N z, we can derive that x is to the west and can be to the north of z

2. N (North):
   - If x's x-coordinates overlap with z while remaining west of y, x can be directly north of z

3. W (West):
   - If x's y-coordinates overlap with z while maintaining the required position relative to y, x can be directly west of z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, N, W
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, knowing that region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z.

Let me work through the implications:

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints, I can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), therefore supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), therefore supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

These three deduced constraints exactly match the definition of the W relation. 

Therefore, the answer is: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

B, W, E
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Based on the given relations, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x W y (x is West of y)
- y S z (y is South of z)

To analyze this systematically:

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (vertical overlap)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (horizontal overlap)

Combining these constraints:
- Vertically: supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is always below z
- Horizontally: We have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)

Two possibilities emerge:
1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z): x is completely to the left of z (and below it) → SW relation
2. If infx(z) ≤ supx(x): x has horizontal overlap with z (while being below it) → S relation

I can verify no other relations are possible because:
- We've established x is strictly below z, which eliminates W, NW, N, NE, E, B
- The constraints prevent x from being to the right of z, eliminating SE

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SW
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Based on the constraints given:

- x W y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let me determine what these constraints imply about the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
- From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Combining these: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely to the west of z.

For the y-coordinates:
- From x W y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- Combining these: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Therefore: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is completely south of x.

Since x is completely west of z and z is completely south of x, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- Region y is SW of region z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, I can deduce:
- From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), by transitivity: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), by transitivity: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These two deduced constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) match exactly the definition of the SW relation.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: Based on the constraints, I'll determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- x W y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

First, for the y-axis relationship:
- From x W y: supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- From y SE z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Combining these: supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This confirms x is strictly south of z on the y-axis.

For the x-axis:
- From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

These constraints don't directly determine the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis. x could be:
- West of z (making x SW of z)
- Overlapping with z on the x-axis (making x S of z)
- East of z (making x SE of z)

All three positions are consistent with our original constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, SE
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x W y: This means x is west of y
- y NE z: This means y is northeast of z

From these relations, I can deduce:
- Since x is west of y, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- Since y is northeast of z, we know that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- From x W y, we also know that infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Combining these constraints, I can determine that supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means z is south of x.

For the horizontal relationship, both x and z are west of y, but their relative horizontal positioning could vary.

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
NW, N, NE
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is B of region z

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Analyzing each possible direction:

- W: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- NW: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- N: Possible if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- NE: Not possible (contradicts x being west of y)
- E: Not possible (contradicts x being west of y)
- SE: Not possible (contradicts x being west of y)
- S: Possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- SW: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- B: Possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: W, NW, N, SW, S, B
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the E relation, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

From the N relation, we know:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z (north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge

Now, considering the x-direction positioning, three possibilities emerge:

1. N (North): If x's x-range is completely contained within z's x-range (infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z))

2. NE (Northeast): If x is completely to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x))

3. N:NE: If x spans both N and NE tiles (infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x))

The possible relations are: N, NE, N:NE
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is W of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

From the definitions:
- x E y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y W z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

By combining these constraints, I can derive:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z.

For the x-coordinates, we know y is to the left of both x and z, but we don't have a direct constraint between x and z.

Analyzing all possible relations:
- B: Possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- E: Possible if supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- W: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- N, NE, NW: Not possible (requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicting our constraint)
- S, SE, SW: Not possible (requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), contradicting our constraint)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: B, E, W
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine what cardinal direction relationships are possible between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is E of y: This means sup_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y)
- y is E of z: This means sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y), and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x), so sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x)
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), so inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x)
- sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z), so sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z)

Checking possible relations:

E: Requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z) - all are satisfied.

NE: Requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) - first condition is satisfied, second is possible but not guaranteed.

SE: Requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z) - first condition is satisfied, second is possible but not guaranteed.

Answer: E, NE, SE
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is E of y: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y is S of z: This means supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) < infx(x)

Based on these derived constraints:

For S relation:
- We have supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) < infx(x)
- If supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is S of z

For SE relation:
- We have supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is SE of z

The remaining relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, SW, B) can be ruled out:
- N, NE, NW are impossible because we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- E is impossible because the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint
- W, SW are impossible because we know infx(z) < infx(x)
- B is impossible because it requires infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts our constraint

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SE
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From x E y:
- The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x (supx(y) ≤ infx(x))
- The y-range of x is contained within the y-range of y (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y))

From y NW z:
- The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z))
- The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y (supy(z) ≤ infy(y))

Combining these constraints:
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- This means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x, so x must be strictly north of z

The only possible cardinal direction relations where region x is strictly north of region z are:
- NW (if x is sufficiently to the left relative to z)
- N (if x overlaps horizontally with z)
- NE (if x is sufficiently to the right relative to z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, N, NE
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x E y (x is East of y)
- y SW z (y is Southwest of z)

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of x not below bottom of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x not above top of y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these constraints:
- From x E y and y SW z, we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z.
- The x-coordinate relationship between x and z is not directly constrained - x could be to the left, aligned with, or to the right of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is to the left of z)
- S (if x is aligned with z on the x-axis)
- SE (if x is to the right of z)
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E (East) of region y
- Region y is SE (Southeast) of region z

Let me analyze what this means:

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (overlap constraint on y-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (overlap constraint on y-axis)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Combining these constraints:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
  This means x is to the east of z.
- From supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y), we get: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  This means x is to the south of z.

When a region is both to the east and south of another region, it is in the SE direction.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-projection is within y's)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These two conditions match exactly the definition of the NE relation:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)

All other cardinal directions are inconsistent with these constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine what constraints are placed on region x relative to region z, given the information:
- x is E of y
- y is B of z

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (eastern boundary of y is west of western boundary of x)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (southern boundary of y is south of or at same position as southern boundary of x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (northern boundary of x is south of or at same position as northern boundary of y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (western boundary of z is west of western boundary of y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (eastern boundary of y is east of eastern boundary of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (southern boundary of z is south of southern boundary of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (northern boundary of y is north of northern boundary of z)

Combining these constraints:
1. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which gives us infx(z) < infx(x)
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which gives us infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which gives us supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Now, checking all possible relations:

For relation B: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- Three conditions are met, but supx(x) ≤ supx(z) depends on the specific regions.

For relation E: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- Two conditions are met, but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) depends on the specific regions.

All other relations (N, NE, SE, S, W, NW, SW) can be ruled out because our deductions contradict their requirements.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: B, E
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

From the given:
- x is S of y: This means supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is N of z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Looking at the x-coordinate constraints:
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y N z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z, which rules out cardinal directions that require x to be east or west of z (NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW).

For the y-coordinates:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These don't give us a direct constraint between the y-coordinates of x and z, so we must consider all possibilities that are consistent with our x-coordinate constraints.

The possible relations are: N, S, B
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is W of region z

Let me analyze what these conditions tell us:

For x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is aligned with or to the right of y's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is aligned with or to the left of y's right boundary)

For y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's bottom boundary extends below or is aligned with y's bottom boundary)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z's top boundary extends above or is aligned with y's top boundary)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is definitely to the left of z
- The vertical relationship between x and z depends on specific positions

The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

SW, W
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: Based on the given constraints:
1. x is S of y: This means x is below y with horizontal overlap.
2. y is E of z: This means y is to the right of z with vertical overlap.

From these constraints, I can determine:

For the x-coordinate relationship:
- From y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x S y: infx(y) <= infx(x)
- Therefore: supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means region x is always to the right of region z, which immediately rules out W, NW, SW, and B relations.

For the y-coordinate relationship:
- From x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y E z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

These constraints lead to two possible scenarios:
1. If supy(x) <= infy(z): Then x is SE of z
2. If infy(z) < supy(x) and other conditions for E are met: Then x is E of z

The N, NE, and S relations are not possible given our constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: E, SE
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Based on the given definitions of cardinal direction relations, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is S of y and y is S of z.

Let me analyze what each constraint tells us:

From x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x doesn't extend beyond y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x doesn't extend beyond y's right edge)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y doesn't extend beyond z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z's right edge)

Combining these constraints for the relationship between x and z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x doesn't extend beyond z's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x doesn't extend beyond z's right edge)

These constraints match exactly the definition of the S relation. For x to be in any other cardinal direction relative to z (like SW or SE), we would need conditions that contradict our derived constraints.

The answer is: S
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

Let me analyze the constraints:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

For the x-coordinate relation between x and z:
- By transitivity: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- This means x is completely to the left of z

For the y-coordinate relation:
- We know that both x and z are below y
- But we don't have a direct constraint between the y-coordinates of x and z

Given that x is completely to the left of z, and considering all possible vertical relationships between them, the possible relations are:

W, NW, SW
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: The question asks for possible relations between x and z given that:
- x is S of y
- y is SW of z

Let me analyze this step by step using the definitions of cardinal directions.

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

These two derived constraints mean:
- x's top boundary is below or at z's bottom boundary
- x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's left boundary

These conditions precisely match the definition of the SW relation. No other relation is possible because:
- For S: Would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), but we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- For W: Would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- All other relations similarly contradict our derived constraints

The answer is: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: To solve this problem, I need to analyze the constraints given by the two relations and determine what they tell us about the possible positions of region x relative to region z.

First, let's understand what we know:
* "x is S of y" means:
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal extent is within y's horizontal extent)

* "y is SE of z" means:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, I can derive constraints for the relationship between x and z:

Vertical relationship:
- From "x is S of y": supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From "y is SE of z": supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

Horizontal relationship:
- From "y is SE of z": supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- From "x is S of y": infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- Combining these: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- Therefore: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z)

Since x must be both below z and to the right of z, the only possible relation is SE.
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- E
- NE
- SE

Here's why:

From "x is S of y", we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From "y is NE of z", we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)

This means x must be to the east of z (since supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), which limits us to E, NE, or SE relations.

For the y-coordinates, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But this doesn't establish a definitive relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z. Therefore, x could be:
- Above z (giving NE relation)
- At the same latitude as z (giving E relation)
- Below z (giving SE relation)
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: To solve this problem, I need to analyze what the given relationships tell us about the possible positions of regions x, z, and then determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Given information:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is B of region z

From the definition of S relation:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x doesn't extend further left than y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x doesn't extend further right than y)

From the definition of B relation:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is within z's left bound)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within z's right bound)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is within z's lower bound)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is within z's upper bound)

Combining these relations:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now I'll check each possible cardinal direction relation:

The x-coordinate constraints (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) rule out SW, W, NW, NE, E, and SE, as these require x to be either entirely left or entirely right of z.

For N: We have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means x cannot be north of z.

This leaves us with two possibilities:

1. B relation: Possible when infy(z) ≤ infy(x), in which case x would be inside z's bounding box.

2. S relation: Possible when supy(x) ≤ infy(z), in which case x would be south of z.

The answer is: B, S
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

First, let's analyze what we know from these relations:

1) x is NW of y means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

2) y is N of z means:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- This confirms x is to the north of z

For the east-west relationship:
- From x NW of y, I know: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y N of z, I know: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- This means supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) is not fixed

The possible relations are:

N: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x would be directly north of z.

NW: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x would be to the northwest of z.

The answer is: N, NW
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine what the possible cardinal direction relations could be between region x and region z, given that:
- x is NW of y
- y is W of z

Let me analyze these constraints systematically:

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is strictly west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly north of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is strictly west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Combining these constraints:

For the x-direction:
- From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- This means x is strictly west of z

For the y-direction:
- From supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), we get infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Therefore, infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- But we cannot determine a definite relationship between supy(x) and supy(z)

Given these constraints:

1. For x to be NW of z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (established) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The latter is possible but not guaranteed.

2. For x to be W of z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (established), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (established), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The latter is possible.

3. For x to be SW of z: We would need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But we've established infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(x). This is impossible for a non-empty region.

The possible relations are: NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NW of y: This means x is to the left of y and above y
- y is E of z: This means y is to the right of z and vertically aligned with z

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us about the relationship between x and z:

1. Horizontally: 
   - x is to the left of y
   - z is to the left of y
   - Therefore, x and z could be in any horizontal relationship (x could be left of z, right of z, or horizontally overlapping)

2. Vertically:
   - x is above y
   - y is vertically aligned with z (y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent)
   - This means x is at least partially above y's position, but x could be entirely above z or partially overlapping z vertically

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

NW, N, NE, W, B, E
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Based on the given information, I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y (x NW y)
- Region y is S of region z (y S z)

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely to the north of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is completely to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

To determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider these constraints:

For x E z (or NE or SE): 
This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but from our constraints we can derive: supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), which would lead to supx(y) ≤ infx(y) - a contradiction. So x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z.

For the remaining relations:
- N: x can be above z
- W: x can be to the west of z
- NW: x can be to the northwest of z
- S: x can be below z (if z extends high enough)
- SW: x can be to the southwest of z
- B: x can be inside z's bounding box

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, W, NW, S, SW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y (x NW y)
- Region y is NW of region z (y NW z)

From the definition of the NW relation:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, I can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which gives supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These two derived inequalities (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) precisely define the relation x NW z.

Therefore, if region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

First, let's analyze what we know for sure:
- If x is NW of y, then x is to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- If y is SW of z, then y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

From these conditions, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x must be to the left of z

However, for the vertical relationship between x and z, we know that:
- x is above y (from x NW y)
- y is below z (from y SW z)

This doesn't give us a definitive vertical relationship between x and z. There are three possibilities:
1. x could be above z (NW relation)
2. x could be at the same vertical level as z (W relation)
3. x could be below z (SW relation)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, SW
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

From the definition of NW relation:
- If x NW y, then supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

From the definition of SE relation:
- If y SE z, then supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Looking at these constraints, we can see that both x and z are located to the west of y (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)), and both x and z are located to the north of y (since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).

However, these constraints don't determine the exact relation between x and z. The regions x and z could be oriented in any of the possible cardinal direction relationships relative to each other.

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y: x NW y
- Region y is NE of region z: y NE z

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y): x is to the left of y
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x): x is above y

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y): z is to the left of y
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y): z is below y

Combining these constraints:
- From the y-axis constraints: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x is always above z.
- On the x-axis, both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative positions to each other are not constrained.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:

NW, N, NE
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: 
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: 
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is W of region z

Let me analyze what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (vertical constraints)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (vertical constraints)

By transitivity, we can conclude:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x must be west of z)

For the vertical relationship, we can't make a definitive conclusion because:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)

These constraints allow x to be either south of z, partially vertically overlapping with z, or north of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
SW, W, NW
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is E of z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, I can determine:
1. Both x and z are to the left of y (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
2. x is below y (since supy(x) ≤ infy(y))
3. z has vertical overlap with y (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

Analyzing the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

- B: If x is inside z's bounding box
- S: If x is directly below z with horizontal overlap
- SW: If x is to the left and below z
- W: If x is to the left of z with vertical overlap
- SE: If x is to the right of z (but still left of y) and below z
- E: If x is to the right of z (but still left of y) with vertical overlap

The relations N, NE, and NW are not possible because these would require x to be above z in some capacity, which contradicts our constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: B, S, SW, W, SE, E.
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

SW, S, SE
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

W, NW, SW

These are the only possible relations because:

1. From "x is SW of y" we know that:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

2. From "y is NW of z" we know that:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y)

3. By transitivity:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This confirms that x must be west of z. However, the north-south relationship between x and z is not fully constrained by the given information. Both x and z are south of y, but their relative positions to each other in the y-direction can vary.
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Given:
- x is SW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is SW of z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These derived conditions (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) exactly match the definition of the SW relation.

Let me verify no other relation is possible:
- For S: Would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- For W: Would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- For B, N, NE, E, SE, NW: All require conditions that contradict our derived inequalities

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

From the definition of SW: 
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

From the definition of SE:
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means x is definitely to the south of z. However, the east-west relationship between x and z isn't fully constrained.

The possible relations are:
1. SW - if x is to the west of z
2. S - if x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection
3. SE - if x is to the east of z

SW, S, SE
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y, which means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- Region y is NE of region z, which means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these constraints, we know that both x and z are positioned to the west and south of y. However, their positions relative to each other are not directly constrained.

Let me verify this by checking possible positions for all cardinal relations:

For example, if:
- z has bounds (0,0,1,1)
- y has bounds (3,3,4,4)

Then x could be positioned at:
- B relation: (0.5,0.5,0.8,0.8) - inside z's bounding box
- N relation: (0.5,1.5,0.8,2.5) - north of z
- NE relation: (1.5,1.5,2.5,2.5) - northeast of z
- E relation: (1.5,0.5,2.5,0.8) - east of z
- SE relation: (1.5,0,2.5,0.5) - southeast of z
- S relation: (0.5,0,0.8,0.5) - south of z
- SW relation: (0,0,0.5,0.5) - southwest of z
- W relation: (0,0.5,0.5,0.8) - west of z
- NW relation: (0,1.5,0.5,2.5) - northwest of z

All these positions satisfy our constraints that x is SW of y and y is NE of z.

Therefore, all possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is B of z: This means infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Analyzing each possible relation:

1. SW: Region x can be SW of z. This occurs when both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

2. S: Region x can be S of z. This occurs when supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and x has x-coordinate overlap with z.

3. W: Region x can be W of z. This occurs when supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and x has y-coordinate overlap with z.

4. B: Region x can be B of z (inside z). This is possible if z is large enough to contain both y and x.

5. For other relations (SE, E, NE, N, NW): These are impossible because x is southwest of y, and y is inside z. This positioning prevents x from being east or north of z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, W, B
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Looking at the given constraints:
1. Region x is SE of region y
2. Region y is N of region z

I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

When x is SE of y, we know:
- x is to the east of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x))
- x is to the south of y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y))

When y is N of z, we know:
- y is to the north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- y's x-extent is within z's x-extent (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z))

Based on these constraints, let me determine the possible relations:

1. Since x is to the east of y, and y's x-extent is within z's x-extent, x could be to the east of z (E) or its x-extent could overlap with z's x-extent.

2. Since x is to the south of y, and y is to the north of z, x could be to the north of z, to the south of z, or its y-extent could overlap with z's y-extent.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (if x is to the east of z and to the north of z)
- E (if x is to the east of z and overlaps with z in the north-south direction)
- SE (if x is to the east of z and to the south of z)
- N (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is to the north of z)
- B (if x's extent falls within z's bounding box)
- S (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is to the south of z)
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z, given that x is SE of y and y is W of z.

Let me analyze the constraints:

1) x is SE of y means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x): x is to the east of y
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y): x is to the south of y

2) y is W of z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z): y is to the west of z
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z): y and z have a specific relationship in the y-direction

Now, I'll determine what this tells us about the possible relationship between x and z:

In the x-direction:
- Both x and z are to the east of y, but we don't know their relative positions.
- x could be east of z, west of z, or they could overlap in the x-direction.

In the y-direction:
- x is strictly south of y
- z's y-range extends both below y's lower bound and above y's upper bound
- For x to be north of z, we would need supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- However, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- This means supy(z) > infy(x), so x cannot be to the north of z

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
SW, S, SE, W, B, E
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal relations are possible between region x and region z, given the constraints.

Given:
- x is SE of y: This means x is to the east and south of y
- y is E of z: This means y is to the east of z, with y's vertical extent contained within z's vertical extent

First, let's establish what we know for certain:
- Since x is east of y and y is east of z, then x must be east of z (by transitivity)

For the north-south relationship between x and z:
- From x SE y: x is south of y (x's top edge is below y's bottom edge)
- From y E z: y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent (z's bottom edge is at most as low as y's bottom edge, and z's top edge is at least as high as y's top edge)

Considering these constraints, there are two possible relationships:

1. E (East): If z's bottom edge is lower than y's bottom edge, it's possible for x to overlap vertically with z while still being south of y and east of z.

2. SE (Southeast): If z's bottom edge is at the same level as y's bottom edge, then x (being south of y) would also be south of z, resulting in x being southeast of z.

The answer is E, SE.
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

S, SE
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: To solve this problem, I need to consider the constraints and determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From these constraints:
- x is to the east and south of y
- y is to the west and north of z

Let me analyze what's possible by testing different configurations:

1. If y is at (0,0):
   - x must be somewhere in the southeast quadrant relative to y
   - z must be positioned such that y is in its northwest quadrant

The key insight is that while both x and z have positions constrained relative to y, their positions relative to each other are not fully determined.

By placing x and z at different locations that satisfy the given constraints, I can achieve all possible cardinal direction relations:

- N: x can be north of z
- NE: x can be northeast of z
- E: x can be east of z
- SE: x can be southeast of z
- S: x can be south of z
- SW: x can be southwest of z
- W: x can be west of z
- NW: x can be northwest of z
- B: x can be bounding or overlapping with z

The answer is: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

From "region x is SE of region y":
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From "region y is SW of region z":
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (z is to the right of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these constraints, I can deduce:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is definitely below z

However, the relative position of x and z on the x-axis is not constrained. There are three possibilities:
- If x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), then x is SW of z
- If z is to the left of x (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), then x is SE of z
- If x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then x is S of z

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
S, SW, SE
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: Based on the definition of the cardinal direction relations, I need to analyze what happens when we have "x SE y" and "y SE z".

For "x SE y", we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is entirely to the south of y)

For "y SE z", we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is entirely to the south of z)

By transitivity, we can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is entirely to the south of z)

These two conditions precisely match the definition of SE (South East).

I checked other possible relations (S, E, B, etc.), but each one requires conditions that would contradict our derived constraints.

The answer is: SE
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

NE, E, SE

These are the only possibilities because:

When x is SE of y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

When y is NE of z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)

Through transitivity:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so x must be east of z

However, the north-south relationship between x and z is indeterminate:
- x could be north of z (NE relation)
- x could be aligned with z in the y-direction (E relation)
- x could be south of z (SE relation)
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z given that x is SE of y and y is B of z.

First, let me understand what these given relations mean:
- x SE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y B z means: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - This is possible if y is positioned near the southeast corner of z.

2. S: For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - This is possible if y is positioned near the southern boundary of z.

3. E: For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - This is possible if y is positioned near the eastern boundary of z.

4. B: For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - This is possible if y is positioned in the northwest portion of z and x is southeast of y but still inside z.

The other cardinal directions (SW, W, NW, N, NE) are not possible given the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SE, S, E, B.
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is N of region z

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:

1. x is NE of y means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y is N of z means:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) → Therefore, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) → Therefore, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x starts at or to the right of z's left boundary)

These constraints limit the possible relations between x and z to:

1. N: When infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
2. NE: When supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
3. N:NE: When infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) < supx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, N:NE
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: The cardinal direction relation between regions is defined by their relative positions and boundaries.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is W of region z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
- Both x and z are east of y
- x is north of y
- y's vertical range is within z's vertical range

For the possible relations between x and z, I need to determine which cardinal directions are compatible with these constraints:

South, Southeast, and Southwest are impossible because:
- We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- This means infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- For any southern relation, we would need supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- But this would create a contradiction: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The possible relations are:
N, NE, E, W, NW, B
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

- NE
- E

I derived this by using the definitions and constraints:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y has vertical overlap with z)

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) → x is east of z
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x) → x's lower bound is above z's lower bound

This means x is definitely east of z, but the vertical relationship depends on whether:
- If supy(z) ≤ infy(x): x is completely north of z → NE relation
- If supy(z) > infy(x) and there's vertical overlap: x is E of z
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is S of region z

First, let's analyze what these relationships tell us:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends westward of or begins at the same point as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends eastward of or ends at the same point as y)

When I consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

For the east-west relationship:
- From the constraints, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- This means x must be at least partially to the east of z
- The relations NW, W, and SW are impossible

For the north-south relationship:
- Both x and z are north of y, but their relative positions to each other are unconstrained
- x could be north of z, at the same level, or south of z

The possible relations between x and z are:
N, NE, E, SE, S, B
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

By transitivity of the north-south relationship:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This means x is definitely to the north of z.

For the east-west relationship, there are three possibilities:
1. x is to the east of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) → x is NE of z
2. x is to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) → x is NW of z
3. x's east-west extent is contained within z's (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) → x is N of z

The answer is: N, NE, NW
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given relations:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

I need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let me analyze what we know:
- x NE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y SW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This places both regions x and z in the northeast quadrant relative to y, but doesn't directly constrain their relation to each other. I can verify all possible relations by constructing specific examples:

1. N: When x is directly north of z (same x-coordinates, x higher than z)
2. NE: When x is northeast of z (x is east and north of z)
3. E: When x is directly east of z (same y-coordinates, x right of z)
4. SE: When x is southeast of z (x is east and south of z)
5. S: When x is directly south of z (same x-coordinates, x lower than z)
6. SW: When x is southwest of z (x is west and south of z)
7. W: When x is directly west of z (same y-coordinates, x left of z)
8. NW: When x is northwest of z (x is west and north of z)
9. B: When x is inside z (z completely contains x)

All nine cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

NE, E, SE

Given:
- x is NE of y: This means x is entirely to the northeast of y
- y is SE of z: This means y is entirely to the southeast of z

From these constraints:
- We can determine that x must be east of z (since x is east of y, which is east of z)
- However, the north-south relationship between x and z is not fixed. Depending on the exact positions, x could be:
  - North of z (making x NE of z)
  - At the same north-south level as z (making x E of z) 
  - South of z (making x SE of z)

All three relations (NE, E, SE) satisfy the given constraints.
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I need to determine what's possible between regions x and z given the constraints:

- x is NE of y, which means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NE of z, which means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which gives: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which gives: supy(z) <= infy(x)

These derived conditions mean that:
1. The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x
2. The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x

Looking at the definition of NE: a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

The conditions supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) perfectly match the definition for x NE z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is B of region z

From "x NE y", we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly north of y)

From "y B z", we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within x-bounds of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is within y-bounds of z)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. B (Bounding box):
   - If z is large enough to contain both y and x within its bounding box
   - Example: z (0,0)-(10,10), y (2,2)-(4,4), x (7,7)-(9,9)

2. NE (Northeast):
   - If z is positioned such that x is strictly northeast of it
   - Example: z (0,0)-(5,5), y (2,2)-(4,4), x (6,6)-(8,8)

3. N (North):

   - Example: z (0,0)-(10,5), y (2,2)-(4,4), x (3,6)-(8,8)

4. E (East):
   - If x is directly east of z but overlaps with z in the north-south direction

The possible relations are: B, N, NE, E
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relation(s) between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y (x is within the bounding box of y)
- Region y is N of region z (y is north of z)

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:

From "x is B of y":
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (left boundary of y is to the left of left boundary of x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (right boundary of x is to the left of right boundary of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom boundary of y is below bottom boundary of x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top boundary of x is below top boundary of y)

From "y is N of z":
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (top boundary of z is below bottom boundary of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (left boundary of z is to the left of left boundary of y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (right boundary of y is to the left of right boundary of z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (left boundary of z is to the left of left boundary of x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (right boundary of x is to the left of right boundary of z)

These constraints match exactly the definition of the N (North) relation:
- x is north of z if and only if x is completely above z and the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

The answer is: N
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is W of region z

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints, I can determine:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  This means x is completely to the west of z

- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Based on these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

W, NW, SW
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Based on the given constraints:
- x B y (region x is in the bounding box of region y)
- y E z (region y is East of region z)

Let me analyze what this means for the relationship between x and z:

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of x is at or above bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top of x is at or below top of z)

These constraints guarantee that x is east of z, but the vertical relationship can vary:

1. E: If x vertically overlaps with z
2. NE: If x is completely above z
3. SE: If x is completely below z

The possible relations between region x and region z are: E, NE, SE
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: 
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: Based on the definitions, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

Let's analyze the constraints:

From "x B y":
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From "y NW z":
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely west of z
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is completely north of z

Therefore, x is completely northwest of z, satisfying the definition of the NW relation:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The answer is NW.
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions and constraints:

When x is B of y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

When y is SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Therefore:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These inequalities satisfy the definition of the SW relation. The region x must be to the southwest of region z.

SW
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: Looking at this problem, I need to determine what relation could exist between region x and region z given that x is B of y and y is SE of z.

Let me break down what we know:

- x B y means: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
  This means x is completely inside the bounding box of y.

- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
  This means y is completely to the southeast of z.

From these constraints, I can derive:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   The eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x.

2. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   The northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of z.

These two conditions together define the SE relation. Region x is completely to the southeast of region z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: The problem asks for possible relations between region x and region z, given that region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z.

Let me work through this step by step:

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these inequalities:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

These combined inequalities tell us that:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) 
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These are exactly the conditions for x NE z.

I've checked all other possible relations (N, NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, B), and none of them are possible because they would contradict our derived constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

NE
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: The question asks about the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z.

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:

When x is B of y, this means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

When y is B of z, this means:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these inequalities:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These four combined inequalities exactly match the definition of x B z.

For any other cardinal direction relation to hold (S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE), region x would need to be at least partially outside the bounding box of z, which contradicts our derived inequalities.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

B
