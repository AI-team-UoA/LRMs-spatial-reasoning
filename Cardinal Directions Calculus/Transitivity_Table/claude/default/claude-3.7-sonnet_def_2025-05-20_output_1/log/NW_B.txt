PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this problem step by step using the definitions provided.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is B of region z

We want to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall what these relations mean:

1. x NW y means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y B z means:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's minimum x is greater than or equal to z's minimum x)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's maximum x is less than or equal to z's maximum x)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y's minimum y is greater than or equal to z's minimum y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's maximum y is less than or equal to z's maximum y)

This means that y is completely contained within the bounding box of z.

Now, let's determine what we know about the relationship between x and z by combining these constraints:

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far left as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far down as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far up as y)

From the first constraint of x NW y and the first constraint of y B z, we can deduce:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in terms of the x-axis. We know x is to the left of y, and z could extend to the left of y, but we don't know if z extends to the left of x.

Similarly, from the second constraint of x NW y and the fourth constraint of y B z, we can deduce:
supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Again, this doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in terms of the y-axis. We know x is above y, and z could extend above y, but we don't know if z extends above x.

So, based on the given constraints, we have a few possibilities for the relationship between x and z:

1. x could be NW of z if z doesn't extend to the left of x or above x.
2. x could be N of z if z extends to the left of x but not above x.
3. x could be W of z if z extends above x but not to the left of x.
4. x could be B of z if z extends both to the left of x and above x, completely containing x.
5. x could be NE of z if z extends so far to the left that it's to the left of x, but doesn't extend above x.
6. x could be E of z if z extends so far to the left that it's to the left of x, and also extends above x, but doesn't completely contain x.
7. x could be SW of z if z extends above x and to the left of x, but in a way that z doesn't contain x and x is to the southwest of z.
8. x could be S of z if z extends so far up that it's above x, to the left of x, and to the right of x, but doesn't completely contain x.
9. x could be SE of z if z extends so far up and so far to the left that x is to the southeast of z.

Wait, I think I've been a bit sloppy with my reasoning. Let me approach this more systematically.

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's see what direct constraints we can establish between x and z:

For the x-axis, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y B z)

We can't derive a direct constraint for supx(x) relative to infx(z) from these. It's possible that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supx(x) > infx(z) (x overlaps with z on the x-axis)

For the y-axis, we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y B z)

Again, we can't derive a direct constraint for infy(x) relative to supy(z). It's possible that:
- infy(x) > supy(z) (x is to the north of z)
- infy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x overlaps with z on the y-axis)

Based on these possibilities, x could have multiple relations with z:

- If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NW of z.
- If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(x) ≤ supy(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is W of z.
- If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is SW of z.
- If infx(z) < supx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is N of z.
- If infx(z) < supx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(x) ≤ supy(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is B of z.
- If infx(z) < supx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is S of z.
- If supx(z) < infx(x) and infy(x) > supy(z), then x is NE of z.
- If supx(z) < infx(x) and infy(x) ≤ supy(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is E of z.
- If supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is SE of z.

Wait, let me double-check these. The constraints for each relation are:

- x NW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- x N z if and only if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- x NE z if and only if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- x W z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- x B z if and only if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- x E z if and only if supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- x SW z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- x S z if and only if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- x SE z if and only if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's check which of these are consistent with our constraints from x NW y and y B z:

- From x NW y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- From y B z, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Let's check each relation:

- For x NW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). From our constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y), but we don't have a direct constraint for infx(z). We also know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which doesn't give us a direct constraint for supy(z) relative to infy(x). So, x NW z is possible if the additional constraints supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) are satisfied.

Hmm, this is getting a bit unwieldy. Let me try a more direct approach by considering specific scenarios.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y (meaning x is to the northwest of y)
- Region y is B of region z (meaning y is inside the bounding box of z)

We want to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Since y is inside the bounding box of z, z can extend beyond y in any direction (north, south, east, west). This means z can potentially encompass parts of space that x occupies, or z can be completely separate from x.

Let's consider a few scenarios:

1. z is exactly the same as y. In this case, since x is NW of y, x would also be NW of z.

2. z extends beyond y to the north but not to the west. Since x is to the northwest of y, x would still be to the west of z, but might not be entirely to the north of z (depending on how far north z extends). If z extends so far north that it encompasses x, then x would be W of z. Otherwise, x would still be NW of z.

3. z extends beyond y to the west but not to the north. Since x is to the northwest of y, x would still be to the north of z, but might not be entirely to the west of z (depending on how far west z extends). If z extends so far west that it encompasses x, then x would be N of z. Otherwise, x would still be NW of z.

4. z extends beyond y both to the north and to the west. If z extends so far that it encompasses x, then x would be B of z. If z extends to the west of x but not to the north of x, then x would be N of z. If z extends to the north of x but not to the west of x, then x would be W of z. If z doesn't extend to the north or west enough to encompass x, then x would still be NW of z.

Actually, I believe I might be overthinking this. Let's just analyze if each of the 9 relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is consistent with our given constraints.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is B of region z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's check each potential relation between x and z:

1. x NW z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From our constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z), which doesn't guarantee supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x NW z is possible only if infx(z) = infx(y) or if we have additional constraints.
   - Similarly, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means supy(z) ≥ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which doesn't guarantee supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NW z is possible only if supy(z) = supy(y) or if we have additional constraints.
   - Overall, x NW z is possible under certain conditions.

2. x N z:
   - Requires: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The same reasoning as above applies for supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We don't have direct constraints for infx(z) relative to infx(x) or supx(x) relative to supx(z) from our given information.
   - Overall, x N z is possible under certain conditions.

3. x NE z:
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - The same reasoning as above applies for supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We don't have direct constraints for supx(z) relative to infx(x) from our given information.
   - Overall, x NE z is possible under certain conditions.

4. x W z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - The same reasoning as above applies for supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - We don't have direct constraints for infy(z) relative to infy(x) or supy(x) relative to supy(z) from our given information.
   - Overall, x W z is possible under certain conditions.

5. x B z:
   - Requires: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We don't have direct constraints for these from our given information.
   - Overall, x B z is possible under certain conditions.

6. x E z:
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We don't have direct constraints for these from our given information.
   - Overall, x E z is possible under certain conditions.

7. x SW z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The same reasoning as above applies for supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - We don't have direct constraints for supy(x) relative to infy(z) from our given information.
   - Overall, x SW z is possible under certain conditions.

8. x S z:
   - Requires: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - We don't have direct constraints for these from our given information.
   - Overall, x S z is possible under certain conditions.

9. x SE z:
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We don't have direct constraints for these from our given information.
   - Overall, x SE z is possible under certain conditions.

So, based on our current reasoning, it seems that all nine relations between x and z are possible under certain conditions.

Actually, let me double check. I think I'm not fully leveraging all the constraints.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is B of region z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's check each potential relation between x and z again but more carefully:

1. x NW z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). 
   From the constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which would partially satisfy the conditions for x NW z. Similarly, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would fully satisfy the conditions for x NW z. So, x NW z is possible if infx(z) = infx(y) and supy(z) = supy(y). This is a specific case, but it's possible.

Actually, I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let's approach it differently:

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y: x is to the northwest of y.
- Region y is B of region z: y is inside the bounding box of z.

This means x is to the northwest of y, and y is inside the bounding box of z.

Now, think about the possible positions of z relative to x:

1. If z is exactly the same as y, then x would be NW of z.
2. If z extends beyond y towards the north, but not too far, then x could still be NW of z.
3. If z extends beyond y towards the west, but not too far, then x could still be NW of z.
4. If z extends beyond y towards both the north and the west, but not too far, then x could still be NW of z.
5. If z extends so far to the west that it encompasses x or goes beyond x, then x would be N of z.
6. If z extends so far to the north that it encompasses x or goes beyond x, then x would be W of z.
7. If z extends so much in all directions that it encompasses x, then x would be B of z.
8. If z extends so far to the west and north that it goes beyond x, and also extends to the east of x, then x would be N of z.
9. If z extends so far to the north and west that it goes beyond x, and also extends to the south of x, then x would be W of z.

From these scenarios, it seems the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B.

But let me try once more by considering the boundary conditions more carefully.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is B of region z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's analyze each cardinal direction relation:

1. x NW z: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - From our constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z), which doesn't guarantee supx(x) ≤ infx(z). However, if infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - We also have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which doesn't guarantee supy(z) ≤ infy(x). However, if supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, for x to be NW of z, we would need both infx(z) = infx(y) and supy(z) = supy(y). This is a very specific case where z's western boundary aligns with y's western boundary and z's northern boundary aligns with y's northern boundary. While it's a specific case, it's possible.

Let's consider a more general approach. Since y is B of z (inside the bounding box of z), z can extend in any direction beyond y. Let's think of the possible positions of z and see which cardinal direction relations are consistent:

1. If z extends beyond y to the west, it could potentially encompass x or extend to the west of x, making x N or NE or E or SE or S or B of z. But since x is NW of y, x cannot be E, SE, or S of z. So, the possibilities are N, NE, and B.

2. If z extends beyond y to the north, it could potentially encompass x or extend to the north of x, making x W or SW or S or SE or E or B of z. But since x is NW of y, x cannot be SW, S, SE, or E of z. So, the possibilities are W and B.

3. If z extends beyond y to both the west and the north, it could potentially encompass x, making x B of z.

4. If z doesn't extend too far beyond y (so it doesn't reach or encompass x), then x would be NW of z.

Hmm, this is still a bit convoluted. Let me try a different approach.

Let's think about the space divided by the lines passing through the boundaries of y. If we extend the west, east, north, and south boundaries of y, we divide the space into 9 regions. Since x is NW of y, it lies in the region to the northwest of y.

Since y is B of z, the boundaries of z can be anywhere beyond the boundaries of y. This means the west boundary of z can be at most at the west boundary of y, the east boundary of z must be at least at the east boundary of y, the south boundary of z can be at most at the south boundary of y, and the north boundary of z must be at least at the north boundary of y.

Consider these possibilities:

1. z coincides exactly with y. This means x is NW of z.
2. z extends beyond y to the west, but not to the north. If z extends so far west that it overlaps with x, then x would be N of z. Otherwise, x is still NW of z.
3. z extends beyond y to the north, but not to the west. If z extends so far north that it overlaps with x, then x would be W of z. Otherwise, x is still NW of z.
4. z extends beyond y to both the west and the north. If z extends so far that it encompasses x, then x would be B of z.

Based on these scenarios, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B.

Actually, let me make sure that each of these possibilities is actually achievable:

1. x NW z:
   - This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - If infx(z) = infx(y) and supy(z) = supy(y), then from our original constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = infx(z) and supy(z) = supy(y) ≤ infy(x). So, x NW z is possible.

2. x N z:
   - This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - If infx(z) < infx(x) (meaning z extends to the west of x), supy(z) = supy(y), and supx(z) ≥ supx(x), then from our original constraints, supy(z) = supy(y) ≤ infy(x). This means x N z is possible if z extends to the west of x.

3. x W z:
   - This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - If infx(z) = infx(y), infy(z) < infy(x) (meaning z extends to the north of x), and supy(z) ≥ supy(x), then from our original constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = infx(z). This means x W z is possible if z extends to the north of x.

4. x B z:
   - This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - If z extends so much that it encompasses x, these conditions would be satisfied. This is possible if z extends both to the west of x and to the north of x.

Wait a minute, I need to consider the fact that regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means they need to be connected regions. This might restrict some of my reasoning.

In our case, we have:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is B of region z

Given the constraint that regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, my previous reasoning still holds. If y is B of z, it means y is contained entirely within z. And if x is NW of y, then x is to the northwest of y.

The possible positions of z relative to x are still:

1. z doesn't extend beyond y to the west or north (or doesn't extend far enough to overlap with x). In this case, x would be NW of z.
2. z extends beyond y to the west, but not to the north (or extends to the north but not far enough to overlap with x). If z extends so far west that it overlaps with x, then x would be N of z. Otherwise, x is still NW of z.
3. z extends beyond y to the north, but not to the west (or extends to the west but not far enough to overlap with x). If z extends so far north that it overlaps with x, then x would be W of z. Otherwise, x is still NW of z.
4. z extends beyond y to both the west and the north. If z extends so far that it encompasses x, then x would be B of z.

And as I verified, all of these relations (NW, N, W, B) are achievable under certain conditions. So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B.

But wait - let's double check this with the actual definition of the relations, making sure that I haven't misunderstood anything.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y, which means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is B of region z, which means: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's check each of the possible relations between x and z:

1. x NW z: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From our constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≥ infx(z). If infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but if infx(z) < infx(y), then we can't guarantee supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - Similarly, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means infy(x) ≥ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but if supy(z) > supy(y), then we can't guarantee supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, for x to be NW of z, we need the west boundary of z to align with the west boundary of y and the north boundary of z to align with the north boundary of y. This is a specific case, but it's possible.

2. x N z: Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - For the first condition, as above, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible if supy(z) = supy(y).
   - For the second condition, we have no direct constraint for infx(z) relative to infx(x) from our given information. But since x is NW of y, we know infx(x) < infx(y). So, if infx(z) < infx(x), then infx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, we have no direct constraint for supx(x) relative to supx(z) from our given information. But since x is NW of y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) (the middle inequality is because y is a region, not a point). And from y B z, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So, supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - So, x N z is possible if supy(z) = supy(y) and infx(z) < infx(x).

Actually, I realize that I'm still making a mistake. Let's be even more careful and precise. The constraints I have are:
- Region x is NW of region y, which means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is B of region z, which means: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, I'll check each possible relation between x and z:

1. x NW z: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From our constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means we can't guarantee supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for all possible configurations.
   - Similarly, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means we can't guarantee supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for all possible configurations.
   - However, if infx(z) = infx(y) and supy(z) = supy(y), then both conditions would be satisfied. So, x NW z is possible.

2. x N z: Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - For the first condition, as above, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible if supy(z) = supy(y).
   - For the second condition, if infx(z) is sufficiently small (i.e., if z extends far enough to the west), then infx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is always satisfied for all regions.
   - So, x N z is possible if supy(z) = supy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

3. x W z: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - For the first condition, as above, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible if infx(z) = infx(y).
   - For the second condition, if infy(z) is sufficiently small (i.e., if z extends far enough to the north), then infy(z) ≤ infy(x) would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, we can derive from x NW y that supy(x) < supy(y) (since regions in REG have connected boundaries). And from y B z, we have supy(y) ≤ supy(z). So, supy(x) < supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is always satisfied for all regions.
   - So, x W z is possible if infx(z) = infx(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

4. x B z: Requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - For the first and third conditions, if z extends sufficiently in both the west and north directions, then infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) would be satisfied.
   - For the second and fourth conditions, as we've seen above, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) are always satisfied for all  regions.
   - So, x B z is possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Let's now check if x can be E, SE, S, SW, or NE of z:

5. x NE z: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - For the first condition, we have infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(z), which doesn't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x). In fact, based on these constraints, it seems like supx(z) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x), which would contradict supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Given that the first condition can't be guaranteed to be satisfied, x NE z doesn't seem like a valid relation for all possible configurations.

Actually, wait. Let's really think through this. I think the confusion is arising because I'm considering constraints of regions with connected boundaries. Let's be careful.

1. x NW z:
   - Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - From the given constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which would satisfy the first condition.
   - Similarly, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would satisfy the second condition.
   - So, for x to be NW of z, we need the west boundary of z to align with the west boundary of y and the north boundary of z to align with the north boundary of y.

2. x N z:
   - Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - For the first condition, as above, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible if supy(z) = supy(y).
   - For the second condition, we have no direct constraint for infx(z) relative to infx(x) from our given information. But if infx(z) < infx(x), then this condition would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y) and infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y B z and the fact that y is a connected region). This gives us supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - So, x N z is possible if supy(z) = supy(y) and infx(z) < infx(x).

3. x W z:
   - Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - For the first condition, as above, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible if infx(z) = infx(y).
   - For the second condition, we have no direct constraint for infy(z) relative to infy(x) from our given information. But if infy(z) < infy(x), then this condition would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, since x is NW of y, we know x is above y, which means the y-coordinate of any point in x is greater than the y-coordinate of some point in y. This doesn't give us a direct constraint for supy(x) relative to supy(y). However, if we assume that x and y don't have regions that are strictly to the east or west of each other (which is true for convex regions), then we can say supy(x) < supy(y).

Actually, I realize that is a wrong assumption. Let's just focus on the constraints we're given. We know:
- Region x is NW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- Region y is B of region z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Are there any constraints we can derive about supy(x) relative to supy(y)? Not directly. But we can prove it from the definitions in the cardinal direction logic:

x NW y means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

Since x is to the west of y, all points in x are to the west of all points in y.
Since x is to the north of y, all points in x are to the north of all points in y.

From these, we can say that x and y are in separate (disjoint) regions of the plane.

Actually, wait. Let me make sure that the definition of "x NW y" does indeed mean that x and y are disjoint.

- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) means the maximum x-coordinate of region x is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of region y. This ensures that all points in x are to the west of all points in y.
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) means the maximum y-coordinate of region y is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of region x. This ensures that all points in y are to the south of all points in x.

If both conditions are true, it means x is entirely to the northwest of y, with no overlap. Hence, x and y are disjoint.

Now, with this understanding, let's derive more constraints:

From x NW y, we can say:
- supx(x) < supx(y) (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y))
- infy(x) > infy(y) (since infy(x) ≥ supy(y) > infy(y))

Also, we can deduce:
- infx(x) < infx(y) (since x is entirely to the west of y)
- supy(x) > supy(y) (since x is entirely to the north of y)

With these additional constraints, let's revisit the possible relations between x and z:

1. x NW z: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - From the original constraints plus the derived ones, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - Similarly, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, x NW z is possible if infx(z) = infx(y) and supy(z) = supy(y).

2. x N z: Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - For the first condition, as above, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible if supy(z) = supy(y).
   - For the second condition, if infx(z) < infx(x), then this condition would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, we have supx(x) < supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So, supx(x) < supx(z), which means the third condition is always satisfied.
   - So, x N z is possible if supy(z) = supy(y) and infx(z) < infx(x).

3. x W z: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - For the first condition, as above, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible if infx(z) = infx(y).
   - For the second condition, if infy(z) < infy(x), then this condition would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, we have supy(x) > supy(y) ≤ supy(z). So, we can't guarantee supy(x) ≤ supy(z). But if we have supy(z) > supy(x), then the third condition would be satisfied.
   - So, x W z is possible under specific conditions.

Wait again. I'm making mistakes about the derived constraints. Let me reconsider.

From x NW y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (all of x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (all of y is to the south of x)

Now, I need to be sure to understand what I can derive from these constraints.

Given that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ supx(y) (because y is connected), we can say supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
Given that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(x) ≤ supy(x) (because x is connected), we can say supy(y) ≤ supy(x).

Now, let's revisit the possible relations between x and z:

Actually, let's try to work from scratch and see.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is B of region z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's check each of the 9 possible relations between x and z, considering the above constraints:

1. x B z:
   - Requires: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - Similarly, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), but this doesn't guarantee supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - For the conditions infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x), we'd need z to extend in the northwest direction beyond x.
   - So, x B z is possible if z extends far enough in the northwest direction to encompass x, and we have supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

2. x S z:
   - Requires: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - From our constraints, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y). If infy(z) = infy(y), then we have infy(z) = infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which would contradict supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - So, it seems x S z is not possible.

Actually, there's a flaw in my reasoning. The inequality supy(y) < infy(x) does not mean infy(y) < supy(y) < infy(x), because I'm not provided with a constraint between infy(y) and supy(y). I've been assuming all regions have non-zero dimensions, so infy(y) < supy(y), but now I realize I need to be more careful.

From our given constraints:
- Region x is NW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is B of region z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's stop assuming that regions have specific shapes or non-zero dimensions. I know they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, but this still allows for various shapes and sizes.

Given the constraints, I'm going to check each possible relation between x and z to see which are compatible with the given constraints.

1. x NW z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From our constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). If infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - We also have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, x NW z is possible if infx(z) = infx(y) and supy(z) = supy(y).

2. x N z:
   - Requires: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - For the first condition, as above, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible if supy(z) = supy(y).
   - For the second condition, if infx(z) is small enough (i.e., if z extends far enough to the west), then infx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is always satisfied.
   - So, x N z is possible if supy(z) = supy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

3. x NE z:
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - For the first condition, we have supx(z) ≥ supx(y) ≥ infx(y) ≥ supx(x), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for all configurations.
   - Given this contradiction, x NE z is not a possible relation.

4. x W z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - For the first condition, as above, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible if infx(z) = infx(y).
   - For the second condition, if infy(z) is small enough (i.e., if z extends far enough to the north), then infy(z) ≤ infy(x) would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, there's no direct constraint relating supy(x) to supy(z) from our given information. If z extends far enough upwards such that supy(z) ≥ supy(x), then this condition would be satisfied.
   - So, x W z is possible under specific conditions.

5. x B z:
   - Requires: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our constraints, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is always satisfied. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x B z would be satisfied.
   - So, x B z is possible if z extends in the northwest direction to encompass x.

6. x E z:
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - For the first condition, as above, we have a contradiction with our given constraints. So, x E z is not a possible relation.

7. x SW z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - For the first condition, as above, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is possible if infx(z) = infx(y).
   - For the second condition, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x). If infy(z) = infy(y), then infy(z) = infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which would contradict supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - Given this contradiction, x SW z is not a possible relation.

8. x S z:
   - Requires: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - For the first condition, if infy(z) is large enough (i.e., if z is high enough above the x-axis), then supy(x) ≤ infy(z) would be satisfied.
   - For the second condition, if infx(z) is small enough (i.e., if z extends far enough to the west), then infx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be satisfied.
   - For the third condition, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is always satisfied from our given constraints.
   - So, x S z is possible under specific conditions.

Hmm, let's analyze the "x S z" relation more carefully:

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is not to the west of z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x is not to the east of z)

Given that x is NW of y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means y is to the south of x. And since y is B of z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y). This means infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which implies infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But given the constraints, we can't guarantee this relationships. So I can't conclusively say that x S z is a possible relation.

I also made errors with the "x SW z" relation. I'm going to analyze each relation more carefully.

Actually, I'm going to approach this systematically. 

Since x is NW of y, x and y are disjoint, with x being to the northwest of y. And since y is B of z, y is completely contained within z.

Given the positions, let's check which of the 9 relations are possible for x and z:

1. x NW z: This is possible if z's boundaries on the west and north coincide with y's. If z extends beyond y in the west or north direction, then x might not be NW of z. But if z matches y's boundaries on the west and north, then x remains NW of z.

2. x N z: This is possible if z extends to the west of y, but its northern boundary coincides with y's. If z extends so far west that it overlaps (or extends beyond) x, then x would be N of z.

3. x NE z: For x to be NE of z, z must be to the southwest of x. But given the constraints, z has y inside it, and y is to the southeast of x. For z to be to the southwest of x, it would have to be to the west of y, which contradicts the constraint that y is inside z. So, x NE z is not possible.

4. x W z: This is possible if z extends to the north of y, but its western boundary coincides with y's. If z extends so far north that it overlaps (or extends beyond) x, then x would be W of z.

5. x B z: This is possible if z extends both to the west and north of y, such that x is inside z.

6. x E z: Similar to the reasoning for x NE z, given the constraints, x cannot be to the east of z. So, x E z is not possible.

7. x SW z: For x to be SW of z, z must be to the northeast of x. But given the constraints, z has y inside it, and y is to the southeast of x. For z to be to the northeast of x, it would have to be to the north of y, which contradicts the constraint that y is inside z. So, x SW z is not possible.

8. x S z: For x to be S of z, z must be to the north of x. But given the constraints, z has y inside it, and y is to the southeast of x. For z to be to the north of x, it would have to extend significantly to the north such that it's completely to the north of x, which contradicts the constraint that y is inside z and y is to the southeast of x. So, x S z is not possible.

9. x SE z: Similar to the reasoning for x E z and x S z, given the constraints, x cannot be to the southeast of z. So, x SE z is not possible.

Alright, based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B.

Actually, let me double-check x S z. Given that y is inside z and y is to the southeast of x, it's hard to imagine a configuration where x is to the south of z. But let's try to sketch it:

Assume x is to the left and above y. If z extends so far to the north that it's completely above x, and also to the west such that it covers the region above x, then x could be S of z.

Hmm but let's check the constraints more explicitly. For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z extends at least as far west as x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as x)

Given that y is B of z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y). And given that x is NW of y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which implies supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x). If we combine these, we get infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x). This would mean infy(z) ≤ supy(x), which contradicts the requirement for x S z, which is supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

So it seems like x S z is not a valid relation.

Alright, so based on the constraints and our analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, W, and B.

Actually, let's really double check with the definitions of the relations to make sure, using the given constraints:

From: 
- Region x is NW of region y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is B of region z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

1. x NW z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We have: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which doesn't guarantee supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But if infx(z) = infx(y), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - We also have: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which doesn't guarantee supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But if supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, x NW z is possible under the specific condition that infx(z) = infx(y) and supy(z) = supy(y).

2. x N z:
   - Requires: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - Again, if supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - There's no direct constraint for infx(z) relative to infx(x). If z extends far enough to the west such that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), then this condition would be satisfied.
   - We have: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - So,
