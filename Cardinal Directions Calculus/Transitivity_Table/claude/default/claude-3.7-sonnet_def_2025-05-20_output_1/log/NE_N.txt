PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step to determine the possible cardinal directions between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y.
- Region y is N of region z.

I need to find all possible relations between region x and region z. Let's analyze the constraints on the positions:

1. x is NE of y means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y is N of z means:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

Now, let's determine where x can be relative to z:

For the y-coordinate:
- We know supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is N of z)
- And supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is NE of y)
- Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
- This means supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies x is always north of z

For the x-coordinate:
- We know supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is NE of y)
- We also know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y is N of z)

Let's look at the possible cases:

1. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is to the east of z, meaning x is NE of z.

2. If infx(x) <= supx(z), we need to check where infx(x) is relative to infx(z):
   - If infx(z) <= infx(x), then x's x-projection overlaps with z's x-projection
   - If infx(x) < infx(z), then x is partially to the west of z, which contradicts our constraints

Actually, let's re-examine case 2 more carefully. We have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is NE of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y is N of z)

This means infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). Therefore, infx(z) <= infx(x).

Now, there are two possibilities:
- If infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z), then x's x-projection overlaps with z's x-projection
- If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is completely to the east of z

Let's categorize the possible cardinal direction relations:

1. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is NE of z (since x is to the east and north of z)

2. If infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is N of z (since x is to the north of z and x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

3. If infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) < supx(x), then x is partially N and partially NE of z.
   But I need to represent this in terms of the defined relations. Since the region must be in exactly one direction, this case would be represented as N:NE.

4. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is NE of z.

Mmm, I think I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me redo this more carefully.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's determine the y-coordinate relationship:
- From y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y)
- From x is NE of y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This confirms that x is north of z (in terms of y-coordinate)

Now, let's determine the x-coordinate relationship:
- From x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y is N of z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x)

Therefore, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).

Now, we need to determine where supx(x) is relative to z:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) (by definition of a region)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y is N of z)

But we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z).

Let's examine the possible cases:

1. If supx(x) <= supx(z), then infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   This would mean x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection, making x N of z.

2. If supx(z) < supx(x), then infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x)
   This would mean x's x-projection partially overlaps with z's x-projection, with x extending further to the east.
   In this case, x would be partially N and partially NE of z, which would be represented as N:NE.

3. If infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) < supx(x), that would make x partially NW, N, and NE of z.
   But this contradicts our constraint that supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which together imply infx(z) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
   So, this case is impossible.

4. If infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z), that would make x partially NW and N of z.
   But again, this contradicts our constraints, so it's impossible.

So, in summary, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (if supx(x) <= supx(z))
- N:NE (if supx(z) < supx(x))

Wait, I need to be more precise and consider all possible arrangements. Let's approach this differently.

Let's reason through the constraints and determine all possible positions:

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For the y-coordinate:
- From the two relations, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is north of z

For the x-coordinate, let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

Case 1: x is NE of z
- This means supx(z) <= infx(x)
- We know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from our constraints)
- Therefore, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- For this to be NE, we also need supx(z) <= infx(x), which is consistent with our derived constraint.
- So, x can be NE of z.

Case 2: x is N of z
- This means infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
- We know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from our constraints)
- For this to be N, we need supx(x) <= supx(z), which doesn't contradict our derived constraints.
- So, x can be N of z.

Case 3: x is NW of z
- This means supx(x) <= infx(z)
- We know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from our constraints)
- Therefore, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- But for NW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the above.
- So, x cannot be NW of z.

Case 4: x overlaps with multiple regions (like N:NE)
- For x to be partially N and partially NE of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x)
- We know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from our constraints)
- For this overlap, we need supx(z) < supx(x), which doesn't contradict our derived constraints.
- So, x can be N:NE of z.

Case 5: x is NW:N of z
- For x to be partially NW and partially N of z, we need supx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(x) < infx(z)
- But we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from our constraints)
- Therefore, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement for NW:N.
- So, x cannot be NW:N of z.

Case 6: x is NW:N:NE of z
- For x to span all three northern regions, we need infx(x) < infx(z) and supx(z) < supx(x)
- But, as in Case 5, our derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the requirement for NW.
- So, x cannot be NW:N:NE of z.

Wait, I think I got confused here. Let me re-evaluate.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's derive the constraints on x relative to z:

For the y-coordinate:
- From the two relations, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is north of z

For the x-coordinate:
- From x is NE of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y is N of z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- Combining these, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- Which simplifies to infx(z) <= infx(x)

Now, let's determine the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z:

1. N: This means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - For N, we also need supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - This doesn't contradict our constraints, so x can be N of z.

2. NE: This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - For NE, we need supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - From our derived constraints, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - This doesn't guarantee supx(z) <= infx(x), but it doesn't contradict it either.
   - So, x can be NE of z.

3. NW: This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - For NW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - But from our derived constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For a valid region, infx(x) <= supx(x), which gives us infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
   - This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for NW.
   - So, x cannot be NW of z.

4. N:NE: This means x spans both the N and NE regions relative to z.
   - For this, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(z) < supx(x), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - The condition supx(z) < supx(x) doesn't contradict our constraints.
   - So, x can be N:NE of z.

5. NW:N: This means x spans both the NW and N regions relative to z.
   - For this, we need infx(x) < infx(z), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - But from our derived constraints, we also have infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - This contradicts the requirement infx(x) < infx(z) for NW:N.
   - So, x cannot be NW:N of z.

6. NW:N:NE: This means x spans all three northern regions relative to z.
   - For this, we need infx(x) < infx(z), supx(z) < supx(x), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - But from our derived constraints, we also have infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - This contradicts the requirement infx(x) < infx(z) for this multi-tile relation.
   - So, x cannot be NW:N:NE of z.

7. E: This means supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For E, we need supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - But from our derived constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For a valid region, infy(x) <= supy(x), which gives us supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
   - This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= supy(z) for E.
   - So, x cannot be E of z.

8. SE: This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - For SE, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - But from our derived constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For a valid region, infy(z) <= supy(z) (z is a valid region) and infy(x) <= supy(x) (x is a valid region).
   - This gives us infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
   - This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for SE.
   - So, x cannot be SE of z.

9. S: Similar to the reasoning for SE, x cannot be S of z.

10. SW: Similar to the reasoning for SE, x cannot be SW of z.

11. W: This means supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    - For W, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
    - But from our derived constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x).
    - For a valid region, infx(x) <= supx(x), which gives us infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
    - This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for W.
    - So, x cannot be W of z.

12. B: This means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    - For B, we need supy(x) <= supy(z).
    - But from our derived constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(x).
    - For a valid region, infy(x) <= supy(x), which gives us supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
    - This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= supy(z) for B.
    - So, x cannot be B of z.

Based on this analysis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. N
2. NE
3. N:NE

I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me focus specifically on the multi-tile relation N:NE.
Let me re-evaluate the constraints for this relation.

For x to be N:NE of z, we need:
- x to be partially in the north tile and partially in the northeast tile of z.
- This means one part of x has its x-projection contained within z's x-projection (the N part), and another part of x is to the east of z (the NE part).

Specifically, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x starts within or to the right of z's left bound)
- supx(z) < supx(x) (x extends beyond z's right bound)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of z)

From our derived constraints, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (from our derivation)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (from our derivation)

The only remaining condition is supx(z) < supx(x), which doesn't contradict our derived constraints. So, x can be N:NE of z.

I've reassessed, and the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. N (if supx(x) <= supx(z))
2. NE (if supx(z) <= infx(x))
3. N:NE (if infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x))

Wait, now I realize there are actually more possible combinations. Let me reevaluate more carefully.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, we derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z in terms of y-coordinate)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary or at the same position)

Now, here's what we know for sure:
- x is somewhere to the north of z (based on the y-coordinate constraint).
- x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary or at the same position.

This means x could be in any of the northern tiles (NW, N, NE) or combinations of them, as long as it doesn't contradict our derived constraints.

Let's reassess each possibility:

1. N: This means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - For this to be N, we also need supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - This doesn't contradict our derived constraints.
   - So, x can be N of z.

2. NE: This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - For this to be NE, we need supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - This doesn't necessarily follow from our derived constraints, but it doesn't contradict them either.
   - So, x can be NE of z.

3. NW: This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - For this to be NW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - But from our derived constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For a valid region, infx(x) <= supx(x), which gives us infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
   - This means infx(z) <= supx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for NW.
   - So, x cannot be NW of z.

4. N:NE: This means x spans both the N and NE regions relative to z.
   - For this, x needs to be partially contained within z's x-projection and partially to the east of z.
   - Specifically, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - The condition supx(z) < supx(x) doesn't contradict our constraints.
   - So, x can be N:NE of z.

5. NW:N: This means x spans both the NW and N regions relative to z.
   - For this, x needs to be partially to the west of z and partially contained within z's x-projection.
   - Specifically, we need infx(x) < infx(z), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We have supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derived constraints.
   - But we also have infx(z) <= infx(x) from our derived constraints.
   - This contradicts the requirement infx(x) < infx(z) for NW:N.
   - So, x cannot be NW:N of z.

Based on our derived constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. N (if supx(x) <= supx(z))
2. NE (if supx(z) <= infx(x))
3. N:NE (if infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x))

But wait, I'm a bit confused about relation 3. Is N:NE a valid cardinal direction relation as defined? Let's revisit the definition:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

So, a cardinal direction relation like N:NE means that the region a is the union of two separate regions, one in N(b) and one in NE(b), and this union is also a valid region (belongs to REG).

Let me re-check if N:NE is a valid possibility. For N:NE to be a valid cardinal direction relation, we need to find regions a1 in N(z) and a2 in NE(z) such that a1 union a2 forms a valid region x.

From our derived constraints, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary or at the same position)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z in terms of y-coordinate)

For x to be N:NE of z, we need:
- A part of x (let's call it a1) to be in N(z), which means infx(z) <= infx(a1) <= supx(a1) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(a1).
- Another part of x (let's call it a2) to be in NE(z), which means supx(z) <= infx(a2) and supy(z) <= infy(a2).
- a1 union a2 = x, and x is a valid region.

For a1 union a2 to be a valid region, it should be connected. Since both a1 and a2 are north of z, they can potentially be adjacent to each other. But I realize now that I need to be very careful about what it means for a:b to be a valid cardinal direction relation.

Actually, let me reconsider the definition. The definition states that for a cardinal direction relation R1: ... : Rk, there are regions a1, ..., ak, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

This means that for a multi-tile relation like N:NE, we need regions a1 in N(z) and a2 in NE(z) such that a1 union a2 forms a region a, which is in REG.

From our derived constraints, we know that x is north of z and x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary or at the same position. For x to be N:NE of z, we need to show that x can be the union of a region in N(z) and a region in NE(z).

But I need to backtrack here to understand N:NE better

Wait, I think there's actually a simpler way. I know that all regions in the set REG are connected. So, for x to be N:NE of z, it must intersect with both the N and NE tiles, and the intersections must form a connected region. This can happen if x spans from the N tile into the NE tile.

To summarize our findings:

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, we derive:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z in terms of y-coordinate)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary or at the same position)

Based on these derived constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- N (if x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)
- NE (if x is entirely to the east of z)
- N:NE (if x partially overlaps with z's x-projection and partially extends to the east of z)

I'm trying to restate the criteria for each of the relations between x and z:

For N:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

For NE:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

For N:NE:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) < supx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Hmm wait, I'm not sure if N:NE is possible, I need to check if it's a valid multi-tile relation.

Given the definition of a cardinal direction relation, a relation R1: ... : Rk requires the existence of regions a1, ..., ak such that a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b), and the union a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b.

Let's try to better understand the N:NE relation with the new approach I set up. Remember, REG is the set of regions which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. Such regions are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries.

For N:NE to be a valid cardinal direction relation, we need to find regions a1 in N(z) and a2 in NE(z) such that a1 union a2 is in REG. This means a1 union a2 should be connected, which implies that a1 and a2 should be adjacent to each other.

N(z) refers to the region where x-coordinates fall within z's x-projection and y-coordinates are north of z. NE(z) refers to the region where x-coordinates are east of z and y-coordinates are north of z.

These two regions share a common boundary (the vertical line where x = supx(z)), so it's theoretically possible for a region to be partially in N(z) and partially in NE(z) and still be connected.

Therefore, N:NE can be a valid cardinal direction relation.

Alright, in summary, based on the given constraints and the rules of cardinal direction relations, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. N
2. NE
3. N:NE

Let me check once more if I've missed any other valid combinations.

Given the derived constraints:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z in terms of y-coordinate)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary or at the same position)

For a multi-tile relation, we need to consider if x can span across the NW, N, and NE tiles relative to z.

For NW:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
But since infx(z) <= infx(x) and for a valid region, infx(x) <= supx(x), we have infx(z) <= supx(x). This contradicts the requirement for NW (which is supx(x) <= infx(z)). So, x cannot be entirely in NW.

For NW:N:
- infx(x) < infx(z)
- supx(z) <= supx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
But since infx(z) <= infx(x), this contradicts the requirement for NW:N. So, x cannot span across NW and N.

For NW:N:NE:
- infx(x) < infx(z)
- supx(z) < supx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
Again, since infx(z) <= infx(x), this contradicts the requirement for NW:N:NE. So, x cannot span across all three northern tiles.

So, the possible combinations remain the same: N, NE, and N:NE.

Actually, let's backtrack here. The question is really about what cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is N of z. Let me try to visualize the constraints:

1. x is NE of y means:
   - x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x))
   - x is to the north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x))

2. y is N of z means:
   - y is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(y))
   - y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

Given these constraints, where can x be relative to z?

For the y-coordinate, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y is N of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is NE of y)
Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

For the x-coordinate:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is N of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y is N of z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is NE of y)
Therefore, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(x).

Given the derived constraints, x cannot be to the west of z (i.e., in W, NW, or SW). It can only be in N, NE, E, SE, S, or B. But since x is to the north of z, it can only be in N or NE or a combination of these.

Let's check each of the remaining possibilities:

1. N: This means infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Given our derived constraints, this is possible.

2. NE: This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Given our derived constraints, this is possible.

3. N:NE: This means x spans both N(z) and NE(z), which requires infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) < supx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This doesn't contradict our derived constraints, so it's also possible.

Given our constraints and the definition of cardinal direction relations, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. N
2. NE
3. N:NE

But wait, I'm now a bit uncertain about N:NE. Let me check the definition again. A cardinal direction relation R1: ... : Rk requires the existence of regions a1, ..., ak such that a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b), and the union a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b.

For N:NE, we need to find regions a1 in N(z) and a2 in NE(z) such that a1 union a2 is in REG. This means a1 union a2 should be connected, which implies that a1 and a2 should be adjacent to each other.

N(z) refers to the region where x-coordinates fall within z's x-projection and y-coordinates are north of z. NE(z) refers to the region where x-coordinates are east of z and y-coordinates are north of z.

These two regions share a common boundary (the vertical line where x = supx(z)), so it's possible for a region to be partially in N(z) and partially in NE(z) and still be connected.

Ah, let me take a step back and recall the definition of a single-tile cardinal direction:

"a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)."

This means a is to the north of b and a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection.

Given this, the N:NE relation is certainly possible. If x has a part that is to the north of z with its x-projection contained within z's x-projection, and another part that is to the northeast of z (both to the north and east), then x would be in the N:NE relation with z.

Now, let me try to check if I've missed any other valid combinations.

Given the derived constraints:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z in terms of y-coordinate)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary or at the same position)

For a multi-tile relation, we need to consider if x can span across the NW, N, and NE tiles relative to z.

For NW:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
But since infx(z) <= infx(x) and for a valid region, infx(x) <= supx(x), we have infx(z) <= supx(x). This contradicts the requirement for NW (which is supx(x) <= infx(z)). So, x cannot be entirely in NW.

For NW:N:
- We need a part of x to be in NW of z and another part to be in N of z.
- For the NW part, supx(a1) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(a1).
- For the N part, infx(z) <= infx(a2) <= supx(a2) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(a2).
- But if infx(z) <= infx(x), then x cannot have a part that's to the left of z's left boundary. Therefore, x cannot span across NW and N.

Alright, in summary, given that x is NE of y and y is N of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. N
2. NE
3. N:NE

Wait a second! I almost forgot to check the `B` relation for completeness.

For B:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given our derived constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(x). For a valid region, infy(x) <= supy(x), which means supy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= supy(z) for B. Therefore, x cannot be B of z.

Let me also check if there are 2-tile relations involving N that I might have missed:

For N:E:
- The N part requires infx(z) <= infx(a1) <= supx(a1) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(a1).
- The E part requires supx(z) <= infx(a2), infy(z) <= infy(a2) <= supy(a2) <= supy(z).
- For a1 union a2 to be a valid region, a1 and a2
- Given our derived constraints, we have supy(z) <= infy(x).
- For the E part, we need supy(a2) <= supy(z), but since supy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x), we have supy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the requirement for E. So, x cannot span across N and E.

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let me clarify how we reason about multi-tile relations. We need to find regions a1, a2, ..., ak such that a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b), and the union a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b.

So the question is whether there is some suitably chosen region x which is NE of region y, and region y is N of region z, such that x is in the specified relation with z. I've been assuming that x can be any valid region, but for the problem we are considering, we need to check if there exists a region x that fulfills both the given constraints (x is NE of y and y is N of z) and has the specific relation with z.

Wait, let me rethink the problem a bit. The problem is asking for all possible relations between regions x and z, given that:
1. x is NE of y
2. y is N of z

So, we're not trying to determine a specific multi-tile relation; we're listing all possible relations that could exist between x and z.

Let me summarize our findings:

Given the constraints and our derivations:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z in terms of y-coordinate)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary or at the same position)

These derivations constrain where x can be relative to z, but they don't determine a unique relation. Instead, they restrict the possible relations.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. N (if x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)
2. NE (if x is entirely to the east of z)
3. N:NE (if x spans both N(z) and NE(z))

I've checked all other possibilities and found that they contradict our derived constraints. So I'm confident that these are the only possible relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is N of z.

Ok, so N, NE, and N:NE are the possible relations.

Actually, I'm not sure if N:NE is a valid relation based on the problem definition. Let me double-check the definition of multi-tile relations.

The definition states: "A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where ... iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

For N:NE to be a valid cardinal direction relation, we need regions a1 and a2 such that a1 belongs to N(z), a2 belongs to NE(z), and a1 union a2 belongs to REG.

N(z) is defined as the region where infx(z) <= infx(a) <= supx(a) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(a).
NE(z) is defined as the region where supx(z) <= infx(a) and supy(z) <= infy(a).

For a1 union a2 to be in REG, it must be closed, connected, and have a connected boundary.

Given that N(z) and NE(z) share a common boundary (the vertical line x = supx(z), y >= supy(z)), it's possible for a1 and a2 to be chosen such that a1 union a2 is a valid region. So, N:NE is a valid multi-tile relation.

Alright, in summary, given that x is NE of y and y is N of z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. N
2. NE
3. N:NE

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is N of region z

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:

1. x is NE of y means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y is N of z means:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) → Therefore, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) → Therefore, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x starts at or to the right of z's left boundary)

These constraints limit the possible relations between x and z to:

1. N: When infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
2. NE: When supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
3. N:NE: When infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) < supx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, N:NE
