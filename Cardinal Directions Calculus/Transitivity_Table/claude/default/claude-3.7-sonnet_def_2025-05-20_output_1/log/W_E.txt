PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1) Region x is W of region y:
   This means: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

2) Region y is E of region z:
   This means: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's think about the relative positions on the x-axis:

Given:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)

This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z), or between supx(z) and infx(x), which means x and z could have various relationships on the x-axis.

Now, let's think about the relative positions on the y-axis:

Given:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From these, we can derive:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means that the y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be:

1. If infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is W of z.

2. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and also considering the y-relationships we derived, it seems x is within the bounding box of z but to the west of z. This could correspond to W or B relations, depending on the exact positions.

3. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is E of z. But this seems unlikely given that both x and z are to the west and east of y, respectively.

4. If there's overlap in the x-extents of x and z, the relation becomes more complex and could involve multiple tiles like NW, W, SW.

Let's consider each of the 9 possible single-tile relations:

B (bounding box):
For x B z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We already established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The x-axis conditions need to be checked.

S (South):
For x S z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
But we've established that infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z), so x cannot be S of z.

SW (South West):
For x SW z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But again, infy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z), so x cannot be SW of z.

W (West):
For x W z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We already have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is indeed W of z.

NW (North West):
For x NW z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
But we've established that supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x), so x cannot be NW of z.

N (North):
For x N z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
But similarly, supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x), so x cannot be N of z.

NE (North East):
For x NE z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
But again, supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x), so x cannot be NE of z.

E (East):
For x E z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We already have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But given that x is W of y and y is E of z, it seems unlikely (but not impossible) that x is E of z. Let's keep this as a possibility for now.

SE (South East):
For x SE z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But infy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z), so x cannot be SE of z.

Wait, I think I may have been making an error. Let me make sure I've correctly understood the constraints based on the given relations:

1) Region x is W of region y:
   This means: 
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y on the x-axis)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y) (y's y-extent contains x's y-extent)

2) Region y is E of region z:
   This means: 
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z on the x-axis)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's y-extent contains y's y-extent)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y) (both x and z are to the west of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), which means infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z)

However, these constraints don't directly compare infx(x) with infx(z), supx(x) with supx(z), supy(x) with infy(z), or infy(x) with supy(z).

So, let's systematically go through the 9 possible single-tile relations again:

B (bounding box):
For x B z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x B z is possible.

S (South):
For x S z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
But we've established that infy(z) <= infy(x), which along with the definition of a region means infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is not possible.

SW (South West):
For x SW z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But again, infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

W (West):
For x W z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We already have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x W z is possible.

NW (North West):
For x NW z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We've established that supy(x) <= supy(z), which means that infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

N (North):
For x N z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
But similarly to the NW case, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x N z is not possible.

NE (North East):
For x NE z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
Again, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

E (East):
For x E z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We already have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x E z is possible.

SE (South East):
For x SE z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SE z is not possible.

So, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are:
1. B (if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z))
2. W (if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z))
3. E (if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z))

Hmm, me getting that x E z as possible doesn't sound right, since we know x is W of y and y is E of z. So x should be west of z, not east. Let me check my logic...

Oh, I didn't consider the transitivity properly. If x is W of y, and y is E of z, then y is between x and z on the x-axis. So, x is W of z.

Let's be more explicit:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)

But this doesn't necessarily mean supx(x) <= infx(z), which would be needed for x W z.

I think I need to draw this out:

```
   x          y           z
   |----------|           |----------
   |          |           |
   |          |           |
   |----------|           |----------
```

This is a valid configuration where x W y and y E z, but x is not W of z; they are on the same side of y. But this would mean y is both E of z and W of x at the same time, which is odd.

Let's try again.

```
   x           z           y
   |----------|           |----------
   |          |           |
   |          |           |
   |----------|           |----------
```

This is another valid configuration where x W y and y E z, but x is not W of z; they are on opposite sides of y.

Wait, this is not right. I need to be more careful with the definitions. 

Let's visualize possible configurations where x W y and y E z:

Case 1:
```
   x            y            z
   |----------|  |----------|
   |          |  |          |
   |          |  |          |
   |----------|  |----------|
```
Here, supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). In this case, both x and z are to the west of y. They are on the same side of y, so their relation depends on their exact positions.

Case 2:
```
   x            z            y
   |----------|  |----------|
   |          |  |          |
   |          |  |          |
   |----------|  |----------|
```
Here, supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y). In this case, both x and z are to the west of y. They are on the same side of y, so their relation depends on their exact positions.

Hmm, this is starting to seem more complex than I initially thought. 

Actually, rereading the definitions, I think I've been misinterpreting them. Let's get back to the definitions:

For a W b, we have:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the west of b on the x-axis)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a's y-extent is contained within b's y-extent)

For a E b, we have:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) (a is to the east of b on the x-axis)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a's y-extent is contained within b's y-extent)

Given x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-extent is contained within y's y-extent)

Given y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-extent is contained within z's y-extent)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From the above, we can derive:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, for the relationship between x and z, the y-extents are partially constrained: x's y-extent is contained within z's y-extent.

For the x-axis, both x and z are to the west of y. This means they can be to the west of each other, or east of each other, or one can be within the bounding box of the other, etc.

Let's go through each possible relation:

B (bounding box):
For x B z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x B z is possible.

S (South):
For x S z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
But we've established that infy(z) <= infy(x), which along with the definition of a region means infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is not possible.

SW (South West):
For x SW z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

W (West):
For x W z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We already have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x W z is possible.

NW (North West):
For x NW z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
But we've established that supy(x) <= supy(z). Since x is a region, we know infy(x) <= supy(x). Thus, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

N (North):
For x N z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
Similarly to the NW case, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x N z is not possible.

NE (North East):
For x NE z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
Again, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

E (East):
For x E z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We already have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x E z is possible.

SE (South East):
For x SE z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SE z is not possible.

So, based on this analysis, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are:
1. B (bounding box) - if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
2. W (West) - if supx(x) <= infx(z)
3. E (East) - if supx(z) <= infx(x)

Let's quickly double-check these visually:

For x B z:
```
        z
    +--------+
    |        |
    |   x    |
    |   |--| |
    |   |--| |
    +--------+
```
For x W z:
```
    x        z
    |--|   +--------+
    |--|   |        |
          |        |
          +--------+
```
For x E z:
```
          z        x
    +--------+   |--|
    |        |   |--|
    |        |
    +--------+
```

Actually, wait a second. I realized there's a mistake in how I'm applying the constraints. If y E z, it means y is to the east of z. This means infx(y) >= supx(z), not supx(z) <= infx(y) as I mistakenly wrote.

Let's correct this:

Given y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-extent is contained within z's y-extent)

Given x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-extent is contained within y's y-extent)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From the above, we can derive:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

The first two constraints mean that both x and z are to the west of y. Their relative positions with respect to each other on the x-axis are not fixed by the given constraints.

For the y-extents, we've determined that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which means z's y-extent contains (or is equal to) x's y-extent.

Wait, how did I get that "Both x and z are to the west of y"? Let's review the conditions from scratch.

Given x W y:
supx(x) <= infx(y)  (x is to the west of y on the x-axis)

Given y E z:
supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z on the x-axis)

Wait, there's an issue. Let me make sure I'm understanding the definition of E correctly. Our definitions are:

A E B: a entity A is to the east of another entity B.

Specifically, a E b if and only if:
supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, if y E z, then:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z on the x-axis)
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's lower y-bound is below or equal to y's lower y-bound)
3. supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's upper y-bound is below or equal to z's upper y-bound)

Similarly, x W y means:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y on the x-axis)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's lower y-bound is below or equal to x's lower y-bound)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's upper y-bound is below or equal to y's upper y-bound)

I think this is where I was getting confused. Let's visualize this:

For x W y:
```
    x          y
    |--|       |--|
    |  |       |  |
    |--|       |--|
```

For y E z:
```
    z          y
    |--|       |--|
    |  |       |  |
    |--|       |--|
```

So, from the x-axis perspective, z is to the left of y, and x is to the left of y. But this doesn't tell us whether x is to the left or right of z, or if they overlap.

From the y-axis perspective, y's y-extent is contained in x's y-extent, and y's y-extent is contained in z's y-extent. But again, this doesn't tell us the direct relationship between x and z's y-extents.

Actually, I think I misunderstood the definitions again. Let me re-read:

a W b if and only if (supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b))

So, for x W y:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y on the x-axis)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's lower y-bound is below or equal to x's lower y-bound)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's upper y-bound is below or equal to y's upper y-bound)

And a E b if and only if (supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b))

For y E z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z on the x-axis)
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's lower y-bound is below or equal to y's lower y-bound)
3. supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's upper y-bound is below or equal to z's upper y-bound)

Visually:

For x W y:
```
      y
   +------+
   |      |
x  |      |
+--+      |
|         |
+--+      |
   |      |
   +------+
```

For y E z:
```
      y
   +------+
   |      |
   |      |      z
   |      +------+
   |              |
   |      +------+
   |      |
   +------+
```

Given these constraints, what can we infer about the relationship between x and z?

From the x-axis perspective, x is to the west of y, and y is to the east of z. This means:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)

From the y-axis perspective:
1. infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
2. supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
3. infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
4. supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From these y-axis constraints, we can derive:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This indicates that the y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of z.

But the x-axis constraints (supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)) don't provide a direct relationship between x and z on the x-axis. They both are to the west of y, but their relative positions to each other can vary.

Let's go through each possible single-tile relation:

B (bounding box):
For x B z, we would need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supx(x) <= supx(z)
3. infy(z) <= infy(x)
4. supy(x) <= supy(z)

We already have (3) and (4) from our previous derivation. If (1) and (2) also hold, then x B z is possible.

S (South):
For x S z, we would need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z)

But we've established that infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). If infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for any region), then infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is not possible.

SW (South West):
For x SW z, we would need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

As with S, the constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

W (West):
For x W z, we would need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z)

We already have (2) and (3) from our previous derivation. If (1) also holds, then x W z is possible.

NW (North West):
For x NW z, we would need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x)

But we've established that supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). If infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for any region), then infy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

N (North):
For x N z, we would need:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z)

Similar to NW, the constraint supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x N z is not possible.

NE (North East):
For x NE z, we would need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x)

Again, the constraint supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

E (East):
For x E z, we would need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z)

We already have (2) and (3) from our previous derivation. If (1) also holds, then x E z is possible.

SE (South East):
For x SE z, we would need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

The constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SE z is not possible.

So, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are:
1. B (if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), along with the already established infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))
2. W (if supx(x) <= infx(z), along with the already established infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))
3. E (if supx(z) <= infx(x), along with the already established infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))

Hang on. Let's re-visualize this to be sure:

For x W y:
```
   x       y
   |-----|  |-----|
   |     |  |     |
   |     |  |     |
   |-----|  |-----|
```

For y E z:
```
   z        y
   |-----|  |-----|
   |     |  |     |
   |     |  |     |
   |-----|  |-----|
```

Given these, here are the possible relative positions of x and z:

1. x W z: x is to the west of z
```
   x       z
   |-----|  |-----|
   |     |  |     |
   |     |  |     |
   |-----|  |-----|
```

2. x E z: x is to the east of z
```
   z       x
   |-----|  |-----|
   |     |  |     |
   |     |  |     |
   |-----|  |-----|
```

3. x B z: x is within the bounding box of z
```
      z
   +--------+
   |        |
   |   x    |
   |   |--| |
   |   |--| |
   +--------+
```
Actually, there's a potential issue in how I've been interpreting the y-constraints. 

For x W y:
infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This does not mean that the y-extent of x is contained in the y-extent of y. It actually means that the y-extent of y is contained in the y-extent of x.

Similarly, for y E z:
infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means the y-extent of y is contained in the y-extent of z.

But, I think I still derived the correct relationships between x and z. Let me double-check.

From x W y:
1. infy(y) <= infy(x)
2. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y E z:
3. infy(z) <= infy(y)
4. supy(y) <= supy(z)

From (1) and (3), we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means infy(z) <= infy(x).

From (2) and (4), we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means supy(x) <= supy(z).

But now, let's visualize the y-extents:

For x:
```
infy(x)
  |
  v
  |
  |
  |
  v
supy(x)
```

For y:
```
infy(y)
  |
  v
  |
  |
  |
  v
supy(y)
```

For z:
```
infy(z)
  |
  v
  |
  |
  |
  v
supy(z)
```

And we have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This is a bit confusing. If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), it means the y-extent of x is within the y-extent of z.

But if infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y), it means the y-extent of x overlaps with the y-extent of y but is not necessarily contained within it.

Actually I think I've been consistently making an error while interpreting the constraints. Let's reread the original definitions more carefully:

a W b if and only if (supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b))

Let's break this down:
1. supx(a) <= infx(b): This means that the maximum x-coordinate of a is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of b. In other words, a is completely to the west of b on the x-axis.
2. infy(b) <= infy(a): The minimum y-coordinate of b is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of a. This means that a doesn't extend as far down as b.
3. supy(a) <= supy(b): The maximum y-coordinate of a is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of b. This means that a doesn't extend as far up as b.

Together, (2) and (3) mean that the y-extent of a is contained within the y-extent of b.

Again, for a E b, we have:
1. supx(b) <= infx(a): a is completely to the east of b.
2. infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b): The y-extent of a is contained within the y-extent of b.

Ok, given x W y:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y): x is to the west of y.
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): The y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of y.

Given y E z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y): y is to the east of z.
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): The y-extent of y is contained within the y-extent of z.

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

Considering the y-constraints, we can further deduce:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): This means infy(z) <= infy(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z): This means supy(x) <= supy(z).

The meaning is still the same: the y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of z.

Now, on the x-axis, both x and z are to the west of y, but their relative positions to each other are not fixed. They could be to the west of each other, or east of each other, or one could be within the bounding box of the other, etc.

So, let's go through each possible relation again, taking into account the y-constraint that the y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of z:

B (bounding box):
For x B z, we need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x): The western boundary of x is to the east of the western boundary of z.
2. supx(x) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of x is to the west of the eastern boundary of z.
3. infy(z) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of x is to the north of the southern boundary of z.
4. supy(x) <= supy(z): The northern boundary of x is to the south of the northern boundary of z.

We already have (3) and (4) from our derivation. If (1) and (2) also hold, then x B z is a possible relation.

W (West):
For x W z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the west of z.
2. infy(z) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of x is to the north of the southern boundary of z.
3. supy(x) <= supy(z): The northern boundary of x is to the south of the northern boundary of z.

We already have (2) and (3) from our derivation. If (1) also holds, then x W z is a possible relation.

E (East):
For x E z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z.
2. infy(z) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of x is to the north of the southern boundary of z.
3. supy(x) <= supy(z): The northern boundary of x is to the south of the northern boundary of z.

We already have (2) and (3) from our derivation. If (1) also holds, then x E z is a possible relation.

For completeness, let's also check the other single-tile relations, although knowing the y-constraints, we've already ruled most of them out:

S (South):
For x S z, we need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z): x is to the south of z.
2. infx(z) <= infx(x): The western boundary of x is to the east of the western boundary of z.
3. supx(x) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of x is to the west of the eastern boundary of z.

But we've established that infy(z) <= infy(x). For any region, infy(x) <= supy(x). This gives infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which contradicts requirement (1) supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is not a valid relation.

SW (South West):
For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the west of z.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z): x is to the south of z.

Again, infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SW z is not a valid relation.

NW (North West):
For x NW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the west of z.
2. supy(z) <= infy(x): x is to the north of z.

But we've established that supy(x) <= supy(z). For any region, infy(x) <= supy(x). This gives infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts requirement (2) supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NW z is not a valid relation.

N (North):
For x N z, we need:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x): x is to the north of z.
2. infx(z) <= infx(x): The western boundary of x is to the east of the western boundary of z.
3. supx(x) <= supx(z): The eastern boundary of x is to the west of the eastern boundary of z.

Similar to NW, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x N z is not a valid relation.

NE (North East):
For x NE z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z.
2. supy(z) <= infy(x): x is to the north of z.

Again, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x NE z is not a valid relation.

SE (South East):
For x SE z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z): x is to the south of z.

But infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SE z is not a valid relation.

So, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are:
1. B: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), given the already established infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
2. W: If supx(x) <= infx(z), given the already established infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
3. E: If supx(z) <= infx(x), given the already established infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Hmm, the fact that x E z is a possibility is a bit counterintuitive, given the original constraints. Let's visualize this to ensure it makes sense:

Original constraints:
- x W y: x is to the west of y, and the y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of y.
- y E z: y is to the east of z, and the y-extent of y is contained within the y-extent of z.

Possible relative positions for x and z:

1. x W z (x is to the west of z):
```
   x         z         y
   |-----|   |-----|   |-----|
   |     |   |     |   |     |
   |     |   |     |   |     |
   |-----|   |-----|   |-----|
```

2. x E z (x is to the east of z):
```
   z         x         y
   |-----|   |-----|   |-----|
   |     |   |     |   |     |
   |     |   |     |   |     |
   |-----|   |-----|   |-----|
```

3. x B z (x is within the bounding box of z):
```
         z
   +--------+
   |        |
   |   x    |
   |   |--| |
   |   |--| |
   +--------+
```

The interesting case is x E z (case 2). In this scenario, x is to the east of z but still to the west of y.

Let's check this with the original constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y): x is to the west of y.
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z): z is to the west of y.
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (for x E z): x is to the east of z.

These constraints are consistent. It's possible for x to be to the east of z, as long as both are to the west of y.

Let me double check if there's some constraint that might make some of these possibilities invalid, going back to the problem statement.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y).
- Region y is E of region z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z).

Derived y-constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): The southern boundary of x is to the north of the southern boundary of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z): The northern boundary of x is to the south of the northern boundary of z.

Derived x-constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y): x is to the west of y.
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z): z is to the west of y.

Given the derived constraints, the possible single-tile relations between x and z are:

1. B (bounding box): If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), along with the already established y-constraints.
2. W (West): If supx(x) <= infx(z), along with the already established y-constraints.
3. E (East): If supx(z) <= infx(x), along with the already established y-constraints.

I think these three relations are indeed the valid possibilities.

Actually, let's double-check the definition of "bounding box" to ensure we've applied it correctly.

For a B b, we need:
1. infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b): The x-extent of a is contained within the x-extent of b.
2. infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b): The y-extent of a is contained within the y-extent of b.

In the context of the question:
For x B z, we need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z): The x-extent of x is contained within the x-extent of z.
2. infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z): The y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of z.

We've already established the y-constraints from the given relations. For the x-constraints, if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x B z is a valid possibility.

Our three possible relations are:
1. B (bounding box): if the x-extent of x is contained within the x-extent of z.
2. W (West): if x is completely to the west of z on the x-axis.
3. E (East): if x is completely to the east of z on the x-axis.

Given our analysis, these three single-tile relations are the possible relationships between x and z given the constraints.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

B, W, E
