PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

We are told that:
1. Region x is SE of region y: This means x SE y
2. Region y is E of region z: This means y E z

We want to find the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Let's analyze the constraints:

For x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

For y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): y is to the east of z
- infy(z) <= infy(y): y's bottom edge is not below z's bottom edge
- supy(y) <= supy(z): y's top edge is not above z's top edge

Now, let's combine these constraints to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the constraints:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)

By transitivity:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z.

For the north-south direction, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From these, we can't directly determine a specific north-south relationship between x and z. Let's analyze possible cases:

1. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the south of z. Combined with x being to the east of z, x SE z.
2. If infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), then x overlaps with z in the north-south direction. Combined with x being to the east of z, x E z.
3. If supy(z) <= supy(x), then x extends northward beyond z. But since we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) can be at most supy(z) (from y E z), this case can't occur.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the analysis. Let's reconsider.

For x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

For y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): y is to the east of z
- infy(z) <= infy(y): y's bottom edge is not below z's bottom edge
- supy(y) <= supy(z): y's top edge is not above z's top edge

Combining these:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z.
- For the north-south relationship, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).

This means supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). But we can't directly relate supy(x) and infy(z) from these constraints.

Let's visualize this with a diagram and consider different configurations:

Case 1: If infy(z) > supy(x), then x is strictly to the south of z. Combined with x being to the east of z, we get x SE z.

Case 2: If infy(z) <= supy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x overlaps with z in the north-south direction. Combined with x being to the east of z, we get x E z.

Case 3: If supy(z) < supy(x), then x extends northward beyond z. But since we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) can be at most supy(z) (from y E z), this case can't occur.

Hmm, I'm not sure that's right. Let me rethink.

From the constraints:
- From x SE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
- From y E z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): This means x is to the east of z.
- From supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we can't directly determine the north-south relationship. However, from supy(y) <= supy(z), we know y's top edge is at most as high as z's top edge.

Actually, I don't think I can further constrain the north-south relationship without additional information. So, x can have various north-south positions relative to z while still satisfying the given constraints.

Given that x is to the east of z, the possible cardinal direction relations are SE, E, and NE. 

But I think I need to be more careful: let's draw this situation out precisely. Define the following reference points:
- Let z have a bounding box defined by the points (zxmin, zymin) and (zxmax, zymax)
- Let y have a bounding box defined by the points (yxmin, ymin) and (yxmax, ymax)
- Let x have a bounding box defined by the points (xxmin, xymin) and (xxmax, xymax)

We know:
1. x SE y means:
   - yxmax <= xxmin (x is to the east of y)
   - xymax <= ymin (x is to the south of y)

2. y E z means:
   - zxmax <= yxmin (y is to the east of z)
   - zymin <= ymin (y's bottom edge is not below z's bottom edge)
   - ymax <= zymax (y's top edge is not above z's top edge)

From 1 and 2, we can derive:
- zxmax <= yxmin <= xxmin (x is to the east of z)

For the north-south relationship:
- xymax <= ymin (from x SE y)
- zymin <= ymin (from y E z)
- ymax <= zymax (from y E z)

From these, we can say xymax <= ymin. But we can't directly relate xymax to zymin or xymin to zymax without additional constraints.

Let's consider possible configurations:

Case 1: xymax <= zymin
This means x is strictly to the south of z. Combined with x being to the east of z, we get x SE z.

Case 2: zymin < xymax <= zymax and xymin >= zymin
x overlaps with z in the north-south direction. Combined with x being to the east of z, we get x E z.

Case 3: xymin > zymax
This means x is strictly to the north of z. Combined with x being to the east of z, we get x NE z.

Case 4: xymin <= zymax and xymax > zymax
x overlaps with z in the north-south direction but extends northward. Combined with x being to the east of z, this is still x E z.

Case 5: xymin < zymin and xymax >= zymin
x overlaps with z in the north-south direction but extends southward. Combined with x being to the east of z, this is still x E z.

But, I need to check if all these cases are consistent with the original constraints. The main constraint to check is xymax <= ymin.

Actually, from our constraints:
- xymax <= ymin (from x SE y)
- zymin <= ymin (from y E z)

We can derive xymax <= ymin and zymin <= ymin. But this doesn't provide a direct relation between xymax and zymin. 

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are E, SE, and possibly others. 

I need to analyze this more systematically to get a complete answer.

Given:
1. x SE y: x is southeast of y
2. y E z: y is east of z

Properties of these relations:
1. x SE y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
   - supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

2. y E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y): y is to the east of z
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent

From these, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y's bottom edge

Now, we need to determine the possible north-south relationships between x and z. 

The constraints tell us that supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). 

Let me redraw the diagram to better visualize:
- x is to the east of y
- x is to the south of y
- y is to the east of z
- y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent

The horizontal relationships are clear: x is to the east of z (by transitivity).

For the vertical relationship, we have:
- From x SE y, x is to the south of y.
- From y E z, y can be anywhere vertically within z.

This means:
- If y is at the bottom edge of z (i.e., infy(y) = infy(z)), then x is to the south of both y and z.
- If y is higher up within z, x could still be to the south of z or might overlap with z vertically.

Let me try once more with a clearer approach:

Given:
1. x SE y: x is southeast of y
2. y E z: y is east of z

We want to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

We know that x is to the east of z (by transitivity), so the possible relations are: SE, E, NE.

Let's determine which of these is possible:

1. SE (Southeast): For x to be southeast of z, x must be to the east and south of z. We already know x is to the east of z. For the south relationship, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y). So, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but we can't directly relate supy(x) to infy(z).

However, it's possible to have a configuration where supy(x) <= infy(z). For instance, if infy(z) = infy(y), then from supy(x) <= infy(y), we get supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z. So, x SE z is a possible relation.

2. E (East): For x to be east of z, x must be to the east of z and overlap with z in the north-south direction. We already know x is to the east of z. For the vertical overlap, we need infy(z) <= supy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(z). 

From our constraints, we can have configurations where infy(z) <= supy(x) (though it's not guaranteed). For instance, if infy(z) < infy(y) and supy(x) is close to (but not exceeding) infy(y), we can have infy(z) <= supy(x).

Also, there's no direct constraint on infy(x) and supy(z), so infy(x) <= supy(z) is possible. Thus, x E z is a possible relation.

3. NE (Northeast): For x to be northeast of z, x must be to the east and north of z. We already know x is to the east of z. For the north relationship, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).

From our constraints, we have supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z). But we don't have a direct relation between infy(x) and supy(y) or supy(z). So, it's not clear if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible.

Actually, on further thought: Since x is to the south of y (from x SE y), it means x's top edge is below y's bottom edge. And if y's bottom edge is potentially at the same level as z's bottom edge (from y E z), then x's top edge can also be below z's bottom edge. This would mean x is to the south of z. However, if y's bottom edge is higher than z's bottom edge, it's possible for x to have a vertical overlap with z.

Let's now specifically check if NE is possible. For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is to the north of z
- supx(z) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z

We already know the second point is satisfied. For the first point, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But from x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). This means x's top edge is below y's bottom edge. But from y E z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). This means y's top edge is at most as high as z's top edge.

Now, if infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for any region), and supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y), and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z), then by transitivity, infy(x) <= supy(z). This means x's bottom edge is at most as high as z's top edge. But for x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(x) <= supy(z).

So, the NE relation is not possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SE and E.

But actually, I think I might have misunderstood the cardinal direction formalization. Let me double-check by going back to basics.

For a region x and a reference region z, the possible cardinal direction relations are:
- x N z: x is north of z
- x NE z: x is northeast of z
- x E z: x is east of z
- x SE z: x is southeast of z
- x S z: x is south of z
- x SW z: x is southwest of z
- x W z: x is west of z
- x NW z: x is northwest of z
- x B z: x is inside the bounding box of z

Let's use the definitions again:

x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

Given:
1. x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From 1 and 2, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): This means x is to the east of z.

Now, let's check the possible north-south relationships:

1. x SE z: For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y). So, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). We can't directly determine if supy(x) <= infy(z).

But, we can have configurations where supy(x) <= infy(z), making x SE z possible.

2. x E z: For this, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We don't have direct constraints on infy(x), and from y E z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z).

We can have configurations where infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), making x E z possible.

3. x NE z: For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). From y E z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). We don't have direct constraints on infy(x).

But, if infy(x) > supy(z), then infy(x) > supy(y) (from supy(y) <= supy(z)). This doesn't contradict any of our constraints, so x NE z is possible.

Given that x can't go below the bottom edge of y (from x SE y), there's no way for x to overlap with z from below (y's bottom edge can align with z's bottom edge). So, the S and SW relations are not possible.

Similarly, given that x is to the east of y (from x SE y) and y is to the east of z (from y E z), there's no way for x to be to the west of z. So, the W, NW, SW, and B relations are not possible.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SE, E, and NE.

Actually, I think I need to pay more attention to the constraint that x SE y means "supy(x) <= infy(y)". Let's reason through this one more time:

Given:
1. x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From 1 and 2, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

Now, consider the possible relations:

1. x SE z: For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). 

If infy(z) < infy(y), then we can't determine if supy(x) <= infy(z) directly. But if infy(z) = infy(y), then from supy(x) <= infy(y), we get supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

So, x SE z is possible, especially when infy(z) = infy(y).

2. x E z: For this, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). 

From our constraints, if infy(z) < infy(y), then we might have infy(z) <= infy(x) (though it's not guaranteed).

Also, from supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) (a basic property of any region), we get supy(x) <= supy(y). From y E z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). So, by transitivity, supy(x) <= supy(z).

Thus, x E z is possible.

3. x NE z: For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). 

From y E z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). So, supy(y) <= supy(z).

But from x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). This implies that x is entirely below y. In general, infy(x) <= supy(x) (a basic property of any region). So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).

From y E z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). This means y's top edge is at most as high as z's top edge. But we don't have a direct relation between infy(y) and supy(z).

If infy(y) > supy(z), then from infy(x) <= infy(y), we'd get infy(x) > supy(z) (contradicting the requirement for x NE z, which is supy(z) <= infy(x)).

But, if infy(y) <= supy(z), then we can't determine if infy(x) <= supy(z) or supy(z) <= infy(x) directly.

I think the confusion arises because the constraints don't fully determine the vertical relationship between x and z. The key insight is that if y's bottom edge is aligned with z's bottom edge, then x is to the south of z. But if y's bottom edge is higher than z's bottom edge, then x can have an overlapping vertical component with z.

Let me approach this differently. Let's use a specific example to clarify. Let's set up the coordinates:

1. z: [(0,0), (2,4)] (i.e., the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (0,0) and top-right corner at (2,4))
2. y: [(3,1), (5,3)] (y is to the east of z and its vertical extent is within z)
3. x: [(6,0), (8,0.5)] (x is to the southeast of y)

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is to the east of z (supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 6)
- x is to the south of z's top edge (supy(x) = 0.5 <= supy(z) = 4)
- But, x's vertical extent overlaps with z's vertical extent (infy(x) = 0 <= supy(z) = 4 and infy(z) = 0 <= supy(x) = 0.5)

So, in this example, x E z.

But if we adjust y to y': [(3,2), (5,3)] (i.e., moving y's bottom edge up), then x': [(6,0), (8,1.5)] (x is still to the southeast of y')

Now, the relation between x' and z:
- x' is to the east of z (supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x') = 6)
- x' is to the south of z's top edge (supy(x') = 1.5 <= supy(z) = 4)
- x' and z have overlapping vertical extents (infy(x') = 0 <= supy(z) = 4 and infy(z) = 0 <= supy(x') = 1.5)

So, in this example too, x' E z.

But if we adjust y further to y'': [(3,3), (5,4)] (i.e., moving y's bottom edge up to align with z's top edge), then x'': [(6,0), (8,2.5)] (x is still to the southeast of y'')

Now, the relation between x'' and z:
- x'' is to the east of z (supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x'') = 6)
- x'' is to the south of z's top edge (supy(x'') = 2.5 <= supy(z) = 4)
- x'' and z have overlapping vertical extents (infy(x'') = 0 <= supy(z) = 4 and infy(z) = 0 <= supy(x'') = 2.5)

So, in this example as well, x'' E z.

Actually, let me try one more example where x SE z:
Let's adjust z to z': [(0,5), (2,8)]. But y and x remain the same: y: [(3,1), (5,3)] and x: [(6,0), (8,0.5)].

Now, the relation between x and z':
- x is to the east of z' (supx(z') = 2 <= infx(x) = 6)
- x is to the south of z' (supy(x) = 0.5 <= infy(z') = 5)

So, in this example, x SE z'.

Now, let's try to disprove NE. For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).

From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). Since infy(x) <= supy(x) (a basic property of any region), we get infy(x) <= infy(y).

From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent.

Now, if supy(z) <= infy(x) (the requirement for x NE z), and infy(x) <= infy(y) (from above), then by transitivity, supy(z) <= infy(y). But this contradicts the constraint from y E z that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which together imply infy(y) <= supy(z) (assuming infy(y) <= supy(y), which is a basic property of any region).

So, x NE z is not possible.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SE and E.

Actually, I'm still not sure about my reasoning. Let me recheck the condition for NE.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

We already established that supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the second condition, from x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). This means x is to the south of y.

From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent.

Now, I need to determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible given these constraints.

From x SE y, we know x is to the south of y. From y E z, we know y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent. So, z's top edge is at least as high as y's top edge. Given that x is to the south of y, it's unlikely (but not definitively ruled out) that x is to the north of z.

But let's check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is consistent with our constraints. From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).

Wait, I'm confused because some properties of regions are not explicitly given, like the relation between infy(x) and supy(x). But it's reasonable to assume that for any region r, infx(r) <= supx(r) and infy(r) <= supy(r). These are basic properties of regions.

Then, for any region x, infy(x) <= supy(x).

From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).

From y E z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z).

For x NE z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But we already have infy(x) <= infy(y). If we can show that supy(z) > infy(y), then by transitivity, we'd have supy(z) > infy(x), which contradicts the requirement for x NE z.

From y E z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). If infy(y) < supy(y) (which is generally true for all regions), then infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z). This means infy(y) < supy(z).

Now, using infy(x) <= infy(y) (from earlier) and infy(y) < supy(z) (from just now), we get infy(x) < supy(z). But for x NE z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradiction shows that x NE z is not possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SE and E.

Not sure why I'm having trouble with this. I think I was overthinking and overcomplicating. Let's try a more direct approach.

First, let's specify the cardinal direction definitions more clearly:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Given:
1. x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From 1 and 2, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of z.

Now, let's check for possible vertical relationships:

1. x SE z: For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
   From y E z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y).
   So, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
   If infy(z) = infy(y), then supy(x) <= infy(z), and x SE z is possible.
   If infy(z) < infy(y), we can't determine if supy(x) <= infy(z) directly.

   Interestingly, if we construct a specific example where z's bottom edge is lower than y's bottom edge, and x's top edge is at a height between z's bottom edge and y's bottom edge, then x would not be to the southeast of z, but rather to the east of z.

2. x E z: For this, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Let's not make any assumptions about infy(x) (since we don't have direct constraints on it). If infy(z) <= infy(x), then one condition is satisfied.
   From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). From y E z, we have infy(y) <= supy(y) (a basic property of any region) and supy(y) <= supy(z). By transitivity, supy(x) <= supy(z).
   So, if infy(z) <= infy(x), then x E z is possible.

3. x NE z: For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Hmm, let's think about this. From x SE y, x is to the south of y. From y E z, y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent, so z's top edge is at least as high as y's top edge. It seems unlikely that x is to the north of z. But let's check the constraints.

   From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). Assuming infy(x) <= supy(x) (a basic property of any region), we get infy(x) <= infy(y).
   From y E z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). If we can show that infy(y) < supy(z) (which would be the case if infy(y) < supy(y), a basic property of any region, and supy(y) <= supy(z), from y E z), then by transitivity, infy(x) < supy(z).
   But for x NE z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This contradiction suggests that x NE z is not possible.
   Actually, hold on. I'm too quick to claim there's a contradiction: the reasoning would require infy(y) < supy(y), which is a property of a non-degenerate region. The original problem formulation says we're dealing with regions homoemorphic to the closed unit disk, which implies they are non-degenerate.

   So for a NE relation, we'd need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x). But we've established above that infy(x) < supy(z), contradicting this requirement. So, x NE z is not possible.

Hmm, so I've gone around this a few times, and I think the answer is that x SE z and x E z are possible, but x NE z is not. Let me double-check by considering a concrete example to disprove x NE z.

Let's say:
- z is the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (0,0) and top-right corner at (2,4).
- y is the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (3,1) and top-right corner at (5,3). This puts y to the east of z, with infy(y) > infy(z).
- For x to be southeast of y, its top edge must be below y's bottom edge. So, x is the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (6,0) and top-right corner at (8,0.5).

We have:
- x is to the east of z (supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 6).
- x's top edge is below z's top edge (supy(x) = 0.5 <= supy(z) = 4).
- But, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 0 <= supy(x) = 0.5 <= supy(z) = 4.

So, in this example, x E z.

It's definitely not x NE z, because infy(x) (which is 0) is not greater than supy(z) (which is 4), so the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for x NE z is not satisfied.

To check if x SE z is possible, let's adjust z to be z': the rectangle with bottom-left corner at (0,5) and top-right corner at (2,8). Keep y and x as above.

Now, the relation between x and z':
- x is to the east of z' (supx(z') = 2 <= infx(x) = 6).
- x is to the south of z' (supy(x) = 0.5 <= infy(z') = 5).

So, in this example, x SE z'.

Therefore, based on these examples and our logical reasoning, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SE and E.

Ok, I'm going to give this one more try, to convince myself of the correct answer. Will try to reason through this as clearly as possible.

Given:
1. x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
2. y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

First, let's see if x could be SE of z:
For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

From 1 and 2, we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.

For the second condition, from 1, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). From 2, we have infy(z) <= infy(y). If infy(z) = infy(y), then supy(x) <= infy(z), and the second condition is also satisfied. So, x SE z is possible when infy(z) = infy(y).

Now, let's check if x could be E of z:
For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (z's bottom edge is not below x's bottom edge)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top edge is not above z's top edge)

From 1 and 2, we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.

For the second condition, we don't have a direct constraint on infy(x). Let's say infy(x) is such that infy(z) <= infy(x).

For the third condition, from 1, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). From 2, we have infy(y) <= supy(y) (a basic property of any region) and supy(y) <= supy(z). By transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so the third condition is also satisfied.

So, x E z is possible when infy(z) <= infy(x).

Now, let's check if x could be NE of z:
For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

From 1 and 2, we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so the first condition is satisfied.

For the second condition, from 1, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). Assuming infy(x) <= supy(x) (a basic property of any region), we get infy(x) <= infy(y).

From 2, we have supy(y) <= supy(z). But this doesn't give us a direct relation between supy(z) and infy(x). But let's see if they can be related.

From infy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) (a basic property of any region) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 2), by transitivity, infy(x) <= supy(z). But for x NE z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). If infy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then infy(x) = supy(z), which is a very specific case. This occurs when x's bottom edge aligns perfectly with z's top edge.

Let's consider this: if infy(x) = supy(z) and from earlier, supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 1), then supy(z) = infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y). So, supy(z) <= infy(y).

But from 2, we also have supy(y) <= supy(z). If infy(y) <= supy(y) (a basic property of any region), then by transitivity, infy(y) <= supy(z). Combining, we have supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(z), which implies supy(z) = infy(y). This is a very specific configuration where the top edge of z aligns perfectly with the bottom edge of y.

So, for x NE z to be possible, we need a specific configuration where supy(z) = infy(y) and infy(x) = supy(z). In other words, the top edge of z aligns with the bottom edge of y, and the bottom edge of x aligns with the top edge of z.

Actually I think I can construct a concrete example of when x NE z could occur:

- z: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (0,0) and top-right corner at (1,1).
- y: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (2,1) and top-right corner at (3,2). Note that infy(y) = 1 = supy(z).
- x: Rectangle with bottom-left corner at (4,1) and top-right corner at (5,2). Note that infy(x) = 1 = supy(z).

Here, y E z (because supx(z) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 1, and supy(y) = 2 <= supy(z) = 1). Oops, supy(y) = 2 > supy(z) = 1, so this doesn't work. Hmm, I think I need to adjust.

Actually, I think I was overthinking this. From the constraints, it's clear that for x NE z to hold, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). But also from the constraints, we have infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y). And from y E z, we have infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So, by transitivity, infy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the requirement for x NE z (which is supy(z) <= infy(x)).

Actually, I think the above is also wrong. I'm trying to use the fact that infy(x) <= supy(x), which is a basic property of any region. But this doesn't allow us to conclude that infy(x) <= infy(y) from supy(x) <= infy(y). So I need to be more careful here.

From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y). This means x's top edge is below y's bottom edge.

For x NE z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). This means z's top edge is below x's bottom edge. But we know that z's top edge is at least as high as y's top edge (from y E z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z)). And y's bottom edge is above x's top edge (from x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y)).

So, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

For a non-degenerate region, infy(y) <= supy(y). By transitivity,  supy(x) <= supy(z).

Alright, let me reframe this more clearly. Let me try to paint the whole picture.

From the constraints, z's bounding box is positioned suth that:
- y is east of z, meaning y is to the right of z.
- y's vertical extent is entirely within z's vertical extent, meaning z's bottom edge is at most as low as y's bottom edge and z's top edge is at least as high as y's top edge.

x's bounding box is positioned such that:
- x is southeast of y, meaning x is to the right of y and above y.
- Actually, x is to the right of y and below y. Southeast means below (south) and to the right (east).

So x is (far) east of z (by transitivity from the transitivity of the east-west position in cardinal direction relations).

But what about the north-south relationship of x and z?
- x is below y (from x SE y).
- y's vertical extent is between z's top and bottom edges (from y E z).

There are multiple possibilities for the north-south relationship of x and z.

If z's bottom edge is at the same level as y's bottom edge (meaning infy(z) = infy(y)), then since x's top edge is below y's bottom edge (from x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y)), x's top edge is also below z's bottom edge. This would mean x is below z, or in cardinal direction terms, x SE z.

If z's bottom edge is lower than y's bottom edge (meaning infy(z) < infy(y)), and x's top edge is between z's bottom edge and y's bottom edge (infy(z) < supy(x) <= infy(y)), then x and z have an overlapping vertical component. Given that x is to the east of z, this would mean x E z.

And that's it! x can only be SE or E of z given the constraints.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking all this time! The NE relation isn't possible because if x is SE of y, it means x is below y. And if y's vertical extent is within z's, then y is not above z. So, by transitivity, x cannot be above z.

But just to double check, let's reason:
For x NE z, we'd need x to be above z.

From x SE y, we know x is below y. From y E z, we know y's vertical extent is within z's. This means z's top edge is at least as high as y's top edge and z's bottom edge is at most as low as y's bottom edge.

Given that x is below y and y is within z's vertical extent, x can't be above z. Hence, x NE z is not possible.

I also think this further confirms that the only possible relations are SE and E.

OK, I'm making this harder than it is. Let me now try to present the solution as clearly as I can.

We have that x SE y, which means:
1. x is to the east of y.
2. x is to the south of y.

We also have that y E z, which means:
1. y is to the east of z.
2. y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent.

From the first constraints, we can deduce:
x is to the east of z. This is by transitivity: if x is east of y, and y is east of z, then x is east of z.

For the north-south relationship, we have:
- x is to the south of y.
- y's top edge is at most as high as z's top edge.
- y's bottom edge is at least as low as z's bottom edge.

Clearly, x cannot be to the north of z, as x is to the south of y, and y is not strictly to the north of z.

Also, if z's bottom edge is at the same level as y's bottom edge, and x is below y, then x is also below z. This would make x SE of z.

But if z's bottom edge is lower than y's bottom edge, it's possible for x to have an overlapping vertical component with z while still being to the south of y. This would make x E of z.

Actually, let's construct a concrete scenario to see if this actually works.

1. z: Rectangle with bottom-left at (0, 0) and top-right at (2, 4). So, the projection of z on the x-axis is [0, 2] and the projection of z on the y-axis is [0, 4].
2. y: Rectangle with bottom-left at (3, 1) and top-right at (5, 3). The projection of y on the x-axis is [3, 5] and on the y-axis is [1, 3]. Clearly, y E z.
3. x: Rectangle with bottom-left at (6, 0.5) and top-right at (8, 0.7). The projection of x on the x-axis is [6, 8] and on the y-axis is [0.5, 0.7]. Since supy(x) = 0.7 < infy(y) = 1, x is to the south of y. Also, supx(y) = 5 < infx(x) = 6, so x is to the east of y. Thus, x SE y.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z. We have:
- supx(z) = 2 < infx(x) = 6. So, x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) = 0.7 and infy(z) = 0. Since infy(z) < supy(x), x and z have an overlapping vertical component. Also, supy(x) = 0.7 < supy(z) = 4. Given that x is to the east of z, we have x E z.

To check if x SE z is also possible, let's adjust z to z': Rectangle with bottom-left at (0, 3) and top-right at (2, 7). Keep y the same. 

Then, the relationship between x and z' is:
- supx(z') = 2 < infx(x) = 6. So, x is to the east of z'.
- supy(x) = 0.7 < infy(z') = 3. So, x is to the south of z'.

Thus, x SE z'. This confirms that both x SE z and x E z are possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SE and E.

Indeed a simple graphical representation also corroborates the above. The picture is: 
x is to the south-east of y, and y is to the east of z. Graphically representing this, we'd have:

```
      z
            y
                  x
```

Where `z` is to the northwest of `y`, and `y` is to the northwest of `x`. (In reality, we'd have to arrange this in 2D with the proper constraints, but I'm just simplifying to get the idea across).

In this configuration, x is to the southeast of z, confirming that x SE z is indeed a valid relation.

But we can also adjust the y-positions such that:

```
      z
      |     y
      |           x
```

In this configuration, `x` is to the east of `z`, and just slightly south. The vertical projections of `x` and `z` overlap, making the relation `x E z` valid.

So, I confirm my earlier conclusion: the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SE and E.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal relations are possible between region x and region z, given the constraints.

Given:
- x is SE of y: This means x is to the east and south of y
- y is E of z: This means y is to the east of z, with y's vertical extent contained within z's vertical extent

First, let's establish what we know for certain:
- Since x is east of y and y is east of z, then x must be east of z (by transitivity)

For the north-south relationship between x and z:
- From x SE y: x is south of y (x's top edge is below y's bottom edge)
- From y E z: y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent (z's bottom edge is at most as low as y's bottom edge, and z's top edge is at least as high as y's top edge)

Considering these constraints, there are two possible relationships:

1. E (East): If z's bottom edge is lower than y's bottom edge, it's possible for x to overlap vertically with z while still being south of y and east of z.

2. SE (Southeast): If z's bottom edge is at the same level as y's bottom edge, then x (being south of y) would also be south of z, resulting in x being southeast of z.

The answer is E, SE.
