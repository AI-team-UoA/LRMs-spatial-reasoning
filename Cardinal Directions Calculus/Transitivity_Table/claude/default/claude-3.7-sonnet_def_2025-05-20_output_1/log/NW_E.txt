PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that:
- x is NW of y
- y is E of z

We need to find the possible relations between x and z.

First, let's recall the definitions:

x NW y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above y)

y E z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is entirely to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is horizontally aligned with z)

Now, let's deduce the relationship between x and z:

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above y)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is entirely to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is horizontally aligned with z)

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)

From this, we can deduce that either:
1. supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(y) (x could be to the left of z, or overlapping with it horizontally)
2. supx(z) <= supx(x) <= infx(y) (z could be to the left of x, or overlapping with it horizontally)

Also:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is horizontally aligned with z)

This means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)

So, infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).

But we can't determine the exact relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) or supy(x).

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is entirely above z, which would make x NW, N, or NE of z.
If supy(z) > infy(x), then x and z could overlap vertically.

Let's go through the possibilities:

1. If x is entirely to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) and entirely above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), then x is NW of z.

2. If x and z overlap horizontally (infx(z) <= supx(x)) but x is entirely above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), then x is N of z.

3. If x is entirely to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and entirely above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), then x is NE of z.

4. If x is entirely to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) and they overlap vertically (infy(x) <= supy(z)), then x is W of z.

5. If x and z overlap both horizontally and vertically, then x could be B (within the bounding box) of z.

6. If x is entirely to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and they overlap vertically (infy(x) <= supy(z)), then x is E of z.

7. If x is entirely to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) and entirely below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), then x is SW of z. (But this contradicts our finding that x is above y, and y is horizontally aligned with z, so x should be above z or at least overlapping vertically. So this isn't a valid relation.)

8. If x and z overlap horizontally (infx(z) <= supx(x)) but x is entirely below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), then x is S of z. (But again, this contradicts our findings.)

9. If x is entirely to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and entirely below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), then x is SE of z. (But once more, this contradicts our findings.)

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let's step back and reason more carefully.

We know:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's deduce the relationship between x and z in terms of horizontal positioning:

From:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)

We have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y)

These two inequalities don't give us a direct comparison between supx(x) and supx(z), or between infx(x) and infx(z). x and z could be in any horizontal relationship: x could be W, NW, SW of z, or z could be W, NW, SW of x, or they could overlap horizontally.

Now, let's look at the vertical positioning:

From:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

We can derive:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

This gives us:
- supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z))

But we can't directly compare infy(x) and supy(z). It's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x) (making x entirely above z), or infy(x) <= supy(z) (allowing x and z to overlap vertically).

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. If supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely above z), and if one of the following holds:
   a. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z), then x is NW of z.
   b. infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (x and z overlap horizontally), then x is N of z.
   c. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z), then x is NE of z.

2. If infy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(x) (x and z overlap vertically), and if one of the following holds:
   a. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z), then x is W of z.
   b. infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (x and z overlap horizontally), then x is B (within the bounding box) of z.
   c. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z), then x is E of z.

Wait, I think we need to be a bit more careful here. Let's go through the inequalities once more.

From:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the left of y)

So, both x and z are to the left of y, but we can't directly compare their horizontal positions.

And:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as low as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as high as y)

From:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as low as y)

We can derive:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)

This implies:
- infy(z) < infy(x) (z starts lower than x)

But we don't have a direct comparison between supy(z) and infy(x). 

It's possible that:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is entirely below x)
- infy(x) < supy(z) (z and x overlap vertically)

Similarly, we don't have a direct comparison between supy(z) and supy(x). 

So, the possible configurations are:

1. If supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is entirely below x), then based on the horizontal relationship:
   a. If supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z), then x is NW of z.
   b. If there's horizontal overlap, then x is N of z.
   c. If supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z), then x is NE of z.

2. If infy(x) < supy(z) (z and x overlap vertically), then based on the horizontal relationship:
   a. If supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z), then x is W of z.
   b. If there's horizontal overlap, then x could be B, NW, N, NE, W, or E of z, depending on the exact relationship.
   c. If supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the right of z), then x is E of z.

Actually, I'm a bit confused by my own reasoning. Let's go back to the basic logic. 

We know:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's think about the region z and its relationship to y. We know y is E of z, which means y is to the right of z, and they are aligned vertically. Now, if x is NW of y, it means x is both to the left of and above y.

Given that z is to the left of y and x is to the left of y, we can't determine the horizontal relationship between x and z. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or they could overlap horizontally.

Now, considering the vertical relationship: x is above y, and y is aligned vertically with z. This suggests that x is at least partially above z. But since z extends vertically at least as high as y, and we don't know how high z goes beyond that, we can't conclusively say if x is entirely above z or if they overlap vertically.

Given these constraints, the possible relationship between x and z are:

1. NW: x is both to the left of and above z.
2. N: x is aligned horizontally with z but is above it.
3. NE: x is to the right of and above z.
4. W: x is to the left of z and they overlap vertically.
5. B: x is within the bounding box of z (they overlap both horizontally and vertically).
6. E: x is to the right of z and they overlap vertically.

OK so the possible relationships between x and z are NW, N, NE, W, B, E. Let me check this:

First I understand the following constraints from "x is NW of y" and "y is E of z":
1. x is to the left of y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. x is above y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
3. z is to the left of y: supx(z) <= infx(y)
4. z and y are aligned vertically: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From 1 and 3, we see that both x and z are to the left of y, but we don't know their relative horizontal positions. This allows for the possibility that x is to the left of z, x is to the right of z, or they overlap horizontally.

From 2 and 4, we know x is above y, and z extends at least as high as y (and also at least as low as y). This means x is at least partially above z, but since we don't know how high z extends beyond the height of y, x could be entirely above z or they could overlap vertically.

So, the possible relations are:
- NW: x is to the left of and entirely above z.
- N: x is horizontally aligned (overlapping) with z and entirely above it.
- NE: x is to the right of and entirely above z.
- W: x is to the left of z and they overlap vertically.
- B: x is within the bounding box of z (they overlap both horizontally and vertically).
- E: x is to the right of z and they overlap vertically.

Actually no, let me try a visual approach to be sure. Let's visualize our situation and then deduce the constraints.

Given the constraints, let's place some coordinate axes and the regions:

The constraints:
1. x is NW of y: so, supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y is E of z: so, supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's denote the coordinates as follows:
x = [xinf_x, xsup_x] x [xinf_y, xsup_y]
y = [yinf_x, ysup_x] x [yinf_y, ysup_y]
z = [zinf_x, zsup_x] x [zinf_y, zsup_y]

Now expressing the constraints:
1. xsup_x <= yinf_x and ysup_y <= xinf_y
2. zsup_x <= yinf_x and zinf_y <= yinf_y and ysup_y <= zsup_y

Now the question is, what's the relation between x and z, which is determined by their relative positions:

Horizontally:
- If xsup_x <= zinf_x, then x is to the left of z.
- If zinf_x <= xinf_x and xsup_x <= zsup_x, then x is horizontally aligned (overlapping) with z.
- If zsup_x <= xinf_x, then x is to the right of z.

Given the constraints, we can't determine which of the above three is true. So, horizontally, x can be to the left of, aligned with, or to the right of z.

Vertically:
- If xsup_y <= zinf_y, then x is below z. (contradicting our constraints, as ysup_y <= xinf_y and ysup_y <= zsup_y)
- If xinf_y <= zinf_y and zsup_y <= xsup_y, then z is within (or at the same height as) x vertically.
- If zinf_y <= xinf_y and xsup_y <= zsup_y, then x is within (or at the same height as) z vertically.
- If zinf_y <= xinf_y and xinf_y <= zsup_y <= xsup_y, then x and z overlap vertically, with z starting lower.
- If xinf_y <= zinf_y <= xsup_y and xsup_y <= zsup_y, then x and z overlap vertically, with x starting lower.
- If zsup_y <= xinf_y, then x is entirely above z.

From the given constraints, we know ysup_y <= xinf_y and ysup_y <= zsup_y. This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between xinf_y and zsup_y. However, the constraint ysup_y <= xinf_y implies x is above y, and zinf_y <= yinf_y and ysup_y <= zsup_y implies that z includes y vertically. This gives us two possibilities:
1. zsup_y <= xinf_y: z is entirely below x.
2. xinf_y < zsup_y: z and x overlap vertically.

Combining the horizontal and vertical possibilities, we get the following potential relations between x and z:

1. If x is to the left of z (xsup_x <= zinf_x):
   a. If z is entirely below x (zsup_y <= xinf_y), then x is NW of z.
   b. If z and x overlap vertically (xinf_y < zsup_y), then x is W of z.

2. If x and z overlap horizontally (zinf_x <= xinf_x and xsup_x <= zsup_x or zinf_x <= xsup_x and xinf_x <= zsup_x):
   a. If z is entirely below x (zsup_y <= xinf_y), then x is N of z.
   b. If z and x overlap vertically (xinf_y < zsup_y), then x is B of z.

3. If x is to the right of z (zsup_x <= xinf_x):
   a. If z is entirely below x (zsup_y <= xinf_y), then x is NE of z.
   b. If z and x overlap vertically (xinf_y < zsup_y), then x is E of z.

So the possible relations are: NW, N, NE, W, B, and E.

Wait, let me double check this by visualizing.

Given the constraints:
1. x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's start with placing z. Let's say z is a region on the left side of our canvas.

Now, since y is E of z, y is to the right of z with vertical alignment. This places y to the right of z, and within the vertical extent of z.

Given that x is NW of y, x is both to the left of and above y. This places x above and to the left of y.

Now, let's think about the possible positions of x:

1. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or horizontally overlap with z. We can't determine which based on the constraints.

2. x is above y, and y is within the vertical extent of z. So, x is at least partially above z. However, since z extends beyond y vertically, we can't determine if x is entirely above z or if they partially overlap vertically.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. NW: x is to the left of z and entirely above it.
2. N: x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely above it.
3. NE: x is to the right of z and entirely above it.
4. W: x is to the left of z and they overlap vertically.
5. B: x is within the bounding box of z (they overlap both horizontally and vertically).
6. E: x is to the right of z and they overlap vertically.

Let me verify:

From the constraints, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is within the vertical extent of z)

From these, we can deduce:
- x and z are both to the left of y, but their horizontal relationship to each other is undetermined.
- x is above y, and y is within the vertical extent of z. This means x is at least partially above z, but we don't know if x is entirely above z or if they overlap vertically.

Let me double-check the possible relationships by looking at the standard single-tile cardinal directions:

1. x is in the NW of z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible if x is to the left of z and entirely above it.

2. x is in the N of z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible if x overlaps with z horizontally and is entirely above it.

3. x is in the NE of z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible if x is to the right of z and entirely above it.

4. x is in the W of z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This is possible if x is to the left of z and overlaps with it vertically.

5. x is in the B of z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This is possible if x is within the bounding box of z.

6. x is in the E of z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This is possible if x is to the right of z and overlaps with it vertically.

7. x is in the SW of z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This would require x to be below z, which contradicts the constraint that x is above y and y is within the vertical extent of z. So, x cannot be SW of z.

8. x is in the S of z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This would also require x to be below z, which contradicts our constraints. So, x cannot be S of z.

9. x is in the SE of z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This would require x to be below z, which contradicts our constraints. So, x cannot be SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW, N, NE, W, B, and E.

Actually I realize I'm missing a case.

The constraint from "y is E of z" includes "infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)". This means z's vertical extent includes y vertically. We also have the constraint "supy(y) <= infy(x)" from "x is NW of y", which means x is above y.

Combined, these don't necessarily mean x is at least partially above z. It's still possible that:
- supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is entirely above z. This allows for NW, N, and NE.
- infy(x) < supy(z), meaning x and z overlap vertically. This allows for W, B, and E.

But the "infy(z) <= infy(y)" part also means that z extends at least as far down as y does. We don't know the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z), so we can't tell if x is entirely above z (which would give us NW, N, NE) or if there's a vertical overlap (which would give us W, B, E). It's possible that x is below the upper part of z, which would give us W, B, E.

Actually, isn't there even another case?

Wait, I think I got it. So long as the object x just has to be above object y and vertically aligned with z, then all of these cases are possible:

1. NW: x is to the left of z and entirely above it.
2. N: x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely above it.
3. NE: x is to the right of z and entirely above it.
4. W: x is to the left of z and they overlap vertically.
5. B: x is within the bounding box of z (they overlap both horizontally and vertically).
6. E: x is to the right of z and they overlap vertically.

So the answer is NW, N, NE, W, B, E.

Let me double check once more with a visual. The constraint "x is NW of y" means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

And the constraint "y is E of z" means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's vertical extent is included within z's vertical extent)

If we place these on a coordinate system, z would be on the left, y would be to the right of z with its vertical extent within z's, and x would be to the left of y and above it.

Now, let's check the possible positions of x in relation to z:

1. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or horizontally overlapping with z. This is because both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative horizontal positions are not constrained.
2. x is above y, and y's vertical extent is within z's. This means x can either be entirely above z or partially overlap with it vertically, depending on how far z extends upwards beyond y.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (x is to the left of and entirely above z)
- N (x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely above it)
- NE (x is to the right of and entirely above z)
- W (x is to the left of z and they overlap vertically)
- B (x is within the bounding box of z, meaning they overlap both horizontally and vertically)
- E (x is to the right of z and they overlap vertically)

OK actually I think I'm confusing myself by changing coordinates so many times. Let me try once more, and use proper constraint checking. I'm going to list what we know from the given constraints.

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's derive constraints between x and z.

We know:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
2. supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)

Horizontally, both x and z are to the left of y, but we can't deduce the relation between x and z directly.

Vertically:
3. supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From 3 and 4:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, we have supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)), but we can't deduce the relation between infy(x) and supy(z).

Let's go through each of the 9 cardinal directions and check if it's possible:

1. x NW z: this means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): No constraint directly tells us this, so it's possible.
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): No constraint directly contradicts this, so it's possible.
   
   Possible.

2. x N z: this means infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   
   Possible.

3. x NE z: this means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   
   Possible.

4. x W z: this means supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - infy(z) <= infy(x): No constraint directly contradicts this. From 4, we know infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't have a direct relation between infy(y) and infy(x).
   - supy(x) <= supy(z): No constraint directly contradicts this. From 4, we have supy(y) <= supy(z), but no direct relation between supy(x) and supy(y).
   
   Possible.

5. x B z: this means infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - infy(z) <= infy(x): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - supy(x) <= supy(z): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   
   Possible.

6. x E z: this means supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - infy(z) <= infy(x): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - supy(x) <= supy(z): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   
   Possible.

7. x SW z: this means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): From 3 and 4, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). Combining, we get supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), which doesn't directly tell us anything about supy(x) and infy(z). But since we're assuming objects are continuous, the constraint that x is above y and y is within the vertical extent of z would mean it's unlikely for x to be entirely below z. But I don't think we can definitively say the configuration is impossible. Could this be possible?
   
   Actually let me reason about this more carefully. We have 
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
   
   Let me work with specific values to see if this configuration is possible. Say:
   - infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 7
   - infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 10
   - infy(x) = 8, supy(x) = 10
   
   These values satisfy the constraints:
   - supy(y) = 7 <= infy(x) = 8 (x is above y)
   - infy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 5 and supy(y) = 7 <= supy(z) = 10 (y is within the vertical extent of z)
   
   Now, if we were to make x SW of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). But with our specific values, supy(x) = 10 and infy(z) = 3, which doesn't satisfy the constraint (since 10 > 3).
   
   I think the constraint that x is above y and y is within the vertical extent of z does indeed make it impossible for x to be entirely below z.
   
   I think SW is not possible.

8. x S z: this means infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): Using the same reasoning as for SW, this is not possible because the constraint that x is above y and y is within the vertical extent of z means x can't be entirely below z.
   
   I think S is not possible.

9. x SE z: this means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): No constraint directly contradicts this.
   - supy(x) <= infy(z): Similar to SW and S, this is not possible.
   
   I think SE is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW, N, NE, W, B, E.

Given our constraints:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive that x and z have the following constraints horizontally:
- Both x and z are to the left of y (supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)).
- Their relative horizontal positions can be any of: x is to the left of z, x overlaps horizontally with z, or x is to the right of z.

Vertically:
- x is above y (supy(y) <= infy(x)).
- y is within the vertical extent of z (infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)).
- This implies x is at least partially above y's position, but we don't know if x is entirely above z or if they overlap vertically.

In the cardinal direction framework, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (x is to the left of and entirely above z).
- N (x is horizontally aligned with z and entirely above it).
- NE (x is to the right of and entirely above z).
- W (x is to the left of z and they overlap vertically).
- B (x is within the bounding box of z).
- E (x is to the right of z and they overlap vertically).

The relations SW, S, and SE are not possible because they would require x to be entirely below z, which contradicts the fact that x is above y and y is within the vertical extent of z.

OK so the set of possible relationships is {NW, N, NE, W, B, E}.

Let's double check SW case:

The problem with SW is that it requires supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given the constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)

This would mean:
supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)

It doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). But let's think visually.

If x is NW of y, it means x is above y. If y is E of z, it means y and z are aligned vertically with y being to the right of z. Specifically, z's vertical extent contains y.

So, if x is above y and y is within the vertical extent of z, it's natural to think that x and z must overlap vertically, or x is entirely above z.

But let's think more carefully. We have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's lower bound is below or at y's lower bound)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z's upper bound is above or at y's upper bound)

These constraints don't directly rule out the possibility that supy(x) <= infy(z). For that to be the case, we'd need specific values where supy(x) is lower than infy(z), even though infy(x) is above supy(y) and infy(z) is below infy(y).

I'm going to check with an example:

Let's say:
- infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 7
- infy(x) = 8, supy(x) = 10 (this satisfies supy(y) <= infy(x), so x is above y)
- infy(z) = 4, supy(z) = 9 (this satisfies infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), so y is within the vertical extent of z)

In this case, supy(x) = 10 and infy(z) = 4, so supy(x) > infy(z). This means x and z are overlapping vertically.

Let's see if I can come up with values where supy(x) <= infy(z), which would make x SW of z (if x is also to the left of z):

If I try to set infy(z) higher, say infy(z) = 11, then this would violate the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y), given infy(y) = 5.

It's looking like, given the constraints, we can't have supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x can't be entirely below z. So SW, S, and SE are not possible.

So the set of possible relationships is indeed {NW, N, NE, W, B, E}.

Let's verify this using a visual example again:

Consider the constraints:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's place these on a coordinate system and see what the possible positions of x in relation to z could be.

First, place z. Let's say z is in coordinates (2, 4) to (6, 10).

Given that y is E of z, y would be to the right of z with its vertical extent included within z's. So, y could be located at, for instance, (7, 5) to (9, 8).

Now, since x is NW of y, x is to the left of y and above it. Possible locations for x could range widely, but it needs to be to the left of y (so supx(x) <= 7) and above y (so supy(y) = 8 <= infy(x)). Some options:

1. x is at (1, 9) to (3, 11).
   - Horizontally: x is to the left of z.
   - Vertically: x is entirely above z.
   - Relation: x is NW of z.

2. x is at (3, 9) to (5, 11).
   - Horizontally: x overlaps with z.
   - Vertically: x is entirely above z.
   - Relation: x is N of z.

3. x is at (6.5, 9) to (8, 11).
   - Horizontally: x is to the right of z.
   - Vertically: x is entirely above z.
   - Relation: x is NE of z.

4. x is at (1, 8) to (3, 10).
   - Horizontally: x is to the left of z.
   - Vertically: x overlaps with z.
   - Relation: x is W of z.

5. x is at (3, 8) to (5, 10).
   - Horizontally: x overlaps with z.
   - Vertically: x overlaps with z.
   - Relation: x is B of z.

6. x is at (6.5, 8) to (8, 10).
   - Horizontally: x is to the right of z.
   - Vertically: x overlaps with z.
   - Relation: x is E of z.

These visual examples confirm our derivation that the possible relations between x and z are NW, N, NE, W, B, and E.

So the answer is {NW, N, NE, W, B, E}.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NW of y: This means x is to the left of y and above y
- y is E of z: This means y is to the right of z and vertically aligned with z

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us about the relationship between x and z:

1. Horizontally: 
   - x is to the left of y
   - z is to the left of y
   - Therefore, x and z could be in any horizontal relationship (x could be left of z, right of z, or horizontally overlapping)

2. Vertically:
   - x is above y
   - y is vertically aligned with z (y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent)
   - This means x is at least partially above y's position, but x could be entirely above z or partially overlapping z vertically

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

NW, N, NE, W, B, E
