PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We are given that:
- Region x is S (South) of region y
- Region y is S (South) of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}.

Let's recall the definition of the S relation:
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

So, x S y means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)  (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is not extending beyond the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x is not extending beyond the right edge of y)

And y S z means:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)  (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)  (y is not extending beyond the left edge of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y is not extending beyond the right edge of z)

Now, let's think about the relation between x and z. From the above, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)

So, by transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z (satisfying the first condition for S relation).

Also, from x S y and y S z, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, by transitivity:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (This means x might not be to the left of z's left boundary, violating the second condition for S relation)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (This satisfies the third condition for S relation)

Let me visualize this with examples:

Example 1:
Suppose z is a rectangle with corners at (0,10), (10,10), (10,20), (0,20).
y is a rectangle with corners at (2,0), (8,0), (8,5), (2,5).
x is a rectangle with corners at (3,-10), (7,-10), (7,-5), (3,-5).

In this case, x S y and y S z. And x S z because:
- supy(x) = -5 <= infy(z) = 10
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 3 (This doesn't work because infx(z) = 0, but infx(x) = 3. So infx(z) <= infx(x) is not satisfied)
- supx(x) = 7 <= supx(z) = 10

Wait, let me double-check the S relation again:
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

Oh, I misread the second condition. For S relation, it's infx(b) <= infx(a). 

So, for x S z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x).

From x S y and y S z, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)

By transitivity, infx(z) <= infx(x). So, the second condition for S relation is satisfied.

So, from the constraints x S y and y S z, it seems that x S z is a possible relation.

Let me further check if there are other possible relations.

For the S relation, we've established that:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x is not extending beyond the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is not extending beyond the right edge of z)

If we consider the SW (South West) relation, the definition is:
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

From the constraints, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (satisfying the second condition for SW)

But for x SW z, we also need supx(x) <= infx(z). 

From x S y and y S z, we have:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

So, supx(x) <= supx(z). But this doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

In a specific configuration, it's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z), making x SW z. But in general, this isn't guaranteed.

Let's check the SE (South East) relation:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). 

From x S y and y S z, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

It's not guaranteed that supx(z) <= infx(x). In fact, from supx(y) <= supx(z) and infx(y) <= infx(x), it's possible that supx(z) > infx(x), which would violate the condition for SE.

So, SE might not be a general possible relation.

Let's check the B (Bounding Box) relation:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (this is not guaranteed from the given constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we've established)

So, B might not be a general possible relation due to the third condition.

Let's check the S (South) relation again:
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which we've established)

So, x S z is definitely a possible relation given the constraints.

Let's check the SW (South West) relation:
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is not guaranteed from the given constraints)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)

Similarly, for the SE (South East) relation:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (this is not guaranteed from the given constraints)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)

Hmm, let me think more about the possible relations between x and z.

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's draw out the constraints with specific examples and see if we can identify all possible relations.

First, let's establish a general regional observation: If region x is S of region y and region y is S of region z, then region x is definitely south of region z. But the exact cardinal relation between x and z can vary based on the specific positions.

Let's consider some examples:

1. Region z is a rectangle with corners at (0,10), (10,10), (10,20), (0,20).
   Region y is a rectangle with corners at (2,0), (8,0), (8,5), (2,5).
   Region x is a rectangle with corners at (3,-10), (7,-10), (7,-5), (3,-5).

   In this case, x S y and y S z, and x S z.

2. Region z is a rectangle with corners at (0,10), (10,10), (10,20), (0,20).
   Region y is a rectangle with corners at (2,0), (8,0), (8,5), (2,5).
   Region x is a rectangle with corners at (-5,-10), (0,-10), (0,-5), (-5,-5).

   In this case, x S y and y S z, but x SW z.

3. Region z is a rectangle with corners at (0,10), (10,10), (10,20), (0,20).
   Region y is a rectangle with corners at (2,0), (8,0), (8,5), (2,5).
   Region x is a rectangle with corners at (10,-10), (15,-10), (15,-5), (10,-5).

   In this case, x S y and y S z, but x SE z.

From these examples, it seems that the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE. But let me double-check with more general reasoning.

If x S y and y S z, then:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (implying infx(z) <= infx(x))
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (implying supx(x) <= supx(z))

The constraints don't strictly dictate the horizontal positioning of x relative to z. Depending on the specific positions, x can be directly south of z (S), to the southwest of z (SW), or to the southeast of z (SE).

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE.

Actually, let's double check the constraints for each possible direction:

S: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
Constraints we know: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
These match, so S is a possibility.

SW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
Constraints we know: supy(x) <= infy(z), and potentially x is to the left of z (not guaranteed).
SW is a possibility if x is positioned far enough to the left, I think.

SE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
Constraints we know: supy(x) <= infy(z), and potentially x is to the right of z (not guaranteed).
SE is a possibility if x is positioned far enough to the right, I think.

W: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
Constraints we know: potentially x is to the left of z (not guaranteed), and x is below z (so infy(z) > supy(x), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x)).
W is not a possibility.

E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
Constraints we know: potentially x is to the right of z (not guaranteed), and x is below z (so infy(z) > supy(x), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x)).
E is not a possibility.

N: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
Constraints we know: x is below z (so infy(z) > supy(x), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x)).
N is not a possibility.

NW: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
Constraints we know: potentially x is to the left of z (not guaranteed), and x is below z (so infy(z) > supy(x), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x)).
NW is not a possibility.

NE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
Constraints we know: potentially x is to the right of z (not guaranteed), and x is below z (so infy(z) > supy(x), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x)).
NE is not a possibility.

B: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
Constraints we know: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and x is below z (so infy(z) > supy(x), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x)).
B is not a possibility.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE.

Actually, I'm not fully confident in my analysis of the SW and SE relations. Let me revisit those.

For the SW relation, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

From x S y and y S z, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x S y)

So, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which doesn't tell us whether supx(x) <= infx(z).

But if we consider a scenario where x is positioned far to the left and doesn't overlap with z horizontally, then supx(x) <= infx(z) would be satisfied.

Similarly, for the SE relation, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

From x S y and y S z, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

So, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) <= infx(x), which doesn't tell us whether supx(z) <= infx(x).

But if we consider a scenario where x is positioned far to the right and doesn't overlap with z horizontally, then supx(z) <= infx(x) would be satisfied.

Let me generalize the observations:

- supy(x) <= infy(z): x is below z (x is south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): x is horizontally contained within z or has some horizontal overlap.

Based on the specific positioning of x and z:
1. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x S z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x SW z.
3. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x SE z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE.

Wait, let me carefully check if the constraints from x S y and y S z guarantee any specific positioning of x with respect to z horizontally.

From x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, in general, we can say:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z): x is below z.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): z's left boundary is to the left of or at the same position as x's left boundary.
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z): x's right boundary is to the left of or at the same position as z's right boundary.

Hm, this is still not enough to concretely determine the exact horizontal positioning of x with respect to z.

So let's try a more specific example to understand the possible relations:

Region z spans from (0, 10) to (10, 20).
Region y spans from (3, 5) to (7, 9).

Given that y S z, y's boundaries are:
infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 7, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 9.

Now, let's consider different positions for region x such that x S y:

1. Region x spans from (4, 0) to (6, 4).
   In this case, x S y and y S z. And x S z because:
   - supy(x) = 4 <= infy(z) = 10
   - infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 4
   - supx(x) = 6 <= supx(z) = 10

2. Region x spans from (-5, 0) to (2, 4).
   In this case, x S y and y S z. But x SW z because:
   - supx(x) = 2 <= infx(z) = 0 (This actually isn't true; for the SW relation, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), but supx(x) = 2 and infx(z) = 0, so supx(x) > infx(z))
   - supy(x) = 4 <= infy(z) = 10

Let me recheck this. For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

I mistakenly put infx(z) = 0 and supx(x) = 2, which would make supx(x) > infx(z), violating the SW condition. Let me correct this:

If z spans from (5, 10) to (15, 20) and x spans from (-5, 0) to (2, 4), then:
- supx(x) = 2 <= infx(z) = 5 (satisfying the SW condition)
- supy(x) = 4 <= infy(z) = 10 (satisfying the SW condition)

So, in this corrected scenario, x SW z.

3. Region x spans from (12, 0) to (20, 4).
   If z spans from (0, 10) to (10, 20) and x spans from (12, 0) to (20, 4), then:
   - supx(z) = 10 <= infx(x) = 12 (satisfying the SE condition)
   - supy(x) = 4 <= infy(z) = 10 (satisfying the SE condition)

   So, in this scenario, x SE z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are indeed S, SW, and SE.

Wait, let me double check more closely by re-checking the constraints of these 3.

For the S relation:
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

So, for x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

From x S y and y S z, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z).
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which implies infx(z) <= infx(x).
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which implies supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, all three conditions for x S z are satisfied. S is a possible relation.

For the SW relation:
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So, for x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From x S y and y S z, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z).
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)

The relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) is not directly constrained, so it's possible to have supx(x) <= infx(z), making x SW z a possibility.

For the SE relation:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So, for x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From x S y and y S z, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z).
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

The relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) is not directly constrained, so it's possible to have supx(z) <= infx(x), making x SE z a possibility.

So, given the constraints x S y and y S z, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (South)
- SW (South West)
- SE (South East)

Actually, I have to double check if there are actually more possibilities because I think we can make use of the definition of the regions here.

The constraints given (x S y and y S z) tell us:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left boundary is to the left of or at the same position as x's left boundary)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at the same position as z's right boundary)

Let's double check the constraints for each cardinal direction to see if any other relations are possible.

For S (South):
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

All the constraints are satisfied, so S is a possible relation.

For SW (South West):
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), but the constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) is not guaranteed from x S y and y S z.

Actually, the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) from x S y and y S z suggests that z's left boundary is to the left of or at the same position as x's left boundary. This doesn't align well with the requirement for the SW relation, where x's right boundary should be to the left of z's left boundary (supx(x) <= infx(z)). So the known constraints might not allow for x to be SW of z.

But, given that regions are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries, it could still be possible for x to be positioned in such a way that supx(x) <= infx(z), especially if z and x don't have a horizontal overlap. So, SW is a possible relation.

For SE (South East):
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), but the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) is not guaranteed from x S y and y S z.

Actually, the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) from x S y and y S z suggests that x's right boundary is to the left of or at the same position as z's right boundary. This doesn't align well with the requirement for the SE relation, where z's right boundary should be to the left of x's left boundary (supx(z) <= infx(x)).

But, again, given the nature of the regions, it could still be possible for x to be positioned in such a way that supx(z) <= infx(x), especially if z and x don't have a horizontal overlap. So, SE is a possible relation.

To be more specific. Take the x, y, z constraints from earlier; we know supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z), infx(z) <= infx(x) (z's left edge doesn't extend past x's left edge), and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge doesn't extend past z's right edge).

For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). The constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) means that z's left edge is to the left of or at the same position as x's left edge. At first glance, this seems to contradict supx(x) <= infx(z) (which would mean x's right edge is to the left of z's left edge).

But if we look at possible specific locations, I think both can be true. For exmple, suppose x is in the range [3, 5] along the x-axis, and z is in the range [6, 10] along the x-axis. Then infx(z) = 6, infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 5, supx(z) = 10. So infx(z) > infx(x) (contradicting the constraint), but supx(x) <= infx(z).

Thus, S, SW, and SE are all possible.

Let me be even more specific; there are 9 possible cardinal directions.

Let's carefully check each:

N (North):
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) (which would mean z is below x). So, x N z is not possible.

NE (North East):
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) (which would mean z is below x). So, x NE z is not possible.

E (East):
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z), which means supy(x) < supy(z). But this means infy(z) > supy(x), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) (since infy(x) <= supy(x)). So, x E z is not possible.

SE (South East):
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), which satisfies the second condition. The first condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), is not directly constrained by x S y and y S z, but it's possible to position x in such a way that this is satisfied. So, x SE z is possible.

S (South):
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

All these conditions are satisfied from the constraints of x S y and y S z. So, x S z is possible.

SW (South West):
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z), which satisfies the second condition. The first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), is not directly constrained by x S y and y S z, but it's possible to position x in such a way that this is satisfied. So, x SW z is possible.

W (West):
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z), which means supy(x) < infy(z). But this means infy(z) > supy(x), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) (since infy(x) <= supy(x)). So, x W z is not possible.

NW (North West):
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) (which would mean z is below x). So, x NW z is not possible.

B (Bounding Box):
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= supy(z) (or more specifically, supy(x) <= infy(z)). But the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) is not guaranteed and likely contradicts the knowledge that x is below z (since if x is below z, then infy(z) > supy(x) >= infy(x)). So, x B z is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (South)
- SW (South West)
- SE (South East)

These are the only three possibilities given that x S y and y S z.

Let me double-check the reasoning for the SE relation again, since I think I might have missed something earlier.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From x S y and y S z, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z).
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

From these constraints, it's not immediately clear whether supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible. The constraints suggest infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which don't directly tell us about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).

However, I'm confident that if we pick the right positioning, we can satisfy this constraint; just put x completely to the east of z, without any horizontal overlap.

OK I think I've worked out all the possibilities now. Let's double-check to see we didn't miss anything.

x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)

We can infer that:
- supy(x) <= infy(z): x is below z.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): z doesn't extend past the left edge of x.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): x doesn't extend past the right edge of z.

Let's check one more time if x can be in any other cardinal direction to z.

For x SW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We have the second constraint fixed. For the first, the original constraints indicate infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which suggests that infx(z) is to the left of infx(x). But for x to be SW of z, supx(x) should be to the left of infx(z). This can happen if the region x is positioned such that its right edge (supx(x)) is to the left of z's left edge (infx(z)). While the original constraints don't guarantee this, it's still a possible configuration. So, x SW z is possible.

For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We have the second constraint fixed. For the first, the original constraints don't provide a direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x). But by considering possible specific configurations, it's clear that x can be positioned such that supx(z) <= infx(x). For this to happen, the region x should be to the right of region z without any horizontal overlap. So, x SE z is possible.

For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). All of these are directly inferred from the original constraints, as I've already shown. So, x S z is definitely possible.

I don't think any other cardinal direction is possible, because the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) means that x is below z, which eliminates the northern relations (N, NE, NW). And the horizontal constraints (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)) suggest that x and z can have a horizontal overlap, which aligns with the S relation. But, as we've seen, x can also be positioned such that it's SW or SE of z.

Actually, if we take a closer look at the relative constraints of x and z, we get (for the South West direction):
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), but at the same time, from the original constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x). If we take all this together, we get infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction if x is a non-degenerate region, since infx(x) < supx(x) for such a region.

Similarly for SE, we'd have supx(z) <= infx(x) (required for SE) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (from original constraints). This implies supx(x) <= infx(x), which again is a contradiction for a non-degenerate region.

Given these contradictions, it seems like the only possible cardinal direction for x relative to z is S.

Wait, let me double-check more carefully.

For SW, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). We also have infx(z) <= infx(x) from the original constraints. Together, they would indeed imply supx(x) <= infx(x), which sounds like a contradiction for a non-degenerate region.

But let's examine the definitions more closely. The relation a S b means that a is to the south of b, potentially with some horizontal overlap. If a and b don't have a horizontal overlap, then a would be either SW or SE of b.

From x S y and y S z, we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

The horizontal constraints (infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)) suggest that x, y, and z have a potential horizontal overlap. With this configuration, it seems x is directly south of z (i.e., x S z), and not SW or SE.

But let's consider a more concrete example to see if x can be SW or SE of z.

Suppose z spans from (0, 10) to (10, 20) on the xy-plane. Given y S z, let's say y spans from (2, 5) to (8, 9). Now, given x S y, x can span from (3, 0) to (7, 4). In this configuration, x S z because:
- supy(x) = 4 <= infy(z) = 10
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 3
- supx(x) = 7 <= supx(z) = 10

But can x be SW of z? For that, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), but here infx(z) = 0 and supx(x) = 7, so supx(x) > infx(z). It means x is not to the SW of z.

Can x be SE of z? For that, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), but here supx(z) = 10 and infx(x) = 3, so supx(z) > infx(x). It means x is not to the SE of z.

It's starting to look like x can only be S of z, not SW or SE. 

Let's reconsider the relations:

(1). x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

(2). y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But from (1) and (2), we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x). And for a non-degenerate region, infx(x) < supx(x). So, infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, x cannot be SW of z.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But from (1) and (2), we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(x) <= supx(z). For a non-degenerate region, infx(x) < supx(x). So, infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). Therefore, x cannot be SE of z.

Oh I think I misunderstood the definition. Let's re-read it.

For S, we have:
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

The constraint infx(b) <= infx(a) does NOT mean infx(b) must be to the left of infx(a), but rather infx(a) is not smaller than infx(b), OR infx(a) cannot be more to the left than infx(b).

Similarly, the constraint supx(a) <= supx(b) means supx(a) is not larger than supx(b), or supx(a) cannot extend more to the right than supx(b).

So the S relation means a is below b and a's horizontal extent is contained within b's horizontal extent (or they can have the same horizontal extents).

I think I've been interpreting it correctly.

For S, we have:
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For SW, we have:
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For SE, we have:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, from x S y and y S z, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), implying supy(x) <= infy(z).
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), implying infx(z) <= infx(x).
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), implying supx(x) <= supx(z).

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (which we've established)

So, x S z is valid.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)

But we also know infx(z) <= infx(x). For a non-degenerate region, infx(x) < supx(x). So, infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).

Given the constraints, supx(x) cannot be less than or equal to infx(z), since infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This means x cannot be SW of z.

By a similar argument, x cannot be SE of z either.

Thus, the only valid relation between x and z is S.

Actually, I realized I'm making a mistake. The definition should be interpreted as follows:

For S, we have:
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This means:
1. a is below b (supy(a) <= infy(b)).
2. a does not extend beyond the left edge of b (infx(b) <= infx(a)).
3. a does not extend beyond the right edge of b (supx(a) <= supx(b)).

OK so the original reasoning is correct. S, SW, and SE are all possible.

Wait a second, let me double check my mistake. For:

Condition 2: a does not extend beyond the left edge of b: infx(b) <= infx(a). If we restate this, it means b's left edge is to the left of (or at the same position as) a's left edge, which means a's left edge doesn't extend beyond b's left edge. So if region b is located at [2, 5] and a at [3, 6], then b's left edge (infx(b)) is at 2, a's left edge (infx(a)) is at 3, so 2 <= 3, i.e., infx(b) <= infx(a).

Condition 3: a does not extend beyond the right edge of b: supx(a) <= supx(b). This means a's right edge is to the left of (or at the same position as) b's right edge. So if region a is located at [3, 6] and b at [2, 7], then a's right edge (supx(a)) is at 6, b's right edge (supx(b)) is at 7, so 6 <= 7, i.e., supx(a) <= supx(b).

So a is contained within the bounds of b horizontally, with the left edge of a to the right of (or at the same position as) the left edge of b, and the right edge of a to the left of (or at the same position as) the right edge of b.

But if this is the case, that contradicts what I did above. Let me work through it more carefully:

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's left edge)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

From the original constraints:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge)

If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(x) <= infx(x), which contradicts the non-degeneracy of region x. So, x cannot be SW of z.

Actually, I think I need to think through the constraints more carefully again. Let me re-analyze.

From x S y, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x doesn't extend beyond the left edge of y)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x doesn't extend beyond the right edge of y)

From y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y doesn't extend beyond the left edge of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y doesn't extend beyond the right edge of z)

Now, let's deduce what this means for the relationship between x and z:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge)

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's left edge)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

But the constraints indicate infx(z) <= infx(x), which means z's left edge is to the left of (or at the same position as) x's left edge. This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for x to be SW of z, since for a non-degenerate region, infx(x) < supx(x). So, x cannot be SW of z.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (z's right edge is to the left of x's left edge)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

But the constraints indicate supx(x) <= supx(z), which means x's right edge is to the left of (or at the same position as) z's right edge. This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x to be SE of z, since for a non-degenerate region, infx(x) < supx(x). So, x cannot be SE of z.

So, the only valid relation between x and z is S.

Yes, the definition of the S relation clearly indicates that a is south of b and a's horizontal extent doesn't extend beyond b's horizontal extent. The SW and SE relations indicate a is to the southwest or southeast of b, respectively, which means there's no horizontal overlap between a and b.

From the constraints x S y and y S z, we can infer x S z.

So, the answer is:
The only possible relation between region x and region z is S (South).

Actually wait, let me be absolutely precise. The constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) just tells us that infx(z) <= infx(x), i.e., z's left edge doesn't extend beyond/to the left of x's left edge. It doesn't necessarily mean z's left edge is exactly to the left of x's left edge; it could be exactly at x's left edge.

Similarly, supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) just tells us that x's right edge doesn't extend beyond/to the right of z's right edge; it could be exactly at z's right edge.

So I was right the first time: the only possible relation is S.

ANSWER:

Based on the given definitions of cardinal direction relations, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is S of y and y is S of z.

Let me analyze what each constraint tells us:

From x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x doesn't extend beyond y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x doesn't extend beyond y's right edge)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y doesn't extend beyond z's left edge)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y doesn't extend beyond z's right edge)

Combining these constraints for the relationship between x and z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (x doesn't extend beyond z's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (x doesn't extend beyond z's right edge)

These constraints match exactly the definition of the S relation. For x to be in any other cardinal direction relative to z (like SW or SE), we would need conditions that contradict our derived constraints.

The answer is: S
