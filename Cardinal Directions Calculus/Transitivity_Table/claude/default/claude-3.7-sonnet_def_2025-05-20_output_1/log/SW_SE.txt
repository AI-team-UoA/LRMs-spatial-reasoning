PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

The problem is asking me to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let's analyze this carefully. Let me use the definitions from the provided information:

1. x SW y means: 
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. y SE z means:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Now, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction(s) that could describe the relationship between x and z.

Let's analyze the x-coordinate constraints first:
- From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

From these, we can't directly infer a constraint between supx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(z) and infx(x). So, in terms of the east-west relationship, x could be west of z, east of z, or they could overlap in the x-projection.

Now, let's analyze the y-coordinate constraints:
- From x SW y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y SE z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, we get: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)
This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies that x is to the south of z.

So, the possible cardinal directions for the relationship between x and z are those that include the "south" component:
- S (South): if x is directly south of z
- SW (Southwest): if x is to the south and west of z
- SE (Southeast): if x is to the south and east of z

But let's double-check using the definitions. 

There's actually one more constraint we can derive:
From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)

So, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). This tells us that both x and z are to the west of y, but it doesn't directly give us a constraint between x and z in the x-coordinate.

Let me try to visualize this with an example to see if there are any other constraints:

Imagine z is at position (0, 0) to (1, 1).
Given y SE z, y could be at position (2, -2) to (3, -1). This satisfies supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
Given x SW y, x could be at position (-1, -4) to (0, -3). This satisfies supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).

In this case, x is SW of z because supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

But let's try another example:
Imagine z is at position (0, 0) to (1, 1).
Given y SE z, y could be at position (2, -2) to (3, -1).
Given x SW y, x could be at position (1, -4) to (2, -3).

In this case, x overlaps with z in the x-projection (x is neither strictly east nor strictly west of z), but x is still to the south of z. So, the relation is S.

Let's try one more:
Imagine z is at position (0, 0) to (1, 1).
Given y SE z, y could be at position (2, -2) to (3, -1).
Given x SW y, x could be at position (3, -4) to (4, -3).

In this case, x is to the east of z because infx(x) ≥ supx(z). And x is to the south of z. So, the relation is SE.

Based on these examples, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are S, SW, and SE.

Wait, let me be more systematic in my analysis.

Given:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From the y-coordinate constraints, we can infer:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

For the x-coordinate, we don't have a direct constraint between x and z. However, both x and z are positioned relative to y in the x-coordinate.

Now, let me imagine where the three regions could be positioned:

1. x is to the west of z. In this case, the relation is SW.
2. x overlaps with z in the x-projection. In this case, the relation is S.
3. x is to the east of z. In this case, the relation is SE.

Are these the only possibilities?

If x is strictly west of z, then supx(x) < infx(z) . This, combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), gives us a SW relation.
If x and z overlap in the x-projection, then not(supx(x) < infx(z)) and not(supx(z) < infx(x)). Combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), this gives us a S relation.
If x is strictly east of z, then supx(z) < infx(x). Combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), this gives us a SE relation.

So, the possible relations are SW, S, and SE.

No, wait. I'm making an error here. Let me be more precise.

For x to be SW of z, we need: 
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x and z overlap in the x-projection)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x and z overlap in the x-projection)

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

We already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so x is always to the south of z.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)

This means both x and z are to the west of y in terms of the x-coordinate, but we can't directly infer their relationship with each other. They could overlap, or one could be to the east or west of the other.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SW, S, and SE.

Actually, wait. I made an error in my earlier analysis. The definition of S (South) is more complex than I presented. Let me re-check:

The relation a S b means:
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is to the south of b)
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) (a is not completely to the west of b)
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (a is not completely to the east of b)

For the S relation to hold between x and z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which we've established)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is not completely to the west of z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x is not completely to the east of z)

From our constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)

We can't directly infer infx(z) ≤ infx(x) or supx(x) ≤ supx(z) from these.

So, to summarize, based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SW, S, and SE.

Let's revisit our constraints and definitions once more time to be sure:

A region a is SW of region b if and only if:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is strictly to the west of b in the x-coordinate)
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is strictly to the south of b in the y-coordinate)

A region a is S of region b if and only if:
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is strictly to the south of b in the y-coordinate)
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) AND supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection)

A region a is SE of region b if and only if:
- supx(b) ≤ infx(a) (a is strictly to the east of b in the x-coordinate)
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is strictly to the south of b in the y-coordinate)

Given:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) AND supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) AND supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we can infer that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is strictly to the south of z in the y-coordinate.

Now, let's consider the x-coordinate:
- From x SW y, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
- From y SE z, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

From these, we can't directly deduce the relationship between x and z in the x-coordinate.

Oh, wait, let's be careful about the definition of S. Let me restate it:

A region a is S of region b if and only if:
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is strictly to the south of b in the y-coordinate)
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) (a is not completely to the west of b)
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (a is not completely to the east of b)

The definition of S implies that the x-projection of a overlaps with or is contained within the x-projection of b.

But wait, the definition from the prompt says:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

This means a is to the south of b, and a's x-projection is within b's x-projection. But I think for a to be strictly south of b, the projections should overlap, not necessarily that a's projection is contained in b's.

Anyway, the same conclusion holds: the possible relations between x and z are SW, S, and SE.

Actually, wait, let's break down the definition of S from the prompt more carefully:

a S b if and only if:
1. supy(a) <= infy(b): This means a is to the south of b.
2. infx(b) <= infx(a): This means the left (west) boundary of a is to the east of the left boundary of b.
3. supx(a) <= supx(b): This means the right (east) boundary of a is to the west of the right boundary of b.

Combining 2 and 3, it means a's x-projection is within b's x-projection. So, for a to be S of b, a must be both to the south of b and its x-projection must be contained within b's x-projection.

Now, given the constraints, can x be S of z? It's not clear whether x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. We'd need to know infx(x) in relation to infx(z) and supx(x) in relation to supx(z).

Similarly, for SW and SE, we need to know the specific relationship between x and z in the x-coordinate.

Let's revisit the conditions to narrow down the possible relations, focusing on whether there are scenarios where x can be SW, S, or SE of z.

SW:
For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z), so it's possible for x to be SW of z.

S:
For x to be S of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). From the given constraints, we can't deduce whether these conditions hold. So, it's possible for x to be S of z.

SE:
For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Given that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y), we can infer that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). The inequality supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is not guaranteed, but it's possible. So, x could be SE of z.

So, based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are SW, S, and SE.

Hang on, let me carefully check this. Specifically, I'm questioning if x can be SE of z.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

We've already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)

So, we have:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

To determine if x can be SE of z, we need to see if there's a case where supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Let me try to construct an example:
Suppose supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 3, and infx(x) = 2.

In this case, we have:
supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(y) = 3 (satisfying y SE z)
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) = 3 (part of x SW y, satisfied regardless of the exact value of supx(x))
supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2 (satisfying the condition for x SE z)

So, it is possible for x to be SE of z.

Let me check for other relations:

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Let me try to construct an example:
Suppose supx(x) = 0, infx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 3.

In this case, we have:
supx(x) = 0 ≤ infx(y) = 3 (part of x SW y)
supx(z) ≤ infx(y) = 3 (part of y SE z, satisfied regardless of the exact value of supx(z))
supx(x) = 0 ≤ infx(z) = 1 (satisfying the condition for x SW z)

So, it is possible for x to be SW of z.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Let me try to construct an example:
Suppose infx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5.

In this case, we have:
supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 5 (part of x SW y)
supx(z) = 4 ≤ infx(y) = 5 (part of y SE z)
infx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2 (satisfying the first part of the condition for x S z)
supx(x) = 3 ≤ supx(z) = 4 (satisfying the second part of the condition for x S z)

So, it is possible for x to be S of z.

Is it possible for x to be in any other relation with z? For example, could x be W of z (but not SW)?

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We've already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

Similarly, for the other relations (NW, N, NE, E, B), the condition that x is to the south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) must hold, which contradicts the conditions for those relations.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SW, S, and SE.

Actually, wait, we do need to be more precise about the definition of "S". Let's agree on this definition:

a S b if and only if:
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is strictly to the south of b)
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) (a is not entirely to the west of b)
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (a is not entirely to the east of b)

This means a is to the south of b and a's x-projection is contained within b's x-projection.

Given our constraints:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

We'll check if it's possible for x to be S of z:
1. We've already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
2. We need to determine if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) can hold.

From the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)

These don't give us direct information about infx(z) in relation to infx(x) or supx(x) in relation to supx(z).

Let's try to construct an example:
Suppose infx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5.

In this case, we have:
supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 5 (part of x SW y)
supx(z) = 4 ≤ infx(y) = 5 (part of y SE z)
infx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2 (satisfying the first part of the condition for x S z)
supx(x) = 3 ≤ supx(z) = 4 (satisfying the second part of the condition for x S z)

So, it is possible for x to be S of z.

Actually, upon further reflection, I think I may have been correct in my first analysis, or at least I've been trying to think through the problem more carefully.

Let's try to refine my understanding:

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y, i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- Region y is SE of region z, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

From these, we can infer:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in the x-coordinate. The possible scenarios are:
1. x is west of z, i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z), giving the SW relation.
2. x and z have overlapping x-projections, which, combined with x being to the south of z, would give the S relation.
3. z is west of x, i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x), giving the SE relation.

For scenario 1, I'm constructing an example:
Suppose supx(x) = 1, infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 3, infx(y) = 4.

In this case, we have:
supx(x) = 1 ≤ infx(y) = 4 (part of x SW y)
supx(z) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 4 (part of y SE z)
supx(x) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 2 (satisfying the condition for x SW z)

So, it is possible for x to be SW of z.

For scenario 2, I'm constructing an example:
Suppose infx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, supx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 5.

In this case, we have:
supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 5 (part of x SW y)
supx(z) = 4 ≤ infx(y) = 5 (part of y SE z)
infx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2 (x is not entirely to the west of z)
supx(x) = 3 ≤ supx(z) = 4 (x is not entirely to the east of z)
infx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2 ≤ supx(x) = 3 ≤ supx(z) = 4 (x's x-projection is within z's x-projection, giving the S relation)

So, it is possible for x to be S of z.

For scenario 3, I need to demonstrate that x can be SE of z:
Suppose supx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infx(y) = 4.

In this case, we have:
supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 4 (part of x SW y)
supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(y) = 4 (part of y SE z)
supx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2 (satisfying the condition for x SE z)

So, it is possible for x to be SE of z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SW, S, and SE.

So based on our reasoning, the answer is: SW, S, SE.

Actually, wait. I want to revisit the definition of S again to make sure I'm understanding it correctly. The definition says:

"a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)."

This means region a is to the South of region b if a is strictly south of b, AND a is NOT entirely west of b, AND a is NOT entirely east of b.

Now, for x to be S of z:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (we've established this, so x is strictly south of z).
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (this means x's western boundary is east of z's western boundary).
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (this means x's eastern boundary is west of z's eastern boundary).

Conditions 2 and 3 together mean that x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection.

We want to determine if there's a scenario where x's x-projection can be contained within z's x-projection. From our constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)

So in our most recent example, where:
infx(z) = 1
infx(x) = 2
supx(x) = 3
supx(z) = 4
infx(y) = 5

It's looking good:
1. supx(x) = 3 ≤ infx(y) = 5
2. supx(z) = 4 ≤ infx(y) = 5
3. infx(z) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 2
4. supx(x) = 3 ≤ supx(z) = 4

So x can be S of z.

We also verified that x can be SW and SE of z.

So the possible relations are: SW, S, and SE.

Actually let me check again if there's any additional relationship x and z can have.

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x and z overlap in the y-projection)

Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), the second condition for W cannot be satisfied. So, x cannot be W of z.

For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), the condition for being to the north (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) contradicts it. So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x and z overlap in the x-projection)

Again, the condition for being to the north contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be NE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

The condition for being to the north contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x cannot be NE of z.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x and z overlap in the y-projection)

Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), the condition for overlapping in the y-projection cannot be satisfied. So, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be B (inside the bounding box) of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection)

Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), the condition for x's y-projection to be contained within z's y-projection cannot be satisfied. So, x cannot be B of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are limited to SW, S, and SE.

I think we've determined that the answer is: 
SW, S, and SE.

So the final answer is:
SW, S, SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

From the definition of SW: 
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

From the definition of SE:
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This means x is definitely to the south of z. However, the east-west relationship between x and z isn't fully constrained.

The possible relations are:
1. SW - if x is to the west of z
2. S - if x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection
3. SE - if x is to the east of z

SW, S, SE
