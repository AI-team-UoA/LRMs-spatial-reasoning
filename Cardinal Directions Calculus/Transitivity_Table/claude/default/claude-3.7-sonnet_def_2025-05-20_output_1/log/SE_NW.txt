PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step, using the definitions of the cardinal direction relations provided.

We have:
1. Region x is SE of region y
2. Region y is NW of region z

We want to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions that are relevant here:

For x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, let's try to derive the possible relations between x and z.

From x SE y and y NW z, we can deduce:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)

This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). Both could be greater than supx(y), but we don't know which one is greater.

Similarly:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

Again, this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z). Both are less than or equal to infy(y), but we don't know which one is less.

Let's draw this out to get a clearer picture.

For x SE y:
x is to the east and south of y. That means x is in the southeast quadrant relative to y.

For y NW z:
y is to the west and north of z. That means y is in the northwest quadrant relative to z.

Now, if we place y at the center, x would be in the southeast quadrant and z would be in the southeast quadrant as well (since y is in the northwest of z). But the exact relation between x and z depends on their relative positions.

Let's consider different cases:

1. If x is far to the east of y and z is just a bit to the east of y, then x would be to the east of z.
2. If x is far to the south of y and z is just a bit to the south of y, then x would be to the south of z.
3. If x is far to the southeast of y and z is just a bit to the southeast of y, then x would be to the southeast of z.
4. However, if x is just a bit to the east of y and z is far to the east of y, then z would be to the east of x, which means x would be to the west of z.
5. Similarly, if x is just a bit to the south of y and z is far to the south of y, then z would be to the south of x, which means x would be to the north of z.

But there are even more cases to consider because x and z could also overlap or one could be inside the other.

I think I need to revisit the problem more methodically.

Given that x is SE of y and y is NW of z, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

From x SE y, we know that:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y NW z, we know that:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Let's consider each of the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z and check if they are consistent with the constraints:

1. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
   
   This doesn't directly tell us if supy(z) <= infy(x), and the x-coordinate constraints aren't directly addressed either. So, x N z is a possibility.

2. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
   
   This doesn't directly tell us if supx(z) <= infx(x). But we cannot rule out this possibility.

3. x E z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
   
   Again, this doesn't directly tell us if supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x E z is a possibility.

4. x SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the constraints, we have:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   
   We don't have direct constraints on supx(z) and infx(x) or on supy(x) and infy(z). Hence, x SE z is a possibility.

5. x S z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   
   We don't have direct constraints on supy(x) and infy(z). So, x S z is a possibility.

6. x SW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
   
   We don't know the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). So, x SW z is a possibility.

7. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
   
   We don't have direct constraints on supx(x) and infx(z). So, x W z is a possibility.

8. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the constraints, we know:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
   
   We don't have direct constraints on supy(z) and infy(x). So, x NW z is a possibility.

9. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the constraints, we don't have direct information on these. So, x B z is a possibility.

I think I need to approach this problem differently. Let me think about it in terms of regions on a 2D plane.

Given that x is SE of y and y is NW of z, we know:
- x is to the east and south of y.
- y is to the west and north of z.

Let's place y at the center of our coordinate system. Then:
- x would be somewhere in the fourth quadrant (SE).
- z would be somewhere in the second quadrant (NE, shifted to allow y to be NW of it).

Now, given this configuration, x could be anywhere in the fourth quadrant, and z could be anywhere that allows y to be to its NW.

OK, wait, I think I'm still not correctly thinking about it. The problem isn't well constrained.

Let me go to a more concrete example. Imagine a 2D plane with a Cartesian coordinate system.

Let's say region y is centered at the origin (0, 0) with some arbitrary shape.

Given that x is SE of y, x is somewhere in the fourth quadrant (where both x and y coordinates are positive). Let's say x is centered at (3, -3) for simplicity.

Given that y is NW of z, z is somewhere that places y to its NW. This means z is to the east and south of y. Let's say z is centered at (3, -3) as well.

In this case, x and z can overlap completely, which would make x B z.

But this isn't the only possibility. Depending on the exact positions and sizes of x and z, various cardinal direction relations are possible.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let's try a different approach. 

Actually I think let me rethink the problem from the beginning. 

We are told:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

We're asked to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let me redraw the scenario more carefully:

If x is SE of y, then:
- x is to the east of y.
- x is to the south of y.

If y is NW of z, then:
- y is to the west of z.
- y is to the north of z.

Combining these:
- x is to the east of y, and y is to the west of z. This means x and z are both to the east of y, but their relative east-west position is not constrained.
- x is to the south of y, and y is to the north of z. This means x and z are both to the south of y, but their relative north-south position is not constrained.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- x B z: x is inside z.
- x S z: x is south of z.
- x SW z: x is southwest of z.
- x W z: x is west of z.
- x N z: x is north of z.
- x NE z: x is northeast of z.
- x E z: x is east of z.
- x SE z: x is southeast of z.
- x NW z: x is northwest of z.

OK now I feel even more confused, because my intuition is that the relation between x and z should be more constrained.

Actually, wait. Let's go back to the original problem and be more precise in our understanding.

1. Region x is SE of region y:
   - This means supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - And supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2. Region y is NW of region z:
   - This means supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - And supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

From these, we can derive some relations:
- x is to the east of y, and y is to the west of z.
- x is to the south of y, and y is to the north of z.

So, x is to the east of y, which is to the west of z. This means x and z are both to the east and west of y, respectively. Their relative east-west position is not determined. x could be to the east of z, to the west of z, or their east-west extents could overlap.

Similarly, x is to the south of y, which is to the north of z. This means x and z are both to the south and north of y, respectively. Their relative north-south position is not determined. x could be to the north of z, to the south of z, or their north-south extents could overlap.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z include:
- x B z: x is contained within z.
- x S z: x is south of z.
- x SW z: x is southwest of z.
- x W z: x is west of z.
- x N z: x is north of z.
- x NE z: x is northeast of z.
- x E z: x is east of z.
- x SE z: x is southeast of z.
- x NW z: x is northwest of z.

Actually, I need to be even more careful: the position of y's bounding box matters. 

From "region x is SE of region y", we know that:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From "region y is NW of region z", we know that:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

So, from these we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). This means both x and z are to the east of y, but we don't know their relative east-west position.
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). This means both x and z are to the south of y, but we don't know their relative north-south position.

Given these constraints, x and z can be in various positions relative to each other. The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z depend on their relative positions.

Let's try once again. 

Actually, there's a subtle issue in my understanding. Let's revisit the definitions:

For x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, from these, it's true that both x and z are to the east of y. But it's not correct to say that both x and z are to the south of y. From y NW z, we know y is to the north of z, which means z is to the south of y.

So, from our constraints:
- Both x and z are to the east of y, but their relative east-west position is not determined.
- x is to the south of y, and z is to the south of y as well. But their relative north-south position is not determined.

Now, given this, x and z can be in various positions relative to each other, which determines the cardinal direction relation between them. But I think we can narrow down the possibilities.

Given x SE y and y NW z, the possible positions of x relative to z are:
- x B z: x is contained within z.
- x is N z: (This would be odd given our constraints, because both x and z are to the south of y, but it's not directly ruled out.)
- x is NE z: (Similarly, this would be odd, but not ruled out.)
- x is E z: x is to the east of z.
- x is SE z: x is to the southeast of z.
- x is S z: x is to the south of z.
- x is SW z: x is to the southwest of z.
- x is W z: x is to the west of z.
- x is NW z: (Again, this would be odd.)

I'm getting confused because I feel like I'm repeatedly changing my mind about what the constraint "the y is NW of z" actually implies about the position of x.

So, it seems like all possible cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z given our constraints. This doesn't seem right intuitively. Let's try a more visual approach.

Actually, wait, I think I'm getting confused because I'm considering bounding boxes as points. Let me revisit the definition.

From "region x is SE of region y", we know that:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (the topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of y)

From "region y is NW of region z", we know that:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y)

So, from these we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). This means both x and z are to the right of y, but we don't know their relative left-right position.
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). This means both x and z are below y, but we don't know their relative top-bottom position.

Given these constraints, I think the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z can be:
- NW (x is to the left and above z)
- N (x is above z)
- NE (x is to the right and above z)
- W (x is to the left of z)
- B (x and z overlap)
- E (x is to the right of z)
- SW (x is to the left and below z)
- S (x is below z)
- SE (x is to the right and below z)

Basically, all are possible. I might be missing but maybe there are other constraints to consider.

Wait... let's go back to the visual. If x is SE of y, then x is in the fourth quadrant, bottom-right in a Cartesian plane centered at y. If y is NW of z, then y is in the second quadrant, top-left in a Cartesian plane centered at z.

So, if we're using y as our reference, x is in the fourth quadrant of y, and z is... not directly placed. But if we're using z as our reference, then y is in the second quadrant of z, which means z is located such that y is to its top-left.

Hmm, I feel like this might be a trick question, and the answer is that all cardinal direction relations between x and z are possible.

Let's try once more with a clearer visual.

From "region x is SE of region y", we know that:
- The entire region x is to the right and below region y. So, in a coordinate system, if y's bounding box is at [x_left_y, x_right_y, y_bottom_y, y_top_y], then x's bounding box is at [x_left_x, x_right_x, y_bottom_x, y_top_x] where x_left_x > x_right_y and y_top_x < y_bottom_y.

From "region y is NW of region z", we know that:
- The entire region y is to the left and above region z. So, in the same coordinate system, if z's bounding box is at [x_left_z, x_right_z, y_bottom_z, y_top_z], then x_right_y < x_left_z and y_bottom_y > y_top_z.

But, crucially, the relation between x and z is not directly constrained, even though x is in the fourth quadrant of y, and y is in the second quadrant of z.

OK, I'm going to revise my thinking. If we imagine a grid with 9 cells:

NW N NE
W  B E
SW S SE

And if y is placed in the center (B), and we're told that x is to the SE of y, then x is in the SE cell. Similarly, if y is NW of z, then z is in the SE cell when y is in the center.

But that doesn't directly tell us the relation between x and z because the constraints are relative to y. Both x and z are to the right of y and below y, but that doesn't fix their relationship.

For example, consider these simplified cases:
- Both x and z are exactly in the center of the SE cell. In this case, x B z.
- x is still in the SE cell, but more to the right. In this case, x E z or x SE z or x NE z, depending on the exact position.
- x is still in the SE cell, but more to the bottom. In this case, x S z or x SE z or x SW z, depending on the exact position.

I think that all 9 basic cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B) are possible between x and z given the constraints.

I'm still getting confused here, I think in part because I'm not properly accounting for the fact that regions or their bounding boxes aren't points.

Let me try one more time. We have constraints on positions:
- x is to the SE of y
- y is to the NW of z

Therefore, region x is to the east (right) and south (down) of region y. And region y is to the west (left) and north (up) of region z. That means both x and z are to the east and south of y, but that doesn't constrain the relation between x and z.

Now, let me try some concrete simulations:

1. Let's consider a simple case where y is at the origin (0, 0).
   - Let's place x at (1, -1), which is to the SE of y.
   - Let's place z at (1, -1) too, which allows y to be to the NW of z.
   - In this case, x B z, i.e., they overlap.

2. Now, let's move x a bit:
   - y remains at (0, 0).
   - Let's place x at (2, -1), which is still to the SE of y.
   - z remains at (1, -1), and y is still to the NW of z.
   - In this case, x E z, i.e., x is to the east of z.

3. Another configuration:
   - y remains at (0, 0).
   - Let's place x at (1, -2), which is still to the SE of y.
   - z remains at (1, -1), and y is still to the NW of z.
   - In this case, x S z, i.e., x is to the south of z.

4. Yet another:
   - y remains at (0, 0).
   - Let's place x at (2, -2), which is still to the SE of y.
   - z remains at (1, -1), and y is still to the NW of z.
   - In this case, x SE z, i.e., x is to the southeast of z.

5. Moving z:
   - y remains at (0, 0).
   - x remains at (1, -1).
   - Let's place z at (2, -2), which still allows y to be to the NW of z.
   - In this case, x NW z, i.e., x is to the northwest of z.

I think I can find configurations for all cardinal directions, so the answer is N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.

Oh wait let me double check whether z being SW of x in the previous case makes sense:

Since x is at (1, -1) and z is at (2, -2), I'd say z is SE of x and x is NW of z.

So let me summarize for each case:

1. x is at (1, -1) and z is at (1, -1). Therefore, x B z because they coincide.
2. x is at (2, -1) and z is at (1, -1). Therefore, x E z because x is to the right (east) of z.
3. x is at (1, -2) and z is at (1, -1). Therefore, x S z because x is below (south of) z.
4. x is at (2, -2) and z is at (1, -1). Therefore, x SE z because x is to the right and below z.
5. x is at (1, -1) and z is at (2, -2). Therefore, x NW z because x is to the left and above z.

Let me try to find configurations for the other relations:

6. For x N z:
   - y remains at (0, 0).
   - Let's place x at (1, -0.5), which is still to the SE of y.
   - Let's place z at (1, -2), which still allows y to be to the NW of z.
   - In this case, x N z, i.e., x is to the north of z.

7. For x NE z:
   - y remains at (0, 0).
   - Let's place x at (2, -0.5), which is still to the SE of y.
   - Let's place z at (1, -2), which still allows y to be to the NW of z.
   - In this case, x NE z, i.e., x is to the northeast of z.

8. For x W z:
   - y remains at (0, 0).
   - Let's place x at (0.5, -1), which is still to the SE of y.
   - Let's place z at (2, -1), which still allows y to be to the NW of z.
   - In this case, x W z, i.e., x is to the west of z.

9. For x SW z:
   - y remains at (0, 0).
   - Let's place x at (0.5, -2), which is still to the SE of y.
   - Let's place z at (2, -1), which still allows y to be to the NW of z.
   - In this case, x SW z, i.e., x is to the southwest of z.

OK so I've given a configurations for all of the 9 cardinal direction relations, but let me double check by explicitly checking that the constraints hold.

For x SE y, we need: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
For y NW z, we need: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

For simplicity, let's assume regions are points. Then:

1. x B z:
   - y at (0, 0), x at (1, -1), z at (1, -1).
   - For x SE y: supx(y) = 0 <= 1 = infx(x) and supy(x) = -1 <= 0 = infy(y). ✓

5. x NW z:
   - y at (0, 0), x at (1, -1), z at (2, -2).
   - For x SE y: supx(y) = 0 <= 1 = infx(x) and supy(x) = -1 <= 0 = infy(y). ✓
   - For y NW z: supx(y) = 0 <= 2 = infx(z) and supy(z) = -2 <= 0 = infy(y). ✓

   - y at (0, 0), x at (2, -0.5), z at (1, -2).
   - For x SE y: supx(y) = 0 <= 2 = infx(x) and supy(x) = -0.5 <= 0 = infy(y). ✓
   - For y NW z: supx(y) = 0 <= 1 = infx(z) and supy(z) = -2 <= 0 = infy(y). ✓

8. x W z:
   - y at (0, 0), x at (0.5, -1), z at (2, -1).
   - For x SE y: supx(y) = 0 <= 0.5 = infx(x) and supy(x) = -1 <= 0 = infy(y). ✓
   - For y NW z: supx(y) = 0 <= 2 = infx(z) and supy(z) = -1 <= 0 = infy(y). ✓

9. x SW z:
   - y at (0, 0), x at (0.5, -2), z at (2, -1).
   - For x SE y: supx(y) = 0 <= 0.5 = infx(x) and supy(x) = -2 <= 0 = infy(y). ✓
   - For y NW z: supx(y) = 0 <= 2 = infx(z) and supy(z) = -1 <= 0 = infy(y). ✓

All 9 configurations satisfy the constraints, so all 9 cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible between x and z.

Actually, wait. I should be careful here: I'm treating regions as points for simplicity, which is fine for the basic constraints. But the definition of the cardinal directions I was given earlier considers regions, not just points. Let me think about this more.

Hmm, but we're assessing relations between regions, not just points. In the problem, x, y, and z are regions. But I think my approach is still valid. When I place regions (like x) at a certain point, I'm implying that the region is centered at that point. The regions can have any shape or size as long as they satisfy the constraints.

So, for instance, when I say "x is at (1, -1)", it means the region x is somewhere around that point, and similarly for y and z. The exact shape and size of the regions are not specified, but as long as the constraints are satisfied (as I've verified above), the cardinal direction relations hold.

Therefore, I believe my conclusion holds: all 9 cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible between x and z.

Actually, hold on. I need to double check given the definition I was given earlier:

1. x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
2. x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
3. x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
4. x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
5. x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
6. x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
7. x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
8. x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
9. x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

For each of the 9 configurations I've proposed, I need to verify that they meet the respective definitions. Let's assume each region is a small square centered at the mentioned point. Let me verify one (N):

For x N z, with x centered at (1, -0.5) and z centered at (1, -2):

Assuming a small square region with side 0.2 for both:
- infx(x) = 0.9, supx(x) = 1.1
- infy(x) = -0.6, supy(x) = -0.4
- infx(z) = 0.9, supx(z) = 1.1
- infy(z) = -2.1, supy(z) = -1.9

For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- supy(z) = -1.9 <= -0.6 = infy(x) ✓
- infx(z) = 0.9 <= 0.9 = infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) = 1.1 <= 1.1 = supx(z) ✓

So, the N relation holds with these regions. In fact, regardless of the exact dimensions of the regions (as long as they are consistent with the regions I am thinking of, e.g. a small square), the cardinal relation I am thinking of holds.

And crucially, in each of the 9 configurations I've given, both constraints are satisfied: x is SE of y and y is NW of z. And the respective cardinal relation between x and z holds.

So, I believe the answer is that all 9 cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible between x and z.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to consider the constraints and determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From these constraints:
- x is to the east and south of y
- y is to the west and north of z

Let me analyze what's possible by testing different configurations:

1. If y is at (0,0):
   - x must be somewhere in the southeast quadrant relative to y
   - z must be positioned such that y is in its northwest quadrant

The key insight is that while both x and z have positions constrained relative to y, their positions relative to each other are not fully determined.

By placing x and z at different locations that satisfy the given constraints, I can achieve all possible cardinal direction relations:

- N: x can be north of z
- NE: x can be northeast of z
- E: x can be east of z
- SE: x can be southeast of z
- S: x can be south of z
- SW: x can be southwest of z
- W: x can be west of z
- NW: x can be northwest of z
- B: x can be bounding or overlapping with z

The answer is: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
