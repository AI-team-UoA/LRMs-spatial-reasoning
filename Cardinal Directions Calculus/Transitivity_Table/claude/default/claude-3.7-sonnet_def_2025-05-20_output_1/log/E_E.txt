PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- x is E of y: This means that sup_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y).
- y is E of z: This means that sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y), and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z).

Now, I need to determine what these constraints imply about the relation between x and z.

From the first constraint: sup_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x)
From the second constraint: sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y)

By transitivity: sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x), so sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x).

This means that x is to the right of z on the x-axis, but I still need to determine their relation on the y-axis.

From the constraints:
- inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) (from x is E of y)
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z) (from y is E of z)

By transitivity: inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), so inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x).
By transitivity: sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z), so sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z).

Now, let's analyze what all these constraints together mean for the relation between x and z.

We know:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)
2. inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) 
3. sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z)

Looking at the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- E relation: requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z).
- NE relation: requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x).
- SE relation: requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z).

Let's analyze each case:

E relation:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) ✓
2. inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) ✓
3. sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z) ✓

So, E is a possible relation between x and z.

NE relation:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) ✓
2. sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) ?

We don't know this. We know inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), but we don't know whether sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x). This is possible but not guaranteed.

SE relation:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) ✓
2. sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z) ?

We don't know this. We know sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z), but we don't know whether sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z). This is possible but not guaranteed.

So, based on the given constraints, x could be E, NE, or SE of z.

Actually, I'm not entirely sure that's right. Let's re-examine the constraints carefully.

If x is E of y, then:
1. sup_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x) (x is to the right of y on the x-axis)
2. inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) (x and y overlap on the y-axis)

If y is E of z, then:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) (y is to the right of z on the x-axis)
2. inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z) (y and z overlap on the y-axis)

By transitivity, we know:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x), so sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)

But for the y-axis, is there a constraint? Let's see:

From x is E of y: inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y)
From y is E of z: inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z)

By transitivity, we get:
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), so inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x)
- sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z), so sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z)

Now, for the cardinal directions:
- E relation: requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z).
  From our derived constraints, this is satisfied. So E is a possible relation.

- NE relation: requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x).
  We know sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), but we haven't derived a constraint that ensures sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x). In fact, we have derived that inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), which doesn't tell us anything about whether sup_y(z) is less than or greater than inf_y(x).

- SE relation: requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z).
  We know sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), but we haven't derived a constraint that ensures sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z). In fact, we have derived that sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z), which doesn't tell us anything about whether sup_y(x) is less than or greater than inf_y(z).

Let's think about this differently. For two regions a and b, if a is E of b, then on the x-axis, a is strictly to the right of b. On the y-axis, they can overlap.

Now, if x is E of y and y is E of z, then on the x-axis, x is to the right of y, and y is to the right of z. This means x is to the right of z.

But on the y-axis, here are the possible configurations:
1. x, y, and z all overlap in some way.
2. x and y overlap, but x and z don't overlap, with x above z.
3. x and y overlap, but x and z don't overlap, with x below z.
4. y and z overlap, but x and y don't overlap, with x above y.
5. y and z overlap, but x and y don't overlap, with x below y.

Looking at cardinal direction relations:
- If x, y, and z all overlap on the y-axis, then x is E of z.
- If x is above z (i.e., inf_y(x) ≥ sup_y(z)), then x is NE of z.
- If x is below z (i.e., sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z)), then x is SE of z.

Actually, I'm realizing that there's a missing constraint. If x E y and y E z, it doesn't necessarily restrict the relative positions of x and z on the y-axis. They could be in any configuration on the y-axis.

Let's re-examine the constraints and think about specific examples. 

Let's consider the regions as axis-aligned rectangles for simplicity.
- Region z: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- Region y: [2, 3] × [0, 1] (y is E of z)
- Region x: [4, 5] × [0, 1] (x is E of y)

In this example, x is E of z.

But now, let's shift the regions on the y-axis:
- Region z: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- Region y: [2, 3] × [0, 1] (y is E of z)
- Region x: [4, 5] × [2, 3] (x is E of y)

In this example, x is NE of z.

Let's try another example:
- Region z: [0, 1] × [2, 3]
- Region y: [2, 3] × [1, 2] (y is E of z)
- Region x: [4, 5] × [0, 1] (x is E of y)

In this example, x is SE of z.

However, there's a potential issue with the third example. Let's double-check the definition of y E z:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) (y is to the right of z on the x-axis) ✓ (1 ≤ 2)
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z) (y and z overlap on the y-axis) ✗ (inf_y(z) = 2, inf_y(y) = 1, so inf_y(z) > inf_y(y))

So, the third example doesn't actually satisfy y E z. Let's reconsider.

For y to be E of z:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) (y is to the right of z on the x-axis)
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z) (y's y-extent is contained within z's y-extent)

Actually, I think I may have misunderstood the definition for the E relation. Let me re-check:

a E b if and only if 
1. sup_x(b) ≤ inf_x(a) (a is to the right of b on the x-axis)
2. inf_y(b) ≤ inf_y(a) and sup_y(a) ≤ sup_y(b) (a's y-extent is contained within b's y-extent)

With this definition, let's redo the examples:

1. Region z: [0, 1] × [0, 2]
   Region y: [2, 3] × [0.5, 1.5] (y is E of z)
   Region x: [4, 5] × [0.7, 1.3] (x is E of y)

   In this case, x is E of z because:
   - sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (1 ≤ 4)
   - inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z) (0 ≤ 0.7 and 1.3 ≤ 2)

2. Region z: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
   Region y: [2, 3] × [0, 0.5] (y is E of z)
   Region x: [4, 5] × [1.5, 2] (x is E of y)

   In this case, x's y-extent is above z's y-extent. Is x NE of z?

   For x NE z, we need:
   - sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (1 ≤ 4) ✓
   - sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) (1 ≤ 1.5) ✓

   So, x is NE of z.

3. Region z: [0, 1] × [1.5, 2]
   Region y: [2, 3] × [1, 1.5] (y is E of z)
   Region x: [4, 5] × [0, 0.5] (x is E of y)

   In this case, x's y-extent is below z's y-extent. Is x SE of z?

   For x SE z, we need:
   - sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (1 ≤ 4) ✓
   - sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z) (0.5 ≤ 1.5) ✓

   So, x is SE of z.

Wait, in the second example, I'm not sure if y is E of z. Let's check:

For y E z, we need:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) (1 ≤ 2) ✓
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) (0 ≤ 0) ✓
- sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z) (0.5 ≤ 1) ✓

So, y is indeed E of z.

In the third example, for y E z, we need:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) (1 ≤ 2) ✓
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) (1.5 ≤ 1) ✗

The conditions for y E z are not met in the third example. Let's propose a different example.

3. Region z: [0, 1] × [0, 2]
   Region y: [2, 3] × [0.5, 1.5] (y is E of z)
   Region x: [4, 5] × [0, 0.3] (x is E of y)

   For y E z, we need:
   - sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) (1 ≤ 2) ✓
   - inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) (0 ≤ 0.5) ✓
   - sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z) (1.5 ≤ 2) ✓

   For x E y, we need:
   - sup_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x) (3 ≤ 4) ✓
   - inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x) (0.5 ≤ 0) ✗

   So, the conditions for x E y are not met in this example either. Let's approach this systematically.

Given that:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) (from y E z)
2. sup_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x) (from x E y)

By transitivity, we know:
3. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x)

Also, from y E z, we know:
4. inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z)

And from x E y, we know:
5. inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y)

Combining 4 and 5, we get:
6. inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), so inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x)
7. sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z), so sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z)

Now, for cardinal direction relations:

- E relation: We know sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z). These satisfy the conditions for x E z.

But there's a restriction here. From 6 and 7, it's not guaranteed that inf_y(z) = inf_y(x) or sup_y(x) = sup_y(z). 

- NE relation: We know sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (from 3). For NE, we also need sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x). From the given constraints, we know inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) (from 6). However, there's no constraint that guarantees sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x). So, NE is a possibility, but not a guarantee.

- SE relation: We know sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (from 3). For SE, we also need sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z). From the given constraints, we know sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z) (from 7). However, there's no constraint that guarantees sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z). So, SE is a possibility, but not a guarantee.

- Other directions (like N, S, W, SW, NW): These are not possible given that sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), which places x strictly to the right of z on the x-axis.

Let's double check with concrete examples:

For x E z:
- Region z: [0, 1] × [0, 2]
- Region y: [2, 3] × [0.5, 1.5] (y is E of z)
- Region x: [4, 5] × [0.7, 1.3] (x is E of y)

For x NE z:
- Region z: [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- Region y: [2, 3] × [0.5, 1] (y is E of z)
- Region x: [4, 5] × [1.2, 1.8] (x is E of y)

For x SE z:
- Region z: [0, 1] × [1, 2]
- Region y: [2, 3] × [0.5, 1.5] (y is E of z)
- Region x: [4, 5] × [0, 0.3] (x is E of y)

Let's check the cardinal direction relations between x and z in each case.

For x E z:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (1 ≤ 4) ✓
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) (0 ≤ 0.7) ✓
- sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z) (1.3 ≤ 2) ✓

So, x is E of z in the first case.

For x NE z:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (1 ≤ 4) ✓
- sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) (1 ≤ 1.2) ✓

So, x is NE of z in the second case.

For x SE z:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) (1 ≤ 4) ✓
- sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z) (0.3 ≤ 1) ✓

So, x is SE of z in the third case.

This confirms that x can be E, NE, or SE of z given the conditions x E y and y E z.

Let me double-check my understanding of the definitions:

a E b if and only if:
1. sup_x(b) ≤ inf_x(a) (a is to the right of b on the x-axis)
2. inf_y(b) ≤ inf_y(a) (the bottom edge of a is above the bottom edge of b)
3. sup_y(a) ≤ sup_y(b) (the top edge of a is below the top edge of b)

a NE b if and only if:
1. sup_x(b) ≤ inf_x(a) (a is to the right of b on the x-axis)
2. sup_y(b) ≤ inf_y(a) (a is above b on the y-axis)

a SE b if and only if:
1. sup_x(b) ≤ inf_x(a) (a is to the right of b on the x-axis)
2. sup_y(a) ≤ inf_y(b) (a is below b on the y-axis)

If x E y and y E z, then:
1. sup_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y), which implies sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x).
2. inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x) and inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y), which implies inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x).
3. sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z), which implies sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z).

For x E z, we need:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) ✓
2. inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) ✓
3. sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z) ✓

So, x E z is a possibility.

For x NE z, we need:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) ✓
2. sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x)

The second condition is not guaranteed. Even if inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), it doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between sup_y(z) and inf_y(x). So, x NE z is a possibility (as our example showed), but it's not guaranteed.

Similarly, for x SE z, we need:
1. sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) ✓
2. sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z)

Again, the second condition is not guaranteed. Even if sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z), it doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between sup_y(x) and inf_y(z). So, x SE z is a possibility (as our example showed), but it's not guaranteed.

I think we need to further analyze the constraints. 

x E y gives us:
- inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x) (bottom edge of x is above bottom edge of y)
- sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) (top edge of x is below top edge of y)

y E z gives us:
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) (bottom edge of y is above bottom edge of z)
- sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z) (top edge of y is below top edge of z)

Combining the two:
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x) (bottom edge of x is above bottom edge of y, which is above bottom edge of z)
- sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z) (top edge of x is below top edge of y, which is below top edge of z)

This doesn't guarantee that x's y-extent is completely above or below z's y-extent. Based on the constraints, the y-extents of x and z can have any of the following relationships:
1. They can overlap (resulting in x E z).
2. They can be disjoint, with x above z (resulting in x NE z).
3. They can be disjoint, with x below z (resulting in x SE z).

The constraints from x E y and y E z make all three of these scenarios possible, but they don't dictate which one will occur.

I think we can conclusively say that given x E y and y E z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE, but not the others.

OK, let me be precise though. Let's go through all the possible cardinal directions and elimiinate all that can't be possible:

B (Bounded By): For x B z, we need inf_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), sup_x(x) ≤ sup_x(z), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z). However, from the given constraints, we know that sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), which means sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) ≤ sup_x(x). This contradicts the requirement that sup_x(x) ≤ sup_x(z) for x B z. So, x B z is not possible.

N (North): For x N z, we need sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), inf_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), and sup_x(x) ≤ sup_x(z). But from the given constraints, we know that sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), which contradicts the requirement that sup_x(x) ≤ sup_x(z) for x N z. So, x N z is not possible.

NE (North East): For x NE z, we need sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x). The first condition is satisfied based on the given constraints. The second condition, which requires that z is below x on the y-axis, is neither guaranteed nor contradicted by the constraints from x E y and y E z. So, x NE z is a possible relation.

E (East): For x E z, we need sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z). All three conditions are satisfied based on the derived constraints. So, x E z is a possible relation.

SE (South East): For x SE z, we need sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z). The first condition is satisfied based on the given constraints. The second condition, which requires that x is below z on the y-axis, is neither guaranteed nor contradicted by the constraints from x E y and y E z. So, x SE z is a possible relation.

S (South): For x S z, we need sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z), inf_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), and sup_x(x) ≤ sup_x(z). Similar to N, the requirement that sup_x(x) ≤ sup_x(z) contradicts the derived constraint that sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x). So, x S z is not possible.

SW (South West): For x SW z, we need sup_x(x) ≤ inf_x(z) and sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z). The second condition can be true, but the first one contradicts the derived constraint that sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x). So, x SW z is not possible.

W (West): For x W z, we need sup_x(x) ≤ inf_x(z), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint that sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x). So, x W z is not possible.

NW (North West): For x NW z, we need sup_x(x) ≤ inf_x(z) and sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x). The second condition can be true, but the first one contradicts the derived constraint that sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

To sum up, given the constraints from x E y and y E z, the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Let me quickly verify if I might have made an error in my analysis. 

For x E y and y E z:
- x E y implies sup_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y).
- y E z implies sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y), and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z).

From these, we can derive:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x), so sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x).
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), so inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x).
- sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z), so sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z).

For the possible relations between x and z:

- E relation requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z). All of these are satisfied based on the derived constraints.

- NE relation requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x). The first condition is satisfied. For the second, we know inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), but we don't have information about the relationship between sup_y(z) and inf_y(x). If sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), then x is NE of z. Otherwise, not.

- SE relation requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z). The first condition is satisfied. For the second, we know sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z), but we don't have information about the relationship between sup_y(x) and inf_y(z). If sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z), then x is SE of z. Otherwise, not.

- All other cardinal direction relations involve constraints that are either contradicted by the derived constraints or are not guaranteed.

So, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

So the answer is: E, NE, SE

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine what cardinal direction relationships are possible between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is E of y: This means sup_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y)
- y is E of z: This means sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y), and sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(y) ≤ inf_x(x), so sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x)
- inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(y) ≤ inf_y(x), so inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x)
- sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(y) ≤ sup_y(z), so sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z)

Checking possible relations:

E: Requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x), inf_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x), and sup_y(x) ≤ sup_y(z) - all are satisfied.

NE: Requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(z) ≤ inf_y(x) - first condition is satisfied, second is possible but not guaranteed.

SE: Requires sup_x(z) ≤ inf_x(x) and sup_y(x) ≤ inf_y(z) - first condition is satisfied, second is possible but not guaranteed.

Answer: E, NE, SE
