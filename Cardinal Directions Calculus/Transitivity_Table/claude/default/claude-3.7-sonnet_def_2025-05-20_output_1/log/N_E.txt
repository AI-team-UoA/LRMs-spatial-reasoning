PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We have:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is E of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let me recall the definitions of cardinal direction relations:

When x is N of y, this means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is within the horizontal extent of y)

When y is E of z, this means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is within the vertical extent of z)

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z based on the given information.

From x being N of y, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is within the horizontal extent of y)

From y being E of z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is within the vertical extent of z)

Now, let's try to combine these:

1. For the vertical relationship between x and z:
   - We know that supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
   - And infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is within the vertical extent of z)
   - Combining these, we get: 
     - supy(y) <= infy(x)
     - supy(y) <= supy(z)
   - This implies that x is above y, and y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent.
   - However, this doesn't directly tell us the vertical relationship between x and z.

2. For the horizontal relationship between x and z:
   - We know that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is within the horizontal extent of y)
   - And supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
   - Combining these, we get:
     - supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - This means x is to the right of z. So, horizontally, x is E of z.

Let's try to be more precise:

For x to be N of z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x). We know that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This suggests that it's possible for x to be N of z if supy(z) = supy(y), but it's also possible for x to not be strictly N of z if supy(z) > infy(x).

For x to be NE of z, we would need both supy(z) <= infy(x) (North component) and supx(z) <= infx(x) (East component). We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), so the East component is satisfied. The North component depends on the specific values, as discussed above.

For x to be E of z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the vertical extent of z). We don't have direct information about infy(x) and supy(x) relative to infy(z) and supy(z).

Let's see if I can narrow down the potential relations:

1. NE: This is possible if x is both to the right of z and above z.
2. E: This is possible if x is to the right of z and within the vertical extent of z.
3. SE: This is possible if x is to the right of z and below z.
4. N: This is possible if x is above z and within the horizontal extent of z.
5. NW: This doesn't seem possible given the constraints, as x has to be to the right of z.
6. W: This doesn't seem possible given the constraints.
7. SW: This doesn't seem possible given the constraints.
8. S: This doesn't seem possible with the given constraints.
9. B: This doesn't seem possible with the given constraints.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints. I think I might have made an error.

From x being N of y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally bounded by y)

From y being E of z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically bounded by z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about x's position relative to z:

For the horizontal position:
- We know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(y)
- This implies supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

For the vertical position:
- We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
- This doesn't give us a clear relation between infy(x) and supy(z), so we can't definitively say if x is to the north of z.

Let's consider all possible cases for the vertical position:

Case 1: supy(z) < infy(x)
In this case, x is to the north of z (above z). Combined with the horizontal position, x is NE of z.

Case 2: infy(x) <= supy(z)
In this case, there's some vertical overlap between x and z. Given the horizontal position, x is to the east of z.

Subcase 2.1: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
Here, x is vertically contained within z. So, x is E of z.

Subcase 2.2: infy(x) < infy(z)
Here, x extends below the bottom of z. Given the horizontal position, x can be E or NE of z, depending on the specific extent.

Subcase 2.3: supy(z) < supy(x)
Here, x extends above the top of z. Given the horizontal position, x can be E or NE of z, depending on the specific extent.

Hmm, I realize my analysis is still flawed. Even though we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), it doesn't directly relate infy(x) and supy(z). So, we can't directly deduce the N or NE relation based on these.

Let me re-approach this problem.

From the given constraints:
- Region x is N of region y, which means x is above y.
- Region y is E of region z, which means y is to the right of z.

Visually, we might think of it as:
```
   x
   ^
   |
z ---> y
```

But that's oversimplified, because regions have extents.

What we know is:
- x is above y (vertically separated)
- y is to the right of z (horizontally separated)

For the horizontal relationship between x and z:
- Since x is N of y, x's horizontal extent is within y's horizontal extent.
- Since y is E of z, y is to the right of z.
- This means x is either to the right of z or overlaps with z horizontally.

For the vertical relationship between x and z:
- x is above y.
- y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent.
- The relationship between x and z vertically is not clearly defined.

Given these insights, I would say the possible relations between x and z are:

1. NE: x is to the right and above z.
2. E: x is to the right and within the vertical extent of z.
3. SE: x is to the right and below z.
4. N: x is above and within the horizontal extent of z.
5. B: x is within the extent of z.

Wait, now I'm not sure about 3, 4, and 5. Let me verify based on the constraints.

For SE, x needs to be to the right and below z. But we know x is above y, and y's vertical extent is within z's. So, x isn't likely to be below z.

For N, x would need to be within the horizontal extent of z. But y is to the right of z, and x's horizontal extent is within y's. This suggests x is not within the horizontal extent of z.

For B, x would need to be contained within z. Given the constraints, this doesn't seem likely.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's step back and use the formal definitions directly.

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints, we can deduce:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
- These don't directly relate infy(x) and supy(z), so we can't say if x is N of z.

- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- This implies supx(z) <= infx(x), which is the condition for x being E of z.

Let's go relation by relation:

For NE: 
Required: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
We've deduced: supx(z) <= infx(x)
For supy(z) <= infy(x), we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). It's possible for supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true, but it's not guaranteed. So, NE is a possible relation.

For E:
Required: supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
We've deduced: supx(z) <= infx(x)
For the vertical condition, it's possible for x's vertical extent to overlap with z's. So, E is also a possible relation.

For SE:
Required: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
We've deduced: supx(z) <= infx(x)
For supy(x) <= infy(z), we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z). It's not guaranteed that supy(x) <= infy(z). In fact, it might contradict. So, SE is not a likely relation.

For N:
Required: supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
We've deduced: supx(z) <= infx(x)
Since infx(x) >= supx(z), it contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x within horizontal extent of z). So, N is not a possible relation.

For NW, W, SW, S, and B, the conditions also conflict with our deduced relation supx(z) <= infx(x) because it implies that x is to the east of z. So, these are not possible relations.

Trying to reason through this a bit more..

It seems like the most we can say definitively is that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z. This is the key constraint.

For the vertical relationship, it's a bit ambiguous based on the given constraints. For x to be north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(y) is the smaller of the two values. However, the relation between infy(x) and supy(z) is not clear. 

Actually, let's try a different approach. Let's create a scenario where all constraints are satisfied and see what relations are possible.

Scenario:
- z is at (0, 0) with extent 5 in both directions, so z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 5).
- y is to the east of z, so y can be at (6, 1) with extent 3 in both directions, making it span from (6, 1) to (9, 4).
- x is to the north of y, so x can be at (7, 5) with extent 1 in both directions, making it span from (7, 5) to (8, 6).

In this scenario, x has bounds (7, 5) to (8, 6) and z has bounds (0, 0) to (5, 5). The relation between x and z would be NE, as x is both to the north and to the east of z.

Let's try a different scenario:
- z is at (0, 0) with extent 7 in both directions, so z spans from (0, 0) to (7, 7).
- y is to the east of z, so y can be at (8, 3) with extent 2 in both directions, making it span from (8, 3) to (10, 5).
- x is to the north of y, so x can be at (9, 6) with extent 1 in both directions, making it span from (9, 6) to (10, 7).

In this scenario, x has bounds (9, 6) to (10, 7) and z has bounds (0, 0) to (7, 7). The relation between x and z would be NE again, as x is both to the north and to the east of z.

Let's see if I can create a scenario where x is E of z:
- z is at (0, 0) with extent 10 in the y-direction and 5 in the x-direction, so z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 10).
- y is to the east of z, so y can be at (6, 3) with extent 2 in both directions, making it span from (6, 3) to (8, 5).
- x is to the north of y, so x can be at (7, 6) with extent 1 in both directions, making it span from (7, 6) to (8, 7).

In this scenario, x has bounds (7, 6) to (8, 7) and z has bounds (0, 0) to (5, 10). The relation between x and z would be E, as x is to the east of z and vertically within the extent of z.

I think the key here is to recognize that the "N of" relation doesn't guarantee that a region is strictly north of the reference region's bounds; it could also be within the region's horizontal extent. Similarly, the "E of" relation doesn't guarantee that a region is strictly east of the reference region's bounds; it could also be within the region's vertical extent.

Let me try one more scenario to see if there are other possible relations:
- z is at (0, 0) with extent 5 in the x-direction and minimal extent in the y-direction, so z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 0.1).
- y is to the east of z, so y can be at (6, 0) with extent 2 in the x-direction and 0.1 in the y-direction, making it span from (6, 0) to (8, 0.1).
- x is to the north of y, so x can be at (7, 0.2) with extent 1 in both directions, making it span from (7, 0.2) to (8, 1.2).

In this scenario, x has bounds (7, 0.2) to (8, 1.2) and z has bounds (0, 0) to (5, 0.1). The relation between x and z would be NE, as x is both to the north and to the east of z.

It seems like the possible relations are NE and E. Let's double-check by examining the constraints once more.

For x to be N of y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally bounded by y)

For y to be E of z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically bounded by z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (from y E z and x N y)
This ensures that x is to the east of z. Given that x is to the east of z, the possible relations are NE, E, and SE.

But we also know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

For x to be NE of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). We can deduce from the constraints that supy(y) <= infy(x), but we don't have a direct relation between supy(z) and infy(x). However, the constraint supy(y) <= supy(z) might suggest that supy(z) is greater than or equal to supy(y). If that's the case, it's still unclear if supy(z) <= infy(x).

For x to be E of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z), but we don't have a direct relation between infy(y) and infy(x). The closest we have is supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y), which doesn't tell us anything about the relation between infy(y) and infy(x). Similarly, we don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and supy(z).

For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z), we would have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). To check if supy(x) <= infy(z), we would need information about supy(x) relative to supy(y) and infy(z) relative to infy(y).

Actually, wait. I think there's a scenario where x can be N of z as well:
- z is at (0, 0) with extent 10 in the x-direction and 5 in the y-direction, so z spans from (0, 0) to (10, 5).
- y is to the east of z, so its horizontal extent is beyond z, but its vertical extent is within z. Let's say y is at (15, 2) with extent 2 in both directions, making it span from (15, 2) to (17, 4).
- x is to the north of y, so its horizontal extent is within y, but it's above y. Let's say x is at (16, 5) with extent 1 in both directions, making it span from (16, 5) to (17, 6).

In this scenario, x has bounds (16, 5) to (17, 6) and z has bounds (0, 0) to (10, 5). The relation between x and z would be N, as x is to the north of z and within the horizontal extent of z.

Wait, that's not right. In this scenario, x is at (16, 5) to (17, 6) and z is at (0, 0) to (10, 5). They don't have a horizontal overlap, so x is not N of z. It's actually NE of z.

I think the key here is that when we say x is N of y, it means x's horizontal extent is within y's, and x is above y. Similarly, when y is E of z, y's vertical extent is within z's, and y is to the right of z.

With these constraints, we can deduce that x's horizontal extent is contained within y's, and y's horizontal extent is to the right of z's. This ensures that x's horizontal extent is to the right of z's. So, x is to the east of z (in the E, NE, or SE direction).

Vertically, x is above y, and y's vertical extent is within z's. This doesn't give us a clear vertical relation between x and z. Depending on the specific extents, x could be above, below, or vertically overlapping with z.

Given these insights, I believe the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE. But each of these needs further conditions.

Wait, for SE, one condition is supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z). This means supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). It's not guaranteed that supy(x) <= infy(z). In fact, given supy(y) <= infy(x), it's likely that supy(x) > infy(z), which would contradict the SE relation. So, I'm leaning towards saying SE is not a possible relation.

Again, for the N relation, one condition is infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we deduce from the constraints that supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, N doesn't seem to be a possible relation.

I think I'll try a new approach: I'll draw out the constraint regions and visualize the possible positions of x relative to z.

First, for y to be E of z, y has to be to the right of z, and y's vertical extent must be within z's vertical extent.

For x to be N of y, x has to be above y, and x's horizontal extent must be within y's horizontal extent.

Given these constraints, x is to the right of z (as it's within y's horizontal extent, which is to the right of z). Vertically, the relationship between x and z is a bit ambiguous:

- x can be above the entire z, which would give a NE relation.
- x can vertically overlap with z but still be to its right, which would give an E relation.
- It's not obvious if x can be entirely below z, which would give an SE relation, but I think not, given that x is above y, which is within z's vertical extent.

So, based on my analysis, I believe the possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Actually, no, I think SE is also possible. Let me walk through a scenario:

- z is at (0, 0) with extent 10 in the y-direction and 5 in the x-direction, so z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 10).
- y is to the east of z, so it's to the right of z and its vertical extent is within z's. Let's put y at (6, 1) with extent 2 in both directions, making it span from (6, 1) to (8, 3).
- x is to the north of y, so it's above y and its horizontal extent is within y's. Let's put x at (7, 4) with extent 1 in both directions, making it span from (7, 4) to (8, 5).

Now, in this scenario:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 10).
- y spans from (6, 1) to (8, 3).
- x spans from (7, 4) to (8, 5).

The relation between x and z here is E, as x is to the right of z and vertically within z.

Let's try another scenario:

- z is at (0, 0) with very limited extent in the y-direction, say 2, so z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 2).
- y is to the east of z, so it's to the right of z and its vertical extent is within z's. Let's put y at (6, 1) with very limited extent in the y-direction, making it span from (6, 1) to (8, 1.5).
- x is to the north of y, so it's above y and its horizontal extent is within y's. Let's put x at (6.5, 2) with extent 1 in both directions, making it span from (6.5, 2) to (7.5, 3).

Now, in this scenario:
- z spans from (0, 0) to (5, 2).
- y spans from (6, 1) to (8, 1.5).
- x spans from (6.5, 2) to (7.5, 3).

The relation between x and z here should be NE, as x is to the right of z and above z.

Let's try one more to see if I can  get an SE relation:

- z is at (0, 5) with extent 5 in both directions, so z spans from (0, 5) to (5, 10).
- y is to the east of z, so it's to the right of z and its vertical extent is within z's. Let's put y at (6, 7) with extent 2 in both directions, making it span from (6, 7) to (8, 9).
- x is to the north of y, but the "north" here means x is above y, not necessarily above the entire y. x's horizontal extent is also within y's. Let's put x at (6.5, 10.5) with extent 1 in both directions, making it span from (6.5, 10.5) to (7.5, 11.5).

Now, in this scenario:
- z spans from (0, 5) to (5, 10).
- y spans from (6, 7) to (8, 9).
- x spans from (6.5, 10.5) to (7.5, 11.5).

The relation between x and z here should be NE, as x is to the right of z and above z.

Hmm, I'm trying to think of a scenario where x would be SE of z...

- z is at (0, 5) with extent 5 in the x-direction but a very limited extent in the y-direction, so z spans from (0, 5) to (5, 5.1).
- y is to the east of z, which means it's to the right of z and its vertical extent is within z's. Given z's limited vertical extent, y's vertical extent is also limited. Let's put y at (6, 5) with very small extent in the y-direction, making it span from (6, 5) to (8, 5.1).
- x is to the north of y, so it's above y and its horizontal extent is within y's. Let's put x at (6.5, 5.2) with extent 1 in both directions, making it span from (6.5, 5.2) to (7.5, 6.2).

Now, in this scenario:
- z spans from (0, 5) to (5, 5.1).
- y spans from (6, 5) to (8, 5.1).
- x spans from (6.5, 5.2) to (7.5, 6.2).

The relation between x and z here should be NE, as x is to the right of z and above z.

I'm finding it hard to establish a scenario where x would be SE of z given the constraints. The issue is that when y is E of z, y's vertical extent is contained within z's. And when x is N of y, x is above y. So, x would most likely be either to the right and above z (NE) or to the right and vertically overlapping with z (E).

Ok, I've realized why SE is possible. It's defined as being to the east and south of the reference region. Let me revisit the definition:

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), so that's satisfied.

For the second condition, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). We know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From these, we can deduce: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x). It's not clear how supy(x) relates to infy(z). So, the SE relation is not ruled out definitively.

Let me think...

Actually, let's approach this a bit differently. Let's consider a simple visual:

```
  |
  v
z ----> y
  |
  ^
  x
```

This gives us a simple layout where y is E of z, and x is N of y. Intuitively, in this layout, x is to the NE of z. But, there could be variations of this layout.

Wait, I need to be careful. For y to be E of z, y's vertical extent is within z's, not the other way around. So the layout is more like:

```
     z
     |
     v
x <-- y
```

Here, y is to the east of z, and x is to the north of y. In this layout, x is to the NE of z.

Alright, as I've established, for y to be E of z, y's vertical extent is contained within z's vertical extent. And for x to be N of y, x's horizontal extent is contained within y's horizontal extent.

This means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (from y E z and x N y), which ensures x is to the east of z.
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z). 

To determine if x is SE of z, I need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z). This means infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). 

I think I see the issue. We're trying to determine if the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of z, which would make x SE of z. But the given constraints don't directly relate these two values.

Let's try a scenario where x is SE of z:
- z is at (0, 5) with a significant extent, say z spans from (0, 5) to (5, 10).
- y is to the east of z and its vertical extent is within z's, so y spans from (6, 7) to (8, 9).
- x is to the north of y and its horizontal extent is within y's. Let's say x spans from (6.5, 10) to (7.5, 11).

In this scenario, x is to the right of z, but it's also above z (given infy(x) = 10 and supy(z) = 10). This would actually make the relation between x and z as NE, not SE.

Let's try another scenario:
- z is at (0, 10) with a significant extent, say z spans from (0, 10) to (5, 15).
- y is to the east of z and its vertical extent is within z's, so y spans from (6, 12) to (8, 14).
- x is to the north of y and its horizontal extent is within y's. Let's say x spans from (6.5, 15) to (7.5, 16).

In this scenario, x is to the right of z, but it's also at the top of z (given infy(x) = 15 and supy(z) = 15). This would place x to the NE of z.

I'm trying to think of a scenario where x would be SE of z, but given the constraints, it seems like x would either be to the right of z (E), to the right and above z (NE), or to the right and at the same height as z (E). 

I'm not seeing a clear scenario where x would be below z, which is required for the SE relation.

Ok let me try a different approach. For clarity, I'll refer to the bounds of the regions as follows:
- z with bounds (z_min_x, z_min_y, z_max_x, z_max_y)
- y with bounds (y_min_x, y_min_y, y_max_x, y_max_y)
- x with bounds (x_min_x, x_min_y, x_max_x, x_max_y)

For y to be E of z, we have:
- z_max_x <= y_min_x
- z_min_y <= y_min_y and y_max_y <= z_max_y

For x to be N of y, we have:
- y_max_y <= x_min_y
- y_min_x <= x_min_x and x_max_x <= y_max_x

Now, from these, we can deduce:
- z_max_x <= y_min_x <= x_min_x (from y E z and x N y), which ensures x is to the east of z.
- y_max_y <= x_min_y (from x N y) and z_min_y <= y_min_y and y_max_y <= z_max_y (from y E z).

Let's try to determine if x can be SE of z:
For x to be SE of z, we need:
- z_max_x <= x_min_x (x is to the east of z)
- x_max_y <= z_min_y (x is to the south of z)

We've established z_max_x <= x_min_x, so that's true.

Now, for x_max_y <= z_min_y, we would need to relate x_max_y and z_min_y. From the given constraints, we know:
- y_max_y <= x_min_y (from x N y)
- z_min_y <= y_min_y (from y E z)

If we try to relate x_max_y and z_min_y based on these constraints, we might argue that x_max_y > x_min_y (as x has some vertical extent), and x_min_y >= y_max_y (from x N y). So, x_max_y > y_max_y.

We also know z_min_y <= y_min_y (from y E z), which doesn't directly relate z_min_y and y_max_y. However, if y has some vertical extent, y_min_y < y_max_y.

Given these relations, it's not clear whether x_max_y <= z_min_y. It depends on the specific values.

In fact, thinking about it logically, I don't think x can be SE of z given the constraints. Here's why:

1. x is N of y, which means x is above y.
2. y is E of z, which means y's vertical extent is within z's vertical extent.
3. Combined, this means that x is above y, and y is vertically contained within z. This suggests that x is either above the entire z, or x vertically overlaps with the upper part of z. It's hard to see how x would be entirely below z, which is required for the SE relation.

I think the possible relations between x and z, given the constraints, are NE and E. Let me double-check this with a few more scenarios.

For E relation:
- z spans from (0, 5) to (5, 15).
- y is to the east of z and vertically within z, so y spans from (6, 8) to (8, 12).
- x is to the north of y and horizontally within y, so x spans from (6.5, 13) to (7.5, 14).

In this scenario, x is to the right of z and vertically within z, which is the E relation.

For NE relation:
- z spans from (0, 5) to (5, 10).
- y is to the east of z and vertically within z, so y spans from (6, 7) to (8, 9).
- x is to the north of y and horizontally within y, so x spans from (6.5, 10) to (7.5, 11).

In this scenario, x is to the right of z and above z, which is the NE relation.

I'm trying to think of a scenario where x would be SE of z given the constraints, but it's not obvious. For x to be SE of z, we'd need x to be both to the east of z and below z. The constraint that y is E of z ensures that y's vertical extent is within z's. The constraint that x is N of y ensures that x is above y. Given these constraints, it seems challenging to position x such that it's below z.

Ok, let me try a more systematic approach: Let's consider a specific set of extents and see what relation between x and z emerges.

For z, let's say it spans from (0, 5) to (5, 10).
For y, it's E of z, so it's to the right of z and vertically within z. Let's say y spans from (6, 6) to (8, 9).
For x, it's N of y, so it's above y and horizontally within y. 

There are a few possibilities for x's placement:

1. x spans from (6.5, 10) to (7.5, 11).
   In this case, x is to the right of z and above z, which is the NE relation.

2. x spans from (6.5, 9.5) to (7.5, 10.5).
   In this case, x is to the right of z and partially overlaps with z vertically, but the top of x is above the top of z. This is also the NE relation.

3. x spans from (6.5, 8) to (7.5, 10).
   In this case, x is to the right of z and fully vertically within z, which is the E relation.

4. x spans from (6.5, 8) to (7.5, 9.5).
   In this case, x is to the right of z and vertically within z, which is the E relation.

5. x spans from (6.5, 9) to (7.5, 9.5).
   In this case, x is to the right of z and vertically within z, which is the E relation.

I'm finding it hard to place x such that it's both to the right of z and below z, which would be required for the SE relation. The constraint that x is N of y and y is E of z seems to restrict this possibility.

Let's try to place y at the very bottom of z and then place x just above y:

For z, it spans from (0, 5) to (5, 10).
For y, it's E of z, so it's to the right of z and vertically within z. Let's place y at the very bottom of z, so y spans from (6, 5) to (8, 6).
For x, it's N of y, so it's above y and horizontally within y. Let's place x just above y, so x spans from (6.5, 6.5) to (7.5, 7.5).

In this scenario, x is to the right of z and vertically within z, which is the E relation.

Let's try another approach. For the SE relation to be true, we'd need:
- z_max_x <= x_min_x (x is to the east of z)
- x_max_y <= z_min_y (x is to the south of z)

For y to be E of z, we have:
- z_max_x <= y_min_x
- z_min_y <= y_min_y and y_max_y <= z_max_y

For x to be N of y, we have:
- y_max_y <= x_min_y
- y_min_x <= x_min_x and x_max_x <= y_max_x

The condition x_max_y <= z_min_y for SE conflicts with other conditions. Specifically, y_max_y <= x_min_y (from x N y) and z_min_y <= y_min_y (from y E z). This implies z_min_y <= y_min_y < y_max_y <= x_min_y <= x_max_y, which contradicts x_max_y <= z_min_y.

So, the SE relation is not possible given the constraints.

Let's revisit the N relation, which requires:
- z_max_y <= x_min_y (x is to the north of z)
- z_min_x <= x_min_x and x_max_x <= z_max_x (x is horizontally within z)

We know z_max_x <= y_min_x <= x_min_x (from y E z and x N y), which contradicts x_max_x <= z_max_x unless x has zero horizontal extent. So, the N relation is not possible given the constraints.

Similarly, for NW, W, SW, B, or S relations, the horizontal component would require either x to have some overlap with z horizontally or x to be to the west of z. But we've established that x is to the east of z, so these relations are not possible.

For completeness, the condition for S is:
- x_max_y <= z_min_y (x is to the south of z)
- z_min_x <= x_min_x and x_max_x <= z_max_x (x is horizontally within z)

The horizontal component contradicts our established condition that x is to the east of z. So, the S relation is not possible.

So, from what I can determine, the possible relations between x and z given the constraints are NE and E. 

Let me double-check one more time for clarity. For y to be E of z, we have:
- z_max_x <= y_min_x (y is to the right of z)
- z_min_y <= y_min_y and y_max_y <= z_max_y (y is vertically contained within z)

For x to be N of y, we have:
- y_max_y <= x_min_y (x is above y)
- y_min_x <= x_min_x and x_max_x <= y_max_x (x is horizontally contained within y)

From these constraints, we can deduce for x and z:
- z_max_x <= y_min_x <= x_min_x (ensuring x is to the east of z)

Regarding the vertical component, all we can say from the constraints is:
- y_max_y <= x_min_y (from x N y)
- z_min_y <= y_min_y and y_max_y <= z_max_y (from y E z)

But, with the constraints, how does z_max_y relate to x_min_y? There are two possible scenarios:
1. z_max_y < x_min_y, which means x is above z. This gives the NE relation.
2. x_min_y <= z_max_y, which means there's some vertical overlap between x and z. The relation here could be E, but it depends on how much overlap.

So, based on that, it seems like the possible relations are still NE and E.

Actually, let's just be more precise, for all regions a, the greatest lower bound of the projection of a on the x-axis (similarly in y-axis) is denoted by infx(a) (similarly infy(a)). The least upper bound or the supremum of the projection of a on the x-axis (similarly in y-axis) is denoted by supx(a) (similarly supy(a)). I'll use this notation to be clearer.

From the constraints, we have:
- For y to be E of z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
- For x to be N of y: supy(y) <= infy(x) and infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).

From these, we can infer for the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): This means x is to the east of z.
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z): This doesn't tell us directly how supy(z) compares to infy(x). But the two valid cases are:
  a. supy(z) < infy(x): In this case, x is to the north of z, which would mean the relation is NE.
  b. infy(x) <= supy(z): In this case, x and z overlap vertically but x is to the east of z, so the relation is E.

So, based on that, it seems like the possible relations are indeed NE and E.

Let me summarize:

1. NE (Northeast): x is both to the east and to the north of z. This happens when supx(z) <= infx(x) (east component) and supy(z) < infy(x) (north component).
2. E (East): x is to the east of z and overlaps with z vertically. This happens when supx(z) <= infx(x) (east component) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (vertical overlap).

Given the constraints, both of these relations are possible, depending on the exact extents of the regions.

But wait, I just realized something. For the E relation, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (i.e., x is vertically confined within z). We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z). But these don't directly ensure infy(z) <= infy(x). Actually, given infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), there's a chain infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which does ensure that infy(z) <= infy(x). So the first condition for E is satisfied.

But wait, for the E relationship we also need supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z), but we don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and supy(y). So, we can't assert with certainty that supy(x) <= supy(z). It still is possible though.

So, I think the possible relations between x and z, given the constraints, are still NE and E, depending on the exact extents of the regions.

Actually, since we are looking for all possible relationships, and there are some configurations where x can have a strictly E relationship to z, and other configurations where x can have a strictly NE relationship to z, the possible relationships are NE and E.

So the answer is NE and E.

ANSWER:

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is E of region z

Let me determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the first condition, for x to be N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally bounded by y)

From the second condition, for y to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically bounded by z)

From these constraints, I can determine:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z

For the vertical relationship:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

This gives us two possible scenarios:
1. If supy(z) < infy(x): x is completely above z → NE relation
2. If infy(x) <= supy(z): x has some vertical overlap with z → E relation

The possible relations between x and z are: E, NE
