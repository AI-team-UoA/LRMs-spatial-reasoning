PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step using the definitions provided.

We have:
- Region x is SE of region y, which means: 
  - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
  - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

- Region y is S of region z, which means:
  - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
  - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

Now we need to figure out what these constraints tell us about the possible relationship between x and z.

First, let's look at the y-coordinates:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)

By transitivity: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
So supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z on the y-axis.

Next, let's look at the x-coordinates:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

Combining these: infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)
So infx(z) < infx(x), but we don't have a definite relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).

Given what we know:
1. x is definitely to the south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z))
2. x might be to the east of z if supx(z) <= infx(x)
3. x might overlap with z on the x-axis if infx(x) < supx(z)

This gives us the following possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:
- S (South): if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- SE (South-East): if supx(z) <= infx(x)
- SW (South-West): This is not possible because we know infx(z) < infx(x), so x cannot be entirely to the west of z.
- B (Bounding box): This is not possible because we know supy(x) <= infy(z), so x cannot intersect with z.

Let me double-check by drawing this out. If x is SE of y and y is S of z, we have:

```
        z
        |
        |
        y
       /
      /
     x
```

In this simple diagram, x is SE of y, and y is S of z. Looking at the possible positions of x relative to z:
- If x is shifted far enough to the right, it would be SE of z.
- If x is more directly below z (but still to the right of y), it would be S of z.

Actually, let's be more careful here. We know that:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From x being SE of y, we know x is to the right of y, but we don't know exactly how far right it extends. And from y being S of z, we know that y's x-range is contained within z's x-range.

Let's analyze the possible relationships more carefully:

1. South (S): For x to be S of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-range is contained within z's x-range)
   
   We know infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) < infx(x).
   But we don't know the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z), so S is possible but not guaranteed.

2. Southeast (SE): For x to be SE of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
   
   We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but we can't determine if supx(z) <= infx(x). So SE is possible but not guaranteed.

3. Southwest (SW): For x to be SW of z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've established)
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   
   We know infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) < infx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) needed for SW. So x cannot be SW of z.

4. South-Southwest (SSW) or South-Southeast (SSE): These are not among the basic cardinal directions defined.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. The problem statement doesn't specify that we're working with the exact 9 basic cardinal directions. It's asking for the possible basic relations out of the 9 defined (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE).

Let me revisit the reasoning:

From x SE y and y S z, we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), so x is below z on the y-axis.

Now, let's look at the x-axis:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

So we know: infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)
Which gives us: infx(z) < infx(x)

But we don't have a definite relationship between supx(x) and supx(z), or between supx(z) and infx(x).

This leaves several possibilities for the relationship between x and z on the x-axis:
1. x could be completely to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x))
2. x could partially overlap with z on the x-axis (infx(x) < supx(z) and infx(z) < infx(x))
3. x's x-range could be contained within z's x-range (infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z))

Hmm, I need to be more precise here.

Actually, we know from x SE y and y S z that:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's rightmost point is to the left or at z's rightmost point)

But we cannot derive a direct relationship between infx(x) and supx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z).

Let's try to enumerate the possible cases using the combined constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) (x starts to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right boundary is at or to the left of z's right boundary)

There are a couple of possibilities:

Case 1: supx(z) <= infx(x)
This would mean x is completely to the right of z.
Relations: SE (South-East)

Case 2: infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
This would mean x overlaps with z on the x-axis, but x's x-range is entirely within z's x-range.
Relations: S (South)

Case 3: infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(z) < supx(x)
This would mean x overlaps with z on the x-axis, but x extends further right than z.
In this case, x cannot be categorized as just one of the basic cardinal directions relative to z. It would be a combination, like "S:SE".

Actually, let's step back. We know that x is completely below z on the y-axis. For the x-axis, there are multiple possibilities:

1. x is completely to the right of z on the x-axis (supx(z) <= infx(x)).
   Relation: SE

2. x's x-range is completely contained within z's x-range (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)).
   Relation: S

3. z's x-range is completely contained within x's x-range (infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x)).
   This contradicts infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), so it's not possible.

4. x and z partially overlap on the x-axis, with x extending further right (infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x)).
   In this case, x would be partly S and partly SE of z, giving the relation "S:SE".

5. x and z partially overlap on the x-axis, with x extending further left (infx(x) < infx(z) < supx(x) < supx(z)).
   This contradicts infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), so it's not possible.

But I'm not seeing any mention of composite relations in the problem statement. The question is asking for single-tile cardinal direction relations from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Actually, now I see the definition of a cardinal direction relation just before the definition of the basic relations:

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

So it seems that composite relations like "S:SE" are valid.

Going back to our analysis, the possible relations between x and z can be:
1. S: if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
2. SE: if supx(z) <= infx(x)
3. S:SE: if infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x)

But again, the problem asks for "which could be the possible relations", so it's looking for the set of individual relations that are possible, not composite relations.

Actually, let me rethink this. We've established:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z on the y-axis)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) (x starts to the right of z's left boundary)

But now I'm wondering if it's possible for x to be directly below and to the left of z (SW).

Let's see:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x to be SW of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

We already know that supy(x) <= infy(z) from our transitive reasoning.
For supx(x) <= infx(z), we need to check if this is consistent with our other constraints.

We know: infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)
This directly contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z), so x cannot be SW of z.

What about W (West)? For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-range is contained within z's y-range)

We already found that supx(x) <= infx(z) is inconsistent, so x cannot be W of z.

What about NW (North West)? For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z on the y-axis)

Again, supx(x) <= infx(z) is inconsistent, so x cannot be NW of z.

What about N (North)? For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z on the y-axis)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-range is contained within z's x-range)

But we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which directly contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x), so x cannot be N of z.

What about NE (North East)? For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z on the y-axis)

But we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x), so x cannot be NE of z.

What about E (East)? For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-range is contained within z's y-range)

We already know that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x), so x cannot be E of z.

What about B (Bounding box)? For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-range is contained within z's x-range)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-range is contained within z's y-range)

But we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x), so x cannot be B of z.

So, based on our analysis, the only possible relations between x and z are:
1. S: if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
2. SE: if supx(z) <= infx(x)
3. S:SE: if infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x)

Now, I need to clarify if the problem is asking for single-tile relations or if it's asking for general relations, including composite ones.

From the context and the way the problem is posed, I believe it's asking for the set of single-tile cardinal direction relations that are possible.

In that case, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (South)
- SE (South East)

But now I'm noticing the following in the problem statement: "A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk". This suggests that a cardinal direction relation can be a composite of single-tile relations.

However, the problem asks for "which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?". This is a bit ambiguous.

Just to be safe, I'll list all possibilities:
- S (South): if x's x-range is completely contained within z's x-range.
- SE (South East): if x is completely to the right of z on the x-axis.
- S:SE: if x partially overlaps with z on the x-axis, with x extending further right.

But again, I think the problem is likely asking for the set of possible single-tile relations, which is at most S and SE.

Actually, let me try one more approach to make sure I'm not missing any possibility. Let's trace through the constraints again:

1. x SE y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)

2. y S z:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-range is contained within z's x-range)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) (x starts to the right of z's left boundary)

Now, let's consider the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z) on the x-axis:

1. If supx(x) <= supx(z), then x's x-range is contained within or at the boundary of z's x-range. Along with the fact that x is below z, this means x is S of z.

2. If supx(z) < supx(x), there are further cases to consider:
   a. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is completely to the right of z. Along with the fact that x is below z, this means x is SE of z.
   b. If infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x), then x partially overlaps with z on the x-axis, with x extending further right. This would give a composite relation S:SE.

But there's a constraint I derived earlier: infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(x) is already to the right of supx(y). So, for case 2a, we need to check if it's consistent that supx(z) <= infx(x).

We know supx(y) <= supx(z) from y S z, and supx(y) <= infx(x) from x SE y. So infx(x) >= supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't definitively tell us if supx(z) is less than, equal to, or greater than infx(x).

So, based on our constraints, both cases 1 and 2 (with subcases a and b) are possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- S (South): if supx(x) <= supx(z) (case 1)
- SE (South East): if supx(z) <= infx(x) (case 2a)
- S:SE: if infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x) (case 2b)

Specifically, the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations are S and SE.

Alright, I think I've been overthinking this. The problem is asking for the possible relations between regions x and z, given the constraints. The relations defined in the problem are the 9 basic cardinal direction relations: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE.

From our analysis, the only possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- S (South)
- SE (South East)

I don't believe the problem is asking for composite relations, but rather the possible configurations given the constraints.

Let me summarize: Given that region x is SE of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are S (South) and SE (South East).

Actually, one question I have: throughout all my earlier analysis, I've verified that x cannot be in relation B, SW, W, NW, N, NE, or E with respect to z. But is it possible for x to be in a composite relation involving these, like "S:E" or "S:B"?

Given my earlier reasoning, I doubt it. The constraint that x is SE of y, and y is S of z, already restricts x's possible position relative to z. We've established that x is definitely to the south of z and is either directly below z or to the southeast of it.

But let me check the possibility of a composite relation like "S:E" (South-East):

For x to have a component that is E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the x-axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-range is contained within z's y-range)

But we've already established supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, a composite relation involving E is not possible.

Similarly, for all the other basic relations, we've already checked and found them to be inconsistent with our constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are only:
- S (South)
- SE (South East)
- and potentially composite relation S:SE, if that's within the scope of the question.

Since in my composite relation S:SE, "S:SE", the only single-tile relations involved are S and SE, my final answer is that the possible single-tile relations between region x and region z are S and SE.

So the answer:
S, SE

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

S, SE
