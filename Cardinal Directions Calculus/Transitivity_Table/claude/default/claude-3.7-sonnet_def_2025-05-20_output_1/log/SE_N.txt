PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This question asks about the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
1. Region x is SE of region y
2. Region y is N of region z

Let's analyze what each given relation means:

1. x is SE of y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
   - This means x is to the east (right) and south (below) of y

2. y is N of z means: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - This means y is to the north (above) of z
   - And y's x-extent is within z's x-extent (or equal to it)

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z.

First, we know:
- x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- y's x-extent is within z's x-extent: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining these:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x SE y]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [from y N z]

This doesn't fully determine the relationship between x and z in the east-west direction. x could be:
- east of z (E, NE, SE) if supx(z) < infx(x)
- overlapping with z in the east-west direction if infx(x) <= supx(z)

For the north-south relationship:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [from y N z]

From these, we can't directly determine the north-south relationship between x and z. x could be:
- north of z (N, NE, NW)
- south of z (S, SE, SW)
- overlapping with z in the north-south direction (E, W, B)

Let's think more systematically:

Given that x is SE of y and y is N of z, we need to determine the possible positions of x relative to z.

For x to be SE of y:
- x must be to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- x must be to the south of y: supy(x) <= infy(y)

For y to be N of z:
- y must be to the north of z: supy(z) <= infy(y)
- y's x-extent is contained within z's x-extent: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's determine the possible positions of x relative to z.

First, for the east-west relationship:
- We know x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- We know y's east extent is not greater than z's east extent: supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, we can't conclusively determine if x is to the east of z or overlaps with z's east-west extent. So, x could be to the east of z or overlapping with z in the east-west direction.

Actually, let's be even more precise. From supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we can't directly compare infx(x) and supx(z). So, there are two possibilities:
1. infx(x) > supx(z), which means x is strictly to the east of z. In this case, x could be in relations E, NE, or SE with z.
2. infx(x) <= supx(z), which means x and z might overlap in the east-west direction. Here, we need to further analyze.

Similarly, for the north-south relationship:
- We know x is to the south of y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- We know y is to the north of z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can't directly determine the north-south relationship between x and z. We need to compare supy(x) and supy(z).

Actually, let's be careful about this. If supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), we can't directly compare supy(x) and supy(z). So, we have two possibilities for the north-south relationship:
1. supy(x) > supy(z), which means the south extent of x is greater than the south extent of z.
2. supy(x) <= supy(z), which means the south extent of x is less than or equal to the south extent of z.

Similarly, we need to compare infy(x) and infy(z) for the north extent.

Hmm, I need to be a bit more methodical here.

Let's think in terms of the possible positions of x relative to z based on the given constraints.

Given:
- x is SE of y, which means x is to the east and south of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is N of z, which means y is to the north of z and its x-extent is within z's x-extent: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x SE y]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [from y N z]

This doesn't fully determine the relationship between x and z in the east-west direction. But we can say that if supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), then there's a possibility that supx(z) < infx(x), which would make x to the east of z. But there's also a possibility that they overlap in the east-west direction.

For the north-south relationship:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y]
- supy(z) <= infy(y) [from y N z]

Again, this doesn't fully determine the relationship. There's a possibility that supy(x) <= supy(z), which would make x to the south of z. But there's also a possibility that they overlap in the north-south direction.

Now, let's see which of the cardinal direction relations are possible given these constraints.

Let's actually try a few examples to see if specific cardinal relationships between x and z are possible.

1. Can x be N of z?
   For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   Given our constraints, it's hard to say if supy(z) <= infy(x). But if x is SE of y, it's likely that x is south of y, which makes it hard for x to be north of z. Let's say this is unlikely but I need to check more carefully.

Wait, let's approach this differently. Let's visualize the constraints and see the possible positions.

Given:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is N of region z

This means x is to the southeast of y, and y is to the north of z.

One possible arrangement would be:
```
   y
  /
 /
x       z
```

But this doesn't seem right, because if y is N of z, then y should be directly above z, not to the side.

Let's try again:
```
   y
   |
   |
   z
 /
/
x
```

Hm, but then x would be SW of z, which doesn't seem right either.

One more try:
```
   y
   |
   |
   z   x
```

Actually, I think when we're given these cardinal direction relations, we're not given constraints for regions to be in specific corners, but for them to be anywhere in the specified region. Let me use a different approach.

If region y is N of region z, then y is somewhere in the north tile of z. Similarly, if region x is SE of region y, then x is somewhere in the southeast tile of y.

Let's visualize the 9 tiles for a region:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | B | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

So, if y is in the N tile of z, and x is in the SE tile of y, then where can x be relative to z?

Well, if y is in the N tile of z, then y is above z. And if x is in the SE tile of y, then x is to the southeast of y. So x could be:

1. To the northeast of z (if x is far enough to the east).
2. To the east of z (if x overlaps with z in the north-south direction).
3. To the southeast of z (if x is far enough to the south and east).
4. Directly to the north of z (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is above z).
5. Inside the bounding box of z (if x overlaps with z in both directions).
6. To the south of z (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is below z).

Actually, now I'm wondering if it's possible for x to be anywhere to the west. But if y is N of z and x is SE of y, then it's hard to imagine x could be NW, W, or SW of z. Because y's x-extent is within z's x-extent (from y N z), and x is to the east of y (from x SE y), it seems like x could only be to the east of the western boundary of z. But I need to check if it's possible for x to be to the west of z's eastern boundary.

Wait, let's backtrack. I've been thinking of the regions as points, but they're more general than that. Let's break this down more carefully.

Given:
1. Region x is SE of region y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. Region y is N of region z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For the east-west relationship between x and z:
- We know x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- We know y's x-extent is within z's x-extent: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we can say supx(y) is less than or equal to both infx(x) and supx(z), but we can't directly determine the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). 

For the north-south relationship between x and z:
- We know x is to the south of y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- We know y is to the north of z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

From supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), both supy(x) and supy(z) are less than or equal to infy(y), but we can't directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Actually, I think I've been approaching this too restrictively. Let's expand on all possible configurations...

Given that x is SE of y and y is N of z:

1. If x is sufficiently to the southeast of y, and y is right above z, then x could be E of z, SE of z, or even overlap with z (B relation).

2. If y is large and slightly to the left (while still being N of z), then x could even be to the north of z (NE relation).

3. Conversely, if y is large and slightly to the right (while still being N of z), then x could be to the south of z (S relation).

So, given the constraints, x could potentially be in relations NE, E, SE, S, or B with z. I'm not sure about N and I doubt that W, NW, and SW are possible.

But actually this is not rigorous enough. Let's try to be very precise about the possible locations of x given the constraints.

Given:
1. x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

We know supx(y) <= infx(x) from (1). From (2), we have supx(y) <= supx(z). So, it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), making x to the east of z. We also know supy(x) <= infy(y) from (1) and supy(z) <= infy(y) from (2). But we can't directly conclude supy(z) <= infy(x). It's possible if supy(z) <= supy(x) <= infy(x), for instance. So, NE is a possible relation.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-extent is within z's y-extent)

As before, supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible. For the y-extent condition, it's hard to determine directly from the given constraints. But it's possible for x's y-extent to overlap with z's y-extent in various ways, one of which corresponds to the E relation. So, E is a possible relation.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

As before, supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible. For supy(x) <= infy(z), we know supy(x) <= infy(y) from (1). But we don't have a direct relationship between infy(y) and infy(z) from the given constraints. It's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), especially if y is high above z. So, SE is a possible relation.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-extent is within z's x-extent)

We've already discussed the possibility of supy(x) <= infy(z). For the x-extent condition, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) from (1) and infx(z) <= infx(y) from (2). But we can't directly determine if infx(z) <= infx(x). Similarly, we know supx(y) <= supx(z) from (2), but we don't have a direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z) from the given constraints. So it's hard to say definitively, but S might be a possible relation.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-extent is within z's x-extent)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-extent is within z's y-extent)

As discussed, it's hard to determine directly from the given constraints if x's x-extent can be within z's x-extent. Similarly, for the y-extent. But it's possible for x to overlap with z in various ways, one of which corresponds to the B relation. So, B is a possible relation.

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-extent is within z's x-extent)

We've already discussed the possibility of supy(z) <= infy(x) and the difficulty in determining if x's x-extent can be within z's x-extent. But given the constraints, it's possible for x to be N of z, especially if y is large and slightly to the left. So, N is a possible relation.

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-extent is within z's y-extent)

From (1), we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of y. From (2), we know infx(z) <= infx(y), which means y starts to the east of z's western boundary (or coincides with it). Combining these, it's hard to imagine how x, which is to the east of y, could be to the west of z, unless there's a very specific arrangement.

Let me think about it. We have supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), so that means infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). For x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But from  infx(z) <= infx(x), we have infx(x) >= infx(z). So for supx(x) <= infx(z) to be true, we would need supx(x) <= infx(x), which is not possible for a valid region (because the infimum is supposed to be less than or equal to the supremum).

Actually, let me correct myself here. The constraint we have is supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y), not infx(y) <= infx(x). Let's be very careful with the constraints.

From (1), we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From (2), we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's x-extent is within z's x-extent)

So, for x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But from the constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). If we assume infx(y) <= supx(y) (which is true for valid regions), then we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't immediately tell us the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z), but it's hard to see how supx(x) <= infx(z) can be true.

Actually let's go step-by-step. We are trying to check if x can be W of z. 

We know 
- supx(y) <= infx(x) 
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) 

For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). But I don't see a chain of inequalities that can lead to supx(x) <= infx(z). In fact, if we combine supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can't derive a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and infx(z).

Let's think about this graphically. If y is N of z, then y is above z. And if x is SE of y, then x is to the southeast of y. Given that y's x-extent is within z's x-extent (from y N z), it seems like x, being to the east of y, would typically be either to the east of z or overlapping with z, but not to the west of z.

Actually, I'm not convinced that x CAN'T be W of z given the constraints. Let me try to construct an example where x is W of z.

Let's consider:
- y = [1, 3] × [4, 6] (x-extent [1, 3], y-extent [4, 6])
- z = [0, 4] × [0, 3] (x-extent [0, 4], y-extent [0, 3])

With these, y is N of z because supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 4, infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1, and supx(y) = 3 <= supx(z) = 4.

Now, for x to be SE of y and W of z, we need:
- supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) = 4 (from x SE y)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) = 0 (from x W z)

But this is impossible, because we've stated that infx(x) must be at least 3, and supx(x) must be at most 0. But for a valid region, supx(x) >= infx(x), which means 0 >= 3, which is false.

So, based on this, it seems like x cannot be W of z given the constraints.

Similarly, we can check for NW and SW. Can x be NW of z?

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

We've already shown that supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible given the constraints. So, NW is not a possible relation.

Can x be SW of z?

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

Again, supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible given the constraints. So, SW is not a possible relation.

After going through all the possibilities, it seems that the possible relations between x and z given that x is SE of y and y is N of z are:
- NE
- E
- SE
- S
- B
- N

Let me actually check if N is possible. For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-extent is within z's x-extent)

We know supy(z) <= infy(y) from (2) and supy(x) <= infy(y) from (1). But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). It's possible for supy(z) <= infy(x) if, for instance, supy(z) <= supy(x) <= infy(x).

For the x-extent condition, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) from (1) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) from (2). But this doesn't immediately give us infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). 

Let's check if infx(z) <= infx(x). We know infx(z) <= infx(y) from (2), but we don't have a direct relationship between infx(y) and infx(x) from the given constraints.

Ugh, this is getting very complicated.

Let's take a step back. We have:
- x is SE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is N of z: supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

If x is SE of y, and y is N of z, let's try to reason graphically.

If y is N of z, then y is somewhere above z, with its x-extent contained within z's x-extent.

If x is SE of y, then x is somewhere to the southeast of y, which means it's to the east and south of y.

Given that y's x-extent is within z's x-extent, and x is to the east of y, it's plausible for x to be to the east of z or overlap with z's x-extent.

Given that y is to the north of z, and x is to the south of y, it's plausible for x to be to the north of z, overlap with z's y-extent, or be to the south of z.

It makes sense that x can be in relations NE, E, SE, S, or B with z.

Oh, let me check N as well. If x is to the south of y (from x SE y) and y is to the north of z (from y N z), it's not immediately clear if x can be to the north of z. Let's visualize:

```
   y
   |
   x
   |
   z
```

In this case, x would be somewhere between y and z in the north-south direction. If x is below y (supy(x) <= infy(y)) and z is below y (supy(z) <= infy(y)), then it's possible for x to be above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)).

For x to be N of z, its x-extent should also be contained within z's x-extent:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Given that y's x-extent is contained within z's x-extent (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)) and x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)), it's not immediately clear if x's x-extent can be contained within z's x-extent.

Actually, I think it's clear that x cannot be to the west of z, because x is to the east of y, and y's entire x-extent is within z's x-extent. So, if x's eastern boundary is to the east of y's western boundary, and y's western boundary is to the east (or equal to) z's western boundary, then x's eastern boundary is to the east of z's western boundary. This means x cannot be completely to the west of z. So, W, NW, and SW are not possible.

But could x be within z's x-extent (as required for N)? If supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), does that mean supx(x) <= supx(z)? Not necessarily.

In fact, let's construct an example where x is not within z's x-extent:
- y = [1, 2] × [4, 5]
- z = [0, 3] × [0, 3]

Here, y is N of z because supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 4, infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1, and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3.

For x to be SE of y, we need:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) = 4

We could set:
- x = [4, 5] × [2, 3]

Here, supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 4 and supy(x) = 3 <= infy(y) = 4, so x is SE of y.

But x's x-extent [4, 5] is not contained within z's x-extent [0, 3] because supx(x) = 5 > supx(z) = 3. So, x cannot be N of z in this example.

Actually, this example also shows that x is E of z (not NE, SE, or B). So, E is indeed a possible relation.

Oh wait, I'm not sure my example was right.

Is x [4, 5] × [2, 3] E of z [0, 3] × [0, 3]?
For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4 (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2 and supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 3 (x's y-extent is within z's y-extent)

Yes, all these are satisfied, so x is E of z in this example.

I've established that x can be E of z, and I intuitively think NE, SE, S, and B are also possible. But I haven't rigorously checked NE, SE, S, and B yet.

Actually, I already showed that x cannot be in the tiles NW, W, or SW relative to z, because x must be to the east of y, and y's x-extent is contained within z's x-extent.

To check N: For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-extent is within z's x-extent)

We've already seen that x's x-extent may not be contained within z's x-extent. But it's worth checking if it's possible for x to be N of z if we adjust the example.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Using our example:
- z = [0, 3] × [0, 3]
- supx(z) = 3
- supy(z) = 3

For x to be NE of z:
- infx(x) >= 3
- infy(x) >= 3

We could set:
- x = [4, 5] × [4, 5]

With this, infx(x) = 4 > supx(z) = 3 and infy(x) = 4 > supy(z) = 3, so x is NE of z.

And to check if this configuration satisfies our original constraints:
- y = [1, 2] × [4, 5] (which is N of z)
- x = [4, 5] × [4, 5]

For x to be SE of y, we need:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 4 (which is true)
- supy(x) = 5 <= infy(y) = 4 (which is false)

So this doesn't work. Let's adjust:
- x = [4, 5] × [3, 4]

Now, infx(x) = 4 > supx(z) = 3 and infy(x) = 3 = supy(z) = 3, which doesn't strictly satisfy the infy(x) > supy(z) condition for NE.

Let me try again:
- z = [0, 3] × [0, 3]
- y = [1, 2] × [4, 5] (which is N of z)
- x = [4, 5] × [3.5, 4]

Here, supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 4 and supy(x) = 4 <= infy(y) = 4, so x is SE of y.
Also, supx(z) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4 and supy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 3.5, so x is NE of z.

So NE is also a possible relation. This was much trickier than I initially thought!

For SE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

For S, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-extent is within z's x-extent)

For B, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-extent is within z's x-extent)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-extent is within z's y-extent)

Let me check SE first:
- z = [0, 3] × [0, 3]
- y = [1, 2] × [4, 5] (which is N of z)

For x to be SE of y and SE of z, we need:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) = 4 (from x SE y)
- supx(z) = 3 <= infx(x) (from x SE z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) = 0 (from x SE z)

The last condition, supy(x) <= infy(z) = 0, seems impossible to satisfy because supy(x) must be a positive number. Let me reconsider.

Wait, infy(z) is not 0, it's the y-coordinate of the bottom of z, which is 0. So, for x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) <= 0, which means x must be completely below z.

Let's try:
- z = [0, 3] × [3, 6]
- y = [1, 2] × [7, 8] (which is N of z)
- x = [4, 5] × [1, 2]

Here, supy(z) = 6 <= infy(y) = 7, infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1, and supx(y) = 2 <= supx(z) = 3, so y is N of z.
Also, supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 4 and supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 7, so x is SE of y.
Finally, supx(z) = 3 <= infx(x) = 4 and supy(x) = 2 <= infy(z) = 3, so x is SE of z.

So, SE is also a possible relation.

Now, let's check S:
- z = [0, 3] × [3, 6]
- y = [1, 2] × [7, 8] (which is N of z)

For x to be SE of y and S of z, we need:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) = 7 (from x SE y)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) = 3 (from x S z)
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) = 3 (from x S z)

The last condition, supx(x) <= supx(z) = 3, seems hard to satisfy given that infx(x) >= supx(y) = 2. But it's possible if infx(x) is close to 2 and supx(x) is close to 3.

Let's try:
- z = [0, 3] × [3, 6]
- y = [1, 2] × [7, 8] (which is N of z)
- x = [2.1, 3] × [1, 2]

Here, y is N of z (as before).
Also, supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2.1 and supy(x) = 2 <= infy(y) = 7, so x is SE of y.
Finally, supy(x) = 2 <= infy(z) = 3, infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 2.1, and supx(x) = 3 <= supx(z) = 3, so x is S of z.

So, S is also a possible relation.

Lastly, let's check B:
- z = [0, 3] × [0, 6]
- y = [1, 2] × [7, 8] (which is N of z)

For x to be SE of y and B of z, we need:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) = 7 (from x SE y)
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) = 3 (from x B z)
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) = 6 (from x B z)

Let's try:
- z = [0, 3] × [0, 6]
- y = [1, 2] × [7, 8] (which is N of z)
- x = [2.1, 3] × [3, 5]

Here, y is N of z (as before).
Also, supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2.1 and supy(x) = 5 <= infy(y) = 7, so x is SE of y.
Finally, infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 2.1, supx(x) = 3 <= supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 3, and supy(x) = 5 <= supy(z) = 6, so x is B of z.

So, B is also a possible relation.

Lastly, let's check N:
- z = [0, 3] × [0, 3]
- y = [1, 2] × [4, 5] (which is N of z)

For x to be SE of y and N of z, we need:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) (from x SE y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) = 4 (from x SE y)
- supy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) (from x N z)
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) = 3 (from x N z)

As before, the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) = 3 seems hard to satisfy given that infx(x) >= supx(y) = 2, especially if we also have infy(x) >= supy(z) = 3 and supy(x) <= infy(y) = 4. This restricts x to be very narrow horizontally and very flat vertically.

Let's try:
- z = [0, 3] × [0, 3]
- y = [1, 2] × [4, 5] (which is N of z)
- x = [2.1, 3] × [3.1, 4]

Here, y is N of z (as before).
Also, supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2.1 and supy(x) = 4 <= infy(y) = 4, so x is SE of y.
Finally, supy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 3.1, infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 2.1, and supx(x) = 3 <= supx(z) = 3, so x is N of z.

So, N is also a possible relation.

So, given this analysis, the possible relations between x and z when x is SE of y and y is N of z are:
- NE
- E
- SE
- S
- B
- N

NW, W, and SW are not possible.

Actually, I am wondering about a way to visualize why some directions are not possible. First, we should think about the  constraint "y is north of z". That means z's tile 1 (North) is occupied by y. Given that y's x-extent is within z's x-extent, y occupies a portion of z's North tile.

Now, if x is SE of y, it means x is in the SE tile or sector of y. x is to the southeast of y, but given that y is already to the north of z, x could be:
- To the northeast of z (if x is far enough to the east).
- Directly to the east of z (if x overlaps with z in the north-south direction).
- To the southeast of z (if x is far enough to the south and east).
- Directly to the north of z (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is above z).
- Inside the bounding box of z (if x overlaps with z in both directions).
- Directly to the south of z (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is below z).

x is to the east of y, and y's x-extent is within z's x-extent, so x's western bound is to the east of y's eastern bound, which is still within z's x-extent. This means x can't be entirely to the west of z. Hence, NW, W, and SW are not possible.

So, the answer to the given question is: NE, E, SE, S, B, N are the possible relations.

Actually, I think I was thinking too complicatedly. Let me visualize y as a region inside the "N" tile of z, and visualize the "SE" tile of y.

```
    N-tile of z
  +-------------+
  |      y      |
  |     +-+     |
  |     | |     |
  +-----+-+-----+
  |     |SE of y|
  |     +---+   |
  |         |   |
  |     x   |   |
  |         |   |
  +---------+---+
```

In this diagram, I show y as a region completely within the North tile of z. The southeastern part of y, or the SE tile of y, can overlap with parts of z in the E, SE, NE, B, N, and S tiles. And x, being in the SE tile of y, can be in any of those tiles relative to z. But it seems hard for x to be in the W, NW, or SW tiles of z.

So, the answer is: NE, E, SE, S, B, N are the possible relations.

Let's check these results one more time:

1. NE: If x is sufficiently to the east of y, and y is to the north of z, then x can be to the northeast of z. This is possible.

2. E: If x is to the east of y, and y's x-extent is within z's x-extent, then x can be to the east of z if it overlaps with z in the north-south direction. This is possible.

3. SE: If x is to the southeast of y, and y is to the north of z, then x can be to the southeast of z if it's far enough to the south. This is possible.

4. S: If x is to the south of y, and y's x-extent is within z's x-extent, then x can be to the south of z if it overlaps with z in the east-west direction. This is possible.

5. B: If x is to the southeast of y, and y's x-extent is within z's x-extent, then x can be inside the bounding box of z if it overlaps with z in both directions. This is possible.

6. N: If x is to the southeast of y, and it's close to y in the north-south direction, and y is to the north of z, then x can be to the north of z if it's still above z. This is possible.

7. NW: If x is to the east of y (from x SE y), and y's x-extent is within z's x-extent (from y N z), then it's hard for x to be to the west of z. This is not possible.

8. W: Same reasoning as for NW. This is not possible.

9. SW: Same reasoning as for NW and W. This is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z when x is SE of y and y is N of z are:
- NE
- E
- SE
- S
- B
- N

ANSWER:

Looking at the given constraints:
1. Region x is SE of region y
2. Region y is N of region z

I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

When x is SE of y, we know:
- x is to the east of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x))
- x is to the south of y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y))

When y is N of z, we know:
- y is to the north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- y's x-extent is within z's x-extent (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z))

Based on these constraints, let me determine the possible relations:

1. Since x is to the east of y, and y's x-extent is within z's x-extent, x could be to the east of z (E) or its x-extent could overlap with z's x-extent.

2. Since x is to the south of y, and y is to the north of z, x could be to the north of z, to the south of z, or its y-extent could overlap with z's y-extent.

The possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (if x is to the east of z and to the north of z)
- E (if x is to the east of z and overlaps with z in the north-south direction)
- SE (if x is to the east of z and to the south of z)
- N (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is to the north of z)
- B (if x's extent falls within z's bounding box)
- S (if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction and is to the south of z)
