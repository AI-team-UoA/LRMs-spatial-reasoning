PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down what we know:
1. Region x is NW of region y: x NW y
2. Region y is NE of region z: y NE z

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

- x NW y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's analyze the constraints that these relations impose on the regions x, y, and z:

From x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): x is to the left of y
- supy(y) <= infy(x): x is above y

From y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): z is to the left of y
- supy(z) <= infy(y): z is below y

Let's combine these constraints to determine the possible spatial relationships between x and z:

For the x-axis:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y NE z)

This doesn't directly constrain the relationship between x and z on the x-axis. x could be to the left of z, z could be to the left of x, or they could overlap on the x-axis.

For the y-axis:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y): x is above y
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z): z is below y

Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is above z.

So, based on the y-axis constraint, x is above z. But the relationship on the x-axis is not constrained. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z could be:

- x NW z: if x is to the left of z and above z
- x N z: if x overlaps with z on the x-axis (infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)) and x is above z
- x NE z: if x is to the right of z and above z

Let's double-check each of these:

For x NW z:
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- We already know supy(z) <= infy(x), so the y-axis constraint is satisfied.
- For the x-axis, we don't have a direct constraint, so this is a possibility.

For x N z:
- We need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- We already know supy(z) <= infy(x), so the y-axis constraint is satisfied.
- For the x-axis, we don't have direct constraints, so this is a possibility.

For x NE z:
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- We already know supy(z) <= infy(x), so the y-axis constraint is satisfied.
- For the x-axis, we don't have a direct constraint, so this is a possibility.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. Let's draw out the constraints more explicitly.

From x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): x is to the left of y
- supy(y) <= infy(x): x is above y

From y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): z is to the left of y
- supy(z) <= infy(y): z is below y

Now, the possible relations between x and z:

1. x NW z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the left of z
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z

2. x N z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) && supx(x) <= supx(z): x is within z on the x-axis
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z

3. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): x is to the right of z
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z

4. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the left of z
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) && supy(x) <= supy(z): x is within z on the y-axis

Let's check if these are consistent with our constraints:

For the y-axis, we've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is above z. This rules out any relation where x is below or at the same level as z, so relations like S, SE, SW, B, E, W are ruled out. This leaves only N, NE, and NW as possibilities.

For the x-axis:
- If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the left of z, which would make x NW z.
- If infx(z) <= infx(x) && supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is within z on the x-axis, which would make x N z.
- If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the right of z, which would make x NE z.

Let's check if any of these x-axis conditions are ruled out by our constraints:

From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), we can see that both x and z are to the left of y. But we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between x and z on the x-axis.

So, based on our analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NW z
- x N z
- x NE z

Let me further verify this. 

Actually, let's be more rigorous and use the minimum bounding box representations of the regions to visualize the constraints.

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

For the x-axis, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the left of y)

This means both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative position to each other on the x-axis is not constrained. x could be to the left of z, z could be to the left of x, or they could overlap on the x-axis.

For the y-axis, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is above z.

So, based on the y-axis constraint, x is always above z. But on the x-axis, there are three possibilities:
1. x is to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z), which would make x NW z.
2. x and z overlap on the x-axis: infx(z) <= supx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(z), which would make x N z.
3. x is to the right of z: supx(z) <= infx(x), which would make x NE z.

Let's double-check the possibility of x N z. For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z (which we know is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection.

Actually, no. The definition of x N z is:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): This isn't correct. The N relation doesn't require x's projection to be within z's projection.

Let me revisit the definition for N:
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

Applying this to x N z, we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z (which we've established is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x): z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary
- supx(x) <= supx(z): x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary

This would mean x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection.

Actually, let's go back to basics. The relation N is defined as:
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

So, for x N z, we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): z's top boundary is below x's bottom boundary, which means x is above z.
- infx(z) <= infx(x): z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary.
- supx(x) <= supx(z): x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary.

The last two conditions together imply that z's width (on the x-axis) encompasses x's width.

Let's think about this more intuitively:

1. x NW z: x is to the left and above z.
2. x N z: x is above z and z's width encompasses x's width.
3. x NE z: x is to the right and above z.

Given our constraints, we know that x is above z, but the x-axis relationship is not constrained. Therefore, all three relations (NW, N, NE) are possible.

Actually, I think I was overthinking this, so I will simplify the problem. 

We have that x NW y (x is nortwest of y) and y NE z (y is northeast of z). 

We need to figure out the possible relations between x and z. In other words, where can z be with respect to x?

Let's begin with some diagrams. 

x NW y means:
x is above and to the left of y:
```
x
  y
```

y NE z means:
y is above and to the right of z:
```
  y
z
```

Combining these:
```
x
  y
z
```

or 

```
x
  y
 z
```

or 

```
 x
  y
z
```

These diagrams suggest that x can be to the left, right, or directly above z, but x is always above z. Thus, the possible relations are:
- x NW z (x is to the left and above z)
- x N z (x is directly above z)
- x NE z (x is to the right and above z)

But let's verify this more rigorously:

From x NW y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): x is to the left of y
- supy(y) <= infy(x): x is above y

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): z is to the left of y
- supy(z) <= infy(y): z is below y

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) => supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z
- supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y): Both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative positions on the x-axis are undetermined.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NW z: if x is to the left and above z
- x N z: if x is directly above z
- x NE z: if x is to the right and above z

But when would these happen? Let's determine the conditions:

For x NW z:
- We need supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z).
- We already know supy(z) <= infy(x) from our derivation.
- For x to be to the left of z, we'd need an additional constraint on the x-axis.

For x N z:
- We need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- We already know supy(z) <= infy(x).
- The conditions on the x-axis would require z's width to encompass x's width.

For x NE z:
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z).
- We already know supy(z) <= infy(x).
- For x to be to the right of z, we'd need an additional constraint on the x-axis.

Now, are there any constraints from our original relations that would rule out any of these three possibilities? Let's see:

From x NW y and y NE z, we derived that both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative positions on the x-axis are undetermined. This means x could be to the left of z, z could be to the left of x, or their x-projections could overlap in various ways.

So, based on the given constraints, all three relations (NW, N, NE) between x and z are possible.

Alright, so I was correct in my earlier analysis. The possible relations between x and z are:
- x NW z
- x N z
- x NE z

Let me just double-check the definition of the N relation again:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For x N z, we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z (which we've established is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x): z extends further to the left than x
- supx(x) <= supx(z): z extends further to the right than x

This means x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection. I need to check if this is consistent with our constraints.

From x NW y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y), and from y NE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y). This means both x and z are to the left of y. But we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between x and z on the x-axis. z could extend further to the left than x, and z could also extend further to the right than x (while still being to the left of y). So, x N z is still a possibility.

Alright, I verify that the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NW z
- x N z
- x NE z

Actually, let me re-examine the relation N more carefully. 

The definition of a N b is:
- supy(b) <= infy(a): a is above b
- infx(b) <= infx(a): b's left boundary is to the left of a's left boundary
- supx(a) <= supx(b): a's right boundary is to the left of b's right boundary

Applying this to x N z, we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z (which we've established is true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x): z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary
- supx(x) <= supx(z): x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary

The last two conditions together imply that x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection, not the other way around as I mistakenly stated.

Now, let's check if this is consistent with our constraints.

From x NW y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y), and from y NE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y). This means both x and z are to the left of y. But we don't have a direct constraint on the relationship between x and z on the x-axis. z could have its left boundary to the left of x's left boundary, and z could also have its right boundary to the right of x's right boundary (while still being to the left of y). So, x N z is still a possibility.

Great! I've verified that the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NW z
- x N z
- x NE z

Hm, wait, let me actually map out the constraints a bit more carefully to ensure this is correct.

We have x NW y, which means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): x is to the left of y
- supy(y) <= infy(x): x is above y

We have y NE z, which means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y): z is to the left of y
- supy(z) <= infy(y): z is below y

I think there's a mistake in my previous analysis. Let's reconsider. The diagram for x NW y and y NE z would look something like:

```
x
  y
z
```

From the constraints, we know:
- x is always to the left of y (supx(x) <= infx(y))
- z is always to the left of y (supx(z) <= infx(y))
- x is always above y (supy(y) <= infy(x))
- z is always below y (supy(z) <= infy(y))

Combining the y-axis constraints:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
- This gives supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is always above z.

For the x-axis, we know both x and z are to the left of y, but their positions relative to each other aren't constrained. x could be to the left of z, z could be to the left of x, or they could overlap in various ways, all while staying to the left of y.

Now, let's revisit the possible relations between x and z:

1. x NW z: 
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the left of z
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z
   
   We know x is above z. The other condition (x is to the left of z) is a specific case of the x-axis relationship between x and z. It's possible but not guaranteed.

2. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z
   - infx(z) <= infx(x): z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary
   - supx(x) <= supx(z): x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary
   
   We know x is above z. The other conditions require z's width to encompass x's width. This is another specific case of the x-axis relationship between x and z. It's possible but not guaranteed.

3. x NE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x): x is to the right of z
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z
   
   We know x is above z. The other condition (x is to the right of z) is yet another specific case of the x-axis relationship between x and z. It's possible but not guaranteed.

4. x W z:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the left of z
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) && supy(x) <= supy(z): x and z overlap on the y-axis
   
   Given that we know x is above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), the y-axis condition for W isn't satisfied.

And similarly for the other relations.

So, from our analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NW z
- x N z
- x NE z

This confirms my earlier conclusion.

Actually, I'm not being precise with the definition of the N relation. Let me revisit the definition:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

Given that x N z, let me restate this:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above z
- infx(z) <= infx(x): z extends further to the left than x (or starts at the same position)
- supx(x) <= supx(z): z extends further to the right than x (or ends at the same position)

The last two conditions together do indeed imply that z's width on the x-axis encompasses x's width. Let's visualize:

```
   x
zzzzzz
```

In this diagram, z's width encompasses x's width.

Now, let's check if this is consistent with our constraints.

From x NW y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y), and from y NE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the left of y). This means both x and z are to the left of y. For x N z to be possible, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which means z's width encompasses x's width. This is a specific arrangement among many possible ones, given our constraints. Since there's no direct constraint on the relationship between x and z on the x-axis, x N z is indeed a possibility.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NW z: if x is to the left and above z
- x N z: if x is above z and z's width encompasses x's width
- x NE z: if x is to the right and above z

All three of these are consistent with the given constraints.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y: x NW y
- Region y is NE of region z: y NE z

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y): x is to the left of y
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x): x is above y

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y): z is to the left of y
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y): z is below y

Combining these constraints:
- From the y-axis constraints: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x is always above z.
- On the x-axis, both x and z are to the left of y, but their relative positions to each other are not constrained.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:

NW, N, NE
