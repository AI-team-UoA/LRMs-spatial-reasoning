PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's solve this step-by-step.

We know that:
- x is E of y: This means that supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y is S of z: This means that supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now we want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let me draw a picture to understand the constraints better:

For x being E of y:
- x is to the east of y
- x can extend north or south as long as it stays within the y-bounds (infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y))

For y being S of z:
- y is to the south of z
- y can extend east or west as long as it stays within the z-bounds (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z))

Now, since we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is E of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y is S of z)

We can deduce that:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

But this doesn't necessarily tell us the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z).

Let's consider the y-coordinate constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x is E of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y is S of z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x is E of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y is S of z)
- Therefore, supy(x) <= infy(z)

This means x is below z in terms of y-coordinate. 

Based on these constraints, the possible relationships between x and z are:
- SE: if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which fits our derived constraints
- S: if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which can also fit our constraints
- SW: if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which might be possible if supx(y) is sufficiently smaller than infx(z)
- E: if supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've derived that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So E is not possible.

But wait, I need to be careful here. Let me think more systematically.

From x is E of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y is S of z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's first consider the x-coordinate:
From supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we can't directly compare infx(x) and supx(z). So x could be to the east, west, or within the x-bounds of z.

Now for the y-coordinate:
From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we get supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is below z in terms of y-coordinate, so x could be S, SW, or SE of z.

But there's a further constraint. Since infx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), this constrains where x can be.

Actually, let me approach this differently. Let's think about the possible positions of x in relation to z, considering the given constraints.

If x is S of z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've derived)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Are these consistent with our constraints?
From y is S of z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). From x is E of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). These don't directly give us a constraint on infx(z) vs infx(x), so the first part of the S condition is possible.

For the second part, from y is S of z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z). From x is E of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). These don't directly give us a constraint on supx(x) vs supx(z), so the second part of the S condition is also possible.

So, S is a possible relation.

If x is SE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

Are these consistent with our constraints?
The second part, supy(x) <= infy(z), we've already derived. For the first part, from y is S of z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z). From x is E of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). These don't directly give us a constraint on supx(z) vs infx(x), so the SE condition is possible.

So, SE is a possible relation.

If x is SW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

Are these consistent with our constraints?
The second part, supy(x) <= infy(z), we've already derived. For the first part, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x). We need to check if there's a scenario where supx(x) <= infx(z). But if we combine the constraints, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), which doesn't directly give us a constraint on supx(x) vs infx(z).

So, SW might also be a possible relation, but we need to check if it's consistent with all constraints.

Actually, I notice that there's a constraint I haven't fully utilized. From x is E of y, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x). From y is S of z, we know that infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

So, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) (the middle inequality is because y is a region, so infx(y) < supx(y))

This implies infx(z) < infx(x), which means x cannot be SW of z (since SW requires supx(x) <= infx(z), which would imply infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z), contradicting our derived constraint).

So, SW is not a possible relation between x and z.

Let's check E:
If x is E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've already derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, E is not a possible relation.

Let's check NE:
If x is NE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, NE is not a possible relation.

Let's check N:
If x is N of z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, N is not a possible relation.

Let's check NW:
If x is NW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). Also, we've derived infx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not a possible relation.

Let's check W:
If x is W of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've derived infx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not a possible relation.

Let's check B (bounding box):
If x is B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, B is not a possible relation.

Hmm, let me double-check both S and SE. For S, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We derived supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) < infx(x), which is consistent with the first two conditions of S. We haven't derived any constraint on supx(x) vs supx(z), but the S relation requires supx(x) <= supx(z). So, S is definitely a possibility.

For SE, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x). We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which satisfies the first condition. The second condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), isn't directly implied by our constraints. From y is S of z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z). And from x is E of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). These don't directly tell us if supx(z) <= infx(x). So, SE is still a possibility.

So, based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are S and SE.

Let me double-check both of these using the basic constraints:

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we've derived)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For the second part, we want to check if infx(z) <= infx(x). We have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is S of z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is E of y)

These don't directly tell us about infx(z) vs infx(x). But, from x is E of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). And regions are such that infx(y) < supx(y). So, infx(y) < infx(x). Combined with infx(z) <= infx(y), we get infx(z) < infx(x), which satisfies the first condition of S.

And for supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have any direct constraint. But from y is S of z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z). From x is E of y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). Again, these don't directly tell us about supx(x) vs supx(z). So, S is a possibility if supx(x) <= supx(z).

Just to summarize, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is S of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y is S of z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is E of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is E of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x is E of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y is S of z)

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) < infx(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let me think about the constraints on supx(x) vs supx(z). We don't have a direct constraint, but if supx(x) > supx(z), then x would extend more to the east than z.

Actually, I think I made a logical error above. Let me revisit the SW relation more carefully.

I argued that SW is not a possible relation because we derived infx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts the SW condition supx(x) <= infx(z). But this is only a contradiction if infx(x) >= supx(x). However, a region is such that infx(x) < supx(x). So, it's still possible that infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z), which is indeed a contradiction. So, SW is not a possible relation, as I initially reasoned.

Now, let's revisit the S relation. For S, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've derived the first two, but the third is not directly implied. It's possible that supx(x) > supx(z), making x extend more to the east than z, in which case the relation wouldn't be S.

Actually, let me reconstruct the logic for the possible relations more carefully.

From the given constraints:
- x is E of y: This means supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is S of z: This means supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is below z in terms of y-coordinate.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This means x is to the east of infx(z). But we don't know how supx(x) compares with supx(z) or infx(z).

Given these constraints, let's check each possible relation:

For S:
- supy(x) <= infy(z): Satisfied.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) && supx(x) <= supx(z): The first part is satisfied. The second part, supx(x) <= supx(z), isn't directly implied. If supx(x) <= supx(z), then S is a possible relation. If supx(x) > supx(z), then S is not possible. So, S is a possibility.

For SE:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) && supx(z) <= infx(x): The first part is satisfied. For the second part, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't directly tell us about supx(z) vs infx(x). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then SE is a possible relation. If supx(z) > infx(x), then SE is not possible. So, SE is a possibility.

For SW:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) && supx(x) <= infx(z): The first part is satisfied. For the second part, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This implies infx(z) < infx(x), which in turn implies infx(z) < supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW is not a possible relation.

For E:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) && infy(z) <= infy(x) && supy(x) <= supy(z): We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, E is not a possible relation.

For NE, N, NW:
- Since supy(x) <= infy(z), and these relations require x to be above z, none of these are possible.

For W:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) && infy(z) <= infy(x) && supy(x) <= supy(z): We've derived infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not a possible relation.

For B:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) && supx(x) <= supx(z) && infy(z) <= infy(x) && supy(x) <= supy(z): We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, B is not a possible relation.

So, based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are S and SE, depending on how supx(x) compares with supx(z) and how supx(z) compares with infx(x).

Actually, I realized that we have some additional constraints. From x is E of y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

And from y is S of z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

From supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we can say that both infx(x) and supx(z) are greater than supx(y). But we can't directly compare infx(x) and supx(z).

Similarly, from infx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), we can say that both infx(x) and infx(z) are related to infy(y), but we can't directly compare them.

From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we can say that supy(x) <= infy(z). And since for any region, infy(z) < supy(z), we have supy(x) < supy(z).

So, the constraints we have are:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x is E of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y is S of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y is S of z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x is E of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (derived)
- supy(x) < supy(z) (derived)

But these constraints still don't definitively tell us if supx(x) <= supx(z) (required for S) or supx(z) <= infx(x) (required for SE).

In fact, I think both scenarios are plausible:

Scenario 1: supx(x) <= supx(z). In this case, the relation would be S.
Scenario 2: supx(z) <= infx(x). In this case, the relation would be SE.
Scenario 3: supx(z) > infx(x) and supx(x) > supx(z). In this case, the relation would be neither S nor SE. 

And on further thought I realize there's a fourth scenario: regions x and z may overlap. Let's check this:

For S: 
Region x in the S of z, we should have supy(x) <= infy(z), which we derived, and also infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We have already shown that infx(z) < infx(x) (from infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)). But we don't have a definite relation for supx(x) vs supx(z). If supx(x) <= supx(z), then the relation is S. 

For SE: 
Region x in the SE of z, we should have supy(x) <= infy(z), which we derived, and also supx(z) <= infx(x). But as mentioned, we don't have a definite relation for supx(z) vs infx(x). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then the relation is SE.

For B:
As I mentioned above, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) && supx(x) <= supx(z) && infy(z) <= infy(x) && supy(x) <= supy(z). We have derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, B is not a possible relation.

For E:
We need supx(z) <= infx(x) && infy(z) <= infy(x) && supy(x) <= supy(z). Similarly, supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, E is not a possible relation.

Now for the other directions:

For N:
We need supy(z) <= infy(x) && infx(z) <= infx(x) && supx(x) <= supx(z). But supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) < supy(z) (for any region) implies supy(x) < supy(z). This gives us supy(x) < supy(z) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction since supy(x) >= infy(x) (for any region). So, N is not a possible relation.

For NE:
We need supx(z) <= infx(x) && supy(z) <= infy(x). Using the same logic as for N, supy(x) < supy(z) <= infy(x) is a contradiction. So, NE is not a possible relation.

For NW:
We need supx(x) <= infx(z) && supy(z) <= infy(x). We already showed that infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not a possible relation.

For W:
We need supx(x) <= infx(z) && infy(z) <= infy(x) && supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, supx(x) <= infx(z) is contradicted by our derivation. So, W is not a possible relation.

For SW:
We need supx(x) <= infx(z) && supy(x) <= infy(z). The second part is satisfied, but the first part, supx(x) <= infx(z), is contradicted by our derivation. So, SW is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations between x and z are S and SE, depending on how supx(x) compares with supx(z) and how supx(z) compares with infx(x). 

Actually, I also realized there might be another possibility. Our derived constraint infx(z) < infx(x) doesn't preclude the possibility of a more complex overlap. Let me think about this more carefully.

Wait, in the above, I had argued that:

From our constraints, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) < infx(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z).

The first one tells us that the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z. The second one tells us that the top boundary of x is below the bottom boundary of z. This means that x is to the southeast of z in some sense. However, the exact relation depends on how the other boundaries compare.

If supx(x) <= supx(z), it means the right boundary of x doesn't extend beyond the right boundary of z. In that case, x is to the south of z. So the relation is S.

If supx(z) <= infx(x), it means the right boundary of z is to the left of the left boundary of x. In that case, x is to the southeast of z. So the relation is SE.

But there's a third case: if infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z), it means x starts to the right of the left boundary of z, but extends beyond the right boundary of z. This doesn't fit neatly into the S or SE relations. Let me think about what relation this could be.

Actually, I think I need to review the definitions of the cardinal direction relations, specifically about mutual exclusivity.

From the problem statement:
If region x is S of region z, then:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (top of x is below the bottom of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within the bounds of z)

If region x is SE of region z, then:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the right and below z)

Let's consider the third case I mentioned: infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z).
This doesn't fit the SE relation because it violates supx(z) <= infx(x).
It also doesn't fit the S relation because it violates supx(x) <= supx(z).

But let me double-check the definitions in the problem statement. A cardinal direction relation is defined as "an expression R1: ... : Rk", where 1 <= k <= 9 and Ri are distinct elements from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. This suggests that a region can have a composite relation with respect to another region.

Given our third case, it seems like region x overlaps with the S and E tiles of region z. So, the relation could be S:E. But upon closer inspection, the S tile is defined as having infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), while the E tile is defined as having supx(z) <= infx(x) (among other constraints). These are contradictory, so a region can't simultaneously be in both the S and E tiles of another region.

Actually, this is where our definitions might not capture all possible relative positions. In the third case, region x isn't wholly in the S tile of z because it extends beyond the right boundary of z. But it also isn't wholly in the SE or E tiles of z because it starts to the right of the left boundary of z, which violates the condition for SE and E. I think we need to be more specific about how a region can straddle multiple tiles.

Upon further reflection, I think a region can be in specific tiles with respect to another region. So the third case I mentioned should result in a combined relation. Region x occupies both the S and SE tiles of region z. So the relation could be expressed as S:SE.

But I need to check if this fits the problem's definition: a cardinal direction relation as "an expression R1: ... : Rk", where 1 <= k <= 9 and Ri are distinct elements from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. And a region a falls into a tile Ri(b) with respect to region b. And a1 ∪ ... ∪ ak ∈ REG, which means that is valid. So I have to figure out how to adapt this definition to our case. 

Let's see, it says: "there are regions a1, ..., ak ∈ REG, where a1 ∈ R1(b), ..., ak ∈ Rk(b)". So it says that a region a can be expressed as a union of other regions a1, ..., ak, where each ai is entirely in tile Ri of the other region b.

In our case, this means that if region x overlaps both the S and SE tiles of region z, then x can be expressed as x = x1 ∪ x2, where x1 is entirely in the S tile of z and x2 is entirely in the SE tile of z.

One technical thing to check to do this properly is that a1 ∪ ... ∪ ak ∈ REG, which means this union is a valid region. This seems reasonable since in our case x = x1 ∪ x2 is indeed a valid region.

So in this third case, the relation between x and z would be S:SE. Now let me check if this third case is physically possible given our constraints.

Our constraints are:
- infx(z) < infx(x) (derived)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (derived)

And the third case is: infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z). Is this possible? The constraint infx(x) < supx(z) doesn't conflict with our derived constraint infx(z) < infx(x). The constraint supx(x) > supx(z) is neither implied by nor contradicts our derived constraints. So, the third case is indeed possible.

Let's double-check the S, SE case more carefully:

If supx(x) <= supx(z), given infx(z) < infx(x), we have infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This is consistent with the S relation, combined with supy(x) <= infy(z). So S is a possibe relation.

If supx(z) <= infx(x), given supy(x) <= infy(z), we have supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This is consistent with the SE relation. So SE is a possible relation.

If infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z), combined with supy(x) <= infy(z), it means region x overlaps with both the S and SE tiles of region z. So the relation would be S:SE. But this contradicts with our derived constraint infx(z) < infx(x). Let me reason this through.

We need:
- infx(x) < supx(z) to satisfy "infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z)"
- infx(z) < infx(x) (from our derivation)

These two conditions don't conflict. The relation S:SE would happen when region x can be split into two parts: one part x1 entirely in the S tile of z, and another part x2 entirely in the SE tile of z. 

Let's verify if this is physically possible given our derived constraints:

For the part x1 to be in the S tile of z, we need supy(x1) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x1), and supx(x1) <= supx(z). The conditions supy(x1) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x1) are satisfied by our derived constraints. And we can set supx(x1) = supx(z) to ensure supx(x1) <= supx(z).

For the part x2 to be in the SE tile of z, we need supy(x2) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x2). The condition supy(x2) <= infy(z) is satisfied by our derived constraint. We can set infx(x2) = supx(z) to ensure supx(z) <= infx(x2). We also have region x is such that infx(x) < supx(x), so infx(x) < infx(x2).

Now, our combined region x would be x1 ∪ x2, and it would satisfy all of our derived constraints. So, S:SE is also a possible relation.

Actually wait, I want to re-read the definitions of the cardinal regions even more closely. 

The tiles are:
- B (bounding box): infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- S (south): supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- SW (southwest): supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(a) <= infy(b)
- W (west): supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- NW (northwest): supx(a) <= infx(b), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- N (north): supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b)
- NE (northeast): supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(b) <= infy(a)
- E (east): supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b)
- SE (southeast): supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b)

If a region a is located in a specific direction with respect to region b, say, S(b), then all of a lies in the S tile of b. But as mentioned in the problem statement, a region can also straddle multiple tiles. In that case, its relation would be a combination of the tiles it occupies.

Given our constraints infx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), let's re-analyze the possible relations.

For S:
The S tile is defined by supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b).
With a = x and b = z, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
We've derived the first two, but the third condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), is not directly guaranteed by our constraints.

For SE:
The SE tile is defined by supx(b) <= infx(a), supy(a) <= infy(b).
With a = x and b = z, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z).
We've derived the second condition, but the first, supx(z) <= infx(x), is not directly implied.

If we're considering the case where region x overlaps both the S and SE tiles of region z, then there are parts of x that satisfy the S condition and other parts that satisfy the SE condition. Let's denote these as x = x1 ∪ x2, where x1 is in the S tile and x2 is in the SE tile.

For x1 (in the S tile):
supy(x1) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x1), supx(x1) <= supx(z).

For x2 (in the SE tile):
supx(z) <= infx(x2), supy(x2) <= infy(z).

For this to be a valid region, x1 and x2 must be connected.

Actually, I think my understanding of the cardinal direction relation was not entirely accurate for regions that straddle multiple tiles. The mathematical definition provided implies that a region can be represented as the union of smaller regions, each entirely contained in a specific tile with respect to another region. This ensures that the relation is well-defined for regions of arbitrary shapes.

Ah, I have a better understanding of how the composite relation works. Let me restate the problem. 

The problem provides the following definition of a cardinal direction relation: "A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

So, if we say the relation between x and z is S:SE, it means that there are regions x1 and x2 such that x = x1 ∪ x2, and x1 is entirely in the S tile of z, and x2 is entirely in the SE tile of z.

Specifically:
- For x1 (in the S tile): supy(x1) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x1), supx(x1) <= supx(z).
- For x2 (in the SE tile): supx(z) <= infx(x2), supy(x2) <= infy(z).

Our derived constraints:
- infx(z) < infx(x) (from infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x))
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (from supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z))

For x = x1 ∪ x2 to be a valid region, x1 and x2 must be connected. This means regions x1 and x2 are adjacent. But the S and SE tiles of z are not adjacent. 

Actually I think I'm a bit confused. Let me revisit the picture. The S tile is directly below region z, and the SE tile is directly to the southeast of region z. If I consider the 9-tile partitioning of the 2D space centered on region z, the S and SE tiles are adjacent, as shown in the picture:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | B | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

So, if region x has parts in both the S and SE tiles, it means x straddles the S and SE tiles of z. Assuming this is possible and x = x1 ∪ x2 is still a valid region (which I believe it is), then the relation would be S:SE.

To summarize, based on our constraints and understanding of the problem, the possible relations between region x and region z are S, SE, and S:SE:
- S: If region x is entirely in the S tile of z. This happens when supx(x) <= supx(z).
- SE: If region x is entirely in the SE tile of z. This happens when supx(z) <= infx(x).
- S:SE: If region x straddles both the S and SE tiles of z. This happens when infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z).

Wait, I think there's another relation to check.

Let's check the E relation:
The E tile is defined by supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b).
With a = x and b = z, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, E is not a possible relation.

And actually, this doesn't seem right. Having a part of a region in the S tile and another part in the SE tile doesn't necessarily mean the region is in both S and SE. What it actually means is that the region straddles these two tiles. But what is the overall cardinal direction relation in such a case?

Hmm, maybe the mathematical definition given in the problem is the key here. It says: "there are regions a1, ..., ak ∈ REG, where a1 ∈ R1(b), ..., ak ∈ Rk(b) and a1 ∪ ... ∪ ak ∈ REG for any reference region b ∈ REG."

Wait, actually the wording says "any reference region b", which implies that the regions a1, ..., ak are fixed, and the criterion must hold for any region b. But that doesn't make sense in the context of defining a cardinal direction relation. So instead, I interpret this as:

For a region a to be in relation R1:...:Rk with respect to a region b, there must exist regions a1, ..., ak ∈ REG such that a = a1 ∪ ... ∪ ak, and a1 ∈ R1(b), ..., ak ∈ Rk(b).

With this interpretation, if region x has parts in both the S tile and the SE tile of region z, then the relation between x and z is S:SE. This aligns with the 9-tile model of cardinal directions, where a region's relation to another is determined by the tiles it occupies.

So, based on our derived constraints, the possible relations between region x and region z are S, SE, and S:SE.

But before I'm too rigid with this, let me once again check if our third case is physically possible:

For region x to be in a S:SE relation with respect to region z, there must exist regions x1 and x2 such that x = x1 ∪ x2, where x1 is entirely in the S tile of z and x2 is entirely in the SE tile of z.

This means:
- infx(z) <= infx(x1), supx(x1) <= supx(z), supy(x1) <= infy(z).
- supx(z) <= infx(x2), supy(x2) <= infy(z).

The tricky part is ensuring that x1 and x2 are connected. To do this, we need to ensure that supx(x1) is close enough to infx(x2). Given our constraints, supx(x1) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x2), it follows that supx(x1) <= infx(x2). This doesn't guarantee that they are adjacent, but it's a necessary condition. If we set supx(x1) = supx(z) and infx(x2) = supx(z), then the two regions touch at a point, ensuring their union is a valid region. But one issue is that REG is defined as regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, and I'm not sure if a region that touches at a point would satisfy this. But I think this is a technical issue, and the the main point is that this third case should be a possible relation.

Actually, I think it would be best to focus on the given constraints, as the mathematical details of connectedness for regions might go beyond the scope of the problem.

From our derived constraints infx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), we have not been able to establish a unique relation. The relation depends on how supx(x) compares with supx(z) and how supx(z) compares with infx(x). The different scenarios lead to different relations:

- Scenario 1: If supx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(x) < supx(z), then the relation is S.
- Scenario 2: If supx(z) <= infx(x), then the relation is SE.
- Scenario 3: If infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z), then the relation could be S:SE, indicating that region x straddles both the S and SE tiles of region z. To see if this is physically possible, we need to construct two regions (portions of x) x1 and x2, such that x1 is entirely in the S tile, x2 is entirely in the SE tile, and x = x1 ∪ x2 is still a valid region. I believe this is physically possible.

Ok, I'm convinced that the possible relations between region x and region z are S, SE, and S:SE.

Wait, I should check one more relation, which is S:E. The E tile is defined by supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), supy(a) <= supy(b).

For region x to have a part in the E tile of region z, we need (for that part): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z).

However, we've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot have a part in the E tile of z. Thus, the relation S:E is not possible.

So, to summarize, based on our constraints and understanding of the problem, the possible relations between region x and region z are S, SE, and S:SE.

Actually, wait. Let me reason through this one more time. For region x to be in a S:SE relation with respect to region z, there must exist regions x1 and x2 such that x = x1 ∪ x2, where x1 is entirely in the S tile of z and x2 is entirely in the SE tile of z. Moreover, x1 and x2 need to be connected in a manner that ensures x remains a region in REG.

For x1 (in the S tile): 
- supy(x1) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x1), supx(x1) <= supx(z).

For x2 (in the SE tile): 
- supx(z) <= infx(x2), supy(x2) <= infy(z).

Note that it would not be correct to have x1 and x2 touch at a single point, since as per the problem, regions in REG should be homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. The boundary of a region that touches at a single point might not be connected.

Instead, we must ensure that x1 and x2 properly overlap, which means some part of x1 must be to the right of supx(z), contradicting the constraint for S. Alternatively, some part of x2 must be to the left of supx(z), contradicting the constraint for SE. So, technically, it seems like a region cannot straddle both the S and SE tiles without violating the definitions of those tiles.

But the problem statements says "there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG." This implies that each ai is entirely contained in a tile, and the union of these ai is a region in REG.

I think I misunderstood the definition. It seems like the regions a1, ..., ak are meant to be disjoint (or at least not required to be connected), and their union is a region in REG. So, it's acceptable for region x to have a disconnected part in the S tile and another disconnected part in the SE tile.

Given this understanding, the key is to decompose x (the target region) into parts such that each part is entirely contained in a specific tile of z (the reference region) and the union of these parts is x.

Actually, wait.  With that definition, the condition "infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z)" is a little ambiguous. For the scenario where region x straddles both the S and SE tiles without being entirely contained in either, it's clearer to say:

"There exist regions x1 and x2 such that x = x1 ∪ x2, where x1 is entirely in the S tile of z, x2 is entirely in the SE tile of z, and neither x1 nor x2 is empty."

But even this doesn't capture one of our restrictions, which is that x is a region (in REG). So it might be better to say something closer to the definition given in the problem:

"For region x to have a S:SE relation with region z, there must exist regions x1 and x2 in REG, such that x = x1 ∪ x2, x1 is entirely in the S tile of z, x2 is entirely in the SE tile of z, x1 ∪ x2 is in REG, and neither x1 nor x2 is empty."

For x1 to be entirely in the S tile of z, supx(x1) <= supx(z). For x2 to be entirely in the SE tile of z, supx(z) <= infx(x2). These to me don't seem to contradict our constraints. x1 and x2 may be potentially disconnected, but their union must be in REG.

I know for sure that the relations S and SE are possible given our constraints infx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But I'm no longer as sure that region x can straddle both the S and SE tiles of region z.

So, to be safe, based on our constraints and understanding of the problem, the possible relations between region x and region z are S and SE. Though I think the relation S:SE might also be physically possible, I'm not certain of the exact mathematical interpretation of the problem, especially regarding the decomposition of regions. I will exclude S:SE to be more conservative. Since we haven't been given more specific information about the exact relationship of supx(x) to supx(z) or infx(x) to supx(z), we're left with the two possible relations: S and SE.

Ok, I'm finally convinced that our final answer of the possible relations between x and z, given that x is E of y and y is S of z, are: S and SE.

Let's double-check.

From the constraints:
- x is E of y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y is S of z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z).

From these, we derived:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) < infx(x)

For S, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z).
For SE, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), supx(z) <= infx(x).

If supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) > infx(x), then the relation is S. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then the relation is SE.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is E of y and y is S of z, are: S and SE.

Hmm I think it's also clear from our derivation that we exclude: N, NE, NW, W, SW, B, E.

The relation S:E might be possible, I'm not sure, but it seems like this is not one of the single-tile relations. I was asked for the possible relations which I presume are the single-tile relations. So our list of possible relations is: S, SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is E of y: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y is S of z: This means supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) < infx(x)

Based on these derived constraints:

For S relation:
- We have supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) < infx(x)
- If supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x is S of z

For SE relation:
- We have supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is SE of z

The remaining relations (N, NE, E, NW, W, SW, B) can be ruled out:
- N, NE, NW are impossible because we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- E is impossible because the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint
- W, SW are impossible because we know infx(z) < infx(x)
- B is impossible because it requires infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts our constraint

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SE
