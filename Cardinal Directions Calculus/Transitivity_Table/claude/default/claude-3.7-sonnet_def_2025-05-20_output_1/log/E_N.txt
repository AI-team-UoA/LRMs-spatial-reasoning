PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's figure out what the relations tell us, and from there, we can determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y.
- Region y is N of region z.

Let's recall the definitions:

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

For y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)

Now, we need to determine what these conditions imply about the relationship between x and z.

Let's analyze the constraints:
- x is to the east of y, meaning x is to the right of y.
- y is to the north of z, meaning y is above z.

So, x is to the right of y, and y is above z. 

Let's think about the potential positions of x relative to z.

1. From the east constraint:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)

2. From the north constraint:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)

Combining these:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from 1 and 2)
   - This means infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (since y is a connected region, infx(y) < supx(y))
   - Hence, infx(z) < infx(x) (which means x is to the right of the left edge of z)

But, we don't have a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). However, if:
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from 2)
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from 1)
   - Then, it could be the case that infx(x) ≤ supx(z) or supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

3. From the east constraint:
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

4. From the north constraint:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Combining these:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from 3 and 4)
   - This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which means x is above z)

So, from our analysis, we can say that:
- x is to the right of the left edge of z.
- x is above z.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- NE (if x is entirely to the right of z and above z)
- E (if x is entirely to the right of z but within the y-range of z)
- N (if x is entirely above z but within the x-range of z)

However, I'm not sure if these are the only possibilities. Let me re-check by considering all cardinal direction relations.

Actually, wait. The constraints aren't as tight as I thought.

From our analysis above, we know:
- infx(z) < infx(x) (from 1 and 2)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (from 3 and 4)

Given these, let's reanalyze the potential directions:

1. NE (North East): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). 
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We don't have a direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x), but if supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then NE is a possibility.

2. E (East): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(x) > supy(z). This implies that x is above the top edge of z. Since supy(x) > infy(x) (since x is a connected region), supy(x) > supy(z). 
   - But E requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts our deduction. So, E is not a possibility.

3. SE (South East): This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(x) ≥ supy(z) ≥ infy(z) (since z is a connected region, infy(z) ≤ supy(z)).
   - Since infy(x) ≥ infy(z) and supy(x) > infy(x) (since x is a connected region), we can't guarantee supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - In fact, it's more likely that supy(x) > infy(z), which would violate the SE relation.
   - However, it's still possible for supy(x) ≤ infy(z) to hold. So, I can't definitively rule out SE.

4. N (North): This would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know infx(z) < infx(x).
   - We don't have a direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z). If supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then N is a possibility.

5. NW (North West): This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know infx(z) < infx(x). Since supx(x) > infx(x) (since x is a connected region), it's unlikely that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But it's not impossible, especially if x and z are positioned in a specific way.
   - So, NW could be a possibility, but it's somewhat less likely.

6. B (Bounding Box): This would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know infx(z) < infx(x), which aligns with the B condition.
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(x) > supy(z) (since x is a connected region, supy(x) > infy(x)). 
   - But B requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts our deduction. So, B is not a possibility.

7. W (West): This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know infx(z) < infx(x). Since supx(x) > infx(x) (since x is a connected region), it's unlikely that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But it's not impossible, depending on the positioning.
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(x) > supy(z). This implies that x is above the top edge of z. Since supy(x) > infy(x) (since x is a connected region), supy(x) > supy(z). 
   - But W requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts our deduction. So, W is not a possibility.

8. SW (South West): This would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know infx(z) < infx(x). Since supx(x) > infx(x) (since x is a connected region), it's unlikely that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But it's not impossible, depending on the positioning.
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(x) ≥ supy(z) ≥ infy(z) (since z is a connected region, infy(z) ≤ supy(z)).
   - Since infy(x) ≥ infy(z) and supy(x) > infy(x) (since x is a connected region), we can't guarantee supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - In fact, it's more likely that supy(x) > infy(z), which would violate the SW relation.
   - So, SW is a less likely possibility, but I can't completely rule it out.

9. S (South): This would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(x) ≥ supy(z) ≥ infy(z) (since z is a connected region, infy(z) ≤ supy(z)).
   - Since infy(x) ≥ infy(z) and supy(x) > infy(x) (since x is a connected region), we can't guarantee supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - In fact, it's more likely that supy(x) > infy(z), which would violate the S relation.
   - So, S is a less likely possibility, but I can't completely rule it out.

Hmm I might have made some logical errors above. Let me redo my analysis.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y.
- Region y is N of region z.

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

For y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)

From these, I'll derive constraints on the relationship between x and z.

For the x-coordinates:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

So, infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x).
This means infx(z) < infx(x), and also, using the other constraint, supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
But we don't have a direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible that supx(z) ≤ infx(x) or infx(x) ≤ supx(z).

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z)

So, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).
This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
But, we don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z) or supy(z) and infy(z).

Given these constraints, let's see the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. NE (North East): This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then NE is a possibility.

2. E (East): This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z's top edge. This contradicts the requirement that supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - So, E is NOT a possibility.

3. SE (South East): This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x's bottom edge is above z's top edge. This places x completely above z.
   - But SE would require x's top edge to be below z's bottom edge. This contradicts our known constraint.
   - So, SE is NOT a possibility.

4. N (North): This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know infx(z) < infx(x).
   - If supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then N is a possibility.

5. B (Bounding Box): This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x's bottom edge is above z's top edge. This places x completely above z.
   - But B would require x's bottom edge to be below or at z's bottom edge and x's top edge to be below or at z's top edge. This contradicts our known constraint.
   - So, B is NOT a possibility.

6. NW (North West): This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know infx(z) < infx(x), which implies that z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge. For NW, x's right edge should be to the left of z's left edge, which seems contradictory given our constraint.
   - But there's a subtlety here. If x and z are positioned such that z's left edge extends far to the left, then x's right edge (supx(x)) could still be to the left of z's left edge (infx(z)), even though x's left edge (infx(x)) is to the right of y's right edge (supx(y)).
   - So, NW is generally NOT a possibility, but there might be some specific configurations where it's feasible.

7. W (West): This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - Similar to the reasoning for NW, given our known constraint infx(z) < infx(x), it seems contradictory that x's right edge (supx(x)) would be to the left of z's left edge (infx(z)).
   - Furthermore, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x's bottom edge is above z's top edge. This places x completely above z, which contradicts the height overlap requirement for W.
   - So, W is NOT a possibility.

8. SW (South West): This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We face the same contradiction from W regarding the x-coordinates.
   - Additionally, given supy(z) ≤ infy(x), it's not possible for supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which would place x below z), because x is above z based on our constraint.
   - So, SW is NOT a possibility.

9. S (South): This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - Given supy(z) ≤ infy(x), it's not possible for supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which would place x below z), because x is above z based on our constraint.
   - So, S is NOT a possibility.

Based on this analysis, the only definite possibilities for the relation between x and z are:
- NE (if supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- N (if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z))

Actually I'm not sure if I've been reasoning about this completely correctly. Let me trace through an example.

Suppose we have a region y with coordinates (1, 1) to (3, 3). That is, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 3, infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 3.

Now, if region z is such that y is N of z, then by the definition, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) = 1, and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) = 1 and supx(y) = 3 ≤ supx(z). So, region z could have coordinates (0, -2) to (4, 0).

And, if region x is such that x is E of y, then by the definition, supx(y) = 3 ≤ infx(x), and infy(y) = 1 ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) = 3. So, region x could have coordinates (4, 1) to (6, 3).

Now, let's examine the relationship between x and z:
- infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 6
- infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 3
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 4
- infy(z) = -2, supy(z) = 0

From these, we can see that supy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 1, which means x is above z. And, we can also see that supx(z) = 4 ≤ infx(x) = 4, which means x is to the right of z.

This would make x NE of z.

However, this is just one example. Let's tweak it a bit.

Suppose region z still has coordinates (0, -2) to (4, 0), but region x has coordinates (3, 1) to (5, 2). The relationship between x and y would still be E, and the relationship between y and z would still be N.

Now, the relationship between x and z:
- infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 5
- infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 2
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 4
- infy(z) = -2, supy(z) = 0

Here, supy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(x) = 1, which means x is above z. But, infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 3 and supx(x) = 5 > supx(z) = 4, which means x and z overlap in their x-coordinate range.

This would make x N of z.

So, from these examples, the relation between x and z could be either NE or N, depending on the specific coordinates. Let's check if there are other valid configurations.

Let me try to derive more constraints from the definitions.

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

For y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)

Now, combining these:

For the x-coordinates:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

These don't directly tell us the relationship between x and z, but we can derive that supx(y) ≤ min(infx(x), supx(z)), which means supx(y) is bounded from above by both infx(x) and supx(z). Depending on which is smaller, we can determine if x is completely to the right of z (NE) or if they overlap in the x direction (N).

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This tells us that x is above z, which confirms the direction is either NE or N, depending on the x-coordinate constraints.

Let's also consider the infx(z) constraint:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)

We get infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x). This means infx(z) < infx(x), which confirms that z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge.

Hmm, wait, let me think a bit more.

Given our constraints, can x and z have other relationships besides NE and N?

For NW, x would need to be to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) and above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). But we know infx(z) < infx(x), so it's not possible for x to be to the left of z.

For W, x would need to be to the left of z and overlap with z in y. Again, it's not possible given the x constraint.

For SW, x would need to be to the left of z and below z. This is not possible given both the x and y constraints.

For S, x would need to be below z, which contradicts the y constraint.

For SE, x would need to be to the right of z and below z, which contradicts the y constraint.

For E, x would need to be to the right of z and overlap with z in y. But our y constraint says supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so there's no y-overlap.

For B, x would need to be inside the bounding box of z, which contradicts the y constraint.

So, it seems the only valid relationships are NE and N, as we concluded earlier.

Actually no, let's think more carefully about the NW relation:
For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's left edge)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

Our current constraints tell us:
- infx(z) < infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

The first constraint suggests that part of x is to the right of z's left edge, which contradicts the requirement for NW. So, NW is not a valid relation.

Let me think about other less common configurations.

Actually, there's a stronger constraint on the x-coordinates that I missed. Let me derive it:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from a above)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

These tell us that:
- infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (since y is a connected region, infx(y) < supx(y))
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (again, since y is a connected region, infx(y) < supx(y))

So, infx(z) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). But, this doesn't tell us if infx(x) ≤ supx(z) or supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is to the right of z, which would make it NE of z.

If infx(x) ≤ supx(z), there's an overlap in the x direction. Given that x is above z (from the y constraints), x is N of z.

So, the possible relations are:
- NE (if supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- N (if infx(x) ≤ supx(z))

Actually, one thing we need to more carefully check.

For NE (North East):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

For the second constraint, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so x is indeed above z.

For N (North):
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)

We know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x is indeed above z.
We also know infx(z) < infx(x) (from the chain of inequalities), which aligns with the N constraint.
The remaining question is: Is supx(x) ≤ supx(z)?

It's possible to have supx(x) ≤ supx(z), in which case x would be N of z. But if supx(x) > supx(z), then x would not be N of z, but some other relation.

Given our constraints, there's no direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z), so we can't determine just from these constraints if x is necessarily N of z.

So, from what we've established, x is above z (north of z). In the x-direction, x might be to the right of z (east of z), or there might be some overlap.

Let's see how many possible relations satisfy these:

1. NE (North East): x is above and to the right of z.
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established)
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which is possible)

2. N (North): x is above z and there's an overlap in the x-direction.
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (which is possible)

Actually, let me approach the problem in a different way.

Let's define the eight cardinal directions (plus B) by the constraints on the bounding box coordinates.

For two regions r and s, the cardinal direction relation of r to s is:

B (Bounding Box): infx(s) ≤ infx(r) and supx(r) ≤ supx(s) and infy(s) ≤ infy(r) and supy(r) ≤ supy(s)

S (South): supy(r) ≤ infy(s) and infx(s) ≤ infx(r) and supx(r) ≤ supx(s)

SW (South West): supx(r) ≤ infx(s) and supy(r) ≤ infy(s)

W (West): supx(r) ≤ infx(s) and infy(s) ≤ infy(r) and supy(r) ≤ supy(s)

NW (North West): supx(r) ≤ infx(s) and supy(s) ≤ infy(r)

N (North): supy(s) ≤ infy(r) and infx(s) ≤ infx(r) and supx(r) ≤ supx(s)

NE (North East): supx(s) ≤ infx(r) and supy(s) ≤ infy(r)

E (East): supx(s) ≤ infx(r) and infy(s) ≤ infy(r) and supy(r) ≤ supy(s)

SE (South East): supx(s) ≤ infx(r) and supy(r) ≤ infy(s)

Now, let's use these to determine the possible cardinal direction relation of region x to region z.

From our constraints, we know:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x E y)

So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

Let's check the other constraints for each of the cardinal direction relations:

N (North): This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

For supx(x) ≤ supx(z), we don't have a direct constraint, so it's a valid possibility if this condition is met.

NW (North West): This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established).

From our constraints, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y).

It's not clear if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so we need to check specific configurations to determine if NW is a valid possibility. Actually, let's consider this carefully.

We have infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y). These tell us infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x). But for NW, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This leads to supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is a contradiction unless supx(x) = infx(z) = infx(x). But regions in REG are connected, so their bounding boxes have width, meaning supx(x) > infx(x). So, NW is not a valid possibility.

NE (North East): This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which we've established).

From our constraints, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y). So, supx(y) ≤ min(supx(z), infx(x)), but we don't directly know the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). So, NE is a valid possibility if supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Let me try a different approach. I'll construct some examples to see what's possible.

Suppose y is a region defined by the rectangle from (1, 1) to (3, 3).

z is to the south of y, which means its y-value is below y. And y's x-range is within z's x-range. So, z might be the rectangle from (0, -2) to (4, 0).

x is to the east of y, which means its x-value is to the right of y. And x's y-range is within y's y-range. So, x might be the rectangle from (4, 1) to (6, 3).

For this particular configuration, x is to the northeast of z.

Now, let's adjust z to see if we can get x to be north of z.

If z is the rectangle from (0, -2) to (7, 0), then z's x-range extends beyond x's x-range to the right. In this case, x is to the north of z.

Let's see if we can construct an example where x is to the northwest of z.

For NW, x's right edge (supx(x)) should be to the left of z's left edge (infx(z)), and x should be above z.

But we have the constraint: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y). These imply infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) < infx(x). Since x is a connected region, supx(x) > infx(x), which means supx(x) > infx(z). This contradicts the requirement for NW.

So, NW is not a possible relation between x and z.

Similarly, for W, SW, S, SE, E, and B, the constraints would contradict the requirements. You're right, I think. Only N and NE are possible.

Alright actually, I should be precise about all the constraints from x E y and y N z.

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

For y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)

From these constraints, we know:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge.
- And supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

For the relationship between x and z, the cardinal direction relation could be:

1. NE (North East): Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We don't have a direct constraint on supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But, given that supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z), it's plausible that supx(z) could be greater than or equal to infx(x). But it's also plausible that supx(z) < infx(x).
   - So, NE is a valid possibility.

2. N (North): Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and infx(z) < infx(x).
   - We don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) ≤ supx(z). It's plausible for x to be wider or narrower than z.
   - So, N is a valid possibility.

3. NW (North West): Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We've also established infx(z) < infx(x). Since x is connected, supx(x) > infx(x), which means supx(x) > infx(z). This contradicts the requirement for NW.
   - So, NW is NOT a valid possibility.

4. W (West): Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - Similar to NW, we've established infx(z) < infx(x), which means x cannot be to the left of z.
   - Furthermore, we've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z without any y-overlap. This contradicts the y-related requirement for W.
   - So, W is NOT a valid possibility.

5. SW (South West): Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - Similar to NW, x cannot be to the left of z.
   - Also, we've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the requirement for SW.
   - So, SW is NOT a valid possibility.

6. S (South): Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - We've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x's bottom edge is above z's top edge. This places x completely above z, contradicting the requirement for S.
   - So, S is NOT a valid possibility.

7. SE (South East): Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the requirement for SE.
   - So, SE is NOT a valid possibility.

8. E (East): Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z without any y-overlap. This contradicts the y-related requirement for E.
   - So, E is NOT a valid possibility.

9. B (Bounding Box): Requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We've established supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the requirement for B.
   - So, B is NOT a valid possibility.

Wait, I missed something for the NW constraint. Let's check it again.

For NW (North West):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's left edge)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

From our constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y). These imply infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), or in other words, infx(z) < infx(x).
- But the NW relation doesn't constrain infx(x) relative to infx(z). It constrains supx(x) relative to infx(z), requiring supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This might still be possible if x is a small region such that its right edge (supx(x)) is to the left of z's left edge (infx(z)).
- However, since infx(x) > supx(y) > infx(z), and x is connected, which requires supx(x) > infx(x), we have supx(x) > infx(x) > supx(y) > infx(z). This means supx(x) > infx(z), which contradicts the NW relation.

Actually, going through this one more time and step-by-step:
- From our constraints, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y).
- For the NW relation to hold, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Combining these two with the knowledge that supx(x) > infx(x) (since x is a connected region), we get supx(x) > infx(x) ≥ supx(y). So, supx(x) > supx(y).
- On the other hand, from our constraints, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) (from y N z). If NW is to hold, then supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But since supx(x) > supx(y) and supx(y) > infx(z), we have supx(x) > infx(z). This contradicts the NW relation.

So, indeed, NW is not a valid possibility.

Based on our analysis, only N and NE are the valid possibilities for the relation between x and z.

Let's double-check our work. 

We've established that supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z.

Let's look at x-direction constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (derived from y N z and x E y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)

So, infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x).

For NE, x should be to the right of z. This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). From our constraints, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x), but supx(y) ≤ supx(z). If supx(z) = supx(y), then supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is satisfied, making NE a valid relation. But if supx(z) > supx(y), then supx(z) could be greater than infx(x), making NE invalid.

For N, x should be above z and x's x-range should be within z's x-range. From our constraints, x is above z and infx(z) < infx(x). For N to be valid, we also need supx(x) ≤ supx(z). From our constraints, we don't have a direct relation between supx(x) and supx(z), so N is a valid possibility if this condition is met.

So, based on our constraints, both NE and N are valid possibilities for the relation between x and z, depending on specific configurations.

Ok actually, I think there's one more possibility we should consider: the combination of N and NE, which would be the relation "N:NE". Let me check if this compound relation (which would happen when x straddles the boundary between N and NE) is valid.

For "N:NE" to be valid, we would need x to have part of it directly north of z and part of it to the northeast of z. This means that infx(z) < infx(x), supx(x) > supx(z), and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

We've already established that supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and infx(z) < infx(x). There's no constraint on supx(x) relative to supx(z), so it's perfectly possible for supx(x) to be greater than supx(z).

So, "N:NE" is a valid possibility.

Actually, I'm confused about what's being asked now. I think the compound relation "N:NE" isn't one of the nine primary cardinal direction relations. It's a refinement.

Let me go back to the original problem:

If region x is E of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

Given the constraints we have, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. NE (North East)
2. N (North)

Specifically, depending on how the regions are configured, either x is completely to the Northeast of z, or x is directly North of z (with x's x-range contained within z's x-range).

Actually let me double check if there are any other possibilities. 

Given our constraints, we've established that x is above z, with no y-overlap. This rules out directions that would require x to be below or alongside z in the y-direction, which are S, SW, W, B, and SE.

For the x-direction, we've established that infx(z) < infx(x). The only constraints which don't contradict this are those where x is to the right of z's left edge, which are N, NE, and possibly E. But E requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts our constraint that supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, E is also ruled out.

That leaves N and NE.

For N, we need supx(x) ≤ supx(z). For NE, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which is a stronger constraint than infx(z) < infx(x)).

Given our constraints, both N and NE are valid possibilities, depending on specific configurations.

N is a possibility when supx(x) ≤ supx(z). In this case, x's x-range is contained within z's x-range.
NE is a possibility when supx(z) ≤ infx(x). In this case, x's x-range is entirely to the right of z's x-range.

Wait a minute, I'm forgetting something. It's also possible that N and NE both hold simultaneously if supx(z) = infx(x).

But I think this is a borderline case, and would typically be classified as NE since the regions just touch at a point.

So, I'll conclude with N and NE as the possible relations between x and z.

Actually, in the cardinal direction relations, regions are allowed to touch (or even have more complex intersections like partial overlap). But since regions in REG are connected, if supx(z) = infx(x), then x and z would just touch. This situation would be classified as NE, not as a combination of N and NE.

So, the possible relations between x and z are N and NE.

Actually, wait a second. We have nine basic cardinal relations, but when defining what regions can be in REG, I'm pretty sure relations aren't constrained to be one of those nine. If a region a can have a cardinal direction relation R1:...:Rk, where R1, ..., Rk belong to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, then we have all sort of compound relations where the primary region can span multiple of the tiles.

Let me re-read what's defined in the context:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied:
i) 1 <= k <= 9,
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE},
iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j,
iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

So, a region can span multiple of the nine basic cardinal tiles, and the cardinal direction relation is a colon-separated list of the tiles the region occupies. This makes sense, since real regions can be complex and might not fit neatly into just one of the nine tiles.

Now, if we're asking what are the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, the answer would be:
1. NE (if x is entirely in the NE tile of z)
2. N (if x is entirely in the N tile of z)
3. N:NE (if x spans both the N and NE tiles of z)

Actually, the context also defines a "single-tile" cardinal direction relation, so I think I misunderstood something.

But the fact that the cardinal direction relation is defined as an expression R1: ... : Rk suggests that regions might span multiple tiles. And given the constraints on x and z, it's plausible that x could span both the N and NE tiles of z.

Ok I'm sure now. "Cardinal direction relation" is a more general term that can refer to composite relations like "N:NE" (which would is a way to say "north and north-east"). "Single-tile cardinal direction relation" specifically refers to one of the nine basic tiles. In the question, we're asking for the possible cardinal direciton relations, which would include the composite ones.

Actually I'm getting a lot of mixed signals. Given our constraints, are the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:
1. NE
2. N
3. N:NE

Or is it just NE and N?

Let me re-check the definitions to be sure.

Alright, the definition is given in terms of a reference region and a primary region. Region x is the primary region, and region z is the reference region. 

Now, given our constraints, we need to determine which of the nine tiles x can occupy in relation to z.

We know one constraint for sure: x is above z with no y-overlap, because supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means x must be in one of the northern tiles (NW, N, NE).

For the x-direction, we've established that infx(z) < infx(x), which means x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge. This rules out the NW tile.

So, x can be in the N tile, the NE tile, or span both (N:NE).

For x to be exclusively in the N tile, we would need infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
For x to be exclusively in the NE tile, we would need supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

And for x to span both the N and NE tiles, we would need infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x), which means part of x is directly north of z and part of it is to the northeast.

Given our constraints, all three scenarios are possible. So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. NE
2. N
3. N:NE

Hmm, let me re-check whether N:NE is valid by checking its definition again.

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where...
- there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

So we need regions a1, ..., ak that belong to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b), and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG.

In our case it would be:
- Region a1 belongs to N(z)
- Region a2 belongs to NE(z)
- a1 union a2 belongs to REG

We know that regions in REG are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means they are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries.

So, a1 union a2 needs to be connected. This means a1 and a2 can't be disconnected regions. But if x spans both the N and NE tiles of z, we can define a1 to be the part of x in the N tile and a2 to be the part of x in the NE tile. Since x is connected, a1 and a2 would share a boundary, ensuring that a1 union a2 is connected. So, N:NE would be a valid cardinal direction relation for x relative to z.

So, my conclusion remains the same. The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NE, N, and N:NE.

Actually, I think N:NE is truly a valid possibility.

Let's break it down:
- Region a1 is the part of x that's directly north of z. This region is in N(z).
- Region a2 is the part of x that's to the northeast of z. This region is in NE(z).
- a1 union a2 is the entire region x, which is in REG.

Given that x can span both the N and NE tiles relative to z, N:NE is a valid cardinal direction relation.

So, the proper answer would indeed be that the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. NE (if x is entirely in the NE tile of z)
2. N (if x is entirely in the N tile of z)
3. N:NE (if x spans both the N and NE tiles of z)

Actually, let me carefully anaylze one last time why the N:NE relation must necessarily be a possiblity.

For the N:NE relation to hold, we need x to span both the N and NE tiles of z. This would happen if:
- infx(z) < infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge)
- supx(x) > supx(z) (x's right edge is to the right of z's right edge)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

From our constraints, we know:
- infx(z) < infx(x) (derived from y N z and x E y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (derived from y N z and x E y)

For N:NE to be valid, we also need supx(x) > supx(z). From our constraints, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z). But we don't have a direct constraint on supx(x) relative to supx(z). Given that x is E of y, its x-coordinates can extend further to the right than y's x-coordinates. So, it's plausible that supx(x) > supx(z).

For N to be valid, we need supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This is also plausible given our constraints.

For NE to be valid, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). From our constraints, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x E y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z). If supx(z) = supx(y), then supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is satisfied, making NE valid. But if supx(z) > supx(y), then supx(z) could be greater than infx(x), making NE invalid.

So, N, NE, and N:NE are all valid possibilities depending on the specific configurations.

Phew!

The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- N
- NE
- N:NE

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the E relation, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

From the N relation, we know:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-coordinates are within z's x-range)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z (north of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge

Now, considering the x-direction positioning, three possibilities emerge:

1. N (North): If x's x-range is completely contained within z's x-range (infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z))

2. NE (Northeast): If x is completely to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x))

3. N:NE: If x spans both N and NE tiles (infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x))

The possible relations are: N, NE, N:NE
