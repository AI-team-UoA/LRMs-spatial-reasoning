PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

We're given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of NE and SE from the background information:

NE (North East): a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
SE (South East): a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So, we have:
- x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's combine these to find the constraints between x and z:

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y SE z, we have supx(z) <= infx(y).

By transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x).

This means that x is to the east of z.

Now, let's consider the y-coordinates:
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

These don't directly give us a relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).

So, we know that x is to the east of z, but we don't have a clear constraint on the north-south relationship.

Let's think about this geometrically:
- If x is NE of y, then x is to the north and east of y.
- If y is SE of z, then y is to the south and east of z.

So, x is east of y, which is east of z. Thus, x is east of z.

x is north of y, which is south of z. The relationship between x and z in the north-south direction is not immediately clear.

x could be north of z, at the same level as z, or south of z.

Specifically, the possible relations between x and z based on the constraints are:
- x NE z: If x is north of z.
- x E z: If x is at the same level as z.
- x SE z: If x is south of z.

But let's check if there are more constraints by analyzing the definitions more carefully.

From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is strictly north of y.
From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z), which means y is strictly south of z.

Hmm, this still doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z in the north-south direction.

Let's try to visualize this. If we place z at the origin (0, 0):
- y could be in the SE quadrant of z, say at (1, -1).
- x could be in the NE quadrant of y, say at (2, 0).

In this case, x would be E of z.

But if we place z at the origin (0, 0):
- y could be in the SE quadrant of z, say at (1, -1).
- x could be in the NE quadrant of y, say at (2, 0.5).

In this case, x would be NE of z.

And if we place z at the origin (0, 0):
- y could be in the SE quadrant of z, say at (1, -1).
- x could be in the NE quadrant of y, say at (2, -0.5).

In this case, x would be SE of z.

I have checked three possible scenarios, and in each one, x is east of z. In the north-south direction, x can be north of, at the same level as, or south of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NE z
- x E z
- x SE z

Wait, I think I'm overlooking something. Let me re-analyze using the properties of the regions in REG.

For regions in REG, we're dealing with closed, connected regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This means we're working with regions that have interiors, boundaries, and are topologically equivalent to a disk.

Given the definitions:
- x NE y means x is entirely to the northeast of y.
- y SE z means y is entirely to the southeast of z.

Let's think about this more comprehensively.

When we say x is NE of y, it means the minimum bounding box of x is entirely to the northeast of the minimum bounding box of y. Similarly, when we say y is SE of z, it means the minimum bounding box of y is entirely to the southeast of the minimum bounding box of z.

Translating this to the inequalities:
For x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
For y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

We previously established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.

Now, for the north-south relationship:
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

We can't directly infer a relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) based on these. We need to consider all possibilities.

Let's examine all possible cardinal direction relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.

For x to be in the B relation with z, we would need:
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

But we already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (since regions are non-empty). So, x cannot be in the B relation with z.

For x to be in the N relation with z, we would need:
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

But again, this contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be in the N relation with z.

Similarly, for S, W, SW, and NW relations, there would be contradictions with supx(z) <= infx(x).

The only relations that are consistent with supx(z) <= infx(x) are NE, E, and SE.

For x to be in the NE relation with z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

For x to be in the E relation with z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

For x to be in the SE relation with z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We've already confirmed that supx(z) <= infx(x). Let's check the other conditions.

For NE, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x). Given the constraints, this is possible. For example, if z is at the origin, y is at (1, -1), and x is at (2, 1), then x would be NE of z.

For E, we would need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Given the constraints, this is also possible. For example, if z is at the origin with a height of 2, y is at (1, -1), and x is at (2, 0) with a height of 1, then x would be E of z.

For SE, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z). Given the constraints, this is also possible. For example, if z is at the origin, y is at (1, -3), and x is at (2, -2), then x would be SE of z.

Wait, I'm thinking in terms of points rather than regions. Let me recalibrate:

When we say a region is NE of another, it means the entirety of the first region is to the NE of the second. I believe my analysis with the inequalities is still correct.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NE z
- x E z
- x SE z

But let's actually model it once more to be absolutely sure.

Given:
- x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
infx(y) <= infx(x) (since x NE y, we can interpret this as saying x is to the NE of any part of y, which means its infx is at least as large as the infx of y)

So, by transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(x).

This means x is strictly to the east of z.

Now, for the north-south relationship:
From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

Using these constraints, I can't directly derive a strict inequality between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). This means, in the north-south direction, x could be north of, at the same level as, or south of z.

Let's consider this from a different angle. The given relations tell us that:
- x is strictly northeast of y
- y is strictly southeast of z

For x to be N of z, we'd need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
But this contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be NW of z, we'd need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
But this contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x to be W of z, we'd need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
But this contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But this contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be SW of z.

For x to be S of z, we'd need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
But this contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be S of z.

For x to be B of z, we'd need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
But this contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

Now, let's check the remaining relations:

For x to be NE of z, we'd need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x). For the second condition, let's consider:

Given:
- x NE y means supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SE z means supy(y) <= infy(z)

These don't directly give us a relationship between infy(x) and supy(z). But it's possible for supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true, which would make x NE of z.

For x to be E of z, we'd need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
Again, we've established supx(z) <= infx(x). The other two conditions are possible, given the constraints. So, x could be E of z.

For x to be SE of z, we'd need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We've established supx(z) <= infx(x). For the second condition, it's possible for supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true, which would make x SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NE z
- x E z
- x SE z

This confirms my earlier analysis, but I wanted to be absolutely sure.

So, the final answer is: the possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE.

Actually, I realize I've been thinking through this fairly concretely, but I want to double-check with a more general visual understanding:

We have:
- x is NE of y
- y is SE of z

Maybe I can visualize it as a graph?

z
|
y---x

Where y is to the SE of z, and x is to the NE of y.

From this, it's clear that x is to the east of z. But the north-south relationship isn't as clear.

Let's consider different scenarios:

1. If z is at (0, 0), y is at (1, -1), and x is at (2, 1), then x is NE of z.
2. If z spans from (0, -1) to (0, 1), y is at (1, -1), and x spans from (2, -0.5) to (2, 0.5), then x is E of z.
3. If z is at (0, 2), y is at (1, 0), and x is at (2, -1), then x is SE of z.

This again confirms that x can be NE, E, or SE of z.

Ok, my final answer, based on the definitions and constraints given, is that the possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE.

Wait, I need to be more precise. Let me check:

We have:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

I want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions:
- x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, I can derive:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is strictly to the east of z.

But for the north-south relationship, I just have:
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

These don't give me a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). So, in the north-south direction, x could be north of, at the same level as, or south of z.

Actually, I think there's something I'm missing. Let's reconsider the north-south relationships:

From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). This means y is strictly south of x.
From y SE z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z). This means y is strictly south of z.

Wait, this means y is strictly south of both x and z. But it doesn't tell us the direct north-south relationship between x and z. x could be north of, at the same level as, or south of z. Let me try another approach.

Let me represent the regions as rectangles to simplify:

1. If x is NE of z:
   
  Z
     Y
        X

2. If x is E of z:
   
  Z
     Y
     X

3. If x is SE of z:
   
     Y
  Z
     X

All of these satisfy the constraints that y is SE of z and x is NE of y.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if option 3 is viable. Let's check.

For y to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
For x to be NE of y, we need supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

If x is to be SE of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). For this to be true along with the other constraints, we'd need to find values such that:
supy(x) <= infy(z) (for x SE z)
supy(y) <= infy(x) (for x NE y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (for y SE z)

These are compatible. For example, if supy(y) = 0, infy(x) = 1, infy(z) = 2, and supy(x) = 1.5, then all the inequalities are satisfied.

So, all three relations – NE, E, and SE – are possible for x with respect to z, given the constraints.

The answer is NE, E, SE.

Actually, wait. I want to double check this more carefully, by drawing out the possibilities more fully.

Given:
- x NE y
- y SE z

Let me represent the regions as points to simplify:

1. x NE z:
```
z
|
y---x
```
Here, y is to the southeast of z, and x is to the northeast of y. With these positions, x is to the northeast of z.

2. x E z:
```
z
|
y
|
x
```
Here, y is directly south of z, and x is directly east of y. With these positions, x is directly east of z.

3. x SE z:
```
  z
 /
y
|
x
```
Here, y is to the southeast of z, and x is to the east of y (and a bit to the north). With these positions, x is to the southeast of z.

But wait, that doesn't fit the constraint that x is NE of y. Let me correct:

3. x SE z:
```
  z
 /
y
 \
  x
```
Here, y is to the southeast of z, and x is to the northeast of y (though it may not look like it in the ASCII representation). With these positions, x is to the southeast of z.

Actually, I'm not convincing myself properly. Let me use (x, y) coordinates:

1. If z is at (0, 2), y is at (1, 1), and x is at (2, 2), then x is E of z.
2. If z is at (0, 2), y is at (1, 1), and x is at (2, 3), then x is NE of z.
3. If z is at (0, 3), y is at (1, 1), and x is at (2, 2), then x is SE of z.

In each of these cases, y is SE of z and x is NE of y. And depending on the specific positions, x can be E, NE, or SE of z.

So yes, the possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE.

Ok, to be extra sure, I'm going to draw it one more time with rectangles to represent the regions.

Let's say region z is like:
```
+-+
|z|
+-+
```

First, for y to be SE of z, it should be to the southeast of z:
```
+-+
|z|
+-+
   \
    +-+
    |y|
    +-+
```

Now, for x to be NE of y, it should be to the northeast of y:
```
+-+
|z|
+-+         +-+
   \        |x|
    +-+     +-+
    |y|    /
    +-+   /
```

With this arrangement, x is to the E of z.

Now, if we adjust the positions:
```
+-+
|z|
+-+          +-+
   \         |x|
    +-+     /+-+
    |y|    /
    +-+   /
```

Here, x is to the NE of z.

And with another adjustment:
```
      +-+
      |z|
      +-+
     /
    +-+     +-+
    |y|    /|x|
    +-+   / +-+
```

Here, x is to the SE of z.

So, based on the constraints and the graphical representation, I am confident that the possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE.

Let's also double check this by working from the definitions directly.

Given:
- x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

For x to be NE of z, we'd need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We already know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us supx(z) <= infx(x).
But for supy(z) <= infy(x), we need to check if it's consistent with the other constraints.

Given:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

There's no direct relationship we can infer between supy(z) and infy(x). But it's not inconsistent for supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true. For example, if supy(z) = 0, supy(y) = 1, infy(x) = 2, and infy(z) = 3, then all the constraints are satisfied.

For x to be E of z, we'd need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We've already verified supx(z) <= infx(x). The other two conditions, infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), can be satisfied along with the other constraints. For example, if infy(z) = 1, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3, supy(z) = 4, and supy(y) = 0, infy(z) = 1, then all the constraints are met.

For x to be SE of z, we'd need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We've already verified supx(z) <= infx(x). For supy(x) <= infy(z), we need to ensure it's consistent with the other constraints.

Given:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

Again, there's no direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from these. But it's not inconsistent for supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true. For example, if supy(y) = 0, infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 2, and infy(z) = 3, then all the constraints are satisfied.

So, the relations NE, E, and SE are all possible for x with respect to z, given the constraints.

I have triple-checked my results, and I believe the possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE.

ANSWER:

The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

NE, E, SE

Given:
- x is NE of y: This means x is entirely to the northeast of y
- y is SE of z: This means y is entirely to the southeast of z

From these constraints:
- We can determine that x must be east of z (since x is east of y, which is east of z)
- However, the north-south relationship between x and z is not fixed. Depending on the exact positions, x could be:
  - North of z (making x NE of z)
  - At the same north-south level as z (making x E of z) 
  - South of z (making x SE of z)

All three relations (NE, E, SE) satisfy the given constraints.
