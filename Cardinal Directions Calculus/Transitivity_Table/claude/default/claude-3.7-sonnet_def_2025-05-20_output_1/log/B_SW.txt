PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

We need to understand what happens when x is B of y, and y is SW of z. Then we need to determine the possible relation(s) between x and z.

Let's start by recalling the definitions:

1. x B y if and only if:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. y SW z if and only if:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's establish what we know about the bounds of these regions:

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, we need to determine potential relationships between x and z. Let's think step by step.

First, we know that supx(x) ≤ supx(y) from x B y.
We also know that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) from y SW z.
Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z (or on the boundary).

Similarly, for the y-axis:
We know that supy(x) ≤ supy(y) from x B y.
We also know that supy(y) ≤ infy(z) from y SW z.
Therefore, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z (or on the boundary).

So, x is to the left of and below z. This gives us the following possible cardinal directions:
- SW (if x is strictly to the left of and below z)
- W (if x is strictly to the left of z and overlaps with z in the y-axis)
- S (if x is strictly below z and overlaps with z in the x-axis)
- B (if x is entirely within the bounding box of z)

But we need to verify which of these are actually possible given our constraints.

From the constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means that x is strictly to the left of and below z, which corresponds to the SW relation. 

However, let's double-check if the other relations (W, S, B) are possible:

For W:
If x is W of z, then:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily satisfied from our constraints)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily satisfied from our constraints)

For S:
If x is S of z, then:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not necessarily satisfied from our constraints)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily satisfied from our constraints)

For B:
If x is B of z, then:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not necessarily satisfied from our constraints)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily satisfied from our constraints)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not necessarily satisfied from our constraints)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily satisfied from our constraints)

Wait, I think I need to be more careful with my analysis. Let's reconsider what we know and what we can deduce.

From the constraints:
- x B y: x is within the bounding box of y.
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z.

We can't immediately conclude that x is SW of z just because y is. It depends on the exact positions of x within y, and y with respect to z.

Actually, let's take a different approach. Let's think about possible positions of x relative to y, and then see what that implies for the relation between x and z.

Given that x B y, x can be:
1. Entirely contained within y (strict containment).
2. Partially overlapping with y (e.g., x might extend beyond y in some directions).
3. Equal to y.
4. Containing y (x is a larger region that contains y).

Given that y SW z, y is to the southwest of z. That means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's consider the relation between x and z based on different scenarios:

1. If x is entirely contained within y (strict containment):
   In this case, supx(x) < supx(y) and supy(x) < supy(y). Given that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we have supx(x) < infx(z) and supy(x) < infy(z). This means x is to the southwest of z, so x SW z.

2. If x is equal to y:
   In this case, x and y have the same bounding box, so if y is SW of z, then x is also SW of z.

3. If x is partially overlapping with y or contains y:
   This is trickier. If x extends beyond y in any direction, it could potentially impact the relation with z.

I think I was confused in my previous analysis. Let's be more careful and consider all constraints.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

This means that x is contained within the bounding box of y. Note that this doesn't mean x is strictly inside y; it means the limits of x are within the limits of y.

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

These inequalities tell us that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is to the southwest of z.

So, the relation between x and z is SW.

However, wait. I'm not sure if this is correct, since I hadn't considered all possible positions of x within y. Let me reconsider.

Given x B y and y SW z, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's try to deduce what we can about the relation between x and z:

From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z, which narrows down the possible relations to W, SW, or NW.

From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we have supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is below z, which narrows down the possible relations to S, SW, or SE.

Combining these, the only common relation is SW.

But I'm still not sure if this is correct. Let's think again.

Wait, I just realized that the B relation is specifically about being inside the bounding box, not necessarily being fully contained within the region. This means the region x can be anywhere inside the bounding box of y, it doesn't have to strictly follow y's boundaries.

Given x B y, x is within the bounding box of y. This means x might not extend beyond the limits of y in any direction. Given y SW z, y is to the southwest of z, which means y is to the left of and below z.

Given the bounds, x can indeed be located in various positions within the bounding box of y. Depending on the exact position of x within the bounding box of y, and given that y is SW of z, we can have different relations between x and z.

Let's consider some specific cases:

1. If x is situated at the extreme southwest corner of y's bounding box, it will also be SW of z.
2. If x is situated at the extreme west edge of y's bounding box, it might be W of z (if it's aligned with z in the y-axis) or SW of z.
3. If x is situated at the extreme south edge of y's bounding box, it might be S of z (if it's aligned with z in the x-axis) or SW of z.

I think I'm starting to clarify this problem. 

Actually, let's approach this differently. Given the constraints, what do we know about the spatial relation between x and z?

From x B y and y SW z, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These two inequalities tell us that x is to the left of and below z, which is the definition of the SW relation.

So, based on the constraints provided, the relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, let's verify once more. Given x B y and y SW z, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can deduce the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z.

So, x is to the left of and below z, which is the SW relation.

Now, I'm wondering if there are any other potential relations. Let's revisit the definitions:

For x W z: 
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This contradicts the requirement for W that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So x cannot be W of z.

For x S z: 
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This contradicts the requirement for S that infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x cannot be S of z.

For x B z: 
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This contradicts the requirement for B that infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x cannot be B of z.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our constraints, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is below z. But for NW, x should be above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). This is a contradiction. So x cannot be NW of z.

For x N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This contradicts the requirement for N that infx(z) ≤ infx(x). Also, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts the requirement for N that supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So x cannot be N of z.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z. But for NE, x should be to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)). This is a contradiction. So x cannot be NE of z.

For x E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This contradicts the requirement for E that supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x cannot be E of z.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z. But for SE, x should be to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)). This is a contradiction. So x cannot be SE of z.

So, the only valid relation between x and z based on the constraints provided is SW.

Actually, I think I need to check the constraints more rigorously. I introduced a shorthand by saying "x is to the left of z" and "x is below z", but this isn't strictly accurate in the context of the defined cardinal directions. 

Let's go back to the constraints and be more precise.

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Simplifying:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These inequalities match the definition of x SW z, which means x is to the southwest of z.

Checking other relations:

For x W z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not satisfied from our derived constraints, since supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies infy(x) < infy(z))
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily satisfied from our derived constraints)

For x S z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not satisfied from our derived constraints, since supx(x) ≤ infx(z) implies infx(x) < infx(z))
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily satisfied from our derived constraints)

For x B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not satisfied from our derived constraints, since supx(x) ≤ infx(z) implies infx(x) < infx(z))
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not necessarily satisfied from our derived constraints)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not satisfied from our derived constraints, since supy(x) ≤ infy(z) implies infy(x) < infy(z))
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (not necessarily satisfied from our derived constraints)

I'm not going to check all the other relations, but the pattern is clear. The only relation that's consistent with our derived constraints is x SW z.

Ok wait, I should double-check this result with a simple example. Let's imagine:

Region y is a simple square with bottom-left corner at (1, 1) and top-right corner at (2, 2). So, infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 2, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2.

Region z is another square with bottom-left corner at (3, 3) and top-right corner at (4, 4). So, infx(z) = 3, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 4.

We can check that y SW z: supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 3 and supy(y) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 3.

Now, let's place region x such that x B y. One possibility is a smaller square inside y, with bottom-left corner at (1.2, 1.2) and top-right corner at (1.8, 1.8). So, infx(x) = 1.2, supx(x) = 1.8, infy(x) = 1.2, supy(x) = 1.8.

We can check that x B y: infx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(x) = 1.2, supx(x) = 1.8 ≤ supx(y) = 2, infy(y) = 1 ≤ infy(x) = 1.2, supy(x) = 1.8 ≤ supy(y) = 2.

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = 1.8 ≤ infx(z) = 3
- supy(x) = 1.8 ≤ infy(z) = 3

These inequalities match the definition of x SW z. So, x is to the southwest of z, confirming our earlier derivation.

Actually, let's make a modification to the example. Instead of placing x inside y, let's place them such that they share the same bounding box. So, x has bottom-left corner at (1, 1) and top-right corner at (2, 2). In this case, infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 2, infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 2.

We still have x B y (in fact, they have the same bounding box), and y SW z.

Now, the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = 2 ≤ infx(z) = 3
- supy(x) = 2 ≤ infy(z) = 3

Again, these inequalities match the definition of x SW z.

So, both cases confirm our derivation: if x is within the bounding box of y and y is to the southwest of z, then x is to the southwest of z.

Actually, I am starting to second guess myself. I've shown that you can have x SW z, but I said it's the only possible relation. Let me re-confirm that.

Given the constraints, we've derived:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Are there specific positions of x within the bounding box of y such that the relation between x and z is something other than SW?

For example, if x is at the extreme northwest corner of y's bounding box, could we have x NW z? Let's check.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (this is satisfied from our derived constraints)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (this means x is above z)

But from our derived constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z. This contradicts the requirement for NW, so x cannot be NW of z.

Similarly, for x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (this is satisfied from our derived constraints)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (this means z is to the left of or aligned with x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (this means x is to the left of or aligned with z)

But from our derived constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement for S that infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

I've gone through this logic for a bunch of possible directions, and I'm convinced that the only valid relation given the constraints is x SW z.

Let me double-check that in a slightly different way.

Given the constraints, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This means that the projection of x onto the x-axis is completely to the left of the projection of z onto the x-axis. Similarly, the projection of x onto the y-axis is completely below the projection of z onto the y-axis.

This is the definition of x being to the southwest of z, or x SW z.

All other relations require at least one of these conditions to be violated, which would contradict our derived constraints.

So, the possible relation between x and z based on the given constraints (x B y and y SW z) is SW.

Actually, wait. I've been convincing myself and I am confident that the relation is SW, but what if the regions have strange shapes or are in unusual positions?

Let's remember that we're working with regions in REG, which are regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. These are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries.

Given x B y and y SW z, the constraints on their bounding boxes are as I've derived.

With strange shapes or positions, the regions might overlap or intersect in complex ways, but the constraints on the bounding boxes remain the same.

Given the constraints on the bounding boxes, it's clear that the relation between x and z is SW. This means x is to the southwest of z.

Let's recap:

From x B y and y SW z, we derived the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These constraints define the cardinal direction relation x SW z. And as I've checked, no other cardinal direction relation is consistent with these constraints.

So, the possible relation between x and z is SW.

OK, I'm going to think step-by-step once more, following the definition of the cardinal directions.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Therefore:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Now let's check which cardinal direction relation this fits.

For SW:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)

This is indeed the SW relation.

Let's confirm that no other relation is possible. For a case to be possible, we need to find a configuration of regions x, y, z that satisfy all conditions.

For W:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (from our constraints)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (required for W)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (required for W)

But from our constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This would imply supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(x). This is a contradiction because for any region a, infy(a) ≤ supy(a). So, x cannot be W of z.

Similarly, for S:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (from our constraints)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (required for S)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (required for S)

But from our constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This would imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(x). This is a contradiction because for any region a, infx(a) ≤ supx(a). So, x cannot be S of z.

For the other directions, similar contradictions arise. For instance, for B, we'd need both infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradict the derived constraints.

So, the relation between x and z is uniquely determined as SW, given the conditions x B y and y SW z.

So to sum up my analysis, the possible relation between x and z is SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions and constraints:

When x is B of y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

When y is SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Therefore:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These inequalities satisfy the definition of the SW relation. The region x must be to the southwest of region z.
