PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's walk through this step-by-step.

We have the following information:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is S of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's understand what these relations mean:

1. x B y means that x is in the bounding box of y. That is:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. y S z means that y is South of z. That is:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relation between x and z.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y S z, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let's combine these constraints:

From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means that x is below z, which is consistent with S, SW, or SE relations.

From infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), we get infx(z) ≤ infx(x). This constraint is consistent with relations: B, S, SE, E, NE, N.

From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This constraint is consistent with relations: B, S, SW, W, NW, N.

Hmm, I think I need to reconsider this. Let's approach it differently.

Let's draw it out. Imagine region y as a rectangle, region z is above y, and region x is inside y.

From x B y:
- x is inside the bounding box of y.

From y S z:
- y is South of z, which means y is below z.
- The x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z.

Now, if x is inside y and y is below z, then x must also be below z.

Moreover, since the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z, and x is inside y, the x-projection of x must also be within the x-projection of z.

So, x is below z and the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z. This corresponds to the S (South) relation.

But wait, let's double-check this reasoning and ensure there are no other possibilities.

Actually, I realize my reasoning was incomplete. When we say x B y, it means x is inside the bounding box of y, but it doesn't mean x covers the entire bounding box of y. It could be a smaller region inside y.

Given that y S z, the possible relations between x and z could be:

1. S (South): If x is inside y and doesn't extend outside the x-projection of y.
2. SW (South West): If x is positioned in such a way that it extends to the left of the x-projection of z.
3. SE (South East): If x is positioned in such a way that it extends to the right of the x-projection of z.

Since we know from x B y and y S z that:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

These inequalities show that the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of z. Therefore, the possible relation between x and z is S (South).

Hmm, but I'm not convinced that this is the only possible relation. Let me think again.

Actually, I made a mistake. When we say x B y, it means x is inside the bounding box of y, not necessarily that x is a smaller region inside y. Let me reconsider the constraints.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the right edge of x is to the left of or coincident with the right edge of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom edge of x is above or coincident with the bottom edge of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (the top edge of x is below or coincident with the top edge of y)

From y S z, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (the top edge of y is below or coincident with the bottom edge of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (the left edge of y is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (the right edge of y is to the left of or coincident with the right edge of z)

Now, let's determine the constraints on the relation between x and z:

- From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is below z, which is consistent with S, SW, or SE relations.

Actually, I think I'm complicating things unnecessarily. Let me approach this more systematically.

From the constraints:
- From infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we know the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z.
- From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), we know the right edge of x is to the left of or coincident with the right edge of z.
- From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we know the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z.

Now, let's analyze each possible cardinal direction relation between x and z:

1. B (Bounding Box): This means x is inside the bounding box of z. This requires:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From our constraints, the first two are satisfied, but not the third one because we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

2. S (South): This means x is South of z. This requires:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   All of these are satisfied by our constraints.

3. SW (South West): This means x is South West of z. This requires:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   From our constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

4. W (West): This means x is West of z. This requires:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From our constraints, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

5. NW (North West): This means x is North West of z. This requires:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   From our constraints, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

6. N (North): This means x is North of z. This requires:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   From our constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

7. NE (North East): This means x is North East of z. This requires:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   From our constraints, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

8. E (East): This means x is East of z. This requires:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From our constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

9. SE (South East): This means x is South East of z. This requires:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   From our constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Oh wait, I think I misunderstood what is meant by infx, supx, etc. Let me reconsider this more carefully.

Ok, let me make sure I understand the information provided with a different approach.

If region x is B of region y:
This means that the region x is contained inside the bounding box of y.

If region y is S of region z:
This means that y is located South of z. The y-projection of y is strictly below the y-projection of z, and the x-projection of y is inside the x-projection of z.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between region x and region z?

Since x is inside the bounding box of y, and y is South of z, it follows that x must also be South of z. However, there's a catch: the x-projection of x might not be inside the x-projection of z.

Let's call the bounding boxes of regions x, y, and z as Bx, By, and Bz respectively.

Given that x is B of y, the bounding box Bx is inside By.
Given that y is S of z, the bounding box By is South of Bz.

Since Bx is inside By, and By is South of Bz, it follows that Bx is South of Bz.
This means that the region x is South (S) of the region z.

But hold on, I'm not sure if this reasoning is correct, as the definition of cardinal direction involves the spatial relation of regions, not just their bounding boxes. Let me revisit the definition.

Actually, upon further reflection, I think my reasoning is incorrect. Let's rethink this.

Given that region x is B of region y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Given that region y is S of region z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, we can derive:
1. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. This is consistent with S, SW, and SE.
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z. This is inconsistent with W, NW, and SW.
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which means the right edge of x is to the left of or coincident with the right edge of z. This is inconsistent with E, NE, and SE.

Given these constraints, x could be S (South) of z.

But actually I made a logical mistake. Let's revise my understanding:

From infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we determine that the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z. This is consistent with S, B, N, SE, NE, E, and inconsistent with W, NW, SW.

From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), we determine that the right edge of x is to the left of or coincident with the right edge of z. This is consistent with S, B, N, SW, NW, W, and inconsistent with E, NE, SE.

Combining the above, x could be S, B, or N of z, as these are the only directions that are consistent with both constraints.

But I need to add the constraint also from supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. This is consistent with S, SW, and SE, and inconsistent with B, N, NE, E, NW, W.

So, combining all three constraints, the only possible relation is S.

But wait, I'm not sure if I've understood the problem correctly still. Let's approach it differently.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is S of region z

The B relation means that x is inside the bounding box of y. The S relation means that y is South of z.

Let's consider the vertices of the bounding boxes.
For the bounding box of region x, the vertices are at (infx(x), infy(x)), (supx(x), infy(x)), (infx(x), supy(x)), and (supx(x), supy(x)).
For the bounding box of region y, the vertices are at (infx(y), infy(y)), (supx(y), infy(y)), (infx(y), supy(y)), and (supx(y), supy(y)).
For the bounding box of region z, the vertices are at (infx(z), infy(z)), (supx(z), infy(z)), (infx(z), supy(z)), and (supx(z), supy(z)).

From x is B of y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y is S of z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z)

Now I need to determine which of the cardinal direction relations between x and z is consistent with these inequalities.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our inequalities, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Both conditions are satisfied, so x S z is possible.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

From our inequalities, we know that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our inequalities, we know that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Additionally, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ supy(x). So, x W z is not possible.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our inequalities, we know that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Additionally, we know that infy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our inequalities, we know that infy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x N z is not possible.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our inequalities, we know that infx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Additionally, we know that infy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our inequalities, we know that infx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Additionally, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ supy(x). So, x E z is not possible.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

From our inequalities, we know that infx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x SE z is not possible.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our inequalities, we know that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), so these are satisfied. However, we also know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x B z is not possible.

Looking back based on the given constraints, the only possible relation between x and z is S (South).

But let me double check:

For B:
We can rule this out from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as this means the region x is completely below region z.

For S:
We need supx(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z), and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's horizontal projection is within z's).
From our derived constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x S z is possible.

For SW:
We need supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z).
From our derived constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) but infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

For W:
We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's vertical projection is within z's).
From our derived constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x W z is not possible.

For NW:
We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z).
From our derived constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

For N:
We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's horizontal projection is within z's).
From our derived constraints, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x N z is not possible.

For NE:
We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z).
From our derived constraints, supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Additionally, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

For E:
We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's vertical projection is within z's).
From our derived constraints, supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Additionally, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x E z is not possible.

For SE:
We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).
From our derived constraints, supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x SE z is not possible.

Wait, I've made a logical error in my checks. Let me approach this more systematically.

Given the constraints, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

1. For x to be in B of z, we need:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   
   From our constraints, the first two are satisfied. However, since supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z, this contradicts with infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means the bottom of x is above the bottom of z. So, x B z is not possible.

2. For x to be in S of z, we need:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   
   From our constraints, all three conditions are satisfied. So, x S z is possible.

3. For x to be in SW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   
   While the second condition is satisfied, the first is contradicted by our constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z. So, x SW z is not possible.

4. For x to be in W of z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   
   The first condition is contradicted by our constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x). Additionally, the second is indirectly contradicted by our constraints supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as it would imply that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which can't be true if x is to the west of z. So, x W z is not possible.

5. For x to be in NW of z, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   
   Both conditions are contradicted by our constraints. The first by infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and the second by supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x NW z is not possible.

6. For x to be in N of z, we need:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   
   While the second and third conditions are satisfied, the first is contradicted by our constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x N z is not possible.

7. For x to be in NE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   
   Both conditions are contradicted by our constraints. The first by supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and the second by supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x NE z is not possible.

8. For x to be in E of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   
   The first condition is contradicted by our constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Additionally, the second is indirectly contradicted by our constraints supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as it would imply that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which can't be true if x is to the east of z. So, x E z is not possible.

9. For x to be in SE of z, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   
   While the second condition is satisfied, the first is contradicted by our constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x SE z is not possible.

Given the constraints, the only possible relation between x and z is S (South).

Actually, let me reconsider and see if I'm making a logical mistake somewhere:

From region x B region y:
- Region x is inside the bounding box of region y.
- This means infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- In other words, x is bounded by y on all sides.

From region y S region z:
- Region y is south of region z.
- This means supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (the x-projection of y is within the x-projection of z).

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to combine these constraints.

Given the constraints:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

We can infer:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, let's check each cardinal direction relation.

1. x B z: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From our inferences, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), so these are satisfied. But we also know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z. This contradicts the requirement infy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x B z. So, x B z is not possible.

2. x S z: We need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   From our inferences, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). All conditions are satisfied. So, x S z is possible.

3. x SW z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   From our inferences, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), so this is satisfied. But we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for x SW z (because if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), then certainly supx(x) cannot be less than or equal to infx(z)). So, x SW z is not possible.

4. x W z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From our inferences, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for x W z. Additionally, the fact that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts the requirement infy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x W z (because if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is entirely below z, and can't have its bottom above the bottom of z). So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   From our inferences, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z) for x NW z. Additionally, if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x's top is below z's bottom, which contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x NW z (because if x's top is below z's bottom, then z's top certainly can't be below x's bottom). So, x NW z is not possible.

6. x N z: We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   From our inferences, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first two are satisfied, but the fact that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x N z (again, if x's top is below z's bottom, then z's top certainly can't be below x's bottom). So, x N z is not possible.

7. x NE z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   From our inferences, we know infx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first contradicts the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for x NE z (because if infx(x) ≤ supx(z), then certainly supx(z) cannot be less than or equal to infx(x)). Additionally, the fact that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x NE z. So, x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From our inferences, we know infx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first contradicts the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for x E z. Additionally, the fact that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts the requirement infy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x E z. So, x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   From our inferences, we know infx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first contradicts the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x) for x SE z. So, x SE z is not possible.

Given the constraints, the only possible relation between x and z is S (South).

Let me run through this once more with a slight change of perspective.

From region x B region y:
- x is in the bounding box of y.
- This means that the boundaries of x are contained within or aligned with the boundaries of y.

From region y S region z:
- y is south of z.
- This means that y is strictly below z, and the horizontal (x) extent of y is within the horizontal extent of z.

Visualizing this, since x is inside y, and y is below z, the combined relation is that x is also below z. Moreover, since the horizontal extent of y is within the horizontal extent of z, and x is inside y, the horizontal extent of x is also within the horizontal extent of z.

This aligns with the south (S) relation between x and z, where x is strictly below z and the horizontal extent of x is within the horizontal extent of z.

Actually, I think should think about this problem more carefully. Let's go step by step.

Given information:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is S of region z

Let's understand what these relations mean.

For B:
- x is inside the bounding box of y.
- Constraints: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For S:
- y is south of z.
- Constraints: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let's combine these constraints to understand the relation between x and z.

From B:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From S:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

I need a way to understand the relation between x and z. Let's derive the constraints between x and z.

From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
From infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

So, these are the constraints we have for the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Next, let's determine which cardinal direction relation between x and z satisfies these constraints.

For x S z:
- We need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- All these constraints are satisfied. So, x S z is a possible relation.

For x SW z:
- We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- We know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (because if the left edge of x is to the right of the left edge of z, then the right edge of x can't be to the left of the left edge of z). So, x SW z is not possible.

For x W z:
- We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- We know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x W z is not possible.

For x NW z:
- We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- We know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Additionally, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which, when combined with the constraint for NW that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), would imply supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which is a contradiction. So, x NW z is not possible.

For x N z:
- We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- We know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but we also know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x N z is not possible.

For x NE z:
- We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- We know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

For x E z:
- We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- We know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x E z is not possible.

For x SE z:
- We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- We know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x SE z is not possible.

For x B z:
- We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- We know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), so these are satisfied. But we also know supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies that the top of x is below the bottom of z. This contradicts the need for infy(z) ≤ infy(x) for x B z (because if the top of x is below the bottom of z, then the bottom of x can't be above or at the bottom of z). So, x B z is not possible.

Based on these checks, the only possible relation between x and z is S (South).

Alright, I'll take another approach to double-check. Let me draw out the regions schematically:

Given:
- Region x is B of region y. This means x is inside the bounding box of y.
- Region y is S of region z. This means y is south of z.

Schematically, we might have:

```
   ___z___
  |       |
  |       |
  |_______|
   ___y___
  |       |
  |  _x_  |
  | |   | |
  | |___| |
  |_______|
```

From this schematic, it's clear that x is south of z. This is because x is inside y, and y is south of z.

Let's also check boundary cases:

If x is at the northern-most point of y:

```
   ___z___
  |       |
  |       |
  |_______|
   ___y___
  |  _x_  |
  | |   | |
  | |___| |
  |       |
  |_______|
```

Even in this case, x is south of z.

If x is at the southern-most point of y:

```
   ___z___
  |       |
  |       |
  |_______|
   ___y___
  |       |
  |       |
  |  _x_  |
  | |   | |
  |_|___|_|
```

x is still south of z.

If x is at the western-most point of y:

```
   ___z___
  |       |
  |       |
  |_______|
   ___y___
  |       |
  |_x_    |
  ||  |   |
  ||__|   |
  |_______|
```

x is still south of z.

If x is at the eastern-most point of y:

```
   ___z___
  |       |
  |       |
  |_______|
   ___y___
  |       |
  |    _x_|
  |   |  ||
  |   |__||
  |_______|
```

x is still south of z.

Even in these boundary cases, the relation between x and z is S (South). This is due to the constraint supy(y) ≤ infy(z) from y S z, which means the top of y is below or at the bottom of z. Combined with x B y, which means x is inside y, the top of x must also be below or at the bottom of z, leading to the south relation between x and z.

After careful analysis of all possible configurations, I'm confident that the only possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is S (South).

Actually, let me double-check once again that our definition of S matches the constraints we're checking.

From the definition in the problem:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This means for region x to be S of region z, we need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z) (the top of x is below or at the bottom of z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z)
3. supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or coincident with the right edge of z)

From our derived constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (from supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z))
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (from infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x))
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (from supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z))

All three constraints for the S relation are satisfied. Therefore, x S z is a possible relation.

And to be extra thorough, let me also double-check that no other relation is possible:

For SW:
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
For x SW z, we would need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)
We know that infx(z) <= infx(x) (from our derived constraints), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (because infx(x) <= supx(x) by definition). So, x SW z is not possible.

For W:
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
For x W z, we would need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(z)
We know that supy(x) <= infy(z) (from our derived constraints), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) (because if the top of x is below the bottom of z, then the bottom of x cannot be above the bottom of z). So, x W z is not possible.

Similarly, by checking each relation using its definition, we find that S is the only possible relation.

To conclude, the only possible cardinal direction relation between region x and region z is S (South).

Actually, after further deliberation, I believe there might be other possible relations between region x and region z. Let's redo this.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y. This means infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- Region y is S of region z. This means supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Combining these:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from our derived constraints)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from our derived constraints)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from our derived constraints)

For x to be in B of z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (satisfied)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (satisfied)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not satisfied because supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (satisfied)

For x to be in S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (satisfied)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (satisfied)

For x to be in SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (not satisfied because infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)

For x to be in W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (not satisfied because infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not satisfied because supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (satisfied)

For x to be in NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (not satisfied because infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not satisfied because supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z, so the top of z can't be below the bottom of x)

For x to be in N of z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not satisfied because supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z, so the top of z can't be below the bottom of x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (satisfied)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (satisfied)

For x to be in NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not satisfied because supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means the right edge of x is to the left of or coincident with the right edge of z, so the right edge of z can't be to the left of the left edge of x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not satisfied because supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z, so the top of z can't be below the bottom of x)

For x to be in E of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not satisfied because supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means the right edge of x is to the left of or coincident with the right edge of z, so the right edge of z can't be to the left of the left edge of x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not satisfied because supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means the top of x is below the bottom of z, so the bottom of x can't be above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (satisfied)

For x to be in SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not satisfied because supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means the right edge of x is to the left of or coincident with the right edge of z, so the right edge of z can't be to the left of the left edge of x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (satisfied)

Based on this analysis, the only relation between region x and region z that satisfies all the constraints is S (South).

Let me just try this again to make sure I've gotten it right.

Given information:
- Region x is B of region y. This means x is inside the bounding box of y.
- Region y is S of region z. This means y is south of z.

Let's extract the constraints:
- x B y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

I'm going to derive the constraints for the relation between x and z:
- From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- From infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

Now, let's go through each of the cardinal directions and see which one(s) match our derived constraints:

1. B (Bounding Box): Requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   Our derived constraints satisfy the first and second, but from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we know that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

2. S (South): Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   All of these are satisfied by our derived constraints.

3. SW (South West): Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   The second is satisfied, but from infx(z) ≤ infx(x), we know that the left edge of x is to the right of or coincident with the left edge of z, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

4. W (West): Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From our derived constraints, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Also, from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we know the top of x is below the bottom of z, which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

5. NW (North West): Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   From our derived constraints, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Also, from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we know the top of x is below the bottom of z, which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

6. N (North): Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The second and third are satisfied, but from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we know the top of x is below the bottom of z, which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

7. NE (North East): Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   From our derived constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Also, from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we know the top of x is below the bottom of z, which contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

8. E (East): Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From our derived constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Also, from supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we know the top of x is below the bottom of z, which contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

9. SE (South East): Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   The second is satisfied, but from our derived constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Based on this comprehensive analysis, the only relation between region x and region z that satisfies all the derived constraints is S (South).

OK, I'll try this one more time. Let's consider this problem again:

Given information:
- Region x is B of region y.
- Region y is S of region z.

Based on the definitions:
1. x B y means that x is in the bounding box of y. This means:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. y S z means that y is South of z. This means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

I'm going to derive the constraints for the relation between x and z:
- From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- From infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

I think the main difference between the constraints for the relation between x and z and the definition of the "S" relation is that the constraints explicitly state:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

And looking at the definition of "S":
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

Which matches exactly when a is x and b is z.

So, based on this, the relation "x S z" is the only possible relation.
