PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Alright, so I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that:
1. Region x is NE of region y
2. Region y is NW of region z

Let's recall the definitions of the cardinal directions from the context:

For x NE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (meaning x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (meaning x is to the north of y)

For y NW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (meaning y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (meaning y is to the north of z)

Now, I need to determine what these two relations imply for the relation between x and z.

From x NE of y, we know:
- x is to the east of y
- x is to the north of y

From y NW of z, we know:
- y is to the west of z
- y is to the north of z

Let's see what we can deduce about the relation between x and z:

For the east-west relationship:
- We know x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x))
- We know y is to the west of z (supx(y) <= infx(z))
- But this doesn't directly tell us whether x is to the east or west of z. Both are possible.

For the north-south relationship:
- We know x is to the north of y (supy(y) <= infy(x))
- We know y is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(y))
- By transitivity, this means x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x))

So, we can conclude that x is to the north of z, but we don't have enough information to determine if x is to the east or west of z or possibly overlapping in the east-west direction.

From the definitions of the cardinal directions, x could be N, NE, or NW of z, depending on its east-west relationship with z.

Let's break it down:

If x is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), then x is NE of z.
If x is to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), then x is NW of z.
If x and z overlap in the east-west direction (but not completely, otherwise it would be a different relation), then x is N of z.

Wait, I think I need to be more precise. Let me think through this step by step again:

From x NE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y NW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

For the east-west relationship:
- x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- y is to the west of z: supx(y) <= infx(z)

Hmm, these don't directly give us a relation between x and z in the east-west direction. We can't determine if x is to the east or west of z based on these inequalities alone. Both are possible.

For the north-south relationship:
- x is to the north of y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is to the north of z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

By transitivity: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

So, given these constraints, x can be N, NE, or NW of z, depending on its east-west relationship with z.

Let's double-check by considering an example:

Imagine y has a bounding box with corners at (5, 5) and (10, 10).
Then, for x to be NE of y, it might have a bounding box with corners at (12, 12) and (15, 15).
For z to have y as NW, it might have a bounding box with corners at (12, 0) and (15, 3).

In this example, x is NE of z (both to the north and to the east).

But we can construct other examples where x is N or NW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE
- N
- NW

No, wait. Let's reconsider this. I think I'm confusing myself a bit. Let's take a step back and be more systematic.

Let's denote the bounding boxes of the regions as follows:
- x has a bounding box defined by (infx(x), supx(x)) on the x-axis and (infy(x), supy(x)) on the y-axis.
- y has a bounding box defined by (infx(y), supx(y)) on the x-axis and (infy(y), supy(y)) on the y-axis.
- z has a bounding box defined by (infx(z), supx(z)) on the x-axis and (infy(z), supy(z)) on the y-axis.

Given:
1. x is NE of y: 
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y is NW of z:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (by transitivity, x is to the north of z)

But we don't have a direct relation between x and z in the east-west direction based on the given constraints.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: x is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)).
In this case, x is NE of z.

Case 2: x is to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)).
In this case, x is NW of z.

Case 3: x and z overlap in the east-west direction, but not completely. 
That is, infx(x) <= supx(z) and infx(z) <= supx(x), but not both infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x). 
In this case, x is N of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE
- N
- NW

But wait, I think I need to check if there are any constraints that rule out any of these possibilities.

Let's see:
We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), but these don't provide a direct relation between x and z in the east-west direction.

Let's imagine specific coordinates to illustrate:

Case 1 (x is NE of z):
y has a bounding box with corners at (0, 10) and (5, 15).
z has a bounding box with corners at (10, 0) and (15, 5).
x has a bounding box with corners at (20, 20) and (25, 25).

Here, y is NW of z, x is NE of y, and x is NE of z.

Case 2 (x is N of z):
y has a bounding box with corners at (5, 10) and (10, 15).
z has a bounding box with corners at (15, 0) and (20, 5).
x has a bounding box with corners at (7, 20) and (17, 25).

Here, y is NW of z, x is NE of y, and x is N of z.

Case 3 (x is NW of z):
y has a bounding box with corners at (0, 10) and (5, 15).
z has a bounding box with corners at (10, 0) and (15, 5).
x has a bounding box with corners at (7, 20) and (9, 25).

Here, y is NW of z, x is NE of y, and x is NW of z.

I think all three cases are possible based on the given constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE
- N
- NW

Wait, I should double-check my third example (Case 3). Let me verify that x is NE of y and y is NW of z:

x is NE of y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) => 5 <= 7 (true, x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) => 15 <= 20 (true, x is to the north of y)

y is NW of z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) => 5 <= 10 (true, y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) => 5 <= 10 (true, y is to the north of z)

x is NW of z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) => 9 <= 10 (true, x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) => 5 <= 20 (true, x is to the north of z)

So, the coordinates for Case 3 check out. This means all three relations (NE, N, NW) are possible between x and z.

But let me continue thinking. The question asks for all possible relations between x and z, not just the ones that satisfy the constraints in the examples I provided.

Given the constraints:
1. x is NE of y
2. y is NW of z

We know for sure that x is to the north of z (as shown earlier).

In the east-west direction, we don't have a direct constraint between x and z. However, we do know:
- x is to the east of y
- y is to the west of z

But this doesn't constrain x and z relative to each other in the east-west direction.

Let's consider a different example:
y has a bounding box with corners at (5, 10) and (10, 15).
z has a bounding box with corners at (15, 0) and (20, 5).
x has a bounding box with corners at (12, 20) and (13, 25).

Here, x is to the east of y (5 <= 10 <= 12) and to the north of y (15 <= 20), so x is NE of y.
And y is to the west of z (10 <= 15) and to the north of z (5 <= 10), so y is NW of z.

But in this example, x is to the west of z (13 <= 15), positioning x NW of z.

Wait, I made an error. Let me rethink.

If x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x)), and y is to the west of z (supx(y) <= infx(z)), it doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z on the east-west axis.

It could be that:
- x is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x))
- x is to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z))
- x and z overlap in the east-west direction, but not completely.

So, given the constraints x is NE of y and y is NW of z, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE
- N
- NW

I believe these are the only possible relations because we know x is to the north of z, and the east-west relationship between x and z can vary, resulting in these three possibilities.

Actually, there's one more case to consider: what if x and z overlap completely in the east-west direction? This would mean infx(x) = infx(z) and supx(x) = supx(z). In this case, the relation would still be N.

So, my final answer is:
The possible relations between region x and region z, given that region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, are:
- NE
- N
- NW

But wait, I need to check if there's any other relation that I might have missed. 

Let's see if B is a possibility. For x B z, we need:
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Given that x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)), it contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) required for B. So, B is not a possibility.

Let's check if E is a possibility. For x E z, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Again, the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) is contradicted by the fact that x is to the north of z. So, E is not a possibility.

Similarly, W, SW, S, and SE are not possible due to the constraint that x is to the north of z.

So, the only possible relations between region x and region z, given the constraints, are:
- NE
- N
- NW

Let me check one more time if I might be missing anything.

wait I messed up something, let me review the definition one more time:

a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

This means:
- a is to the east of b: The rightmost edge of b is to the left of the leftmost edge of a.
- a is to the north of b: The topmost edge of b is below the bottommost edge of a.

So going back to our constraints:

1. x is NE of y: 
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y is NW of z:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (by transitivity, x is to the north of z)

However, we don't have a direct relation between x and z in the east-west direction.

Let me try to examine it more visually, with a 2D coordinate system where the positive direction of the y-axis is northward and the positive direction of the x-axis is eastward.

Let's say y is in the northwest corner of the diagram, z is in the southeast corner, and x is in the northeast corner.

It all depends on the relative positions of x and z in the east-west direction. If x is to the east of z, then x is NE of z. If x is to the west of z, then x is NW of z. If x and z are aligned in the east-west direction, then x is N of z.

Given the constraints, these three scenarios are all possible.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z, given the constraints, are:
- NE
- N
- NW

I'm confident that these are the only three possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

Actually, wait. I said that if x and z overlap in the east-west direction, then x is N of z. However, this is not entirely correct. To be N of z, x needs to be directly above z in the east-west direction. 

Let me clarify with the definitions.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection)

Given the constraint that x is to the north of z, the first condition is satisfied.

For the second condition, we need to check if it's possible for x's projection on the x-axis to be contained within z's projection. With the current constraints, there's nothing preventing this, so N is a possibility.

Actually I realize I've been inconsistent. Let me clarify the definition again:

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection)

Actually, that doesn't sound right. Let's read the definition from the given context again:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

So, for x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the western edge of z is to the west of or aligned with the western edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the eastern edge of x is to the west of or aligned with the eastern edge of z)

The first condition is satisfied due to the transitive property we've established. But the other two conditions require x's east-west extent to be within z's. Given the current constraints, this is not guaranteed, and we'd need to verify if it's even possible.

From x NE of y and y NW of z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)

From these, we can't directly deduce anything about the east-west relationship between x and z. It could be that x is to the east of z, to the west of z, or overlapping. Without any additional constraints, we can't rule out any of these possibilities.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z, given the constraints, remain:
- NE (if x is to the east of z)
- N (if x's east-west extent is within z's)
- NW (if x is to the west of z)

But actually, there might be more possibilities. Let's think about it:

Case 1: x is entirely to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)). Then, x is NE of z.
Case 2: x is entirely to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)). Then, x is NW of z.
Case 3: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means x's east-west extent is contained within z's. Then, x is N of z.
Hmm, are there other cases?

Case 4: infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x). This means z's east-west extent is contained within x's. If x is to the north of z, what relation would this be?

Looking at the definition: a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For Case 4, we have infx(x) <= infx(z) (which is the opposite of infx(z) <= infx(x)) and supx(z) <= supx(x) (which is the opposite of supx(x) <= supx(z)). This doesn't fit the definition for N.

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me review the definitions once more:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

Case 4 actually contradicts this. So, Case a case where the east-west extents are aligned in this way, given the north-south relationship, it wouldn't be N.

Let's see:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

Case 4 doesn't fit either of these.

Wait, there's an issue in my reasoning. In the definition, it says: a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

For Case 4, I said infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x). This doesn't fit the definition for x N z because we would need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

But I think I'm still not fully capturing all the cases. Let's break it down differently:

Case A: x is entirely to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)). Then, x is NE of z.
Case B: x is entirely to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)). Then, x is NW of z.
Case C: x and z overlap in the east-west direction. This can be further broken down:
Case C1: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means x's east-west extent is contained within z's. Then, x is N of z.
Case C2: infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x). This means z's east-west extent is contained within x's.
Case C3: infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means the western edge of x is to the west of the western edge of z, and the eastern edge of x is to the west of the eastern edge of z.
Case C4: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= supx(x). This means the western edge of z is to the west of the western edge of x, and the eastern edge of z is to the west of the eastern edge of x.

For all these cases, we have established that x is to the north of z.

For Case C2, it doesn't fit any of the definitions for the single-tile cardinal directions. It doesn't fit N, NE, or NW.

But I'm also realizing that the general from of a cardinal relation in this context isn't limited to a single tile. The definition says a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where certain conditions are met. This means we can have multi-tile directions like N:NE, which would represent a region that spans both the N and NE tiles.

Let's re-approach the problem:
For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's east-west extent is contained within z's)

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Now, if x and z don't fit into any of these SINGLE tile descriptions, then we might need a multi-tile description.

Case C2: infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x).
This means the western edge of x is to the west of the western edge of z, and the eastern edge of x is to the east of the eastern edge of z. In other words, x's east-west extent completely contains z's.

Given that x is also to the north of z, this doesn't fit a single-tile cardinal direction. It spans multiple tiles, namely NW, N, and NE.

To be more specific, we can say the relation is NW:N:NE, meaning that the x region has parts in the NW, N, and NE tiles relative to z.

Similarly, we can analyze Case C3 and Case C4:

Case C3: infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
This means the western edge of x is to the west of the western edge of z, and the eastern edge of x is to the west of the eastern edge of z. This is a combination of NW and W. However, given that x is to the north of z, it's a combination of NW and N.

Wait, this is a description for if the regions can extend over multiple tiles, not the cardinal direction itself. I think I'm getting confused.

Let's go back to the original definitions:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

With these, let's analyze the cases again:

Case A: x is entirely to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)) and to the north (supy(z) <= infy(x)). Then, x is NE of z.
Case B: x is entirely to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) and to the north (supy(z) <= infy(x)). Then, x is NW of z.
Case C: x and z overlap in the east-west direction, and x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)).

For Case C, we need to see if it fits the definition for N:
For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we have) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

But in general, for Case C, we have x and z overlapping in the east-west direction, which can be any of the following:
Case C1: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means x's east-west extent is contained within z's. This is N.
Case C2: infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x). This means z's east-west extent is contained within x's.
Case C3: infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means x partially overlaps with z.
Case C4: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= supx(x). This means z partially overlaps with x.

For Cases C2, C3, and C4, we need to identify the cardinal directions they represent.

Oh, I think I get it now. The single-tile relations are defined for specific configurations, but any region a in relation to a reference region b can span multiple tiles. This is captured by the expression R1:...:Rk.

I think my interpretation now correctly reads the definitions. So, for Case C1, I'm correct: it's N.

For Case C2, C3, and C4, it's not a single-tile relation. We need to express it as a multi-tile relation. The region x in these cases might span multiple tiles relative to z, such as NW:N:NE, NW:N, or N:NE.

wait now I feel like I'm overthinking this a lot.

if region x is NE of region y and region y is NW of region z, it's asking for the cardinal direction of x relative to z, and the answer can only be one of the 9 basic directions: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B.

This means the regions are partitioned into 9 basic cardinal regions always, and I just have to figure out which one x falls in.  Specifically, x is always to the north of z (either NW, N, or NE).

Let me make sure I understand the question now.

The question is asking for the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that:
1. Region x is NE of region y
2. Region y is NW of region z

And the answer should be one or more of the 9 basic cardinal directions.

We've established that x is to the north of z (because y is to the north of z and x is to the north of y).

The east-west relationship between x and z is not constrained by the given information. It could be that x is to the east of z, to the west of z, or they have some overlap in the east-west direction.

The three basic cardinal directions (of the 9) that have "north" in them are:
N, NE, and NW.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- N (if x's east-west extent is contained within z's)
- NE (if x is to the east of z)
- NW (if x is to the west of z)

Ugh, ok, I need to be more careful again. Let's look at the definitions straight from the context:

a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

With these, let me analyze the cases:

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

We've already established that x is to the north of z. For the east-west relationship, I've been considering the case where x is to the east of z, so this is a legitimate possibility.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

Again, x is to the north of z. And for the east-west relationship, I've been considering the case where x is to the west of z, so this is also a legitimate possibility.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the western edge of z is to the west of or aligned with the western edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the eastern edge of x is to the west of or aligned with the eastern edge of z)

While x is to the north of z, the other two conditions are specific. They require x's east-west extent to be contained within z's. Given the current constraints, this is not guaranteed. But it's a possibility given that x could be to the east of y and y could be to the west of z, and x's east-west extent could still be contained within z's.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- N
- NE
- NW

But wait, I'm overthinking again. Let me approach this problem differently.

Given that x is NE of y, and y is NW of z, here are the possible spatial configurations:

1. The north-south relation is clear. Since y is to the north of z, and x is to the north of y, x is definitely to the north of z.
   
2. The east-west relation between x and z depends on the relative positions of x, y, and z on the east-west axis.
   
   a. If x is to the east of z, then x is NE of z.
   b. If x is to the west of z, then x is NW of z.
   c. If x and z overlap in the east-west direction, and specifically, if x's east-west extent is contained within z's, then x is N of z.

Based on the given constraints, all three of these cases are possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:
- N
- NE
- NW

Actually, wait. I need to be careful with that claim (c). Let me check if it's possible for x's east-west extent to be contained within z's.

Given:
1. x is NE of y:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. y is NW of z:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is already established through transitivity)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the western edge of z is to the west of or aligned with the western edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the eastern edge of x is to the west of or aligned with the eastern edge of z)

Given the constraints, is it possible for both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) to be true?

We know supx(y) <= infx(x), which means y is to the west of x.
We also know supx(y) <= infx(z), which means y is to the west of z.

These constraints don't directly tell us anything about the east-west relationship between x and z. Specifically, we don't have constraints on infx(x) vs. infx(z) or supx(x) vs. supx(z).

Without any additional constraints, it's entirely possible for infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) to be true, which would make N a possible relation between x and z.

OK so all of N, NE and NW are perfectly possible. The question is -- is there any other direction beyond these three that is possible?

Let's go through all directions:

1. B (bounding box): For x B z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But given that x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), it contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z). So, B is not a possibility.

2. S (South): For x S z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But again, the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the fact that x is to the north of z. So, S is not a possibility.

3. E (East): For x E z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) means x is to the east of z, and infy(z) <= infy(x) means the bottom edge of z is below or aligned with the bottom edge of x. But, given that x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) is contradicted. So, E is not a possibility.

4. W (West): For x W z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The condition supx(x) <= infx(z) means x is to the west of z, and infy(z) <= infy(x) means the bottom edge of z is below or aligned with the bottom edge of x. But, given that x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) is contradicted. So, W is not a possibility.

5. SE (Southeast): For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the fact that x is to the north of z. So, SE is not a possibility.

6. SW (Southwest): For x SW z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the fact that x is to the north of z. So, SW is not a possibility.

7. N (North): As I've already established, this is a possibility.

8. NE (Northeast): As I've already established, this is a possibility.

9. NW (Northwest): As I've already established, this is a possibility.

So, the only possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given the constraints, are:
- N
- NE
- NW

Let me double check my reasoning, especially for East (E) and West (W):

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of z is below or aligned with the bottom edge of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top edge of x is below or aligned with the top edge of z)

The first two conditions can be satisfied. The third condition, supy(x) <= supy(z), means the top edge of x is below or aligned with the top edge of z. But given that x is to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), it means the top edge of z is below or aligned with the bottom edge of x. Since the top edge of a region is always above or aligned with its bottom edge, we have: infy(x) <= supy(x). Combining this with supy(z) <= infy(x), we get supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z). So, E is not a possibility.

Similarly, for x W z, the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) is contradicted by the fact that x is to the north of z. So, W is not a possibility.

OK, so I think my reasoning was correct: the only possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given the constraints, are:
- N
- NE
- NW

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

By transitivity of the north-south relationship:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This means x is definitely to the north of z.

For the east-west relationship, there are three possibilities:
1. x is to the east of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) → x is NE of z
2. x is to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) → x is NW of z
3. x's east-west extent is contained within z's (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) → x is N of z

The answer is: N, NE, NW
