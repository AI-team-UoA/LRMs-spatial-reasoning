PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This is a problem about reasoning with cardinal direction relations.

Let's denote the relation "x is west of y" as x W y, and "y is northwest of z" as y NW z.

Now, we need to find the possible relations between x and z.

To solve this, I'll use the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

1. x W y means: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
2. y NW z means: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's try to determine what these constraints imply for the relationship between x and z.

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): the maximum x-coordinate of region x is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of region y.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): the minimum y-coordinate of region y is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of region x.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): the maximum y-coordinate of region x is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of region y.

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): the maximum x-coordinate of region y is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of region z.
- supy(z) <= infy(y): the maximum y-coordinate of region z is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of region y.

Now let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

1. For the x-coordinates:
   From x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
   From y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z)
   Combining: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
   So, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left (west) of z on the x-axis.

2. For the y-coordinates:
   From x W y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
   From y NW z: supy(z) <= infy(y)
   
   Combining: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
   So, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is above (north) of z on the y-axis.

So, from the constraints, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): x is to the left (west) of z on the x-axis.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): x is above (north) of z on the y-axis.

These two constraints together define the "Northwest" (NW) relation. So, the relation between x and z is NW, i.e., x is northwest of z.

Actually, let me double check this by drawing a diagram. We know that:

x is W of y:
- x's max x-coordinate <= y's min x-coordinate
- y's min y-coordinate <= x's min y-coordinate
- x's max y-coordinate <= y's max y-coordinate

So we have a region x that's somewhere to the left of y, not going higher than y and not going lower than y.

y is NW of z:
- y's max x-coordinate <= z's min x-coordinate
- z's max y-coordinate <= y's min y-coordinate

So we have a region y that's somewhere to the left and above z.

Let's draw this:

```
  y       
  |       
  |       
x |       
  |       
  +----- z
```

Here, x is to the left of y, and y is to the left and above z. From this diagram, x seems to be to the left and above z as well, which corresponds to the NW relation. But let's carefully work through all the constraints to make sure.

Actually, I'm realizing that's not the right diagram for "x W y". It doesn't capture that y's min y-coordinate <= x's min y-coordinate and x's max y-coordinate <= y's max y-coordinate, which means that x is vertically "inside" the y-range. Let me try again with a more accurate representation:

```
  +---y---+
  |       |
  |       |
+---x---+ |
  |     | |
  +-----+-+
```

This is a better representation of "x W y". Here, x is to the left of y, with x's vertical range contained within y's vertical range.

Now, let's add the constraint "y NW z" to this picture. We know that y's max x-coordinate <= z's min x-coordinate (y is to the left of z) and z's max y-coordinate <= y's min y-coordinate (y is above z). So:

```
  +---y---+
  |       |
  |       |
+---x---+ |
  |     | |
  +-----+-+
           
           
           
         +---z---+
         |       |
         +-------+
```

From this diagram, we can see that x is to the left of z. But it's not clear whether x is above, below, or at the same level as z. Let's reason through this more carefully.

From "x W y":
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y NW z":
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means that the top of z is below the bottom of y, which is below or at the same level as the bottom of x. So, z is definitely below x.

Now, let's summarize our findings:
- x is to the left of z.
- x is above z.

This corresponds to the "Northwest" (NW) relation. So, x is NW of z.

But actually, I realize there's a mistake in my reasoning. I need to be more careful about the y-coordinate constraints.

For x W y:
- infy(y) <= infy(x): The bottom of y is below or at the same level as the bottom of x.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): The top of x is below or at the same level as the top of y.

These two conditions mean that x's vertical range is contained within y's vertical range, which is what I depicted in the second diagram. However, there's a slight subtlety: infy(y) <= infy(x) means the bottom of y is at or below the bottom of x, which means x doesn't go as low as y. And supy(x) <= supy(y) means the top of x is at or below the top of y, which means x doesn't go as high as y.

For y NW z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y): The top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y.

Combining the y-coordinate constraints, we get:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): The top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y, which is below or at the same level as the bottom of x.

This confirms that z is below x.

Now, let's revisit the x-coordinate constraints:

For x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): The right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of y.

For y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): The right edge of y is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of z.

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z): The right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of y, which is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of y, which is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of z.

This means x is to the left of z, which is consistent with the previous conclusion.

So, x is to the left of z and above z, which corresponds to the "Northwest" (NW) relation. The possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

Wait, let me step back and think. I think I'm making it more complicated than I need to. Let me try again using the definitions:

x W y iff supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
y NW z iff supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's extract the constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

From the first two, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
- So, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

From the last three, we can deduce:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- So, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

Looking at the combination of these two (west and north), the possible relation between x and z is NW (x is northwest of z).

Actually, wait, I need to be more careful here. I've been implicitly assuming that the relation between x and z has to be one of the single-tile cardinal direction relations. But the problem is asking for the "possible relations", which may include multi-tile relations.

Let's think about this differently. We've established that:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This means x is to the west of z on the x-axis.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This means x is to the north of z on the y-axis.

Now, the question is, does the region x have to be entirely in the NW tile of z? Or can it span multiple tiles?

Let's look at the constraints again. I think my previous analysis actually already tells us that x must be entirely in the NW tile of z. I established that:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): This means x is entirely to the west of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This means x is entirely to the north of z.

These two constraints together define the NW relation. So, the relation between x and z is specifically NW, not any multi-tile relation.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let's go with the definition of the single-tile relations and see if x is exclusively NW of z, or if it can have other relations as well.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

I've established that both these conditions are met.

For x to be W of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The latter means that the top of z is below the bottom of x, so supy(x) <= supy(z) is not satisfied (it's actually the opposite). Also, the fact that the top of z is below the bottom of x means that z is completely below x, so infy(z) <= infy(x) is not necessarily true either (though it might be). So, x cannot be W of z.

For x to be N of z, we need:
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z). The latter means that the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z, so infx(z) <= infx(x) is not satisfied. Also, since x is completely to the left of z, supx(x) <= supx(z) will be true. However, because infx(z) <= infx(x) is not satisfied, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The latter means that the top of z is below the bottom of x, so supy(x) <= infy(z) is not satisfied (it's the opposite). So, x cannot be SW of z.

Similarly, we can check for other single-tile relations and conclude that none of them are satisfied except NW. So, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Scratch that. I think I need to be even more careful. The constraints we have are:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

From these, we can definitively deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): The right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z, which means x is completely to the left of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): The top of z is below the bottom of y, which is below the bottom of x, which means z is completely below x.

These two conditions are consistent with x being NW of z.

But I think I need to check if there are other possible configurations as well. Let me think...

Given x W y, we know that x is to the left of y and vertically within the bounds of y. Given y NW z, we know that y is to the left of z and above z.

Given that x is vertically within the bounds of y, and y is above z, it seems intuitive that x should be above z. And we've verified this.

Given that x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z, it's also intuitive that x should be to the left of z. And we've verified this as well.

So, I think the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, let me just double-check with a diagram. Given x W y and y NW z, let's visualize the minimal constraints on their positions:

```
  +---y---+
  |       |
  |       |
+-x+      |
|  |      |
+--+------+
           
           
           
         +---z---+
         |       |
         +-------+
```

From this diagram, I can see that:
- x is to the left of z.
- x is above z.

This corresponds to the "Northwest" (NW) relation. 

Actually, I'm wondering if there are any other possible configurations that would still satisfy our constraints. Let's see...

Let's see what happens if we allow the regions to be arbitrary shapes (as long as they satisfy the constraints of being homeomorphic to the closed unit disk). The constraints still force x to be to the left of z and above z, so the relation should still be NW.

One last thing to double-check: I've been assuming that the regions are "nice" and their projections onto the axes are intervals. If the regions can be more complex, like having "holes" or being disjoint, the analysis might change. But the problem states that we're considering regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, which means they're nice and don't have holes.

Given all these considerations, I believe the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Hmm, actually let me be even more careful, and try to consider specific cases. So I'm reasonably convinced by now that x NW z is a possible relation. Are there other possible relations?  I need to think more carefully.

We're given:
- x W y
- y NW z

Let's think about the possible ways x could relate to z:

1. x is B of z? No, because that would mean x is bounded by z's bounding box, which contradicts our findings that x is entirely to the left of and above z.

2. x is S of z? No, because we've established that z is below x.

3. x is SW of z? No, for the same reason.

4. x is W of z? 
   For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (already established)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This means the top of z is below the bottom of x, which contradicts both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

5. x is NW of z? 
   For x NW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (already established)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (already established)
   
   We've already verified that this is satisfied, so x can be NW of z.

6. x is N of z? 
   For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (already established)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

7. x is NE of z? 
   For x NE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (already established)
   
   From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

8. x is E of z? 
   For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

9. x is SE of z? 
   For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). Also, from our constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This means supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be SE of z.

So, after checking all the single-tile cardinal directions, it seems like the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

One last thing: could x have a multi-tile relation with z? Given the constraints, x must be entirely to the left of z and entirely above z, which means it can only occupy the NW tile in relation to z. So, a multi-tile relation is not possible.

In conclusion, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I realize I need to double-check the reasoning in a few cases.

1. x is W of z? 
   For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (already established)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From our constraints, we know:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
   
   Combining these, we get supy(z) <= infy(x). This means the top of z is below the bottom of x, which contradicts both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

This reasoning looks correct.

2. x is N of z? 
   For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (already established)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From our constraints, we know:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
   
   Combining these, we get supx(x) <= infx(z). This means the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of z, which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

This reasoning looks correct.

I think my analysis is consistent, and the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Let me step back one more time and think about the problem in terms of regions on the Cartesian plane. 

1. x W y means x is to the left of y, with x's vertical range contained within y's vertical range.
2. y NW z means y is to the left of and above z.

Given these, where can x be in relation to z? The fact that x is to the left of y and y is to the left of z means x is to the left of z. And the fact that x's vertical range is contained within y's vertical range, and y is above z, means x should also be above z. This would align with x being NW of z.

But let's verify this more rigorously using the constraints:

From x W y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): x's max x is <= y's min x.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): y's min y is <= x's min y.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): x's max y is <= y's max y.

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y's max x is <= z's min x.
- supy(z) <= infy(y): z's max y is <= y's min y.

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z): This means x's max x is <= z's min x, so x is completely to the left of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): This means z's max y is <= x's min y, so z is completely below x.

So, x is completely to the left of z and z is completely below x, which means x is NW of z. This is consistent with our earlier analysis.

Could x occupy multiple tiles in relation to z? Given that x is completely to the left of z and z is completely below x, x can only occupy the NW tile in relation to z. It cannot be in multiple tiles.

So, I believe the only possible relation between x and z is NW. That is, x is northwest of z.

Actually wait. I want to make sure I've handled all the cases correctly. Let's go through each possible relation again:

1. x is B of z? No, because x is completely to the left of and above z, which means it cannot be bounded by z's bounding box.

2. x is S of z? No, because we've established that z is below x, which contradicts the definition of "South."

3. x is SW of z? No, because z is below x.

4. x is W of z? No, because x is completely above z, which contradicts the definition of "West."

5. x is NW of z? Yes, because x is completely to the left of and above z.

6. x is N of z? No, because x is completely to the left of z, which contradicts the definition of "North."

7. x is NE of z? No, because x is completely to the left of z, which contradicts the definition of "North East."

8. x is E of z? No, because x is completely to the left of z, which contradicts the definition of "East."

9. x is SE of z? No, because x is completely to the left of and above z, which contradicts the definition of "South East."

Given the constraints, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Therefore, the answer is:
The possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

Hmm, I realize I could've made an error earlier. I said that x is completely to the left of z and z is completely below x. Let me verify this.

From x W y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): x's max x is <= y's min x.
- infy(y) <= infy(x): y's min y is <= x's min y.
- supy(x) <= supy(y): x's max y is <= y's max y.

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y's max x is <= z's min x.
- supy(z) <= infy(y): z's max y is <= y's min y.

Combining these:

For the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
- So, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is completely to the left of z.

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- So, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x.

Yes, these confirm that x is completely to the left of z and z is completely below x, which means the relation between x and z is NW.

I stand by my analysis and conclude that the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

ANSWER:

Based on the constraints given:

- x W y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let me determine what these constraints imply about the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
- From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Combining these: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely to the west of z.

For the y-coordinates:
- From x W y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- Combining these: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Therefore: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is completely south of x.

Since x is completely west of z and z is completely south of x, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

NW
