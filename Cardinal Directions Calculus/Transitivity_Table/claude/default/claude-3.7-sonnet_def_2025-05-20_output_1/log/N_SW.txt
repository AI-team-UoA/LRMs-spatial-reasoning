PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step using the definitions of cardinal direction relations.

We are given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions:

1. x N y means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. y SW z means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z using the transitive properties.

From x N y, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally contained within the projection of y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Let's combine these constraints to see what we can determine about the relationship between x and z:

From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we know that both x and z are above y, but we don't directly know how x and z relate vertically.

From infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), we know x is horizontally contained within y's projection.

From supx(y) <= infx(z), we know z is to the right of y.

So, x is above y, and z is to the right of y. But this still leaves several possibilities for how x and z relate.

Let me draw a diagram to visualize this:

```
    x (somewhere in this region)
    ↑
    |
y ---+--- z
    |
```

Based on this diagram and the constraints, x could be:
- NW of z (if x is completely to the left of z)
- N of z (if x overlaps horizontally with z)
- NE of z (if x is completely to the right of z)
- W of z (if x extends down to the level of z but is still to the left)
- B of z (if x overlaps with z's bounding box)
- E of z (if x extends down to the level of z and is to the right)

Let me check if any of these are actually impossible due to the constraints.

Given that y is SW of z, we know that y is to the left of and below z. Given that x is N of y, we know that x is above y and horizontally contained within y's projection.

Since y is to the left of z (supx(y) <= infx(z)), and x is horizontally contained within y's projection (infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)), we can deduce that x is also to the left of z (supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)).

This eliminates the possibilities where x is to the right of or overlapping with z horizontally. So, x cannot be NE, E, or B of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (if x is above z)
- W (if x is at the same level as z)

Wait, I need to reconsider this. Let me be more careful about the constraints.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so x is to the left of z
- supy(y) <= infy(x), so x is above y
- supy(y) <= infy(z), so z is above y

But we don't have a direct constraint on how x and z relate vertically. x could be above, below, or at the same level as z.

If x is above z, then x is NW of z.
If x is at the same level as z, then x is W of z.
If x is below z, then x is SW of z.

Actually, I need to reconsider the vertical relationship more carefully. 

From y SW z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z), meaning z is above y.
From x N y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x), meaning x is above y.

So both x and z are above y, but we don't know which one is higher.

If infy(x) >= supy(z), then x is completely above z, so x is N of z.
If infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(x) >= supy(z), then x overlaps vertically with z, so x is W of z.
If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is completely below z, so x is S of z.

But wait, that contradicts the earlier constraints. Let me rethink this.

From x N y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x), meaning x is above y.
From y SW z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z), meaning z is above y.

So both x and z are above y, but we don't know their relative vertical positions.

From x N y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), meaning x is horizontally contained within y's projection.
From y SW z, we have supx(y) <= infx(z), meaning z is to the right of y.

Combining these, we get supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z.

Ok, let's think about the original problem statement again. We'd like to know about the possible cardinal directions from x to z.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is SW of z

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally within y's projection)

From y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can deduce that x is to the left of z because:
supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

But for the vertical relationship, we know both x and z are above y, but we don't have enough information to determine which one is higher.

Let's consider all possible vertical relationships:

1. infy(z) > supy(x): In this case, z is completely above x, which means x is to the left of and below z, so x SW z.
2. infy(x) > supy(z): In this case, x is completely above z, which means x is to the left of and above z, so x NW z.
3. infy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(x): In this case, x and z overlap vertically, which means x is to the left of z, so x W z.

In cases 1, 2, and 3, x is always to the left of z because supx(x) <= infx(z). So the possible relations are NW, W, and SW.

Let me double-check this reasoning.

From the constraints we've established:
- x is above y
- z is above y
- x is to the left of z

Given these, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (if x is above z)
- W (if x is at the same vertical level as z)
- SW (if x is below z)

But wait, I'm not sure if the "SouthWest" relation means "x is to the left of and below z" or "x is to the southwest of z's bounding box." Let me revisit the definitions to be sure.

A single-tile cardinal direction relation SW (South West) is defined as:
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

So, x SW z means:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

Similarly, x NW z means:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

And x W z means:
supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x overlaps vertically with z)

So my reasoning was basically correct.

Given that x is N of y and y is SW of z, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW (depending on their relative vertical positions).

Actually, let me carefully analyze it once more to make sure I got the correct answer. Let me reconsider the constraints once again.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (1)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (2)

From y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (3)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (4)

From (2) and (3), we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (5)

This means x is to the left of z.

Now, considering the vertical relationship:
- From (1), we know x is above y.
- From (4), we know z is above y.

But we can't directly compare the vertical positions of x and z.

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then z is below x, so x is NW of z.
If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is below z, so x is SW of z.
If they overlap vertically (infy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(x) or infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z)), then x is W of z.

Actually, I'm second-guessing myself on the third case. Let's revisit the definition of the W relation:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

So, for x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've established from (5))
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (z starts at or below where x starts)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x ends at or below where z ends)

I've been careful and I have considered the exact definition, so I think the correct answer is that the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Let me just do one more sanity check. Let's imagine some concrete regions that satisfy the given conditions to see if they match our analysis.

Imagine:
y = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2).
z = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4).

For y SW z to be true, we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): 1 <= 3 ✓
- supy(y) <= infy(z): 2 <= 3 ✓

Great, y is SW of z.

Now, for x N y, we need:
- supy(y) <= infy(x): 2 <= the lower y-bound of x, so let's say x starts at y=2.5.
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y): 0 <= the left x-bound of x and the right x-bound of x <= 1.

So let's say x = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 2.5), (1, 2.5), (1, 3.5), (0, 3.5).

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
- supx(x) = 1, infx(z) = 3, so x is to the left of z.
- supy(x) = 3.5, infy(z) = 3.
Since infy(z) <= supy(x), they overlap vertically. But we also need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) for the W relation.
- infy(z) = 3, infy(x) = 2.5. So infy(z) > infy(x), which means the W relation doesn't hold.

In this particular example, x is NW of z.

If I change the example, I can establish other relations. For instance, if x = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 3.5), (1, 3.5), (1, 4.5), (0, 4.5), then x is NW of z.

But if x = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 1.5), (1, 1.5), (1, 2.5), (0, 2.5), then supx(x) = 1, infx(z) = 3, supy(x) = 2.5, infy(z) = 3. Since supy(x) < infy(z), x is SW of z.

It seems that the W relation is a bit tricky with the examples I've chosen. Let me try another example.

Imagine:
y = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (0, 1).
z = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 5), (5, 5).

For y SW z to be true, we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): 2 <= 5 ✓
- supy(y) <= infy(z): 1 <= 3 ✓

Now, for x, let's say it's a region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 2), (2, 2), (2, 4), (0, 4).

For x N y to be true, we need:
- supy(y) <= infy(x): 1 <= 2 ✓
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y): 0 <= 0 and 2 <= 2 ✓

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
- supx(x) = 2, infx(z) = 5, so x is to the left of z.
- infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 5.

Since infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) < supy(z), they overlap vertically in a specific way. 

Let's check the W relation again:
For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): 2 <= 5 ✓
- infy(z) <= infy(x): 3 <= 2 ❌
- supy(x) <= supy(z): 4 <= 5 ✓

So, in this example, x is not W of z.

It seems like the W relation might be hard to achieve given the constraints. Let me analyze if it's actually possible.

Given:
- x is N of y (so x is above y and horizontally contained within y's projection)
- y is SW of z (so y is to the left of and below z)

For x W z to be true, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z, which holds from our deductions)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (z starts at or below where x starts)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x ends at or below where z ends)

The third condition is not restrictive, as we haven't established any upper bound on supy(z). But the second condition is where things get interesting.

From x N y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y SW z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z).

These two conditions alone don't tell us anything about the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). If infy(x) <= infy(z), then x potentially starts below or at the same level as z, which seems plausible.

But let's also consider an example again:

Imagine:
y = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (0, 1).
z = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 5), (5, 5).

For y SW z to be true, we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): 2 <= 5 ✓
- supy(y) <= infy(z): 1 <= 2 ✓

Now, for x, let's say it's a region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 2), (2, 2), (2, 6), (0, 6).

For x N y to be true, we need:
- supy(y) <= infy(x): 1 <= 2 ✓
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y): 0 <= 0 and 2 <= 2 ✓

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
- supx(x) = 2, infx(z) = 5, so x is to the left of z.
- infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 6, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 5.

Let's check the W relation:
For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): 2 <= 5 ✓
- infy(z) <= infy(x): 2 <= 2 ✓
- supy(x) <= supy(z): 6 <= 5 ❌

Oops, the third condition fails. Let me adjust my example.

Imagine:
y = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (0, 1).
z = Region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 5), (5, 5).

For y SW z to be true, we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): 2 <= 5 ✓
- supy(y) <= infy(z): 1 <= 2 ✓

Now, for x, let's say it's a region bounded by the rectangle with coordinates (0, 2), (2, 2), (2, 4), (0, 4).

For x N y to be true, we need:
- supy(y) <= infy(x): 1 <= 2 ✓
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y): 0 <= 0 and 2 <= 2 ✓

Now, what's the relation between x and z?
- supx(x) = 2, infx(z) = 5, so x is to the left of z.
- infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 5.

Let's check the W relation:
For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): 2 <= 5 ✓
- infy(z) <= infy(x): 2 <= 2 ✓
- supy(x) <= supy(z): 4 <= 5 ✓

Great! In this example, x is W of z. So, x W z is a possible relation.

To get x NW z, we could push x slightly upwards, making it: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 6), (0, 6). Then supy(z) <= infy(x) would be satisfied, and x would be NW of z.

And to get x SW z, we could push z slightly upwards, making it: (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 6), (5, 6). Then supy(x) <= infy(z) would be satisfied, and x would be SW of z.

I'm more confortable now with my conclusion that the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Actually, let's be very careful here with regards to the N relation:

For x N z to be true, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally contained within z's projection)

But from our analysis, we've determined that x is to the left of z, i.e., supx(x) <= infx(z). This directly contradicts the second condition for x N z. Hence, x N z is not possible.

Hmm, but let me think about the NW relation again. 

For x NW z to be true, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), so the first condition is met. For the second condition, we haven't directly determined the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). But I've already proven through an examples that x NW z is possible.

In the previous example, even is supy(z) <= infy(x) isn't true, we could adjust the regions to make it true.

My conclusion is still the same: the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Just to summarize:
NW: x is to the left of and above z.
W: x is to the left of and overlaps vertically with z.
SW: x is to the left of and below z.

Let me double check that the NE, E, SE, N, B, and S relations are impossible.

For x NE z to be true, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

But we've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z, contradicting supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

Similarly, E and SE are also ruled out because they both require x to be to the right of z.

For x N z to be true, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally contained within z's projection)

The second condition contradicts what we've established, so x N z is not possible.

For x B z to be true, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is contained within z's bounding box)

Again, our established constraint that x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)) contradicts the first two conditions. So, x B z is not possible.

For x S z to be true, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally contained within z's projection)

The second condition contradicts what we've established, so x S z is not possible.

I've confirmed that x can only have the relations NW, W, or SW with z, given the original constraints that x is N of y and y is SW of z.

Actually, I'm realizing I've been making an error concerning vertical projections. When I say that x is horizontally contained within y's projection, I mean:

infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

is true. This means x fits entirely within the horizontal projection of y. Let me double check that I haven't made an error with my visualizations.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally within y's projection)

This can be visualized as:
```
   x
   |
---y---
```

From y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

This can be visualized as:
```
      z
      |
y-----+
```

Combining them, we get:
```
   x
   |
---y-----z
```

As we can see, x is above y, y is to the left of and below z, and x is horizontally contained within y's projection.

Given that x is horizontally contained within y's projection (infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)), and y is to the left of z (supx(y) <= infx(z)), we can deduce that x is also to the left of z (supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)).

But for the vertical relationship, we know both x and z are above y, but their relative vertical positions remain undetermined.

If x is above z, then x is NW of z.
If x and z overlap vertically in a specific way, then x is W of z.
If x is below z, then x is SW of z.

Based on all this analysis, I'm confident in my answer: the possible relations between x and z given the constraints are NW, W, and SW.

Hmm, but I'm slightly unsatisfied with my earlier approach: I should carefully check all the conditions for the W relation. For the W relation (x W z):

- supx(x) <= infx(z): From our analysis, we've established this.
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z): This means z starts at or below where x starts, and x ends at or below where z ends.

Let me check if this is possible given our constraints:

From x N y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) (1)
From y SW z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z) (2)

(1) and (2) don't directly relate infy(x) and infy(z). Both infy(x) > infy(z) and infy(x) < infy(z) are possible, as long as both are greater than supy(y).

If infy(z) <= infy(x), then the first part of the condition for W is satisfied. If not, it leans towards NW.

For the second part of the condition, supy(x) <= supy(z), we don't have direct constraints from the given relations. It depends on the specific regions.

For SW, the condition is supy(x) <= infy(z). Again, I've shown through examples that all three relations (NW, W, SW) are possible.

It's worth noting that the W relation is sort of "in between" NW and SW. As x shifts upwards relative to z, it transitions from SW to W to NW.

So, my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

Let's now summarize all of what we've worked out from the constraints to be sure of our answer:

1. First, the regions are constrained with:
   - x is N of y
   - y is SW of z

2. From these constraints, we can deduce:
   - x is to the left of z
   - Both x and z are above y

3. The cardinal direction from x to z depends on their relative vertical positions:
   - If x is above z, then x is NW of z.
   - If x and z vertically overlap in a specific way, then x is W of z.
   - If x is below z, then x is SW of z.

4. I've shown through examples that all three relations (NW, W, SW) are possible within the constraints.

5. Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are ruled out because they contradict the established constraint that x is to the left of z.

The possible relations from x to z, given x is N of y and y is SW of z, are NW, W, and SW. I'm now very confident that this is the correct answer.

Let me go over our approach one more time to check we've been rigorous. 

First, I established the relations in a coordinate system. We were looking for the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y: This means x is above y and horizontally contained within y's projection. Specifically, supy(y) <= infy(x) and infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- y is SW of z: This means y is to the left of and below z. Specifically, supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

The key deductions from these constraints were:
- From the second constraint, we have supx(y) <= infx(z).
- From the first constraint, we have supx(x) <= supx(y).
- Combining these, we get supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Since x is to the left of z, all other cardinal direction relations that require x to be to the right of or overlapping horizontally with z are ruled out. This includes NE, E, SE, N, S, and B.

The only possibilities for the relation between x and z are NW, W, and SW.
- NW: x is to the left of and above z, so supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- W: x is to the left of and overlaps vertically with z, so supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- SW: x is to the left of and below z, so supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

I've verified through examples that all three of these relations are possible within the given constraints. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, and SW.

My final answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are NW, W, and SW.

To summarize:
- NW: x is to the left of and above z.
- W: x is to the left of and overlaps vertically with z in a specific way.
- SW: x is to the left of and below z.

I've verified that all three of these relations are possible given the constraints, and all other cardinal direction relations are ruled out.

Given that we have that x is N of y, and y is SW of z.

Possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, let's analyze what we know:

1) x N y means:
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y's projection)

2) y SW z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
- x is to the left of z because: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Both x and z are above y

The vertical relationship between x and z is not fixed by the constraints, so we have three possibilities:
- NW: if x is above z
- W: if x overlaps vertically with z (according to the definition)
- SW: if x is below z

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, SW.
