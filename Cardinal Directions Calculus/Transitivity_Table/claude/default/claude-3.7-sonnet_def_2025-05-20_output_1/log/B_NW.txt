PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what are the constraints given:
1. Region x is B of region y 
2. Region y is NW of region z

Let's recall what these mean:
- x B y means x is inside the bounding box of y. Mathematically:
  infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)

- y NW z means y is in the northwest direction of z. Mathematically:
  supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now I want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let me think about the constraints that we know:

From x B y:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's try to derive constraints between x and z:

From x B y, we know supx(x) <= supx(y).
From y NW z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z).
Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x could be to the west of z (W, NW, SW).

Also, from x B y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x).
From y NW z, we know supy(z) <= infy(y).
Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x could be to the north of z (N, NW, NE).

So, the combination suggests that x could be NW of z.

However, let's think more carefully. We need to check if other relations are possible as well.

Let's see if x could be N of z:
For x N z, we need:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've already established)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We don't know the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x), or between supx(x) and supx(z) from the given constraints. So, x N z is a possibility.

Let's see if x could be NE of z:
For x NE z, we need:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've already established)
2. supx(z) <= infx(x)

We don't have information about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) from the given constraints. So, x NE z is a possibility.

Let's see if x could be W of z:
For x W z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've already established)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We don't know the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), or between supy(x) and supy(z) from the given constraints. So, x W z is a possibility.

Let's see if x could be SW of z:
For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we've already established)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

We don't have information about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from the given constraints. So, x SW z is a possibility.

Let's see if x could be B of z:
For x B z, we need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know from the combined constraints that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z) for x B z. So, x B z is not a possibility.

Let's see if x could be S of z:
For x S z, we need:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know from the combined constraints that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z) for x S z. So, x S z is not a possibility.

Let's see if x could be SE of z:
For x SE z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know from the combined constraints that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x SE z (because it would imply supx(z) <= infx(z), which is impossible). So, x SE z is not a possibility.

Let's see if x could be E of z:
For x E z, we need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Similar to the SE case, we know from the combined constraints that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x E z. So, x E z is not a possibility.

So, from the above analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, W, SW, and NW.

Hm, actually, I think I need to reconsider whether N and NE are possible. Let's think again:

For x B y, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

For y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

For x N z, we need:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

From x B y and y NW z, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
  So, supy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies condition 1 for x N z.
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
  So, infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z)

For condition 2 of x N z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). This contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x), because it would imply infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z), which means infx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = infx(z).

So, upon further reflection, x N z is not a possibility.

Similarly, for x NE z, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) would be in contradiction with supx(x) <= infx(z) (derived from the given constraints), because it would imply supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). This means supx(z) <= infx(z), which is impossible.

So, x NE z is also not a possibility.

Let's redo the analysis, being more rigorous in our reasoning. 

First, from "x B y" and "y NW z", we want to derive possible cardinal relations between x and z. Let's go through each of the nine cardinal relations and see if they are possible for x and z.

From "x B y", we have:
infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y NW z", we have:
supx(y) <= infx(z)
supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's check each of the possible cardinal relations between x and z:

1. x B z:
   For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we know:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y)
   
   supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) for x B z.
   supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x B z.
   
   So, x B z is not possible.

2. x S z:
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) for x S z.
   
   So, x S z is not possible.

3. x SW z:
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   This satisfies the first condition for x SW z.
   
   For the second condition, we need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   We know: supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
   But we don't have a direct constraint between supy(y) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and infy(z).
   So, based on the given constraints, it's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), which makes x SW z a possibility.

4. x W z:
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y)
   
   The first constraint satisfies the first condition for x W z.
   The second constraint contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for x W z.
   
   So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z:
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y)
   
   These constraints satisfy both conditions for x NW z.
   
   So, x NW z is possible.

6. x N z:
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   The first constraint satisfies the first condition for x N z.
   The second constraint contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) for x N z.
   
   So, x N z is not possible.

7. x NE z:
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   The first constraint satisfies the second condition for x NE z.
   But, the constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) is contradictory to the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x NE z, as it implies supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z), which would mean supx(z) <= infx(z), which is impossible.
   
   So, x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z:
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y)
   
   The constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x E z.
   The constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x E z.
   
   So, x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z:
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   The constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x SE z.
   
   So, x SE z is not possible.

Let's double check my analysis for x SW z:
For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) - We established that this is true from the given conditions.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the given conditions, we know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

But we don't have a clear constraint between supy(x) and infy(z). We know that infy(y) is greater than or equal to supy(z) and supy(x) is less than or equal to supy(y). But this doesn't tell us about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Let's visualize this: We have regions x, y, and z with the cardinal relations "x B y" and "y NW z". 

From "x B y", region x is inside the bounding box of region y. 
From "y NW z", region y is northwest of region z.

Let's think about this differently: the bounding box of y is to the northwest of z. Since x is inside the bounding box of y, x is at least to the west of z (since the entire bounding box of y is west of z). But the N-S (north-south) relationship between x and z depends on how far north x is within the bounding box of y.

If x is in the northern part of y's bounding box, then x could be northwest of z (because the northern part of y's bounding box is north of z). If x is in the southern part of y's bounding box, it could be southwest of z.

So, both "x NW z" and "x SW z" seem possible.

Let me try to be more precise about x SW z:

For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) - We established that this is true.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)

Now, could supy(x) <= infy(z) be true? We don't have a direct constraint, but let's see if there's a way to place x such that supy(x) <= infy(z) while still satisfying all the given conditions.

From "y NW z", we know supy(z) <= infy(y), but this doesn't tell us anything about infy(z).

So, it doesn't seem like we can determine whether supy(x) <= infy(z) from the given conditions. It's possible for supy(x) to be either less than or greater than infy(z), which means x SW z is a possibility (but not a certainty).

Actually, let me think again. 

Let's visualize the regions. The bounding box of y is to the northwest of z, and x is inside y's bounding box.

Wait, I think I've been making a mistake. The condition "x B y" means x is inside the bounding box of y, but that doesn't necessarily mean x is strictly inside y. It just means the bounding box of x is inside the bounding box of y.

Given that, if the entire region y is to the northwest of z, and the bounding box of x is inside the bounding box of y, then x could potentially touch any part of y's bounding box, including parts that are adjacent to z.

Let's try to be more systematic:

From "x B y", we have:
infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y NW z", we have:
supx(y) <= infx(z)
supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, for x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

For the first condition, we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so it's satisfied.

For the second condition, we need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible. 

From the given conditions, we know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)

Now, can we infer anything about the relationship between supy(y) and infy(z)? Not directly from the given conditions. The condition "y NW z" tells us about the relationship between supy(z) and infy(y), but not about supy(y) and infy(z).

So, it's possible for supy(x) to be either less than or greater than infy(z), which means x SW z is a possibility.

But now, let's consider a specific case: imagine x is a region that's exactly the same as y (i.e., x and y are equivalent regions). In this case, "x B y" still holds (because x's bounding box coincides with y's bounding box), and we also know that y is NW of z. So, x would also be NW of z.

Wait, I think we can deduce more from the conditions.

If supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y), then supy(z) <= infy(x). This is one of the conditions for x NW z, alongside the condition supx(x) <= infx(z), which we already established.

So, "x NW z" is a definite possibility.

For x SW z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). But from the given conditions, we can't infer a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

If we imagine a specific scenario: Let's say x is a region at the southern end of y's bounding box. In this case, it's possible for supy(x) to be less than infy(z), which makes "x SW z" a possibility. 

So, "x SW z" and "x NW z" seem to be the possible relations between x and z given the conditions.

Actually, I don't think this is complete. From "x B y", we know:
infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means the bounding box of x is contained inside the bounding box of y. But the extent of this containment can vary. For instance, x's bounding box can touch the western edge of y's bounding box, or it can be fully inside y's bounding box without touching any edge.

Now, if x's bounding box touches the western edge of y's bounding box, and y's bounding box is west of z (as implied by "y NW z"), then the western edge of x's bounding box is also west of z. This makes "x W z" a possibility.

Let me reconsider this:

For x W z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) - We've already established that this is satisfied.
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the given conditions, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

From supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), we have supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x W z.

So, "x W z" is not a possibility.

This seems to confirm that "x NW z" and "x SW z" are the only possible relations between x and z given the conditions.

Let me double check one more time to make sure I didn't miss anything:

For each of the nine cardinal relations between x and z, let's verify if they are possible given the conditions "x B y" and "y NW z".

From "x B y", we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y NW z", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

1. x B z:
   For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z) => supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) for x B z.
   
   So, x B z is not possible.

2. x S z:
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z) => supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) for x S z.
   
   So, x S z is not possible.

3. x SW z:
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z) => supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   This satisfies the first condition for x SW z.
   
   For the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). From the given conditions, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). But it's possible to position x within y's bounding box in such a way that supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   So, x SW z is a possibility.

4. x W z:
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z) => supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y) => supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   This contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x W z.
   
   So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z:
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z) => supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y) => supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   These constraints satisfy both conditions for x NW z.
   
   So, x NW z is a possibility.

6. x N z:
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y) => supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z) => supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) for x N z.
   
   So, x N z is not possible.

7. x NE z:
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y) => supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z) => infx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x NE z.
   
   So, x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z:
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z) => infx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y) => supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   This contradicts both the requirements supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x E z.
   
   So, x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z:
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the given conditions, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z) => infx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x SE z.
   
   So, x SE z is not possible.

Based on the analysis above, the possible cardinal relations between x and z given the conditions "x B y" and "y NW z" are: NW and SW.

Let me think if there's any other potential relation between x and z.

Actually, let's see if x can also have a composite relation with z. For instance, can x be both northwest and west of z?

For x to be both NW and W of z, its bounding box would need to span both the northwestern and western regions of z. But this contradicts the single-tile nature of the cardinal directions we're considering.

So, the answer should be restricted to single-tile cardinal directions, and based on the analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: "x NW z" and "x SW z".

Actually, I think I still need to consider if x can be W of z. Let me analyze this more carefully:

For x W z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've already established that supx(x) <= infx(z) from the given conditions.

From the given conditions, we also have:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

The second and third conditions imply supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), but they don't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

However, the first and third conditions together give us infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y), which implies supy(z) <= infy(x). 

This contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x W z, as it would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which is only possible if infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z). BUT this doesn't work because the "infy" of a region can't be equal to the "supy" of the same region, since regions have a non-zero area.

So, x W z is not possible.

Actually, I think I should verify my inference from the conditions:

1. "x B y" means the bounding box of x is inside the bounding box of y.
2. "y NW z" means region y is in the northwest direction of region z.

When I say "region y is in the northwest direction of region z," it means that the entirety of y is to the northwest of z. 

Let's revisit the cardinal direction relation "NW" to make sure I'm getting this right.

For a NW b:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is entirely to the west of b)
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is entirely to the north of b)

For y NW z, this means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is entirely to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is entirely to the north of z)

Now, let's take a step back and reconsider all of the constraints:

From "x B y":
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y NW z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's now check each of the nine cardinal relations for regions:

1. x B z:
   For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) for x B z.
   
   So, x B z is not a possibility.

2. x S z:
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) for x S z.
   
   So, x S z is not a possibility.

3. x SW z:
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   This satisfies the first condition for x SW z.
   
   For the second condition, we know:
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x B y)
   
   But we don't have a direct constraint between supy(y) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and infy(z). So, it's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), which makes x SW z a possibility.

4. x W z:
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   
   Combining the second and third constraints gives us supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x W z.
   
   So, x W z is not a possibility.

5. x NW z:
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   
   These constraints satisfy both conditions for x NW z.
   
   So, x NW z is a possibility.

6. x N z:
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   Combining the first and second constraints gives us supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies the first condition for x N z.
   
   But the third constraint contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) for x N z.
   
   So, x N z is not a possibility.

7. x NE z:
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   Combining the first and second constraints gives us supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies the second condition for x NE z.
   
   But the third constraint implies infx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x NE z (since it's impossible for supx(z) <= infx(x) <= infx(z)).
   
   So, x NE z is not a possibility.

8. x E z:
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   
   Combining the second and third constraints gives us supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x E z.
   
   So, x E z is not a possibility.

9. x SE z:
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   This implies infx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x SE z (since it's impossible for supx(z) <= infx(x) <= infx(z)).
   
   So, x SE z is not a possibility.

Based on the analysis above, the possible cardinal relations between x and z are: NW and SW. The other seven cardinal relations are not possible given the constraints.

OK, I think my final answer now is solid: the possible cardinal directions between x and z given the constraints "x B y" and "y NW z" are NW and SW.

Actually, let's check what happens if region x is B of region y and region y is NW of region z.

For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's define region y as having the coordinates: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 6, supy(y) = 8. And let's define region z as having the coordinates: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3.

I'm defining these regions to satisfy the condition "y NW z" because supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 and supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 6.

Now, for "x B y", region x's coordinates should be: infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y).

So, 2 <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= 4 and 6 <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= 8.

Let's define region x with the coordinates: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infy(x) = 6, supy(x) = 7. This satisfies "x B y".

For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) => 3 <= 5, which is true.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) => 7 <= 1, which is false.

So, x SW z is not a consistent relation given the chosen coordinates. In fact, for this particular setup, supy(x) > infy(z) implies x cannot be to the south of z. So, the only possible relation is x NW z.

Let's try another set of coordinates to see if we can have x SW z.

Region y: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 7.
Region z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3.

This satisfies "y NW z" because supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 and supy(z) = 3 <= infy(y) = 5.

Now, for "x B y", let's define region x with the coordinates: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6. This is inside the bounding box of y.

For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) => 4 <= 5, which is true.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) => 6 <= 1, which is false.

Even in this case, the chosen regions do not support "x SW z". And the reason is the constraint from "y NW z": supy(z) <= infy(y) which means z is south of y. If x is inside the bounding box of y, then x's south extreme (supy(x)) can't be below z's north extreme (infy(z)).

I'm starting to doubt if x SW z is a possibility under the given constraints. Let's try to see if we can construct a case.

Actually. Drawing this out explicitly, I realized that "y NW z" means the entirety of y is to the northwest of z. Given that x is inside the bounding box of y, and the entirety of y is to the northwest of z, the relation "x SW z" is inconsistent. This is because if x is inside the bounding box of y, and y is entirely to the north of z, then x is also entirely to the north of z, which contradicts the "S" in "SW".

So, the only correct answer is: x NW z.

Actually, wait. Let me think again. The constraints are:

From "x B y":
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y NW z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

For "x SW z", we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know that supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), so the first condition for "x SW z" is satisfied.

But for the second condition, we know that supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). However, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Let's approach this differently. Is it possible to construct regions x, y, and z such that "x B y", "y NW z", and "x SW z" are all satisfied?

Let's try to come up with actual coordinates:

Region y: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 7.
Region z: infx(z) = 6, supx(z) = 8, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 4.

This satisfies "y NW z" because supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 6 and supy(z) = 4 <= infy(y) = 5.

Now, for "x B y", let's define region x with coordinates: infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 5.1. This satisfies "x B y" because infx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4 <= supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 5 <= infy(x) = 5, and supy(x) = 5.1 <= supy(y) = 7.

For "x SW z", we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) => 4 <= 6, which is true.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) => 5.1 <= 2, which is false.

Again, it's impossible to satisfy "x SW z" under the given constraints, because "y NW z" ensures that z is south of y, and "x B y" ensures that x is within (or touching) the bounding box of y, so x can't be south of z. The only possible relation is "x NW z".

Wait, I may be making an error. Let's think about the definition of "y NW z" again:

For y NW z, we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is entirely to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is entirely to the north of z)

OK, the second condition actually means y is north of z, not z is south of y. I was incorrectly interpreting the condition as saying z is south of y, which is the same thing. 

The condition "supy(z) <= infy(y)" means the maximum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of y. This means y is strictly to the north of z.

So, if y is entirely to the north of z, and x is inside the bounding box of y, can x be to the south of z?

No, it can't. If y's bounding box is entirely to the north of z (i.e., supy(z) <= infy(y)), and x's bounding box is inside y's bounding box (i.e., infy(y) <= infy(x)), then we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is also entirely to the north of z.

This contradicts the "S" in "SW" for "x SW z". So, "x SW z" is not a possible relation under the given constraints.

Alright, it seems like the only possible relation under the given constraints "x B y" and "y NW z" is "x NW z".

Actually, I still want to double check the case for x SW z:
For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's set up a concrete example:
- Region y: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 5, supy(y) = 7.
- Region z: infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 4.

This satisfies "y NW z" because supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5 and supy(z) = 4 <= infy(y) = 5.

Now, for "x B y", region x should satisfy: infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y).

So, 2 <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= 4 and 5 <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= 7.

Let's define region x with the coordinates: infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 6.

For x SW z, we need:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) => 4 <= 5, which is true.
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) => 6 <= 2, which is false.

So, "x SW z" is not satisfied by these chosen coordinates.

Now, is there any way to choose the bounding boxes of y and z to satisfy "y NW z" and then choose the bounding box of x to satisfy both "x B y" and "x SW z"?

For "y NW z", we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

For "x B y", we need:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)

For "x SW z", we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the first and third constraints, we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z).

From the second and fourth constraints, we have infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y).

The challenge is to ensure supy(x) <= infy(z) while also ensuring supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x).

These two conditions together imply supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This is the opposite of supy(x) <= infy(z) that we need for "x SW z". So, if "y NW z" and "x B y" are satisfied, it's impossible to have "x SW z" unless supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) both hold simultaneously. But that would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z), which gives supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x) = infy(z) = supy(z), which isn't meaningful for non-point regions.

So, "x SW z" is not a possible relation given the constraints "x B y" and "y NW z".

I now believe the only possible relation under the given constraints is "x NW z".

OK, actually I think my mistake was thinking that we can have composite regions, but the question seems to be restricted to single-tile cardinal direction relations. Given that, and based on the constraints "x B y" and "y NW z", the only possible relation between x and z is "x NW z". This is because the constraints ensure that x is to the northwest of z.

Let me triple check by going through all 9 cardinal relations again:

From "x B y":
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)

From "y NW z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

1. x B z:
   For x B z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) for x B z. So, x B z is not a possibility.

2. x S z:
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) for x S z. So, x S z is not a possibility.

3. x SW z:
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   
   Combining the second and third constraints gives us supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for x SW z (because it would imply supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which is only possible for point regions).
   
   So, x SW z is not a possibility.

4. x W z:
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   
   Combining the second and third constraints gives us supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x W z.
   
   So, x W z is not a possibility.

5. x NW z:
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   
   These constraints satisfy both conditions for x NW z.
   
   So, x NW z is a possibility.

6. x N z:
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   Combining the first and second constraints gives us supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies the first condition for x N z.
   
   But the third constraint contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) for x N z.
   
   So, x N z is not a possibility.

7. x NE z:
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   Combining the first and second constraints gives us supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which satisfies the second condition for x NE z.
   
   But the third constraint implies infx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x NE z (since it's impossible for supx(z) <= infx(x) <= infx(z)).
   
   So, x NE z is not a possibility.

8. x E z:
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x B y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
   
   The first constraint contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x E z (because it implies infx(x) <= infx(z), which is incompatible with supx(z) <= infx(x)).
   
   Combining the second and third constraints gives us supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) for x E z.
   
   So, x E z is not a possibility.

9. x SE z:
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   From the given constraints, we have:
   - infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z)
   
   This implies infx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for x SE z (since it's impossible for supx(z) <= infx(x) <= infx(z)).
   
   So, x SE z is not a possibility.

Based on the analysis above, the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints "x B y" and "y NW z" is "x NW z".

Let me one final time make sure I didn't miss anything, since this doesn't match my earlier analysis, in which I had both NW and SW. I see that I made a conceptual error when thinking about SW. Let me try to think clearly:

For "x SW z", regions x and z should satisfy:
1. supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the west of z)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely to the south of z)

Now, from the constraints "x B y" and "y NW z", we can derive:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (from x B y and y NW z), which means x is entirely to the west of z. This satisfies the first condition for "x SW z".
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y NW z and x B y), which means x is entirely to the north of z. This contradicts the second condition for "x SW z".

So, "x SW z" is not a possibility given the constraints.

Looking at it more carefully, the key insight is that the constraints "y NW z" and "x B y" together ensure that:
- x is entirely to the west of z (because y is entirely to the west of z and x is inside the bounding box of y).
- x is entirely to the north of z (because y is entirely to the north of z and x is inside the bounding box of y).

Based on the cardinal directions, this means "x NW z" is the only possible relation.

In conclusion, the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints "x B y" and "y NW z" is "x NW z".

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

Let's analyze the constraints:

From "x B y":
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From "y NW z":
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely west of z
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is completely north of z

Therefore, x is completely northwest of z, satisfying the definition of the NW relation:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The answer is NW.
