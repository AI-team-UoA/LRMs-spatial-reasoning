PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break this down step by step using our cardinal direction relation definitions.

We are told:
1. Region x is B of region y
2. Region y is SE of region z

And we need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions:

x B y if and only if infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
This means x is completely inside the bounding box of y.

y SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
This means y is completely to the south-east of z.

Now, let's visualize these constraints:

1. Region x is B of region y:
   - x is inside the bounding box of y
   - The eastern boundary of x doesn't extend beyond the eastern boundary of y
   - The western boundary of x doesn't extend beyond the western boundary of y
   - The northern boundary of x doesn't extend beyond the northern boundary of y
   - The southern boundary of x doesn't extend beyond the southern boundary of y

2. Region y is SE of region z:
   - y is to the south-east of z
   - The western boundary of y is to the east of the eastern boundary of z
   - The northern boundary of y is to the south of the southern boundary of z

Now, let's deduce the relationship between x and z.

Since x is B of y, it's entirely contained within the bounding box of y. Since y is SE of z, y is completely to the south-east of z.

So, x (being inside y) is to the south-east of z. 

But wait, that's not entirely correct. Since x is B of y, it doesn't mean x is fully contained within y. It means x is within the bounding box of y. So, x can overlap with y or even extend outside y as long as it stays within the bounding box of y.

Let me reconsider:

Given that y is SE of z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Given that x is B of y, we know:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
  This means the eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x, or in other words, x is to the east of z.

- supy(y) <= infy(z)
  The northern boundary of y is to the south of the southern boundary of z, or y is to the south of z.

However, we can't say definitively that x is to the south of z. We only know that the upper boundary of x is below the upper boundary of y, which doesn't tell us about its relation to z.

So x could be SE, E, or NE of z, or it might have a more complex relation.

Let's visualize it geometrically.

1. First, establish the bounding box of z.
2. Given that y is SE of z, y is in the south-east tile.
3. Now, x is B of y, so x is within the bounding box of y.

This means x is somewhere in the south-east tile of z, potentially overlapping with the east or north-east or south tiles.

Let's enumerate all the possible single-tile relations between x and z:

- E: x is completely to the east of z.
- SE: x is completely to the south-east of z.
- S: x is completely to the south of z.

These three are immediately possible based on the constraints.

But wait, there are other relations:

- NE: x is completely to the north-east of z.
- B: x is completely within the bounding box of z.
- N: x is completely to the north of z.
- NW: x is completely to the north-west of z.
- W: x is completely to the west of z.
- SW: x is completely to the south-west of z.

Let's check each of these.

NE: Can x be completely to the north-east of z?
For x to be NE of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We already established supx(z) <= infx(x) from our derivation above. For the second condition, we know supy(y) <= infy(z), which means y is to the south of z. Since x is B of y, x's upper boundary doesn't extend beyond y's upper boundary. So, it seems unlikely that x is to the north of z. However, if y is just slightly to the south of z and x's bounding box is also just slightly constrained by y, x could potentially extend to the north of z. So, NE is possible.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's reconsider.

Given that y is SE of z, the northern boundary of y is to the south of the southern boundary of z. That means supy(y) <= infy(z).

Given that x is B of y, the upper boundary of x doesn't extend beyond the upper boundary of y. That means supy(x) <= supy(y).

Combining these, we get: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).

This means the northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of z. In other words, x is to the south of z. So, x cannot be to the north of z, which rules out N, NE, and NW.

So, the possible single-tile relations so far are:
- E: x is completely to the east of z.
- SE: x is completely to the south-east of z.
- S: x is completely to the south of z.

Now, let's check the other relations:

B: Can x be completely within the bounding box of z?
For x to be B of z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). This means the eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x. This violates the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for x to be B of z. So, x cannot be B of z.

Wait, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me redo this.

For y to be SE of z, we have:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z)

For x to be B of y, we have:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From 1 and 3, we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
This means the eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x, or in other words, z is to the west of x. This implies x is to the east of z.

From 2 and 6, we get: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
This means the northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of z, or x is to the south of z.

So, x is to the east and to the south of z. This suggests x is SE of z.

But that's only one possibility. Let's consider other relations:

E: For x to be E of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x). For the condition infy(z) <= infy(x), it might be true if the southern boundary of z is low enough. But we also have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z) because infy(z) < supy(z). So, x can't be E of z.

S: For x to be S of z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

We've established supy(x) <= infy(z). For the condition infx(z) <= infx(x), it might be true if the western boundary of z is far enough to the west. But we also have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) because infx(x) < supx(x). So, x can't be S of z.

W, NW, SW: These all require x to be to the west of z, but we've established x is to the east of z, so these are ruled out.

N, NE: These require x to be to the north of z, but we've established x is to the south of z, so these are ruled out.

B: This requires x to be within the bounding box of z, but we've established x is to the east and south of z, so this is ruled out.

Therefore, the only possible single-tile relation between x and z is SE.

Hmm, but let's double-check our deductions.

From our constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's western boundary is to the east of y's western boundary)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's eastern boundary is to the west of y's eastern boundary)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's southern boundary is to the north of y's southern boundary)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's northern boundary is to the south of y's northern boundary)

From these, I derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

This means x is to the south-east of z, as shown in the single-tile relation SE.

But there's a slight issue with our problem statement. When we say "x is B of y," it means x is within the bounding box of y. But that doesn't fully constrain x's location. For example, x could be a tiny region in the bottom-right corner of y's bounding box, which would place it to the south-east of z.

Let's go back to the definition of B:
x B y if and only if infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means x is completely inside the bounding box of y. It doesn't say anything about x's exact location within that bounding box.

Given that y is SE of z, y is to the south-east of z.

The bounding box of y can be visualized as a rectangle where the top-left corner is at (infx(y), supy(y)) and the bottom-right corner is at (supx(y), infy(y)).

Now, x can be anywhere inside this rectangle (the bounding box of y) as long as it satisfies the condition x B y.

Let me think about the possible relations between x and z.

From y SE z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From x B y, we know x is inside the bounding box of y. This bounding box is entirely to the south-east of z. Hence, x, being inside this bounding box, is also to the south-east of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Wait, I'm making a mistake. When I say "x is B of y," it doesn't mean x is inside the bounding box of y. It means x is bound by the bounding box of y. In other words, y's bounding box is a constraint for x's location.

Let's revisit the definition:
x B y if and only if infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means the western boundary of x is to the east of the western boundary of y, the eastern boundary of x is to the west of the eastern boundary of y, the southern boundary of x is to the north of the southern boundary of y, and the northern boundary of x is to the south of the northern boundary of y.

In simpler terms, x is inside the bounding box of y.

Wait, let's be careful here. The "bounding box" of a region is the smallest rectangle containing the region, and the region of REG can be of any shape. So x "is B of" y means x is within the minimal rectangle containing y, not necessarily within y itself.

Given:
- y is SE of z
- x is B of y

For y to be SE of z, the northern boundary of y must be to the south of the southern boundary of z, and the western boundary of y must be to the east of the eastern boundary of z.

Given that x is within the bounding box of y, and the entire bounding box of y is to the south-east of z, x must also be to the south-east of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is SE.

But now I'm suspicious of this. Let me be absolutely rigorous to confirm this.

From y SE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (The eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) (The northern boundary of y is to the south of the southern boundary of z)

From x B y:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x) (The western boundary of x is to the east of the western boundary of y)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y) (The eastern boundary of x is to the west of the eastern boundary of y)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x) (The southern boundary of x is to the north of the southern boundary of y)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y) (The northern boundary of x is to the south of the northern boundary of y)

From 1 and 3:
7. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (The eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x)

For x to be SE of z, we need:
(i) supx(z) <= infx(x) (The eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x)
(ii) supy(x) <= infy(z) (The northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of z)

From 7, condition (i) is satisfied.

From 2 and 6:
8. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (The northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of z)

From 8, condition (ii) is satisfied.

So, x is SE of z.

Actually, wait. I need to reconsider. I was right previously: the relation is indeed just SE. Let me verify one more time.

From y SE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (The eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) (The northern boundary of y is to the south of the southern boundary of z)

From x B y:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x) (The western boundary of y is to the west of the western boundary of x)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y) (The eastern boundary of x is to the west of the eastern boundary of y)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x) (The southern boundary of y is to the south of the southern boundary of x)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y) (The northern boundary of x is to the south of the northern boundary of y)

For x to be SE of z, we need:
(i) supx(z) <= infx(x) (The eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x)
(ii) supy(x) <= infy(z) (The northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of z)

From 1 and 3:
7. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (The eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x)

From 7, condition (i) is satisfied.

From 2 and 6:
8. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (The northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of z)

From 8, condition (ii) is satisfied.

So, x is SE of z.

Wait, I think I've been misinterpreting the problem. The question is asking for all possible relations between x and z.

We've established that x is SE of z. But the question is asking for ALL possible relations, which could be multi-tile relations.

So far, we've established that x is in the south-east tile with respect to z. But can x also extend to other tiles?

Let me revisit the constraints:

From y SE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From x B y:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's western boundary is to the east of y's western boundary)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's eastern boundary is to the west of y's eastern boundary)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's southern boundary is to the north of y's southern boundary)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's northern boundary is to the south of y's northern boundary)

From 1 and 3:
7. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)

From 2 and 6:
8. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

This confirms that x is to the south and to the east of z, which means x is SE of z.

But let's clarify if there's any ambiguity here:

From the constraints, is it possible for x to extend to any other tile with respect to z?

For x to extend to the S tile with respect to z, we would need:
supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we have) and
infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) 

But from 7, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) <= supx(z). So, x can't extend to the S tile.

For x to extend to the E tile with respect to z, we would need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we have) and
infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

But from 8, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't extend to the E tile.

Similarly, for other tiles (SW, W, NW, N, NE, B), the constraints establish that x is in the SE tile with respect to z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Wait, I think I may have been making a mistake. I've been interpreting the relation "is B of" as placing constraints on the region, but it could be that "B" is one of the cardinal direction relations.

Let's go back to the original problem:
- Region x is B of region y 
- Region y is SE of region z

The definition of "B" as a cardinal direction relation given in the problem states:
x B y if and only if infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means x is within the bounding box of y. 

The definition of "SE" states:
y SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means y is to the south-east of z.

Now, given these two constraints, we want to find the possible relations between x and z.

From y SE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From x B y:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's western boundary is to the east of y's western boundary)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's eastern boundary is to the west of y's eastern boundary)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's southern boundary is to the north of y's southern boundary)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's northern boundary is to the south of y's northern boundary)

From 1 and 3:
7. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z's eastern boundary is to the west of x's western boundary)

From 2 and 6:
8. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (x's northern boundary is to the south of z's southern boundary)

From 7, x is to the east of z.
From 8, x is to the south of z.

So, x is to the south-east of z, which means the cardinal direction relation between x and z is SE.

But, let's double-check this by considering all possible relations:

- N: For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But from 8, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) because infy(z) < supy(z). So, x is not N of z.

- NE: For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is true from 7) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But from 8, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) because infy(z) < supy(z). So, x is not NE of z.

- E: For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is true from 7), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from 8, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x) because infy(x) < supy(x). So, x is not E of z.

- SE: For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is true from 7) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is true from 8). So, x is SE of z.

- S: For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is true from 8), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But from 7, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) because infx(z) < supx(z). So, x is not S of z.

- SW: For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is true from 8). But from 7, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) because infx(z) < supx(z) and infx(x) < supx(x). So, x is not SW of z.

- W: For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from 7, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) because infx(x) < supx(x). So, x is not W of z.

- NW: For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But from 7, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) because infx(x) < supx(x). So, x is not NW of z.

- B: For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from 7, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) because infx(z) < supx(z). So, x is not B of z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, I think I may have been overthinking this. Let's make sure we're absolutely clear on the problem.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Question:
Which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

Let's resort to a more visual approach. If y is SE of z, then y is to the south-east of z. If x is B of y, then x is within the bounding box of y. Visually:

```
z
      y
     (x)
```

Where (x) indicates that x is somewhere within the bounding box of y.

From this visual, it's clear that x is to the south-east of z, because the entire bounding box of y is to the south-east of z. So, the relation between x and z is SE.

I think this is the correct answer: The relation between x and z is SE.

Wait, I realized there's a potential issue with my approach. The problem asks for "possible" relations. This suggests that there might be multiple valid answers.

Let's think more about the constraints. If y is SE of z, then y is to the south-east of z. If x is B of y, then x is within the bounding box of y. The constraints give us:

1. supx(z) <= infx(y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z)
3. infx(y) <= infx(x)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From these, we can derive:
7. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
8. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

These two conditions together define the "SE" relation. 

But there's a subtlety. These relations can also be considered multi-tile when a region spans multiple tiles. For example, x can be both SE and E of z if it spans both the SE and E tiles. However, based on the constraints given, x is firmly in the SE tile and doesn't span any other tile.

So my final answer is: the relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, there's another approach that might help clarify this. Let's think about the problem in terms of the 9-tile partitioning of the reference region, as described in the problem.

When we say "y is SE of z", it means y is entirely within the SE tile of z. Similarly, for "x is B of y", x is entirely within the bounding box of y.

Given that y is in the SE tile of z, and x is within the bounding box of y, x must also be within the SE tile of z (since the bounding box of y is within the SE tile of z).

Therefore, the relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, let's make sure I correctly understand "is B of" again. The definition provided is:

x B y if and only if infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means x is within the bounding box of y, as we've been interpreting. But then why is the question asking for "possible" relations? This might be because there are actually multiple valid relations.

Let me redo the analysis.

Given:
1. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's western boundary is to the east of y's western boundary)
2. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's eastern boundary is to the west of y's eastern boundary)
3. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's southern boundary is to the north of y's southern boundary)
4. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's northern boundary is to the south of y's northern boundary)

These constraints ensure that x is within the bounding box of y. But they don't tell us anything about the exact location or shape of x. For example, x could be a tiny region at the center of y, or it could almost fill the entire bounding box.

Now, given that y is SE of z, every point of y is to the south and east of z. Given that x is B of y, x is somewhere within the bounds of y. 

Let's consider all possible directions between x and z:

- SE: Is it possible for x to be SE of z? Yes, because y is SE of z, and x is within the bounds of y, so x is also SE of z.

Are there any other possibilities? Let's consider the other cardinal directions:

- E: For x to be E of z, it would need to be at the same latitude as z (or overlap in latitude) but to the east of it. Since y is to the south and east of z, and x is within the bounds of y, x is also to the south of z. So, x cannot be purely E of z.

- S: For x to be S of z, it would need to be at the same longitude as z (or overlap in longitude) but to the south of it. Since y is to the south and east of z, and x is within the bounds of y, x is also to the east of z. So, x cannot be purely S of z.

- SW, W, NW, N, NE: These cases can be ruled out based on similar reasoning.

- B: For x to be B of z, it would need to be within the bounds of z. But since y is to the south and east of z, and x is within the bounds of y, x cannot be within the bounds of z.

So, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is SE.

Wait, let's double-check our deductions from the constraints. From y SE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From x B y:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's western boundary is to the east of y's western boundary)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's eastern boundary is to the west of y's eastern boundary)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's southern boundary is to the north of y's southern boundary)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's northern boundary is to the south of y's northern boundary)

We've established that these constraints ensure x is in the SE tile with respect to z. But can x also occupy other tiles?

For x to be in the S tile with respect to z, we need:
a. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)
b. infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's western boundary is to the east of z's western boundary)
c. supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's eastern boundary is to the west of z's eastern boundary)

From 1 and 3, we know:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This contradicts condition (c) for x to be in the S tile, because supx(z) <= infx(x) implies infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z) is false. So, x can't be in the S tile.

For x to be in the E tile with respect to z, we need:
a. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
b. infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's southern boundary is to the north of z's southern boundary)
c. supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's northern boundary is to the south of z's northern boundary)

From 2 and 6, we know:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This contradicts condition (b) for x to be in the E tile, because supy(x) <= infy(z) implies infy(z) <= infy(x) is false, since infy(x) <= supy(x). So, x can't be in the E tile.

Similarly, for the other tiles, we can show that x doesn't occupy them based on our constraints.

Therefore, x is entirely within the SE tile with respect to z. So, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is SE.

Wait, let's be absolutely sure:

From y SE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From x B y:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's western boundary is to the east of y's western boundary)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's eastern boundary is to the west of y's eastern boundary)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's southern boundary is to the north of y's southern boundary)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's northern boundary is to the south of y's northern boundary)

We've shown that these constraints ensure x is in the SE tile with respect to z. Can x occupy multiple tiles?

Yes, if x is a large or complex region, it could span multiple tiles. But the constraints given restrict x to be entirely within the SE tile. 

For x to be in both the SE and E tiles, for example, part of x would need to be at the same latitude as z. But from 2 and 6, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely to the south of z.

Similarly, for x to be in both the SE and S tiles, part of x would need to be at the same longitude as z. But from 1 and 3, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z.

For x to be in other tiles like SW, W, NW, N, NE, or B, it would violate our constraints even more.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

Ok, I think I may be missing the point of these constraints:

From y SE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From x B y:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's western boundary is to the east of y's western boundary)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's eastern boundary is to the west of y's eastern boundary)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's southern boundary is to the north of y's southern boundary)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's northern boundary is to the south of y's northern boundary)

From 1 and 3, we derive:
7. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
This ensures that x is to the east of z.

From 2 and 6, we derive:
8. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) which means supy(x) <= infy(z)
This ensures that x is to the south of z.

So, x is to the south and east of z, which means x is SE of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is SE.

Hmm, but the question still asks for "could be the possible relations." What am I missing?

Wait, let me consider what "relation" means in this context. It seems that we're looking for a cardinal direction relation, which is an expression R1:...:Rk, where R1, ..., Rk are from the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

That is, the relation can be multi-tile. So I need to determine if x can span multiple tiles with respect to z.

From our constraints and derivations, we know:
- x is to the east of z.
- x is to the south of z.

So, x is in the SE tile with respect to z.

Can x also be in any other tile? The answer is no. For x to be in another tile, for example the B tile, it would mean that a part of x is within the bounding box of z, which would violate the constraints we derived.

Therefore, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is SE.

Hold on, I think I've been confusing the terminology. Let's clarify:

- "B of y" means x is within the bounding box of y (but not necessarily within y itself).
- "SE of z" means y is to the south-east of z.

I think "the relation between x and z" is asking for Rx,z where Rx,z is one of {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE} or a composite of these.

From our derivations:
- x is to the east of z.
- x is to the south of z.

This means x is in the SE tile with respect to z. The cardinal direction relation between x and z is thus SE.

The wording "which could be" suggests that there might be multiple valid configurations, but we've shown that the only consistent relation is SE.

Actually, I might have mistaken a specific definition in the problem. Let me revisit the definition of "B" in the cardinal direction context:

x B y if and only if infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means x is completely inside the bounding box of y. Given that y is to the south-east of z (y SE z), the bounding box of y is also to the south-east of z. So, x being within the bounding box of y, is also to the south-east of z.

The relation between x and z is thus SE.

Actually, while I'm sure the relation is SE, the question is about the possible relations, which means all valid relations. Let me be clear:

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Question:
Which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

From our derivations:
- x is to the east of z (i.e., supx(z) <= infx(x)).
- x is to the south of z (i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z)).

These two conditions together define the SE relation. So, x is SE of z.

Possible Relations: SE.

I can't think of any other valid relations given the constraints. So, the answer is SE.

Wait, I think I've been overthinking this, and the question might be simpler. Let me revisit the problem:

Given that x is within the bounding box of y (i.e., x B y), and y is to the south-east of z (i.e., y SE z), where could x be with respect to z?

Since y is to the south-east of z, and x is constrained to be within the bounding box of y, x is also to the south-east of z.

Thus, the relation between x and z is SE.

Let me double-check this by visualizing the relationship:

1. y is SE of z: This means y is to the south-east of z. Visually, z is at the top-left and y is at the bottom-right.
2. x is B of y: This means x is within the bounding box of y.

Combining these, it's clear that x is also to the south-east of z. The relation between x and z is thus SE.

So, the answer is SE.

Mmm, I feel like I've been overthinking this. Let me think one more time.

The problem states:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

For one last time, let's clarify the terminology:
- "B of y" means x is within the bounding box of y.
- "SE of z" means y is to the south-east of z.

From these:
- y is to the south and east of z.
- x is constrained to be within the bounding box of y.

Since y is to the south-east of z, the entire bounding box of y is also to the south-east of z. Since x is within the bounding box of y, x is also to the south-east of z.

Thus, the relation between x and z is SE.

So, the answer to the question "Which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is SE.

Actually, I think the issue is that I'm forgetting that a region can occupy multiple tiles at once.

Wait, but given our constraints, x is entirely to the south and east of z, as we've derived:
- x is to the east of z (i.e., supx(z) <= infx(x)).
- x is to the south of z (i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z)).

These two conditions together ensure that x is entirely within the SE tile with respect to z. So, the relation is SE.

I believe the answer is SE.

Actually, you know what, there's something fishy going on. Let's think about this differently.

The question asks which "could be" the possible relations. I think I could be misunderstanding or missing a key ambiguity.

The given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let me focus on the constraints for x explicitly.
1. From "y is SE of z": y is to the south and east of z.
2. From "x is B of y": x is within the bounding box of y.

These constraints ensure that x is bound by the bounding box of y. But they don't give any position of x within the bounding box. And the bounding box of y can be any rectangle that contains y.

So it still seems the only possible relation is SE.

Actually, could the ambiguity lie in the "bounding box" itself? Maybe the bounding box isn't a tight fit around y, and it has some room?

Let's revisit the definition:
x B y if and only if infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means x is within the bounding box of y. 

Let's explicitly understand the conditions.

infx(y) <= infx(x) means: The left boundary of y is to the left of or coincides with the left boundary of x.

So the left bound of x is as left as or more right than the left bound of y. In other words, the left edge of x is not allowed to go further left than the left edge of y. It also means that the left edge of x could be to the right of the left edge of y. In fact, the condition is telling us that the left edge of x is to the right of the left edge of y or it coincides with the left edge of y.

supx(x) <= supx(y) means: The right boundary of x is to the left of or coincides with the right boundary of y. 

So the right bound of x is as right as or more left than the right bound of y. In other words, the right edge of x is not allowed to go further right than the right edge of y. It also means that the right edge of x could be to the left of the right edge of y. In fact, the condition is telling us that the right edge of x is to the left of the right edge of y or it coincides with the right edge of y.

infy(y) <= infy(x) means: The bottom boundary of y is below or coincides with the bottom boundary of x.

So the bottom bound of x is as low as or higher than the bottom bound of y. In other words, the bottom edge of x is not allowed to go further down than the bottom edge of y. It also means that the bottom edge of x could be above the bottom edge of y. In fact, the condition is telling us that the bottom edge of x is above the bottom edge of y or it coincides with the bottom edge of y.

supy(x) <= supy(y) means: The top boundary of x is below or coincides with the top boundary of y.

So the top bound of x is as high as or lower than the top bound of y. In other words, the top edge of x is not allowed to go further up than the top edge of y. It also means that the top edge of x could be below the top edge of y. In fact, the condition is telling us that the top edge of x is below the top edge of y or it coincides with the top edge of y.

OH I know what it is. I've been in my head focusing on the _smallest_ bounding box of y, but it's possible that the bounding box is not the smallest!

Wait, the definition still says "bounding box" and not just "any box" though. The bounding box by definition is the smallest rectangle that contains the region. So, I believe my interpretation is correct.

Let me refocus and try one last approach.

The question is asking for the possible relations between x and z. Let's derive the constraints explicitly:

From y SE z:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

From x B y:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's western boundary is to the east of y's western boundary)
4. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's eastern boundary is to the west of y's eastern boundary)
5. infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's southern boundary is to the north of y's southern boundary)
6. supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's northern boundary is to the south of y's northern boundary)

From 1 and 3, we derive:
7. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) which means supx(z) <= infx(x)
This ensures that x is to the east of z.

From 2 and 6, we derive:
8. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) which means supy(x) <= infy(z)
This ensures that x is to the south of z.

So, x is to the south and east of z, which means x is SE of z.

Therefore, the relation between x and z is SE.

Wait, I think the key insight I had is the definition of the cardinal direction relation, as provided in the problem:

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

So the answer can be multiple tiles! For example, if x spans both the South and SouthEast tiles with respect to z, then the relation would be S:SE.

But, from our derivations, we've shown that x is entirely within the SE tile with respect to z. It doesn't span any other tile.

Therefore, the cardinal direction relation between x and z is just SE.

I think the answer is: SE.

Actually, I may not fully understand the possibilities. Let me break this down one more time.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

We know from the definition of B and SE that:
1. infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(y)
3. supx(z) <= infx(y) 
4. supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combing these, we get:
5. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) 
This means the easternmost point of z is to the west of the westernmost point of x. So, x is to the east of z.

6. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
This means the northernmost point of x is to the south of the southernmost point of z. So, x is to the south of z.

From 5 and 6, we can conclude that x is to the southeast of z, which is the SE relation.

But the question asks which "could be" the possible relations, indicating that there might be multiple valid relations. 

Is it possible that the relation is not uniquely SE? Let's see:

1. Can x be S of z?
For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) (which is true from 6), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But from 5, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) <= supx(z). So, x can't be S of z.

2. Can x be E of z?
For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is true from 5), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from 6, we know supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be E of z.

3. Can x be SW, W, NW, N, NE, B of z?
Using similar derivations, we can show that these are all contradictions.

4. Can x be in multiple tiles with respect to z (like S:SE or E:SE)?
From our derivations, x is firmly in the SE tile and doesn't span any other tile.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

I'm sticking with my original answer: The relation between x and z is SE.

Wait, I think I'm being too hasty here. I think the "possible" relations don't just come from the constraints, but also from any freedom the problem gives us. There might be multiple valid configurations given the constraints.

Let me see if I can find any freedom in our constraints.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let's focus more on the bounding box of y. The bounding box of y is the smallest rectangle that contains y.

1. First, establish the bounding box of z.
2. Given that y is SE of z, y is in the south-east tile.
3. Now, x is B of y, so x is within the bounding box of y.

Given that y is in the SE tile of z, the bounding box of y is somewhere to the southeast of z.

Now, here's a point of freedom: we don't know the exact location of the bounding box of y within the SE tile of z. It could be very close to z, or it could be far away.

Also, I think I can think of the problem with, say, z being a city, y being a landmark or point of interest, and x being a region. We know y is SE of the city. And we're told that x is within the bounding box of y. The question is: where could x be relative to the city?

Given that y is to the south-east of the city, and x is within the confines of y, x is also to the south-east of the city.

This kind of confirms our current answer: The relation between x and z is SE.

So, with absolute confidence, I'd say the answer is: SE. Based on our constraints, the only possible relation between x and z is SE. It's not possible for x to span any other tiles with respect to z.

Oh wait: Let me double check the definition.

"x B y if and only if infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)"

x B y means that the bounding box of y bounds x. But "x is within the bounds of y" doesn't, at first glance, mean that "x is within the bounds of each of y's points". Actually wait: This tells us about their projections:

infx(y) <= infx(x): the left edge of x is to the right of the left edge of y
supx(x) <= supx(y): the right edge of x is to the left of the right edge of y
infy(y) <= infy(x): the bottom edge of x is above the bottom edge of y
supy(x) <= supy(y): the top edge of x is below the top edge of y

We know from 3 and 4 that:
supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

So:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): The left edge of x is to the right of the right edge of z
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z): The top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z

So x is solidly to the south-east of z. 

So, the relation between x and z is SE. Not SE:S, not SE:E, not SE:B, just SE.

Therefore, the answer is: SE.

ANSWER:

Looking at this problem, I need to determine what relation could exist between region x and region z given that x is B of y and y is SE of z.

Let me break down what we know:

- x B y means: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
  This means x is completely inside the bounding box of y.

- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
  This means y is completely to the southeast of z.

From these constraints, I can derive:
1. supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   The eastern boundary of z is to the west of the western boundary of x.

2. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   The northern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of z.

These two conditions together define the SE relation. Region x is completely to the southeast of region z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
