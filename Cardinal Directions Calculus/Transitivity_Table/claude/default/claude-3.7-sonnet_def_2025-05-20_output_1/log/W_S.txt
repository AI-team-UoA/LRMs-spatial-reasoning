PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this carefully, step by step.

We know:
- x W y (region x is West of region y)
- y S z (region y is South of region z)

We want to find: possible relations between x and z.

Let's recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

For x W y (x is West of y):
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means x is to the left of y, and vertically, x is within the y-range or partially overlaps with y.

For y S z (y is South of z):
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means y is below z, and horizontally, y is within the z-range or partially overlaps with z.

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, I need to consider the constraints imposed by these two given relations.

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)

From y S z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z starts at or to the left of where y starts)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y ends at or to the left of where z ends)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
This doesn't give us a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z). So x could be to the left, right, or partially overlapping with z on the horizontal axis.

From x W y, we also know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x and y have some vertical overlap)

From y S z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
- So, supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z on the vertical axis. (since the upper bound of x is below the lower bound of z)

Now, let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. SW (South West): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z). But we don't know for sure if supx(x) <= infx(z). However, this is a possibility.

2. S (South): If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). But again, we don't have direct information about the horizontal relationship between x and z. However, this is a possibility.

3. SE (South East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z). But we don't have direct information about whether x is to the right of z. However, this is a possibility.

4. W (West): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be purely to the West of z.

5. B (Bounding box): If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be inside the bounding box of z.

6. E (East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be purely to the East of z.

7. NW (North West): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies that the vertical projections of x and z don't overlap, with x being below z. This contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be to the Northwest of z.

8. N (North): If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be purely to the North of z.

9. NE (North East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be to the Northeast of z.

Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning. I'm concluding that x can be SW, S, or SE of z.

Oh, I think I may have made a mistake in my deduction. Let's verify if supy(x) <= infy(z) necessarily holds.

From x W y, we know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the upper bound of x is at most the upper bound of y)

From y S z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (the upper bound of y is at most the lower bound of z)

Combining these, we get:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
- So, supy(x) <= infy(z)

So, my deduction was correct; x is indeed vertically below z (i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z)).

Now, let's revisit the horizontal relationship.

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)

From y S z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z starts at or to the left of where y starts)

Combining these, we can't directly infer a relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

Here's a specific example: If infx(z) is to the left of supx(x), then x and z have a horizontal overlap, even though x is to the left of y and y is within the horizontal span of z.

So, x could be:

- SW of z: If supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is strictly to the left of z on the horizontal axis) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is strictly below z on the vertical axis).
- S of z: If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within the span of z) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is strictly below z on the vertical axis).
- SE of z: If supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is strictly to the right of z on the horizontal axis) and supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is strictly below z on the vertical axis).
- W of z: If supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is strictly to the left of z on the horizontal axis) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x and z have a vertical overlap, with x starting at or after z starts, and ending at or before z ends).

Wait, but I just concluded earlier that x is vertically below z (i.e., supy(x) <= infy(z)), which contradicts the condition for x to be W of z (which requires vertical overlap). So, x can't be W of z.

Similarly, x can't be NW, N, NE, E, or B of z because all these relations require a vertical overlap between x and z, which we've shown is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (South West)
- S (South)
- SE (South East)

Let me verify with an example:

Assume z is at coordinates (4, 4) to (6, 6), a 2x2 square.
Then y, being S of z, could be at coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 4), a 2x2 square.
And x, being W of y, could be at coordinates (2, 2) to (4, 4), a 2x2 square.

In this example, x would be SW of z.

But we can also have:
z at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
y at (4, 2) to (6, 4)
x at (3, 2) to (5, 4)

In this case, x would be S of z.

And also:
z at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
y at (4, 2) to (6, 4)
x at (5, 2) to (7, 4)

In this case, x would be SE of z.

Let's also verify that regions like NW, N, NE, E, W, or B are not possible relations for x in relation to z, based on our given constraints.

For W:
Assume z is at coordinates (4, 4) to (6, 6).
y, being S of z, could be at coordinates (4, 2) to (6, 4).
For x to be W of z, it needs to be to the left of z and have a vertical overlap with z. It could be at coordinates (2, 5) to (4, 6), for instance.
But this doesn't satisfy x W y, since y is at (4, 2) to (6, 4) and x is at (2, 5) to (4, 6). x and y don't have a vertical overlap, so x can't be W of y. This confirms that x can't be W of z.

Actually, let me double-check my understanding of the relation W:

For a W b, we have:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the left of b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a and b have a vertical overlap, with a starting at or after b starts, and ending at or before b ends)

So for our constraints:
- x W y means: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y S z means: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

OK that's consistent with my earlier understanding.

Let's think step by step about the vertical relationship:
From x W y, we have infy(y) <= infy(x). This means y starts at or below where x starts.
From y S z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z). This means y ends before z starts.

But we can't directly infer a vertical relationship between x and z. 

Hmm, let me retry. 

From x W y, we have:
infy(y) <= infy(x) (y starts at or below where x starts)
supy(x) <= supy(y) (x ends at or below where y ends)

From y S z, we have:
supy(y) <= infy(z) (y ends before z starts)

Now, combining these:
infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
So, infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (using y S z)
Thus, infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

Wait, this isn't enough to determine the exact vertical relationship. Let's consider different cases:

1. x ends strictly below z (i.e., supy(x) < infy(z)):
   In this case, x is strictly below z.

2. x ends exactly at the bottom of z (i.e., supy(x) = infy(z)):
   In this case, x touches z from below.

So, in both cases, x is below z and doesn't have a vertical overlap with z.

Now, let's think about the horizontal relationship:

From x W y, we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)

From y S z, we have:
infx(z) <= infx(y) (z starts at or to the left of where y starts)
supx(y) <= supx(z) (y ends at or to the left of where z ends)

Wait, the two relations give us:
supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)

But this doesn't directly tell us about the horizontal relationship between x and z. Let's consider a few scenarios:

1. If infx(z) > supx(x):
   Here, z starts to the right of where x ends. So, x is strictly to the left of z, which is the SW relation.

2. If infx(z) <= supx(x) and infx(x) <= supx(z):
   There is a horizontal overlap between x and z. The exact relation could be S if x is horizontally within the span of z.

3. If supx(z) < infx(x):
   Here, z ends to the left of where x starts. So, x is strictly to the right of z, which could be the SE relation.

But (3) seems problematic because from y S z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z), and from x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). That would mean supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so it's not immediately clear whether supx(z) < infx(x) can hold.

Wait, I think we need to go back and think about the constraints more carefully.

Let's consider it step by step.

From the given relations x W y and y S z, we can derive:
1. Horizontally, x is strictly to the left of y.
2. Horizontally, z encloses y (or they share edges).
3. Vertically, x and y have an overlap.
4. Vertically, y is strictly below z.

From these, we can deduce:
- x is below z (since x has vertical overlap with y, and y is strictly below z).
- Horizontally, the relationship between x and z isn't immediately clear. x is strictly to the left of y, and z encloses y horizontally, but this doesn't give a clear horizontal relationship between x and z.

Actually, let's visualize this with a specific example:

Suppose:
- z is at coordinates (3, 6) to (7, 8).
- y is at coordinates (4, 3) to (6, 5).
- x is at coordinates (1, 4) to (3, 5).

Let's verify:
- x is West of y: The x-value of x (1-3) is to the left of the x-value of y (4-6), and they overlap vertically (both have y-values 4-5).
- y is South of z: The y-value of y (3-5) is below the y-value of z (6-8), and they overlap horizontally (y has x-values 4-6, z has x-values 3-7).
- x is South-West of z: x is both to the left and below z.

But let's try another example:

- z is at coordinates (3, 6) to (7, 8).
- y is at coordinates (4, 3) to (6, 5).
- x is at coordinates (2, 4) to (5, 5).

In this case, x and z have a horizontal overlap, so x is South of z.

Let's try one more example:

- z is at coordinates (3, 6) to (7, 8).
- y is at coordinates (4, 3) to (6, 5).
- x is at coordinates (4, 4) to (8, 5).

Wait, but this doesn't work because for x to be West of y, the x-value of x must be to the left of the x-value of y. But here, they overlap horizontally.

Let me revise:

- z is at coordinates (3, 6) to (7, 8).
- y is at coordinates (4, 3) to (6, 5).
- x is at coordinates (6, 4) to (8, 5).

In this case, x is East of y. But that's not our given relation. So, our original relation x W y doesn't allow for a SE relation between x and z.

Hmm, let me try to be more careful and check my understanding of the cardinal directions.

For a W b, we have:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (the rightmost point of a is to the left of the leftmost point of b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a has a vertical overlap with b)

For a S b, we have:
- supy(a) <= infy(b) (the topmost point of a is below the bottommost point of b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) (a has a horizontal overlap with b)

Given:
- x W y means: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y S z means: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let me focus on the horizontal relationship:

From x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). From y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).

Now, if we were to place z entirely to the right of y, we would have supx(y) <= infx(z). But that's not consistent with y S z, which says infx(z) <= infx(y). So, z and y must have a horizontal overlap or z is entirely horizontally enclosing y.

This horizontal overlap relation gives us:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

Combined with x W y, which gives supx(x) <= infx(y), we get:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From this, we can deduce:
- If supx(x) < infx(z), then x is strictly to the left of z on the horizontal axis.
- If infx(z) <= supx(x), then there's potential for overlap. But since we also have supx(x) <= infx(y), this means infx(z) <= supx(x) <= infx(y), which is consistent with the relation y S z. So, this case is valid.

Moreover, from y S z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). Combined with x W y, which gives supx(x) <= infx(y), we get supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). This means supx(x) <= supx(z).

But we haven't established a relation between infx(x) and infx(z) or infx(x) and supx(z).

Actually, let's go back and try to think of this more directly. Let's consider a specific, representative case. 

Let's say z is at positin (3, 7) to (7, 9). It's box-shaped.
Since y S z, then y's y-coordinates must be below z, and with some x-overlap.
So y could be like (4, 4) to (6, 6).
Now, if x W y, then x's x-coordinates must be to the left of y, and with some y-overlap.
So x could be like (1, 5) to (3, 6).

In this particular case, x would be SW of z, since it's both to the left and below z.

But let's consider a different arrangement. Say:
z is at (3, 7) to (7, 9)
y is at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
x is at (2, 5) to (4, 6)

Now, there's a horizontal overlap between x and z (both include the x-coordinate 4). And still, x is W of y and y is S of z. In this case, x would be S of z since they overlap horizontally but x is below z.

Now, let's try to get a SE relation. For that, x needs to be to the right of z. But that would mean x's leftmost point, infx(x), is to the right of z's rightmost point, supx(z). Specifically:
supx(z) <= infx(x)

But from y S z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is horizontally within z).
From x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y).

This means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

So, even if y and z are positioned to use the full ranges, we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (required for a SE relation).

So, it seems like the possible relations are SW and S.

But let me double-check by trying to construct an example where x SE z.

Let z be at (3, 7) to (7, 9).
Let y be at (4, 4) to (6, 6).
For x to be SE of z, it needs to be both to the right and below z.
So, x should be at (8, 5) to (10, 6), for example.

But this doesn't satisfy x W y, since for x W y, supx(x) <= infx(y). Here, supx(x) = 10, which is not less than or equal to infx(y) = 4. So, x can't be W of y in this case.

OK so we've shown that x can't be SE of z. I made an error earlier. Let's regroup.

From our derivation, we have:
- Vertically, x ends at or below where y ends (supy(x) <= supy(y)), and y ends before z starts (supy(y) <= infy(z)). So, x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)).
- Horizontally, x is to the left of y (supx(x) <= infx(y)), and y is horizontally within z (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)).

So, the possible relations are:
- SW: If x is strictly to the left of z on the horizontal axis.
- S: If x and z have a horizontal overlap.

WAIT, let me see if there are any cases where the horizontal relationship between x and z could be different.

From x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). From y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y). This means supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y).

Let's consider the relative values of supx(x) and infx(z):

1. If supx(x) < infx(z), then x is strictly to the left of z, which corresponds to the SW relation.
2. If supx(x) = infx(z), then x and z touch horizontally, with x to the left. This is still an SW relation.
3. If supx(x) > infx(z) and infx(x) < supx(z), then x and z have a horizontal overlap. This corresponds to the S relation.
4. If supx(x) > infx(z) and infx(x) >= supx(z), then x is strictly to the right of z, which corresponds to the SE relation.

Wait, but for case 4, we would have:
supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
supx(x) > infx(z) (from the assumption of case 4)

And from earlier, we derived that supx(x) <= supx(z). This means supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which can't be true for a meaningful region x. So, case 4 is not valid.

So I'm back to the two options:
1. x SW z (if supx(x) <= infx(z))
2. x S z (if infx(z) < supx(x))

Let me try one more thing.

For a relation where part of x is to the right of z but still with some horizontal overlap, we'd have:
- infx(x) < supx(z) (they have horizontal overlap)
- infx(z) < infx(x) (part of x is to the right of z)

But this doesn't determine a unique cardinal direction. If it's combined with x being below z, it would still be an S relation.

So, indeed, the possible relations are:
- SW: If x is strictly to the left of z on the horizontal axis.
- S: If x and z have a horizontal overlap.

Actually, let me check our constraints again. Part of the issue might be the definitions of these relationships.

1. x W y means:
   - Horizontally, x is strictly to the left of y (supx(x) <= infx(y)).
   - Vertically, x and y have an overlap (infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)).

2. y S z means:
   - Vertically, y is strictly below z (supy(y) <= infy(z)).
   - Horizontally, y and z have an overlap (infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)).

Alright, I'm making a mistake more explicit here: the "SW" relation means South-West, but that doesn't imply horizontal and vertical overlaps. An object can be South West of another even if there's no overlap. The South-West relation means the object is both to the left and below the other, without any requirement of overlap. In fact, the definitions indicate strict inequality.

Let's review the definitions:
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So, x SW z if and only if:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the horizontal axis)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z on the vertical axis)

From our derivation, we've established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)). The horizontal relationship can be:
- If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is SW of z.
- If infx(z) < supx(x), then there's a horizontal overlap. This would be the S relation.

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

So, x S z if and only if:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z on the vertical axis)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of z is to the left of or at the same position as the left edge of x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is to the left of or at the same position as the right edge of z)

From our derivation, we've established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But for the S relation, we also need infx(z) <= infx(x). We haven't established this. In fact, it could be that infx(x) < infx(z), in which case x wouldn't be strictly S of z, but would be SW of z.

Hmm so it feels like either S or SW are possible.

Let me try to think of examples for both:

For x SW z:
- z at (3, 7) to (7, 9)
- y at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
- x at (1, 5) to (3, 6)

For x S z:
- z at (3, 7) to (7, 9)
- y at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
- x at (5, 5) to (7, 6)

Wait the latter example doesn't work. I need x W y, which means supx(x) <= infx(y). So supx(x) = 7 and infx(y) = 4, which is not valid since 7 > 4. Let's correct that:

For x S z:
- z at (3, 7) to (7, 9)
- y at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
- x at (2, 5) to (4, 6)

This way, x is to the left of y (supx(x) = 4 and infx(y) = 4, so supx(x) <= infx(y)), and there's a vertical overlap. And x has a horizontal overlap with z, so x is S of z.

This makes sense now. In order for x W y and y S z, the constraints align so that x can either be strictly to the left of z (SW of z) or have a horizontal overlap with z (S of z).

OK so to summarize the directions so far: SW and S.

Let me double-check by using the reasoning above to see if we can construct an example for W.

For x W z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the horizontal axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x and z have a vertical overlap)

But from our derivation, we've established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)). This means x and z don't have a vertical overlap, which contradicts the vertical condition for the W relation. So, x can't be W of z.

Hmm, let me actually check the NW, NE, E, SE, N, B conditions too, to be thorough:

NW (North West): a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
For x NW z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the horizontal axis)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z on the vertical axis)

But from our derivation, we've established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)). This implies infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be NW of z.

N (North): a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
For x N z, we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z on the vertical axis)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x has horizontal overlap with z)

But as shown above, x is below z, not above. So, x can't be N of z.

NE (North East): a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
For x NE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the horizontal axis)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z on the vertical axis)

Again, x is below z, not above. So, x can't be NE of z.

E (East): a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
For x E z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the horizontal axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x has vertical overlap with z)

But x is below z, so they don't have a vertical overlap. So, x can't be E of z.

SE (South East): a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
For x SE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the horizontal axis)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z on the vertical axis)

From our derivation, we've established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)). But we've also shown that supx(x) <= supx(z), which means it's not possible to have supx(z) <= infx(x) (since that would imply supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which is not valid for a non-empty region x). So, x can't be SE of z.

B (Bounding box): a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
For x B z, we'd need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally within z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically within z)

But x is below z, so they don't have a vertical overlap. So, x can't be B of z.

Let's go back to the SE condition. I think my reasoning was too quick before. Let's think more carefully:

For x SE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the horizontal axis)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z on the vertical axis)

From the given relations, we've established that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), which satisfies the vertical condition for SE.

For the horizontal condition, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). Let's see what our derivation gives us. From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we can deduce supx(x) <= supx(z), but this doesn't allow us to determine the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z).

So we need to think about the conditions where supx(z) <= infx(x) might hold. But we've already derived that supx(x) <= supx(z). For SE, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). These combined would give supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x). But for a region that has a positive width, infx(x) < supx(x). So, the conditions supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) lead to a contradiction supx(x) < supx(x). This means the SE relation is not possible.

I think we're done and the answer is:
SW South.

Actually, hold on, let me double-check more to make sure there aren't other possible relations.

Let me reconsider SE more carefully:

For x SE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the horizontal axis)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z on the vertical axis)

From our derivation, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

From these, we can't directly establish a relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). 

Let me think of a specific example:
- z at (3, 7) to (7, 9)
- y at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
- For x to be SE of z, it needs to be both to the right and below z. So, x would need to have infx(x) >= 7 and supy(x) <= 7. We could say x is at (7, 5) to (9, 6).

But now we need to check if x is W of y. To be W of y, supx(x) <= infx(y) needs to hold. Here, supx(x) = 9 and infx(y) = 4, so supx(x) > infx(y). This doesn't satisfy the W relation. So, this example doesn't work.

Actually, I think I've been making a mistake. Let me clarify the W relation again:

For a W b, we have:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) (a is to the left of b on the horizontal axis)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) (a and b have a vertical overlap)

Now, with the correct understanding, for x to be W of y, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y on the horizontal axis)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x and y have a vertical overlap)

And for y to be S of z, we need:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z on the vertical axis)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y and z have a horizontal overlap)

Ah, I see. That's where the confusion arose. The W relation requires x to be to the left of y, not "x to the west of y with a horizontal overlap." This clarifies a lot.

So, with the correct understanding:

For x W y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x and y have a vertical overlap)

For y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y and z have a horizontal overlap)

Now, let's revisit the SE relation for x and z. For x SE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z on the horizontal axis)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z on the vertical axis)

Let's try to set up a specific example:
- z at (3, 7) to (7, 9)
- y at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
- For x to be SE of z, it would need to be at, for example, (8, 5) to (10, 6).

Now, we need to check if x is W of y. For that, supx(x) <= infx(y) must hold. Here, supx(x) = 10 and infx(y) = 4, so supx(x) > infx(y). This doesn't satisfy the W relation. So, x can't be W of y if it's SE of z.

Actually, let's try to determine the relation from the constraints themselves:

For x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
For y S z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).

Combining them, we get infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y). But this doesn't give a direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x), which we need for the SE relation.

Hmm, let's approach this from a different angle.

From x W y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From x W y and y S z, we can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

The second line gives us supy(x) <= infy(z), which confirms that x is below z on the vertical axis.

The first line gives us two relations with infx(y) as a common term: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). But this doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z), which is what we need for determining the horizontal relationship between x and z.

If supx(x) < infx(z), then x is strictly to the left of z, which is the SW relation.
If infx(z) < supx(x), then there's a potential for horizontal overlap. But for x to be S of z, we also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From y S z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). From x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). Combined, we get supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(x) <= supx(z). But this doesn't tell us about the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z).

So, depending on the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z), I think x can be:
- SW of z (if supx(x) <= infx(z))
- S of z (if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z))
- W of z (if supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))

But hold on, we've already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the vertical conditions for the W relation. So, x can't be W of z.

Alright, let's verify this reasoning again with specific examples:

For x SW z:
- z at (3, 7) to (7, 9)
- y at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
- x at (1, 5) to (3, 6)

For x S z:
- z at (3, 7) to (7, 9)
- y at (4, 4) to (6, 6)
- x at (3, 5) to (5, 6)

In the first case:
- x is West of y: supx(x) = 3 <= infx(y) = 4, and there's a vertical overlap.
- y is South of z: supy(y) = 6 <= infy(z) = 7, and there's a horizontal overlap.
- x is South-West of z: supx(x) = 3 <= infx(z) = 3 and supy(x) = 6 <= infy(z) = 7.

In the second case:
- x is West of y: supx(x) = 5 <= infx(y) = 4, and there's a vertical overlap. WAIT, 5 <= 4 is not true! This example is incorrect.

OK let me fix the X Sz example:

For x S z:
- z at (3, 7) to (7, 9)
- y at (5, 4) to (7, 6)
- x at (3, 5) to (5, 6)

Now:
- x is West of y: supx(x) = 5 <= infx(y) = 5, and there's a vertical overlap.
- y is South of z: supy(y) = 6 <= infy(z) = 7, and there's a horizontal overlap.
- x is South of z: supy(x) = 6 <= infy(z) = 7, infx(z) = 3 <= infx(x) = 3, and supx(x) = 5 <= supx(z) = 7.

Great. SW and S are possible relations.

Let me double-check if it's possible for X to be SE of Z, with a direct derivation:

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (X is to right of z's right edge)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (X is below z)

We've already established the the second condition is always satisfied. 

Now considering the first condition: supx(z) <= infx(x)

From y S z, we know: supx(y) <= supx(z)
From x W y, we know: supx(x) <= infx(y)

Combined: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
So: supx(x) <= supx(z)

For SE, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x)

Combining this with our deduction: supx(x) <= supx(z) <= infx(x)
Which means: supx(x) <= infx(x)

But for a region x that has a positive width, we need infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(x). So, the SE relation is not possible.

Alright, let's review all possible relations:

For relation x W y and y S z, we've shown that:
- x can be SW of z (if x is strictly to the left of z, and x is below z)
- x can be S of z (if x has a horizontal overlap with z, and x is below z)

And we've shown that no other cardinal direction relation is possible between x and z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: Southwest (SW) and South (S).

Actually, wait, I want to check one more time the possibility of the W relation. As I think I was making an error in my reasoning.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the horizontal axis)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x and z have a vertical overlap)

From our derivation from the given relations, we know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (from x W y and y S z)

This means that x is strictly below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), which contradicts the vertical conditions for W (which require a vertical overlap, i.e., infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)). Hence, x cannot have the W relation to z.

Great. So our derived answer is SW or S.

Actually, wait, I want to check one more relation: x NW z.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the horizontal axis)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z on the vertical axis)

From our derivation, we know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z) (from x W y and y S z)

This means that x is strictly below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), which contradicts the vertical condition for NW (which requires x to be above z, i.e., supy(z) <= infy(x)). So, x cannot have the NW relation to z.

To wrap up:

For relations x W y and y S z, we've determined that:
- x can be SW of z (if x is strictly to the left of z, and x is below z)
- x can be S of z (if x has a horizontal overlap with z, and x is below z)

And we've verified that no other cardinal direction relation is possible.

The answer is: SW, S.

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x W y (x is West of y)
- y S z (y is South of z)

To analyze this systematically:

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (vertical overlap)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (horizontal overlap)

Combining these constraints:
- Vertically: supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is always below z
- Horizontally: We have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)

Two possibilities emerge:
1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z): x is completely to the left of z (and below it) → SW relation
2. If infx(z) ≤ supx(x): x has horizontal overlap with z (while being below it) → S relation

I can verify no other relations are possible because:
- We've established x is strictly below z, which eliminates W, NW, N, NE, E, B
- The constraints prevent x from being to the right of z, eliminating SE

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SW
