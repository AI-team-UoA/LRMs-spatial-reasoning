PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this step by step. We have:
- Region x is SE of region y: x SE y
- Region y is NE of region z: y NE z

Now, we need to figure out the possible relationships between region x and region z.

Let's recall the cardinal direction definitions:

x SE y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

y NE z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, we need to determine what we can say about the relationship between x and z.

From x SE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's combine these to find the relation between x and z:

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y NE z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x SE y)

By transitivity:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)

We can't directly establish a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x).

So, we know that x is definitely to the east of z. But for the north-south relationship, we have several possibilities:
- x could be to the north of z (N)
- x could be to the south of z (S)
- x could overlap with z in the y-coordinate

Let's analyze each case:

1. If x is to the north of z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   This combined with supx(z) <= infx(x) gives x NE z.

2. If x is to the south of z:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   This combined with supx(z) <= infx(x) gives x SE z.

3. If x overlaps with z in the y-coordinate:
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z) or infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   This combined with supx(z) <= infx(x) gives x E z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NE z
- x E z
- x SE z

Let's try to visualize this to confirm. We have a region z, and a region y is to the northeast of z. Then, region x is to the southeast of y. Depending on the exact positions, x could be to the northeast, east, or southeast of z. 

Let's visualize this with a few examples:

Example 1: x is NE of z
```
    y
   /
  /
 z---x
```

Example 2: x is E of z
```
  y
 / \
z   x
```

Example 3: x is SE of z
```
 z
  \
   y
    \
     x
```

So, the possible relationships between x and z are: NE, E, or SE.

Actually, let me think about this more systematically using minimum bounding boxes. 

Let's define the minimum bounding box of region a as the box formed by x=infx(a), x=supx(a), y=infy(a), and y=supy(a).

For x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

For y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Applying transitivity again:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) => supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate, we need to consider different cases.

From x SE y and y NE z, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

But we can't directly establish a relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z).

So, x could be north of z (NE relation), or south of z (SE relation), or overlapping with z in the y-coordinate (E relation).

To be more precise:
1. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is to the northeast of z (x NE z).
2. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the southeast of z (x SE z).
3. If these bounding boxes overlap in the y-coordinate but not in the x-coordinate, then x is to the east of z (x E z).

Actually, there's one more possible case I need to consider. What if x and z overlap significantly? Could there be a S, B, N, or other relationship?

Let's analyze more carefully:

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is strictly to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is strictly to the south of y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is strictly to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is strictly to the north of z)

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (this is not necessarily true; we only know that supx(y) <= infx(x))

So, we can't directly establish that supx(z) <= infx(x). Thus, we cannot definitively say that x is to the east of z.

Let's reconsider the problem:

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

By combining, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
- So, supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

But we can't directly establish a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x).

Let's consider different cases:

1. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is to the northeast of z (x NE z).
2. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the southeast of z (x SE z).
3. If they overlap in the y-coordinate (i.e., infy(x) < supy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x)), then x is to the east of z (x E z).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x NE z
- x E z
- x SE z

Actually, I think I made a mistake in the previous analysis.

Let's revisit the constraints:
- For x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- For y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) [from y NE z] and supx(y) <= infx(x) [from x SE y]
- By transitivity, supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [from x SE y] and supy(z) <= infy(y) [from y NE z]

But we can't directly establish a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x).

So, we have the following possibilities:
1. x is northeast of z (x NE z): supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
2. x is east of z (x E z): supx(z) <= infx(x) and there's an overlap in the y-coordinate
3. x is southeast of z (x SE z): supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

To further confirm, let's visualize some Cartesian coordinates.

Suppose:
- z has bounding box [0,1] x [0,1]
- y has bounding box [2,3] x [2,3]
- x has bounding box [4,5] x [0,1]

Then, x is SE of y and y is NE of z, and x is E of z.

Suppose:
- z has bounding box [0,1] x [0,1]
- y has bounding box [2,3] x [2,3]
- x has bounding box [4,5] x [4,5]

Then, x is SE of y and y is NE of z, and x is NE of z.

Suppose:
- z has bounding box [0,1] x [4,5]
- y has bounding box [2,3] x [2,3]
- x has bounding box [4,5] x [0,1]

Then, x is SE of y and y is NE of z, and x is SE of z.

So, the relationship between x and z can be:
- NE (Northeast)
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)

Let's think again. 

We have:
- x SE y: x is southeast of y, meaning x is both to the east and south of y.
- y NE z: y is northeast of z, meaning y is both to the east and north of z.

Now, let's use bounding boxes to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

By transitivity, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) => supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate, we need to consider the transitivity:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)

We can't directly establish a relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or between infy(x) and infy(z). So, x can be:
- Northeast of z (NE): If supy(z) <= infy(x)
- East of z (E): If there's an overlap in the y-coordinate
- Southeast of z (SE): If supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's see if there are any other potential relations.

Could x be N of z? This would mean:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (overlap in x-coordinate)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

But we already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), so x can't overlap with z in the x-coordinate. Therefore, x can't be N of z.

Similarly, x can't be NW, W, SW, S, or SE of z for the same reason.

Could x be B (inside) of z? This would mean:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is bounded by z in the x-coordinate)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is bounded by z in the y-coordinate)

But again, we already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), so x can't be inside z.

So, the only possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (Northeast)
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)

Hmm, let me take a different approach. Let's use examples:

Example 1: z at [0,1] x [0,1], y at [2,3] x [2,3], x at [4,5] x [1,2]
- x is to the east and south of y, so x SE y.
- y is to the east and north of z, so y NE z.
- x is to the east of z and at the same 'northern' level, so x E z.

Example 2: z at [0,1] x [0,1], y at [2,3] x [2,3], x at [4,5] x [3,4]
- x is to the east and south of y, so x SE y.
- y is to the east and north of z, so y NE z.
- x is to the east and north of z, so x NE z.

Example 3: z at [0,1] x [3,4], y at [2,3] x [2,3], x at [4,5] x [1,2]
- x is to the east and south of y, so x SE y.
- y is to the east and south of z, so y SE z.
- x is to the east and far south of z, so x SE z.

Wait, Example 3 doesn't match our original given: y is NE of z, not SE. Let me correct:

Example 3: z at [0,1] x [0,1], y at [2,3] x [2,3], x at [4,5] x [0,1]
- x is to the east and south of y, so x SE y.
- y is to the east and north of z, so y NE z.
- x is directly to the east of z (no significant north or south displacement), so x E z.

Example 4: z at [0,1] x [2,3], y at [2,3] x [4,5], x at [4,5] x [3,4]
- x is to the east and south of y, so x SE y.
- y is to the east and north of z, so y NE z.
- x is to the east and north of z, so x NE z.

Example 5: z at [0,1] x [4,5], y at [2,3] x [6,7], x at [4,5] x [4,5]
- x is to the east and south of y, so x SE y.
- y is to the east and north of z, so y NE z.
- x is to the east and directly aligned with z, so x E z.

Wait, in Example 5, if z is at [0,1] x [4,5] and x is at [4,5] x [4,5], then x is not only to the east of z but also shares the same y-coordinate with z (or at least there's a significant overlap). This would make the relation between x and z to be E, not NE.

Let me correct:

Example 5: z at [0,1] x [4,5], y at [2,3] x [6,7], x at [4,5] x [5,6]
- x is to the east and south of y, so x SE y.
- y is to the east and north of z, so y NE z.
- x is to the east and north of z, so x NE z.

Example 6: z at [0,1] x [6,7], y at [2,3] x [4,5], x at [4,5] x [2,3]
- x is to the east and south of y, so x SE y.
- y is to the east and south of z, so y SE z.
- x is to the east and far south of z, so x SE z.

Wait, Example 6 doesn't match our original given: y is NE of z, not SE. 

Let me reconsider. Given that y is NE of z, it means y has a higher y-coordinate (is more "northerly") than z.

Corrected Example 6: z at [0,1] x [0,1], y at [2,3] x [4,5], x at [4,5] x [2,3]
- x is to the east and south of y, so x SE y.
- y is to the east and north of z, so y NE z.
- x is to the east and north of z, but not as 'northerly' as y, so the relation between x and z is x NE z.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's simplify:

We have:
- x SE y: x is to the east and south of y.
- y NE z: y is to the east and north of z.

From this, we know:
- x is to the east of y, and y is to the east of z, so x is to the east of z.
- x is to the south of y, and y is to the north of z.

But the last point doesn't directly tell us the relationship between x and z in the y-direction.

It's clearer to use the bounding box example:

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

By transitivity, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) => supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the east of z. But for the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SE y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)

We can't directly establish a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x). So, we need to consider different possibilities.

Let's draw some diagrams to visualize the possible relations:

Case 1: x is NE of z
```
    y
   /
  /
 z---x
```

Case 2: x is E of z
```
    y
   /
  /
 z---x
```

Case 3: x is SE of z
```
    y
   /
  /
 z
  \
   \
    x
```

In all of these cases, the conditions are met:
- x is SE of y: x is to the east and south of y.
- y is NE of z: y is to the east and north of z.

But the relation between x and z can be:
- NE (Northeast): x is to the east and north of z.
- E (East): x is to the east and aligned or overlapping with z in the y-direction.
- SE (Southeast): x is to the east and south of z.

Are there any other possible relations?

Let's consider the other possible cardinal directions:
- N (North): x is directly to the north of z.
- NW (Northwest): x is to the north and west of z.
- W (West): x is directly to the west of z.
- SW (Southwest): x is to the south and west of z.
- S (South): x is directly to the south of z.
- B (Bounding Box or Inside): x is contained within z.

Can x be directly to the north of z (N)? This would mean x and z overlap in the x-coordinate. But we've established that x is to the east of z, so x can't be N of z.

Similarly, x can't be NW, W, or SW of z because all of these imply that x is to the west of z, which contradicts our finding that x is to the east of z.

Can x be directly to the south of z (S)? This would mean x and z overlap in the x-coordinate. But again, we've established that x is to the east of z, so x can't be S of z.

Can x be inside or contained by z (B)? This would mean x is bounded by z in both the x and y coordinates. But since x is to the east of z, it can't be inside z.

So, the only possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (Northeast)
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)

Let's double-check. 

We have:
- x SE y: x is to the east and south of y.
- y NE z: y is to the east and north of z.

Let's think about cases:

Suppose z has bounding box [0,1] x [0,1] and y has bounding box [2,3] x [2,3]. To ensure y is NE of z, we need y to be east and north of z, which is satisfied.

Now, let's consider different positions for x:

1. x has bounding box [4,5] x [3,4]:
   - x is east and south of y, so x SE y is satisfied.
   - x is east and north of z, so the relation is x NE z.

2. x has bounding box [4,5] x [1,2]:
   - x is east and south of y, so x SE y is satisfied.
   - x is east of z, but not significantly north or south, so the relation is x E z.

3. x has bounding box [4,5] x [0,1]:
   - x is east and south of y, so x SE y is satisfied.
   - x is east and at the same 'northern' level as z, so the relation is x E z.

4. x has bounding box [4,5] x [-1,0]:
   - x is east and south of y, so x SE y is satisfied.
   - x is east and south of z, so the relation is x SE z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (Northeast)
- E (East)
- SE (Southeast)

Let's go with these:
1. x NE z
2. x E z
3. x SE z

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

NE, E, SE

These are the only possibilities because:

When x is SE of y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

When y is NE of z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)

Through transitivity:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so x must be east of z

However, the north-south relationship between x and z is indeterminate:
- x could be north of z (NE relation)
- x could be aligned with z in the y-direction (E relation)
- x could be south of z (SE relation)
