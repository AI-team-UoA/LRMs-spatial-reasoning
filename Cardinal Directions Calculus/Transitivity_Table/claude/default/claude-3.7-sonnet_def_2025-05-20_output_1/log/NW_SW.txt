PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this problem step by step:

1) We're given that region x is NW of region y.
   This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   
2) We're given that region y is SW of region z.
   This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
   
3) We need to find all possible relations between region x and region z.

From (1) and (2), we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x is NW of y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y is SW of z)

Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
This simplifies to: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means region x is to the left of region z. 

Now let's look at the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x is NW of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y is SW of z)

We know that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but we can't directly compare infy(x) and infy(z) based on the given information.

Let's break down the possible cases for the y-coordinate relationship between x and z:

Case 1: infy(x) > supy(z)
This means x is above z, making the relation between x and z: NW.

Case 2: infy(x) ≤ supy(z) and supy(x) ≥ infy(z)
This means x and z overlap in the y-direction. Combined with the fact that x is to the left of z, the relation would be: W.

Case 3: supy(x) < infy(z)
This means x is below z. Combined with the fact that x is to the left of z, the relation would be: SW.

Actually, there's an issue with how I'm thinking about this. I need to be careful about the definition. Let me re-examine the definition for the cardinal directions.

For x to be NW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)

For y to be SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, I can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z.

Now, for the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x is NW of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y is SW of z)

This doesn't give me a direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z).

So, based on the x-coordinate relationship alone, x could be W, NW, or SW of z. It depends on how x and z relate in the y-direction.

But let me try to use the transitivity of the inequalities more carefully:

From x is NW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)

From y is SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

We know for sure that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This restricts the possible relations to: W, NW, and SW.

Additionally, from the y-coordinate information, we know that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). This doesn't directly tell us how infy(x) relates to infy(z).

Let's consider the possible cases:

Case 1: infy(x) > supy(z)
This means x is above z. Combined with the fact that x is to the left of z, the relation would be: NW.

Case 2: infy(x) ≤ supy(z) and supy(x) ≥ infy(z)
This means x and z overlap in the y-direction. Combined with the fact that x is to the left of z, the relation would be: W.

Case 3: supy(x) < infy(z)
This means x is below z. Combined with the fact that x is to the left of z, the relation would be: SW.

Actually, even this approach has a flaw. I'm trying to derive too much from the given information. Let's approach this differently:

From the given information:
- x is NW of y
- y is SW of z

We know that x is to the left of y, and y is to the left of z. Therefore, x is to the left of z.

We also know that x is above y, and y is below z. But this doesn't directly tell us the vertical relationship between x and z. x could be above, below, or at the same vertical position as z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (if x is above z)
- W (if x is at the same vertical position as z)
- SW (if x is below z)

However, I'm not fully confident in this conclusion. Let me verify:

From the definition, for region x to be NW of region y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x, or x is above y)

For region y to be SW of region z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining the left-right relations:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y SW z)
This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which confirms that x is to the left of z.

Now, for the top-bottom relations:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)

This doesn't give us a direct relation between the vertical positions of x and z. Without further information, x could be above, below, or at the same vertical position as z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NW (if x is above z)
- W (if x is at the same vertical position as z)
- SW (if x is below z)

To clarify, I should draw this out to verify:

If x is NW of y:
```
   x
      y
```

And y is SW of z:
```
      z
   y
```

Combining these:
```
   x
      z
   y
```
This would make x NW of z.

But it's also possible:
```
   x
   |
   y   z
```
Which would make x W of z.

Or even:
```
      z
   y
   |
   x
```
Which would make x SW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, and SW.

But, actually, let me think more carefully using the definitions. I believe there was an error in how I was interpreting the meaning of supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Let's be clear about the definitions:

For region x to be NW of region y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x, or x is above y)

For region y to be SW of region z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

The condition supy(y) ≤ infy(x) means that y is below x, or equivalently, x is above y. This is because the supremum of y's projection on the y-axis (the highest point of y) is less than or equal to the infimum of x's projection on the y-axis (the lowest point of x).

Similarly, supy(y) ≤ infy(z) means that y is below z.

Given these interpretations, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

I've already established that x is to the left of z. Now, for the vertical relationship, we know:
- x is above y
- y is below z

But this doesn't directly tell us how x and z are related vertically. They could be at any vertical position relative to each other.

So, indeed, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, and SW. This is because x is definitely to the left of z, but it could be above, below, or at the same level as z based on the given information.

Actually, let me go through our possible cases again. I want to make sure I'm reasoning correctly.

We have:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the relation between x and z, let's evaluate:

For x to be N of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From the given conditions, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z). This implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement for x to be N of z (which would require x to be vertically aligned with z). So, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be NE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Again, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement for x to be NE of z (which would require x to be to the right of z). So, x cannot be NE of z.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

This also contradicts the fact that x is to the left of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Again, this contradicts the fact that x is to the left of z. So, x cannot be SE of z.

For x to be S of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This contradicts the fact that x is to the left of z. So, x cannot be S of z.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

The first condition is satisfied since we know x is to the left of z. For the second condition, we need to determine if x is below z. From the given conditions, we know that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(x) and infy(z). So, x could be SW of z, but we need additional information to confirm.

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

The first condition is satisfied. The second condition requires x and z to overlap in the y-direction. Again, from the given conditions, we can't definitively say if this is the case. So, x could be W of z.

For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The first condition is satisfied. For the second condition, we need to know if z is below x (or x is above z). From the given, we can't determine this directly. So, x could be NW of z.

Checking for B (bounding box):
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

But we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement for x to be bound by z. So, x cannot be B of z.

Let's double check the case of x SW of z and x W of z again. I don't think I'm capturing all the constraints correctly.

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

For the first condition, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z). This implies supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the first condition is satisfied.

For the second condition, we need to determine if x is below z. From the given, we know that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between x and z in the y-direction. So, without additional information, we can't say for sure if x is SW of z.

Similarly, for x to be W of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x and z overlap in the y-direction)

The first condition is satisfied. For the second condition, again, we don't have enough information from the given to determine if x and z overlap in the y-direction.

And for x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

The first condition is satisfied. For the second condition, we need to determine if x is above z. From the given, we know that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between x and z in the y-direction.

So, for all of the cardinal directions: x NW, W, or SW of z. In all these cases, we've confirmed that the first condition (x is to the left of z) is satisfied, but we don't have enough information to definitively say which of these three it is.

Let's see if we can rationalize this a different way: by considering the possible vertical positions of x and z. I know for sure that x is to the left of z from the aforementioned transitive inequalities.

Now, then I know:
- x is above y (from the NW relation)
- y is below z (from the SW relation)

Let's consider some possibilities. Imagine a vertical comparison of the heights:

1. If the heights from highest to lowest are x, z, y. In this case, x would be NW of z.
2. If the heights from highest to lowest are z, x, y. In this case, x would be SW of z.
3. If x and z are at the same height, but both are above y, then x would be W of z.

Okay, one last thing to consider: in my enumeration of possible relations, I've only considered the primitive relations (like NW, W, SW, etc.). But there's also the possibility of multi-tile relations. For example, if x shares both the W and NW tiles of z, then the relation between x and z would be W:NW. To see if this is possible I'd need to check if the 2nd part of our definition allows for 2 adjacent regions that can be in multi-tile relations: regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG. But this doesn't seem to be the case here. So I think my enumeration of primitive relations is correct.

Actually I realize I should be more careful with the definitions. It says we're supposed to consider regions in REG, which are homeomorphic to closed unit disks. These are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries.

So the relations between regions can only be the primitive relations: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and B.

For x to be NW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x, or x is above y)

For y to be SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This confirms that x is to the left of z.

For the vertical relationship between x and z, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

But this doesn't directly tell us how x and z relate vertically. They could be at any vertical position relative to each other.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, and SW. This is because x is definitely to the left of z, but it could be above, below, or at the same level as z based on the given information.

OK so actually I think the possible answer set is: NW, W, SW, and that's it. Let me double check by making sure the other 6 cardinal directions are not possible, and I think I've already verified this:

1. N: No, because x is to the left of z.
2. NE: No, because x is to the left of z.
3. E: No, because x is to the left of z.
4. SE: No, because x is to the left of z.
5. S: No, because x is to the left of z.
6. B: No, because a region within the bounding box of another region can't be to the left of it. Since x is to the left of z, it can't be within the bounding box of z.

So the final answer is: NW, W, SW.

Actually, let's define the primitives once more to double check. I don't think I am mapping the problem to the list of definitions correctly. Let me check the exact algebraic formulations again:

According to the problem statement, the single-tile cardinal direction relations are defined as follows:

For a region a and a reference region b:

1. a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
2. a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
3. a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
4. a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
5. a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
6. a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
7. a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
8. a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
9. a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Okay, so we could reformulate the problem statement as follows:

1. x NW y means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)

2. y SW z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining the inequalities, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z). (x is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

But this doesn't directly relate the vertical positions of x and z. Let me try to derive it another way.

Wait, if we have the situations:
- Region x is NW of region y. This means that x is to the left of and above y. Algebraically, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- Region y is SW of region z. This means that y is to the left of and below z. Algebraically, supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

The horizontal relationships can be combined to get supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. But we can't say anything definitive about the vertical relationship between x and z. So, region x can be to the left of and below z (SW), to the left of and at the same vertical level as z (W), or to the left of and above z (NW).

Actually, it seems like I'm getting confused by the naming conventions. In the provided context:
- NW means above and to the left
- SW means below and to the left
- W means to the left and at the same vertical level
- and so on.

Given the algebraic formulations, let's reanalyze:

1. If x is NW of z, then:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

From the givens, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the first condition is satisfied. But for the second condition, we don't have any direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) from the given conditions. So, x could be NW of z, but we need more information to be sure.

2. If x is W of z, then:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x and z overlap in the y-direction)

Again, the first condition is satisfied, but for the second condition, we don't have enough information.

3. If x is SW of z, then:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

Again, the first condition is satisfied. As for the second condition, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from the given conditions.

All that I can deduce from the given conditions is that x is to the left of z. The vertical relationship cannot be definitively determined.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused again. Let me try to break down the problem once more:

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y. This means that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- Region y is SW of region z. This means that supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

From these conditions, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z). But we can't determine a direct vertical relationship between x and z. However, we know that x is above y and y is below z. Given this, we have the following possibilities:

1. x is above z (NW relation in the context): There's no contradiction here. It's possible for x to be above both y and z.
2. x and z are at the same vertical level (W relation in the context): Again, no contradiction. x can be above y while z can be above y as well, with x and z being at the same level.
3. x is below z (SW relation in the context): This is also possible. y can be below both x and z, with x being below z.

So, without any additional information, we can't rule out any of these possibilities.

Let me sketch some geometrical configurations to visualize:

For x NW of z:
```
x       z
    y
```

For x W of z:
```
x   z
    y
```

For x SW of z:
```
    z
x
    y
```

All of these configurations satisfy the given conditions. That's why the answer is: NW, W, and SW.

In other words, if all we know is:
- Region x is NW of region y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- Region y is SW of region z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

Then the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, and SW. This is because x is definitely to the left of z (derived from the above conditions), but the vertical relationship can be any of the three (x above z, x at the same level as z, or x below z).

Actually this could easily be answered in a more rigorous way, as follows. Let's consider all 9 possible cardinal directions and rule out which can and can't be the relation between z and x.

1. Let's check if x B z is possible.
   For this, we need:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   
   But we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely to the left of z. This contradicts the condition for x B z. Therefore, x cannot be inside the bounding box of z.

2. Let's check if x S z is possible.
   For this, we need:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   
   But again, since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the third condition above is contradicted. Therefore, x cannot be S of z.

3. Let's check if x SE z is possible.
   For this, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   
   But we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This contradicts the condition for x to be to the right of z. Therefore, x cannot be SE of z.

4. Let's check if x E z is possible.
   For this, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   
   Again, since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition for x to be to the right of z is contradicted. Therefore, x cannot be E of z.

5. Let's check if x NE z is possible.
   For this, we need:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   
   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the condition for x to be to the right of z is contradicted. Therefore, x cannot be NE of z.

6. Let's check if x N z is possible.
   For this, we need:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   
   But since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the third condition above is contradicted. Therefore, x cannot be N of z.

7. Let's check if x NW z is possible.
   For this, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   
   We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the first condition is satisfied. For the second condition, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) from the given conditions. However, given that x is above y and y is below z, it's possible for x to be above z as well. Therefore, x can be NW of z.

8. Let's check if x W z is possible.
   For this, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   
   We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the first condition is satisfied. For the second and third conditions, we don't have direct relationships from the given. But it's possible for x and z to overlap in the y-direction while x is above y and y is below z. Therefore, x can be W of z.

9. Let's check if x SW z is possible.
   For this, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   
   We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the first condition is satisfied. For the second condition, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from the given conditions. However, even though x is above y and y is below z, it's still possible for x to be below z. Therefore, x can be SW of z.

In summary, from the given conditions:
- x can be NW of z.
- x can be W of z.
- x can be SW of z.
- x cannot be N, NE, E, SE, S, or B of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, and SW.

To make sure that I'm interpreting the problem definition correctly, let's revisit the definition of the cardinal directions:

- NW means the region is above and to the left of the reference region.
- W means the region is to the left of and overlaps vertically with the reference region.
- SW means the region is below and to the left of the reference region.

The possible relations that I have ruled in (NW, W, SW) all have x to the left of z, which is consistent with the derivation that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). The vertical relationship between x and z can be any of the three (x above z, x vertically overlapping with z, or x below z), which is consistent with the given constraints.

So the answer is: NW, W, SW.

Actually, OK, let's just double check each of these just to be doubly sure.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

We know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) from the given conditions. For the second condition, imagine if z is below x. This is consistent with the given conditions because x is above y (from x NW y) and y is below z (from y SW z), but it's still possible for x to be above z. So, x NW z is a possibility.

It could also be that z is above x, in which case x would be SW of z. This is also consistent with the given conditions because even though x is above y and y is below z, it's possible for x to be below z.

And finally, z and x could be at the same vertical level, which would make x W of z.

In all three cases:
- x is to the left of z (derived from the given conditions).
- The vertical relationship between x and z could be any of the three.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, and SW.

Alright, my answer the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, and SW.

Yeah, actually I know that NW, W, and SW must all be options because of the following. In our enumeration of possible relations, we've only considered the primitive relations (like NW, W, SW, etc.). But then again we could also check the second condition for multi-tile relations: regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG. But this restriction doesn't actually apply in our problem. Because we're asked to find the possible relations between x and z.

As a final check, let me go through all the relations and think about when they could hold:

For x to be (the relation of) B (z):
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
But I know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). If x is to the left of z, then it isn't bounded by z. So B is not an option.

For x to be (the relation of) S (z):
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
But I know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then at the very most, x is to the left of z. So we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) to have a vertical relation, but that's not possible of supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So S is not an option.

For x to be (the relation of) SW (z):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
From the given conditions, I know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So x is definitely to the left of z. What about the vertical relationship? I know that x is above y (from x NW y) and y is below z (from y SW z), but that doesn't give me a direct relationship between x and z in the vertical direction. So, x could be below z, which would make x SW of z. Unless I misunderstand the relations.

For x to be (the relation of) W (z):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
I know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is definitely to the left of z. For the vertical relationship, again, I don't have a direct relationship between x and z. However, it's possible for x and z to overlap in the vertical direction, which would make x W of z.

For x to be (the relation of) NW (z):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
I know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x is definitely to the left of z. For the vertical relationship, I know that x is above y (from x NW y) and y is below z (from y SW z), but that doesn't give me a direct relationship between x and z. However, it's possible for x to be above z, which would make x NW of z.

For x to be (the relation of) N (z):
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
But I know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then at the very most, x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement for x to be vertically aligned with z. So, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be (the relation of) NE (z):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
But I know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement for x to be to the right of z. So, x cannot be NE of z.

For x to be (the relation of) E (z):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
But I know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement for x to be to the right of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be (the relation of) SE (z):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
But I know that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the left of z. This contradicts the requirement for x to be to the right of z. So, x cannot be SE of z.

In summary, from the check above, the relations NW, W, and SW are possible between x and z, while the other relations (B, S, N, NE, E, SE) are not possible.

Therefore, the answer is: NW, W, SW.

So to recap:

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y (meaning x is to the left of and above y)
- Region y is SW of region z (meaning y is to the left of and below z)

From these, we can deduce that x is to the left of z. But the vertical relationship between x and z can be any of the three (x above z, x at the same level as z, or x below z).

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, and SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

First, let's analyze what we know for sure:
- If x is NW of y, then x is to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y)) and above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- If y is SW of z, then y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)) and below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

From these conditions, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x must be to the left of z

However, for the vertical relationship between x and z, we know that:
- x is above y (from x NW y)
- y is below z (from y SW z)

This doesn't give us a definitive vertical relationship between x and z. There are three possibilities:
1. x could be above z (NW relation)
2. x could be at the same vertical level as z (W relation)
3. x could be below z (SW relation)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, SW
