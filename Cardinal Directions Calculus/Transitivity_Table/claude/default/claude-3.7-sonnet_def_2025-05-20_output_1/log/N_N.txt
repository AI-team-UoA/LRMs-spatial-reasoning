PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This question is asking about the transitivity of cardinal direction relations. Let's analyze step by step:

Given information:
- Region x is N of region y, meaning x is in the North of y.
- Region y is N of region z, meaning y is in the North of z.

We need to determine what cardinal direction relation(s) could exist between region x and region z.

From the definition I'm given:
- x N y means that supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y N z means that supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, we have:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is to the North of y)
2. supy(z) <= infy(y)  (y is to the North of z)

From 1 and 2, by transitivity of <= relation, we can say: 
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)  
So, supy(z) <= infy(x)  (This is one condition for x to be North of z)

For the East-West relation, we have:
3. infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x is to the North of y)
4. infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y is to the North of z)

From 3 and 4, we can deduce that infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x).
Also, from 3 and 4, we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), meaning supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (North condition)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (Bounded in East-West direction)

These conditions match the definition of x N z. Therefore, by transitivity, if x is North of y and y is North of z, then x is North of z.

But let me think again to see if there could be other possible relations between x and z given the constraints...

Let's think about the positions graphically. If x is North of y and y is North of z, then x is above y, and y is above z. This means x must be above z, which means x is in the North direction of z.

But wait, I need to be careful here. The definition of North (N) also constrains the bounds in the East-West direction, as seen in points 3 and 4 above.

Let's reconsider the East-West bounds. For x N y, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). This means the East-West extent of x must be contained within the East-West extent of y.

Similarly, for y N z, the East-West extent of y must be contained within the East-West extent of z.

This means the East-West extent of x must be contained within the East-West extent of z, which is one of the conditions for x N z.

So, I still believe the only possible relation between x and z is x N z.

However, let me be more careful and consider all the constraints...

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x's East-West extent is contained within y's)

For y N z, we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)  (y is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y's East-West extent is contained within z's)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x)  (z's Western bound is to the left of or equal to x's Western bound)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(x) <= supx(z)  (z's Eastern bound is to the right of or equal to x's Eastern bound)

Now, let's check the conditions for x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z) ✓
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x's East-West extent is contained within z's) ✓

So, the conditions for x N z are satisfied. But let's triple-check by considering other possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z) ✓
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the East of z) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition supx(x) <= supx(z))

For x NW z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z) ✓
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the West of z) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition infx(z) <= infx(x))

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the East of z) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition supx(x) <= supx(z))
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x's North-South extent is contained within z's)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the West of z) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition infx(z) <= infx(x))
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x's North-South extent is contained within z's)

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)  (x is below z) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x))
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x's East-West extent is contained within z's)

For x SE z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)  (x is below z) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x))
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the East of z) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition supx(x) <= supx(z))

For x SW z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)  (x is below z) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x))
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the West of z) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition infx(z) <= infx(x))

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x's East-West extent is contained within z's) ✓
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (x's North-South extent is contained within z's) ✗ (contradicts the derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x))

I've checked all nine cardinal direction relations, and the only one that is consistent with the derived conditions is x N z.

Hmm, I'm not fully confident yet, so let me double check.

Actually, let me think slightly differently. Let's place z at the center or origin. Then, by definition, y is in the North area of z, and x is in the North area of y. Given these constraints, where could x be with respect to z?

x is North of y, so it's in the region above y. Since y is in the North of z, and x is in the North of y, x must be in the North of z as well. This is because the North region of y is a subset of the North region of z, given the constraints.

I'm confident now. If region x is N of region y, and region y is N of region z, then the possible relation between region x and region z is only N. But let me triple check the constraint anyway.

Actually this is too constrainted. I think x could be NE or NW of z depending on the exact positions. Let me revisit the constraints.

For x N y, one of the constraints is infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), which means x's East-West extent is contained within y's.
For y N z, one of the constraints is infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which means y's East-West extent is contained within z's.

Now, it follows that if x's East-West extent is contained within y's, and y's is contained within z's, then x's is also contained within z's. That's the constraint for the North relation in terms of the East-West bounds.

So, the relation between x and z satisfies the North constraint for East-West bounds, as I said.

But, there might be other relations as well. Let's see...

Actually, wait. Let me draw it out more clearly.

Given:
- x is North of y
- y is North of z

Let's denote the the bounding box of each region as [(infx, infy), (supx, supy)].

For y, the bounding box is [(infx(y), infy(y)), (supx(y), supy(y))].
For z, the bounding box is [(infx(z), infy(z)), (supx(z), supy(z))].
For x, the bounding box is [(infx(x), infy(x)), (supx(x), supy(x))].

From the relation x N y:
1. supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From the relation y N z:
4. supy(z) <= infy(y)
5. infx(z) <= infx(y)
6. supx(y) <= supx(z)

From 1 and 4, we can deduce that supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is North of z in terms of the North-South extent.

From 2 and 5, we can deduce that infx(z) <= infx(x). This gives us a constraint for infx.

From 3 and 6, we can deduce that supx(x) <= supx(z). This gives us a constraint for supx.

So, from x N y and y N z, we have deduced the following constraints for the relation between x and z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is North of z in terms of the North-South extent)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)  (Constraint for infx)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)  (Constraint for supx)

Now, the question is, which cardinal direction relation(s) satisfy these constraints?

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  ✓
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  ✓

For x NE z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  ✓
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  ✗ (This would imply supx(z) <= infx(x), which doesn't follow from our deduced constraints, we only have supx(x) <= supx(z))

For x NW z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  ✓
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  ✗ (This would imply supx(x) <= infx(z), which doesn't follow from our deduced constraints, we only have infx(z) <= infx(x))

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  ✗ (As reasoned above for NE)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (Not given by our constraints)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  ✗ (As reasoned above for NW)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  (Not given by our constraints)

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)  ✗ (This would imply supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts our deduced constraint that supy(z) <= infy(x))
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  ✓

For x SE z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)  ✗ (As reasoned above for S)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  ✗ (As reasoned above for NE)

For x SW z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)  ✗ (As reasoned above for S)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  ✗ (As reasoned above for NW)

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  ✓
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)  ✗ (Contradicts our deduced constraint that supy(z) <= infy(x))

Based on the analysis, only the relation x N z satisfies all the constraints we've deduced.

Therefore, if region x is N of region y, and region y is N of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is x N z.

But actually, I need to double check my thinking once more. Maybe I'm being too strict somewhere. 

For the NE relation, I said supx(z) <= infx(x) doesn't follow from our constraints. Let's check this.

For x N y, one of the constraints is: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
For y N z, one of the constraints is: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

From these, we deduced: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

For x NE z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x). But from our deduced constraints, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(x) is to the right or equal to infx(z). The NE relation requires that supx(z) is to the left of infx(x), meaning the entire E-W extent of z is to the left of the E-W extent of x. But this isn't guaranteed by our deduced constraints, as we only know that the left boundary of x is to the right or equal to the left boundary of z. The right boundary of z could still be to the right of the left boundary of x. So, the NE relation isn't guaranteed.

Similar reasoning applies to the other cardinal direction relations. The constraints we've deduced only guarantee the N relation between x and z.

Actually, let's be super-explicit. 

For x N y:
- x is above y, with supy(y) <= infy(x)
- x's East-West extent is constrained within y's, with infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y N z:
- y is above z, with supy(z) <= infy(y)
- y's East-West extent is constrained within z's, with infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

From these, we deduced:
- x is above z, with supy(z) <= infy(x)
- x's East-West extent is constrained within z's, with infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now, for the various cardinal direction relations:

For x N z:
- x is above z, with supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓
- x's East-West extent is constrained within z's, with infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) ✓

For x NE z:
- x is above z, with supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓
- x is entirely to the East of z, with supx(z) <= infx(x) ❓ (Not guaranteed by our deduced constraints)

For x NW z:
- x is above z, with supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓
- x is entirely to the West of z, with supx(x) <= infx(z) ❓ (Not guaranteed by our deduced constraints)

For x E z:
- x is entirely to the East of z, with supx(z) <= infx(x) ❓ (Not guaranteed by our deduced constraints)
- x's North-South extent is constrained within z's, with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) ❓ (Not guaranteed by our deduced constraints)

For x W z:
- x is entirely to the West of z, with supx(x) <= infx(z) ❓ (Not guaranteed by our deduced constraints)
- x's North-South extent is constrained within z's, with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) ❓ (Not guaranteed by our deduced constraints)

For x S z:
- x is below z, with supy(x) <= infy(z) ❓ (Contradicts our deduced constraint that x is above z)
- x's East-West extent is constrained within z's, with infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) ✓

For x SE z:
- x is below z, with supy(x) <= infy(z) ❓ (Contradicts our deduced constraint that x is above z)
- x is entirely to the East of z, with supx(z) <= infx(x) ❓ (Not guaranteed by our deduced constraints)

For x SW z:
- x is below z, with supy(x) <= infy(z) ❓ (Contradicts our deduced constraint that x is above z)
- x is entirely to the West of z, with supx(x) <= infx(z) ❓ (Not guaranteed by our deduced constraints)

For x B z:
- x's East-West extent is constrained within z's, with infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) ✓
- x's North-South extent is constrained within z's, with infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) ❓ (Contradicts our deduced constraint that x is above z)

But wait a second. 

I'm starting to think I might have been too quick to dismiss some of the possible relations. Let's think more about the geometry of the problem. We've deduced that x is North of z in terms of the North-South extent, and x's East-West extent is constrained within z's. 

Given that, it's indeed true that the only guaranteed relation between x and z based on the given constraints is N. The NE, NW, and other relations would require additional constraints that are not provided by the given relations. So, so far, I'm sticking with N as the only possible relation.

However, I should double-check the constraints I'm using from the definition.

Now, I've been considering the x N y relation as having the constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x's East-West extent is constrained within y's)

But the definition I've been given is:
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

So, my interpretation is correct. 

The constraints I deduced for x in relation to z are:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x's East-West extent is constrained within z's)

These exactly match the constraints for x N z.

Actually, let me double-check the definition of each cardinal direction again:

- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

From the constraints I deduced for x in relation to z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x's East-West extent is constrained within z's)

Matching these with the definitions:
- For x N z: Matches, as I've verified.
- For x NE z: We'd additionally need supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is strictly to the East of z. But our deduced constraints only give us infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right or equal to the left boundary of z), which doesn't guarantee that x is strictly to the East of z.
- For x NW z: We'd additionally need supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the West of z. But our deduced constraints give us supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left or equal to the right boundary of z), which doesn't guarantee that x is strictly to the West of z.
- For the other relations, there's a similar mismatch or outright contradiction with our deduced constraints.

So, based on the given constraints, the only guaranteed relation between x and z is x N z.

Actually, I think I've confirmed x N z as the only guaranteed relation, but a question is arising. The original question asked for what *could* be the possible relations between x and z. So we should think about what is possible, not just what is guaranteed. 

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x's East-West extent is constrained within y's)

For y N z, we have:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)  (y is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y's East-West extent is constrained within z's)

From these, we've deduced that:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x's East-West extent is constrained within z's)

These constraints guarantee the N relation between x and z. But, are there other possible relations that could occur in specific cases but might not be guaranteed in all cases?

For x NE z:
We'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is strictly to the East of z. But our deduced constraints only give us infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right or equal to the left boundary of z), which doesn't guarantee that x is strictly to the East of z. But it also doesn't prohibit it. If infx(x) > supx(z), then x would be in the NE of z.

For x NW z:
We'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is strictly to the West of z. But our deduced constraints give us supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left or equal to the right boundary of z), which doesn't guarantee that x is strictly to the West of z. But, similar to the NE case, it doesn't prohibit it. If supx(x) < infx(z), then x would be in the NW of z.

Hmm, I see a pattern. The deduced constraints don't guarantee that x is in the NE or NW of z, but they don't rule it out either. The other cardinal directions (E, W, S, SE, SW, and B) are ruled out by the deduced constraints because they contradict the constraint that x is North of z.

So, it's possible that x could be in the N, NE, or NW of z, depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z. However, z couldn't be B, S, SE, E, SW, W of z.

But wait, I think the constraints do rule out NE and NW. Let's double-check.

For x N y, one of the constraints is:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x's East-West extent is constrained within y's)

For y N z, one of the constraints is:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y's East-West extent is constrained within z's)

From these, I deduced:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x's East-West extent is constrained within z's)

For x NE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is strictly to the East of z)

But from our deduced constraints, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

If we consider these two conditions:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is strictly to the East of z for the NE relation)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)  (from our deduced constraints)

We get supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), which implies supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z). But this doesn't make sense for a region in REG, because it would be a line or a point, not a region. So, there's a contradiction here, and x cannot be in the NE of z.

I'll double check the NW case.

For x NW z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is strictly to the West of z)

But from our deduced constraints, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

If we consider these two conditions:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is strictly to the West of z for the NW relation)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)  (from our deduced constraints)

We get supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), which implies supx(x) <= infx(x). But for a region in REG, infx(x) should be less than or equal to supx(x), not the other way around. So, there's a contradiction here as well, and x cannot be in the NW of z.

So, both the NE and NW relations are ruled out by the deduced constraints. The only possible relation between x and z given the constraints is x N z.

Let me double check this one more time.

Actually I think I made an error in reasoning. Let me re-examine:

For x N y, one of the constraints is:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)  (x's East-West extent is constrained within y's)

For y N z, one of the constraints is:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)  (y's East-West extent is constrained within z's)

From these, I deduced:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x's East-West extent is constrained within z's)

Let's consider the possibility of x being NE of z. For x NE z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is strictly to the East of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is strictly to the North of z)

The second condition is met (we derived that x is to the North of z). But the first condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), doesn't seem compatible with our deduced constraint supx(x) <= supx(z). Why? Because if supx(z) <= infx(x), then by definition of a region in REG, infx(x) <= supx(x). So, we'd have supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z). This would mean supx(z) = infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z), which is only possible for a degenerate region, i.e. x and z are vertical lines.

Since we're considering regions in REG (which are not degenetr), this is a contradiction. Hence, x cannot be NE of z.

Similarly, for x NW z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is strictly to the West of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is strictly to the North of z)

The second condition is met. But the first condition, supx(x) <= infx(z), doesn't seem compatible with our deduced constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then by definition, infx(x) <= supx(x). Combining, we'd have infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(z) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction for regions in REG (it would imply x and z are vertical lines).

Hence, x cannot be NW of z.

So, I can confirm that if region x is N of region y, and region y is N of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is x N z.

Actually, wait. Now I'm thinking I've been defining "single-tile cardinal direction relation" in the wrong way.

The definition I was using is that of single-tile cardinal directions. But these constraints on the infimum and supremum are for a single tile in a direction. But in general, we can have a region "a" split across multiple tiles, with the relation expressed as R1:...:Rk.

So if a region "a" has parts in both the NE and N tiles relative to region "b", the relation would be expressed as a NE:N b.

In the context of the problem, we've established that the region x is N of region z. But I'm not clear if the question is asking for the single-tile relation or the general relation where a region can be in multiple tiles. If it's the latter, then I believe my answer is correct: x is N of z.

Actually, given the preamble to the question, I believe the question is about single-tile cardinal direction relations, and the only possible relation between x and z is N, as I've established.

Actually, one last time, let me draw this out. Start with a very simple drawing. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate system.

Let z be a square region from (0, 0) to (10, 10).

Now, y is N of z, so y is a square region from (2, 12) to (8, 18). Note that the East-West extent of y is within the East-West extent of z.

Finally, x is N of y, so x is a square region from (3, 20) to (7, 24). Note that the East-West extent of x is within the East-West extent of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is above z, so it is North in terms of the North-South extent.
- x's East-West extent is from 3 to 7, which is contained within z's East-West extent of 0 to 10. So, in terms of the East-West extent, x is constrained within z.

This matches the definition of x N z.

There's no position where x could be in the NE or NW of z, because the constraints force the East-West extent of x to be within the East-West extent of y, which in turn is within the East-West extent of z. So, x's East-West extent is always within z's, ruling out the NE and NW relations.

I'm confident in my answer. If region x is N of region y, and region y is N of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is x N z.

Wait, I see a flaw in the understanding of the original problem. Let me double-check.

We're told:
- Region x is N of region y.
- Region y is N of region z.

We've been asked which could be the possible relations between region x and region z.

I've concluded that the only possible relation between region x and region z is x N z. The question is looking for all the possible cardinal direction relations that could be formed, not which ones are uniquely determined.

Given the constraints, the only relation that can exist between x and z is the North (N) relation. The NE, NW, and other relations are ruled out by the constraints. I've demonstrated this through logical deduction, showing that the constraints from the North relation would lead to contradictions in the NE, NW, and other cases.

I think the final answer is: N

just to double check. let me consider a few examples:

Consider z as a square region from (0, 0) to (10, 10).

Example 1:
- y is a square region from (2, 12) to (8, 18).
- x is a square region from (3, 20) to (7, 24).
Relation: x N z.

Example 2:
- y is a square region from (1, 12) to (9, 18).
- x is a square region from (2, 20) to (8, 24).
Relation: x N z.

Example 3:
- y is a square region from (3, 12) to (7, 18).
- x is a square region from (4, 20) to (6, 24).
Relation: x N z.

So, from the examples, I can see that as long as x is North of y and y is North of z, and we maintain the East-West extent constraints, the only relation that is possible between x and z is the North relation.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: N.

Actually I need to read the problem definition one more time. If region x is N of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z? 

I think I was right. The North relation is a single-tile cardinal direction. Given the constraints, the only possible single-tile cardinal direction relation between x and z is x N z. I've proven this by showing that x must be North of z in terms of the North-South extent, and x's East-West extent must be contained within z's, which is the definition of the North relation.

So, the answer to the question is: N.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions provided, I'll analyze what relation(s) could exist between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the definition of the N (North) relation:
- For x N y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- For y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can deduce:
1. supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

These deduced constraints exactly match the definition for the N relation between x and z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is North of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's East-West extent is contained within z's)

No other cardinal direction relation is possible because:
- NE and E would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x), contradicting supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- NW and W would require supx(x) ≤ infx(z), contradicting infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- S, SE, and SW would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), contradicting supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- B would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), contradicting supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: N
