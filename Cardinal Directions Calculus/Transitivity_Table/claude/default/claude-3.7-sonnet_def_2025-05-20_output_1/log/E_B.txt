PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the problem:
- x is E of y
- y is B of z

We need to find all possible relations between x and z.

Let's recall what the relations mean:
- E (East): x is to the east of y if supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- B (Bounding box): y is in the bounding box of z if infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

So what do we know?
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is E of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x is E of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x is E of y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y is B of z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is B of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (y is B of z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is B of z)

Now, let's try to deduce the relation between x and z.

Based on these constraints, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

This gives us: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
So, infx(z) <= infx(x), which suggests that x is to the east of the western boundary of z.

Also, 
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
So, it's possible that supx(x) <= supx(z) or supx(z) <= supx(x).

For the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

This gives us: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
So, infy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of the southern boundary of z.

Also, 
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

This gives us: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
So, supy(x) <= supy(z), which means x is to the south of the northern boundary of z.

Let's reason about the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. East (E): If supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.
   - We've already deduced that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible, but not guaranteed. It depends on the specific regions.
   - So, x can be E of z.

2. North East (NE): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NE of z.
   - We've deduced that supy(x) <= supy(z), which means infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the condition for NE.
   - So, x cannot be NE of z.

3. South East (SE): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z.
   - We've deduced that infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition for SE.
   - So, x cannot be SE of z.

4. North (N): If supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is N of z.
   - We've deduced that supy(x) <= supy(z), which means infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the condition for N.
   - So, x cannot be N of z.

5. South (S): If supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is S of z.
   - We've deduced that infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition for S.
   - So, x cannot be S of z.

6. North West (NW): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NW of z.
   - We've deduced that infx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the condition for NW.
   - So, x cannot be NW of z.

7. West (W): If supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
   - We've deduced that infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition for W.
   - So, x cannot be W of z.

8. South West (SW): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SW of z.
   - We've deduced that infx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the conditions for SW.
   - So, x cannot be SW of z.

9. Bounding Box (B): If infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is B of z.
   - We've deduced that infx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - The only uncertainty is whether supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - If supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is B of z.

10. North East with overlap in the y-dimension (NE:E): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z) <= supy(x), then x is NE:E of z.
    - We've deduced that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
    - The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible, but not guaranteed.
    - The condition supy(z) <= supy(x) contradicts our deduction that supy(x) <= supy(z).
    - So, x cannot be NE:E of z.

But I think I'm making this too complicated. Let's revisit the original problem:

- x is E of y
- y is B of z

Since y is B of z, y is completely inside z's bounding box. The eastern border of y (supx(y)) is to the west of or equal to the eastern border of z (supx(z)). Similarly, the western border of y (infx(y)) is to the east of or equal to the western border of z (infx(z)).

Now, since x is E of y, the western border of x (infx(x)) is to the east of or equal to the eastern border of y (supx(y)). Combined with the fact that supx(y) <= supx(z), we might have infx(x) > supx(z), in which case x is E of z. Alternatively, we might have infx(x) <= supx(z), in which case x could overlap with z in the x-dimension, leading to NE, E, or SE relations.

Similarly, for the y-dimension, since y is B of z, the southern border of y (infy(y)) is to the north of or equal to the southern border of z (infy(z)), and the northern border of y (supy(y)) is to the south of or equal to the northern border of z (supy(z)).

Since x is E of y, the southern border of x (infy(x)) is to the north of or equal to the southern border of y (infy(y)), and the northern border of x (supy(x)) is to the south of or equal to the northern border of y (supy(y)). Combined with the facts about y and z, we get infy(x) >= infy(y) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).

Hmm, this is still a bit complex. Let me try to draw out the possible configurations:

1. x is E of z: This happens when the western border of x is to the east of the eastern border of z.
2. x is NE of z: This happens when the western border of x is to the east of the eastern border of z, and the southern border of x is to the north of the northern border of z.
3. x is SE of z: This happens when the western border of x is to the east of the eastern border of z, and the northern border of x is to the south of the southern border of z.

But wait, we've already deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which means x is within the y-extent of z. This rules out the NE and SE relations.

Additionally, x could be B of z if it's completely inside z's bounding box. This happens when infx(x) >= infx(z), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(x) >= infy(z), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've already deduced the last two conditions. The first two conditions depend on the specific regions.

Actually, I think I'm still approaching this too complexly. Let's reason more directly:

Given:
- x is E of y
- y is B of z

Let's think step by step:

1. If y is B of z, then z's bounding box completely contains y.
2. If x is E of y, then x is to the east of y.
3. Since z contains y, and x is to the east of y, x can be to the east of z, or it can overlap with z in the east.
4. In terms of the y-coordinate, since y is within z, and x is constrained in its y-extent by y, x must also be within the y-extent of z.

Let's enumerate the possible relations:

1. If x is entirely to the east of z, then x is E of z.
2. If x overlaps with z in the east, and x is within the y-extent of z, then x could be B of z or E of z, depending on whether x goes beyond the eastern boundary of z.

But wait, we need to be more precise. If x is E of y, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (the eastern boundary of y is to the west of the western boundary of x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the southern boundary of y is to the south of or at the same position as the southern boundary of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the northern boundary of x is to the south of or at the same position as the northern boundary of y)

And if y is B of z, then:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (the western boundary of z is to the west of or at the same position as the western boundary of y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (the eastern boundary of y is to the east of or at the same position as the eastern boundary of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (the southern boundary of z is to the south of or at the same position as the southern boundary of y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (the northern boundary of y is to the north of or at the same position as the northern boundary of z)

Combining these:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

This gives us: infx(x) >= supx(y) <= supx(z)
But this doesn't tell us the relation between infx(x) and supx(z), which is crucial for determining if x is E of z.

Also, 
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

This gives us: infy(x) >= infy(y) >= infy(z)
So, infy(x) >= infy(z).

And,
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

This gives us: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
So, supy(x) <= supy(z).

Alright, I've clarified that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z:

1. E (East): x is E of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied.
   - The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is not guaranteed. It depends on the specific regions.
   - So, x can be E of z.

2. B (Bounding Box): x is B of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied.
   - The x-conditions are not guaranteed. They depend on the specific regions.
   - So, x can be B of z.

3. North East (NE): x is NE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've deduced that supy(x) <= supy(z), which means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the condition for NE.
   - So, x cannot be NE of z.

4. South East (SE): x is SE of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z), which means supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(z). This contradicts the condition for SE.
   - So, x cannot be SE of z.

5. North (N): x is N of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've deduced that supy(x) <= supy(z), which means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the condition for N.
   - So, x cannot be N of z.

6. South (S): x is S of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z), which means supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(z). This contradicts the condition for S.
   - So, x cannot be S of z.

7. North West (NW): x is NW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've deduced that supy(x) <= supy(z), which means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the condition for NW.
   - So, x cannot be NW of z.

8. West (W): x is W of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've deduced that supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z), which means infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This contradicts the condition for W.
   - So, x cannot be W of z.

9. South West (SW): x is SW of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've deduced that infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x) and infy(x) >= infy(z), which contradicts both conditions for SW.
   - So, x cannot be SW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are E (East) and B (Bounding Box).

Hmm, but let's clarify about E and B. If region x is East of region y, and region y is B (bounded) by region z, then is it possible for region x to be B (bounded) by region z?

We need to ensure that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). 

From x E y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). 
From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

So, we know that infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This means infx(z) < infx(x), which is consistent with the condition for B.

For the other x-condition for B, we need to check if supx(x) <= supx(z). However, from the given constraints, we can't determine this definitively. It's possible that supx(x) > supx(z) (in which case x is not B of z) or supx(x) <= supx(z) (in which case x could be B of z).

Similarly, for the E relation, we need to ensure that supx(z) <= infx(x). From the constraints, we know that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This means supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z)). If infx(x) < supx(z), then supx(y) <= infx(x). If supx(z) < infx(x), then supx(y) <= supx(z). Thus, both cases are consistent with the given constraints, so x can be E of z.

Alright, so taking stock:
- E (East) is possible.
- B (Bounding Box) is possible.
- N (North), NE (North East), NW (North West) are not possible because we've deduced that supy(x) <= supy(z).
- S (South), SE (South East), SW (South West) are not possible because we've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z).
- W (West) is not possible because we've deduced that infx(z) < infx(x).

Oh wait, I think I need to think of the multi-tile relations. Let me consider the different cardinal direction relations based on the 9-tile model:

I believe that if the conditions for both B and E are met, then the relation would be B:E. Similarly, if the conditions for other relations are met, we would have other composite relations.

But actually, based on the Cardinal direction relations definition I was given, I don't think we need to specify these multi-tile relations explicitly. The question asks for "which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" and we're asked to provide answers from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}.

Wait, actually the question is "which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?", which means x could have multiple possible relations with z depending on the specific configurations of x, y, and z. So I need to list all possible relations from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}.

From my analysis, the possible relations between x and z are B and E.

Actually, let me think again.

x is E of y means the western boundary of x is to the east of the eastern boundary of y.
y is B of z means y is completely inside the bounding box of z.

So given that we know these two facts, what are the possible configurations for a, b, and c, and what are the possible relations between x and z?

Since y is B of z, the bounding box of y is inside the bounding box of z. Since x is E of y, x is to the east of y. However, the precise relation between x and z can vary based on the exact configurations.

Here are the possible configurations:

1. x is entirely to the east of z: In this case, the western boundary of x is to the east of the eastern boundary of z. This gives us the E relation.

2. The western boundary of x is to the west of the eastern boundary of z, but x is still entirely to the east of y: In this case, we need to check the y-coordinates to determine the relation.
   a. If x is entirely within the y-extent of z, then x is B (Bounding Box) of z.
   b. If the northern boundary of x is to the north of the northern boundary of z, then x is N, NE, or NW of z.
   c. If the southern boundary of x is to the south of the southern boundary of z, then x is S, SE, or SW of z.

But wait, from our earlier deductions, we know that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z). This means x is entirely within the y-extent of z, which rules out configurations 2b and 2c.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- E (East): If x is entirely to the east of z.
- B (Bounding Box): If x overlaps with z in the east and is entirely within the y-extent of z.

Hmm, there still might be a subtlety I'm missing.

Actually, I want to double check what B (Bounding Box) actually means.

According to the given definition:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, B means that region a is completely inside the bounding box of region b. It's not about "overlapping" as I incorrectly stated earlier.

Now, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. E (East): x is E of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied.
   - The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is not guaranteed, but possible for some configurations.
   - So, x can be E of z.

2. B (Bounding Box): x is B of z if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied.
   - The condition infx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied (from our earlier deduction).
   - The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is not guaranteed, but possible for some configurations.
   - So, x can be B of z.

The other relations (N, NE, SE, S, NW, W, SW) are ruled out by our deductions.

Actually, I just realized I've been making a mistake. From my earlier deductions, I said infx(z) < infx(x), which is consistent with the condition for B. But that's not entirely accurate.

From x E y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x). 
From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

From these, we can only deduce that infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't necessarily mean infx(z) < infx(x). It's possible that infx(z) = infx(y) = infx(x), in which case the western boundary of x is aligned with the western boundary of z.

So, let's reconsider the possible relations:

1. E (East): If the conditions supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) are met, then x is E of z.
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied.
   - The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is not guaranteed, but possible for some configurations.
   - So, x can be E of z.

2. B (Bounding Box): If the conditions infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) are met, then x is B of z.
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied.
   - The condition infx(z) <= infx(x) is possible based on our deductions, but not guaranteed.
   - The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is also not guaranteed, but possible for some configurations.
   - So, x can be B of z.

Hmm, but let's check the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) more carefully. We know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

The only thing we can deduce from these is that infx(z) <= infx(y), but we can't directly relate infx(z) and infx(x). If infx(y) < infx(x), then we might have infx(z) <= infx(y) < infx(x). But if infx(y) is much less than supx(y), then we might have infx(z) <= infx(y) << supx(y) <= infx(x), which doesn't give us a clear relation between infx(z) and infx(x).

So, it's possible that infx(z) > infx(x) for some configurations. If infx(z) > infx(x), then x is not B of z.

Actually that's not right... We have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

For y to be a valid region, we must have infx(y) < supx(y). So we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x)

Which gives us infx(z) < infx(x). This means the western boundary of x is to the east of the western boundary of z, which is consistent with the condition for B.

Let's then consider all 9 possible relations:

1. B (Bounding Box): If infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is B of z.
   - We've deduced that infx(z) < infx(x), infy(x) >= infy(z), and supy(x) <= supy(z), which satisfies three of the four conditions.
   - The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is not guaranteed, but possible for some configurations.
   - So, x can be B of z.

2. E (East): If supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied.
   - The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is not guaranteed, but possible for some configurations.
   - So, x can be E of z.

3. N (North): If supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is N of z.
   - We've deduced that supy(x) <= supy(z). Since for x to be a valid region, we must have infy(x) < supy(x), we get infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - So, x cannot be N of z.

4. S (South): If supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is S of z.
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z). Since for z to be a valid region, we must have infy(z) < supy(z), we get infy(x) >= infy(z) > supy(z). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - So, x cannot be S of z.

5. W (West): If supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
   - We've deduced that infx(z) < infx(x). Since for x to be a valid region, we must have infx(x) < supx(x), we get infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - So, x cannot be W of z.

6. NE (North East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NE of z.
   - We've deduced that supy(x) <= supy(z). Since for x to be a valid region, we must have infy(x) < supy(x), we get infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - So, x cannot be NE of z.

7. SE (South East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z.
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z). Since for x to be a valid region, we must have infy(x) < supy(x), we get supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(z). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - So, x cannot be SE of z.

8. NW (North West): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NW of z.
   - We've deduced that infx(z) < infx(x). Since for x to be a valid region, we must have infx(x) < supx(x), we get infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - Additionally, we've deduced that supy(x) <= supy(z), which means infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - So, x cannot be NW of z.

9. SW (South West): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SW of z.
   - We've deduced that infx(z) < infx(x). Since for x to be a valid region, we must have infx(x) < supx(x), we get infx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - Additionally, we've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z). Since for x to be a valid region, we must have infy(x) < supy(x), we get supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(z). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - So, x cannot be SW of z.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relations between x and z are B (Bounding Box) and E (East).

Actually, let me carefully check something. The only condition for the B relation that I'm being tentative about is supx(x) <= supx(z). Let's see if I can determine this.

From x E y, I can't directly deduce anything about supx(x) in relation to other entities.
From y B z, I know that supx(y) <= supx(z).

I don't have a direct deduction about the relation between supx(x) and supx(z). It's possible that supx(x) <= supx(z), in which case x is B of z. It's also possible that supx(x) > supx(z), in which case x is not B of z.

Similarly, for the E relation, the condition in question is supx(z) <= infx(x). From what I've deduced, I know that supx(y) <= infx(x), but I don't have a direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), in which case x is E of z. It's also possible that supx(z) > infx(x), in which case x is not E of z.

Let's see what we definitely know. Here's what the given constraints tell us:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

From these, we can directly deduce:
1. infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This gives us infx(z) < infx(x).
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). This gives us supy(x) <= supy(z).

But we can't directly determine the relation between supx(x) and supx(z), nor between supx(z) and infx(x).

Let's take a step back. given the conditions supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), what are the possible relations?

infx(x) < supx(x) (for valid region x)
infx(y) < supx(y) (for valid region y)
supx(y) <= infx(x)
supx(y) <= supx(z)

As supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we have these possibilities:
1. infx(x) < supx(z): This means x and z overlap in the x-dimension.
2. infx(x) >= supx(z): This means x is completely to the east of z.

So, the possible relations are:
1. E (East): If supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've deduced that infy(x) >= infy(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-conditions are satisfied.
   - The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied in situation 2.
   - So, x can be E of z.

2. B (Bounding Box): If infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've deduced that infx(z) < infx(x), infy(x) >= infy(z), and supy(x) <= supy(z), which satisfies three of the four conditions.
   - The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) might be satisfied in situation 1, depending on the specific values.
   - So, x can be B of z.

So it looks like the possible relations between x and z are B (Bounding Box) and E (East).

Wait, I'm not being careful about the relation. Specifically I need to ensure this is a Cardinal direction relation, and not some arbitrary set of directions. According to the definition, a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

Here, we're looking for a single-tile cardinal direction relation, which is one of the 9 directiones {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. 

Actually, oh, no we're not. The problem statement asks "which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" and we're asked to provide answers from the set {N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B}. So, I'm looking for a single relation, not a composite one. 

Based on our deductions, the only tile where x can be is B or E. Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are B (Bounding Box) and E (East).

Actually, I notice that I've been inconsistent in the conditions for B (Bounding Box). Sometimes I've used infx(z) <= infx(x), and sometimes infx(z) < infx(x).

Let's go back to the definition:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Substituting a=x and b=z:
x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, let's confirm our deductions one more time:
1. infx(z) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(x). This gives us infx(z) < infx(x).
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x). This gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). This gives us supy(x) <= supy(z).

From 1, we can say that infx(z) <= infx(x) (which is the strict inequality infx(z) < infx(x)).
From 2, we can say that infy(z) <= infy(x).
From 3, we can say that supy(x) <= supy(z).

The only condition for B that we can't directly determine is supx(x) <= supx(z). If this condition is satisfied, then x is B of z. Otherwise, x is not B of z.

For the E relation, the condition is:
x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our deductions, we know that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) is not directly determined. If this condition is satisfied, then x is E of z. Otherwise, x is not E of z.

Note that the conditions for E include supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
The conditions for B include infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From what we've established, infx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z) are satisfied. The two remaining conditions are supx(z) <= infx(x) for E and supx(x) <= supx(z) for B.

Interestingly, the conditions for E and B are mutually exclusive. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for B. Conversely, if supx(x) <= supx(z), then infx(x) < supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for E.

Hmm, but this mutual exclusivity doesn't seem right. Let's think more...

I might be comparing the wrong entities. Let's remember that for E, supx(z) should be compared with infx(x), and for B, supx(x) should be compared with supx(z).

Let's take a step back. Given the conditions supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z), we still don't have direct information about the relation between supx(z) and infx(x) or between supx(x) and supx(z).

It's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x), or for infx(x) < supx(z).

If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is E of z.

If infx(x) < supx(z), then it's about how supx(x) relates to supx(z):
- If supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is B of z.
- If supx(x) > supx(z), then x is neither E nor B of z.

Actually, wait, am I being careless? Let me think again. Well supx(y) <= infx(x) means x is to the east of y. And since supx(y) <= supx(z), z extends at least as far east as y. But it's not clear if z extends so far east that it overlaps with x.

Let me be extremely clear. We have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

These give us the relation:
supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z))

If infx(x) < supx(z), then supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(z).
If supx(z) < infx(x), then supx(y) <= supx(z) < infx(x).

Both of these are consistent with our constraints. 

1. If supx(z) < infx(x), then x is E of z.
2. If infx(x) < supx(z), then we need to check if supx(x) <= supx(z). If so, then x is B of z. Otherwise, x is neither E nor B of z.

But actually I don't think x can be neither E nor B of z. Let's revisit the constraints.

If x is neither E nor B of z, then:
- For not being E, we have infx(x) < supx(z).
- For not being B, we have supx(x) > supx(z).

This means we have: infx(x) < supx(z) < supx(x).

Given our deductions infx(z) < infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z), x is neither N, NE, S, SE, W, NW, SW of z. So, if x is not E or B of z, it doesn't fully fit into any of the 9 single-tile cardinal directions.

But actually, wait a second. Is E and B really mutually exclusive? Actually, let's double check. From our deductions, we have infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). For E, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x). For B, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This would only be possible if supx(z) = infx(x), which seems like an edge case. In this case, the width of x would be 0, which isn't a valid region. So, E and B are generally mutually exclusive for valid regions.

Now, what happens if x doesn't fit neatly into any of the 9 single-tile cardinal directions? This suggests that x overlaps with multiple tiles in the Cardinal Direction Calculus. For instance, x could be in between the cardinal directions. But actually the question asks explicitly for the 9 possible single-tile cardinal directions, and I've reasoned that the only ones that are possible are E and B. So that's the answer.

Actually, I'm being a bit careless, and I should be more precise. From we've deduced, we know infx(z) < infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
The first condition may or may not be verified, but the second and third are.

B: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
The first, third, and fourth conditions are verified, but the second may or may not be. 

So yes, E and B are indeed the only ones that might hold, depending on the specific regions. 

Let me double check the other cardinal directions

1. N: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have supy(x) <= supy(z). This means infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z), contradicting supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be N of z.

2. S: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have infy(z) <= infy(x). This means supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(z), contradicting supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x can't be S of z.

3. W: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have infx(z) < infx(x). This means supx(x) > infx(x) > infx(z), contradicting supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x can't be W of z.

4. NE: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We have supy(x) <= supy(z). This means infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z), contradicting supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be NE of z.

5. SE: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We have infy(z) <= infy(x). This means supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(z), contradicting supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x can't be SE of z.

6. NW: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
We have infx(z) < infx(x). This means supx(x) > infx(x) > infx(z), contradicting supx(x) <= infx(z). Additionally, we have supy(x) <= supy(z). This means infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z), contradicting supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x can't be NW of z.

7. SW: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
We have infx(z) < infx(x). This means supx(x) > infx(x) > infx(z), contradicting supx(x) <= infx(z). Additionally, we have infy(z) <= infy(x). This means supy(x) > infy(x) >= infy(z), contradicting supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x can't be SW of z.

But wait, though supx(x) > infx(x) > infx(z), that only means supx(x) > infx(z), it still allows for supx(x) <= supx(z) which I found is one of the conditions for B. Actually no it doesn't. Let me be more careful. E and B are mutually exclusive in general, but there are strange cases where they the boundaries may touch.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are E (East) and B (Bounding Box). These conditions are:
- E: supx(z) <= infx(x) (western boundary of x is to the east of eastern boundary of z)
- B: supx(x) <= supx(z) (eastern boundary of x is to the west of eastern boundary of z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we've verified)

Yes, the possible relations between region x and region z are B (Bounding Box) and E (East).

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what constraints are placed on region x relative to region z, given the information:
- x is E of y
- y is B of z

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (eastern boundary of y is west of western boundary of x)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (southern boundary of y is south of or at same position as southern boundary of x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (northern boundary of x is south of or at same position as northern boundary of y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (western boundary of z is west of western boundary of y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (eastern boundary of y is east of eastern boundary of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (southern boundary of z is south of southern boundary of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (northern boundary of y is north of northern boundary of z)

Combining these constraints:
1. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which gives us infx(z) < infx(x)
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which gives us infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which gives us supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Now, checking all possible relations:

For relation B: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- Three conditions are met, but supx(x) ≤ supx(z) depends on the specific regions.

For relation E: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- Two conditions are met, but supx(z) ≤ infx(x) depends on the specific regions.

All other relations (N, NE, SE, S, W, NW, SW) can be ruled out because our deductions contradict their requirements.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: B, E
