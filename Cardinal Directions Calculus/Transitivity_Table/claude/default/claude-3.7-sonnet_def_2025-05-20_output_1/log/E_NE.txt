PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step-by-step by using the definitions of cardinal direction relations.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y, which means: 
  - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
  - infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's y-projection is contained within y's y-projection)

- Region y is NE of region z, which means:
  - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
  - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z. Let's analyze what we can deduce:

From x E y and y NE z:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
2. supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y NE z)

These together imply:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
Which means supx(z) <= infx(x), so x is to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship:
1. infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
2. supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)

These together imply:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
Which means supy(z) <= infy(x), so x is to the north of z.

We've established that:
- x is to the east of z
- x is to the north of z

This means x could be:
- NE of z (if both conditions hold together)
- E of z (if only the east condition holds strictly)
- N of z (if only the north condition holds strictly)

Let's double-check my reasoning.

East condition: supx(z) <= infx(x)
North condition: supy(z) <= infy(x)

For x to be NE of z, both conditions must hold, which they do.

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (this is not guaranteed by our given conditions)

For x to be N of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (this is not guaranteed by our given conditions)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've established)

Actually, let me think more carefully. I need to verify whether x could be in positions E or N relative to z.

Let me re-examine the possible relative positions of regions x, y, and z.

For x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

For y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's see if x E z is possible:
For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), so the first condition is met.
For the second condition, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), but we don't know the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) based on the given information. It's possible that supy(x) <= supy(z), but also possible that supy(x) > supy(z).

So, x E z is a possibility if supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's see if x N z is possible:
For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've established that supy(z) <= infy(x), so the first condition is met.
For the second condition, we know supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). This implies that supx(x) cannot be less than or equal to supx(z) (unless x is a degenerate region, which is not the case in our context). So, the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is not satisfied.

Actually, I made a mistake. The fact that supx(z) <= infx(x) means that region x is completely to the east of region z, not that supx(x) cannot be less than or equal to supx(z). But it does mean the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x. For the x N z relation, we need both the conditions infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) to be satisfied, which would mean the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. But this would contradict the fact that supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x N z is not possible.

Let's review:

x NE z is possible because:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (from x E y and y NE z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (from x E y and y NE z)

x E z is possible if:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (confirmed)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (not guaranteed, depends on the specific regions)

x N z is not possible because:
- The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless x is degenerate).

Wait, let me rethink this more carefully. The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) means the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x, which implies region x is completely to the east of region z. This contradicts the N relation, which requires the x-projection of x to be contained within the x-projection of z.

Let's also check if x could be in positions NW, W, SW, S, SE, or B relative to z.

x NW z is not possible:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (required for NW)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)

But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (unless x and z are degenerate).

I believe I'm making it more complex than it needs to be and need to be more systematic. Let me use the original definitions to determine the potential relations.

Given information:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z)

Let's check each cardinal direction relation:

1. x B z?
   For B, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z).
   So, x B z is not possible.

2. x N z?
   For N, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we also know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z).
   So, x N z is not possible.

3. x NE z?
   For NE, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Both conditions are satisfied from our deductions.
   So, x NE z is possible.

4. x E z?
   For E, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x) and we also know supy(z) <= infy(x).
   The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z) (unless x is degenerate).
   So, x E z is not possible.

Hmm, let's double check. For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (we don't know this from our given conditions, but it could be true)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (but we have supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x), contradicting supy(x) <= supy(z) unless supy(x) = infy(x), which would make x degenerate)

Actually, let's think of this graphically.

If we have:
- x is E of y: x is to the right of y, with x's y-projection within y's.
- y is NE of z: y is to the top-right of z.

Then, x is to the right of y, and y is to the top-right of z. This means x is to the right and above z. Given the orientation, x can be NE of z. But x cannot be E of z, because it's not just to the right, but also above. Similarly, x cannot be N of z because it's not just above, but also to the right.

Let's see if x could be in other positions:

5. x SE z?
   For SE, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We know supx(z) <= infx(x), but we also know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This doesn't necessarily contradict supy(x) <= infy(z), but it does mean supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). This would make x degenerate in the y-dimension, which is not allowed in our context.
   So, x SE z is not possible.

Let me double check again. For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

But we have supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This doesn't directly contradict supy(x) <= infy(z) because infy(z) and supy(z) are not directly related. But we also have supy(x) <= supy(y) from x E y. 

So, we know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

We can't derive a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from these. So, x SE z could be possible.

Hmm, but let's think graphically again. If y is NE of z, then y is above z. If x is E of y, x's y-projection is contained within y's. This means x can't go lower than y in the y-dimension. So, x can't be below z, which means x SE z is not possible.

Let's be more formal. We have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x E y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)

From these, we get:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x)

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

The fact that supy(z) <= infy(x) means the top of z is below the bottom of x, which contradicts the requirement for SE that the top of x is below the bottom of z. So, x SE z is not possible.

Let's check the remaining directions:

6. x S z?
   For S, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z).
   So, x S z is not possible.

7. x SW z?
   For SW, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).
   So, x SW z is not possible.

8. x W z?
   For W, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).
   So, x W z is not possible.

9. x NW z?
   For NW, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we also have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).
   So, x NW z is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE (North East).

Let me do another verification to make sure.

We have:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can infer:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x)

These two conditions match the definition of x NE z. So, Northeast is a possible relation.

Let me check if any other relation is possible.

For x to have any relation with z apart from NE, it would mean at least one of the two conditions (supx(z) <= infx(x) or supy(z) <= infy(x)) doesn't hold.

Let's see if we can construct a scenario where x is not NE of z even though the given conditions (x E y and y NE z) are met.

If x is E of y, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

The first condition ensures that x is to the east of y. The second ensures that x's y-projection is contained within y's.

If y is NE of z, then:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

This means y is to the northeast of z. y is to the right of z, and it's above z.

Now, if I try to place x in a position other than NE of z:

For x to be E of z (rather than NE), I would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which is met)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For this, x would need to stretch down to overlap with z's y-projection, meaning supy(x) <= supy(z).

But from the given conditions, we know:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z)

Combining these, we get:
supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Since y's projection on the y-axis is [infy(y), supy(y)], and we know supy(z) <= infy(y), we must have supy(z) < supy(y). Combining with supy(x) <= supy(y), we can't determine a relationship between supy(x) and supy(z).

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's break it down geometrically. 

From y NE z, the region y is completely above and to the right of z. From x E y, the region x is completely to the right of y, but its y-projection is within y's. This means the bottom of x can go down as far as the bottom of y, but not further. And the top of x can go as high as, but not higher than, the top of y.

Now, if z is southwest of y, and y is completely above z, then the bottom of y is above the top of z. And since the bottom of x can be as low as the bottom of y, the bottom of x is above the top of z. This means x is completely above z (in the north). Additionally, x is to the right of y, which is to the right of z, so x is completely to the right of z (in the east).

This places x in the northeast of z.

Since it's impossible to construct a scenario where x is in a different relation to z given the constraints, NE seems to be the only viable relation. But let me think through this one more time systematically.

We know:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to determine the relation between x and z.

I've already determined that:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z)

Referring to the definitions of cardinal direction relations, the relation between x and z is given by:

- x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (both conditions are satisfied)

I'm going to reason through each of the other cardinal direction relations to see if they're possible.

For the B (bounding box) relation, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
  But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So B is not possible.

For the S (south) relation, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
  But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So S is not possible.

For the SW (southwest) relation, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So SW is not possible.

For the W (west) relation, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
  But we have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So W is not possible.

For the NW (northwest) relation, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we also have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So NW is not possible.

For the N (north) relation, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
  We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we also have supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So N is not possible.

For the E (east) relation, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x), but we also know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z) (unless x is degenerate, which is not allowed in our context). So E is not possible.

For the SE (southeast) relation, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
  We know supx(z) <= infx(x), but we also know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement for SE that the top of x is below the bottom of z. So SE is not possible.

So, NE seems to be the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z.

Wait, let me look at another potential relation more carefully: E (east).

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (we don't know this from our given conditions)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (we don't know this from our given conditions)

From x E y, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

But from these, it's hard to establish a relation between infy(z) and infy(x), or between supy(x) and supy(z). So, I can't confidently say whether x E z is possible or not without further information. But this still doesn't seem right, because if y NE z, the region y is both to the east and to the north of z (completely above and to the right). And if x is to the east of y (with x's y-projection contained within y's), then x should also be to the northeast of z, not just to the east.

Actually, from y NE z, we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

And from x E y, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's y-projection is contained within y's)

These together imply:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

For x E z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within z's)

But we have supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of z is below the bottom of x. This contradicts the requirement for E that the top of x is below or equal to the top of z. So, x E z is not possible.

Just to be thorough, let me reason through the possibility of x having the combined relation with z. From the definitions provided, a combined relation is denoted as R1: ... : Rk, where R1, ..., Rk belongs to the set of single-tile relations.

Based on the given constraints (x E y and y NE z), the only single-tile relation we have established between x and z is NE. So, the combined relation would also be NE.

In conclusion, NE is the unique possible relation between region x and region z.

Actually, I made a logical error. To be rigorous, I need to consider that the E relation in 2D cardinal directions is defined relative to the bounding box of the reference region.

Let's revisit:

For x E y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

For y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x)

These two conditions are consistent with the definition of x NE z.

But could there be other possible relations? I need to think about this in the context of regions in REG.

Actually, I think the constraints we have uniquely determine the relation between x and z to be NE. I've shown that:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

These two conditions together define the NE relation. And based on the definitions and our constraints, there doesn't seem to be a way to construct x and z such that x has a different relation to z.

So, the answer is: if region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then x is NE of z.

Actually, let me re-examine the original definition of these cardinal directions to ensure I'm not missing anything.

From the problem statement, the cardinal direction relation E (east) is defined as:
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b)

And the relation NE (northeast) is defined as:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

Let's check if there's any other direction relation that could possibly hold between x and z, given our constraints.

From the given conditions, we've established:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (constraint 1)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (constraint 2)

Now, let's check each of the 9 cardinal direction relations to see if they are consistent with these constraints:

1. B (bounding box): infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   Constraint 1 implies supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, B is not possible.

2. S (south): supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Constraint 2 implies supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, S is not possible.

3. SW (southwest): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   Constraint 1 implies supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, SW is not possible.

4. W (west): supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   Constraint 1 implies supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, W is not possible.

5. NW (northwest): supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Constraint 1 implies supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, NW is not possible.

6. N (north): supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Constraint 2 is consistent with supy(z) <= infy(x).
   But constraint 1 implies supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, N is not possible.

7. NE (northeast): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Constraints 1 and 2 are consistent with this. So, NE is possible.

8. E (east): supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   Constraint 1 is consistent with supx(z) <= infx(x).
   Constraint 2 implies supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). So, E is not possible.

9. SE (southeast): supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   Constraint 1 is consistent with supx(z) <= infx(x).
   Constraint 2 implies supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, SE is not possible.

From this exhaustive check, the only relation that's consistent with our constraints is NE. Therefore, if region x is E of region y and region y is NE of region z, then x is NE of z.

I've checked my reasoning carefully, and I'm confident in this answer. The relation between x and z is uniquely determined to be NE.

Actually, I want to double-check the reasoning about whether E is possible. Let me see if I can construct a scenario where x is E of z.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (Condition 1 from our established constraints, so this is satisfied)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (this condition isn't directly given by our constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (this is in direct contradiction with our established constraint 2, which is supy(z) <= infy(x). The constraint means z is below x, but for E, x's y-projection should be within z's y-projection.)

So, E is not possible.

Let me check one more time for any of the combinations of directions. I've established that the relation between regions x and z is uniquely NE.

Let me go through the reasoning one more time, to make sure:

From the given:
- x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y NE z: supx(z) <= infx(y), supy(z) <= infy(y)

We can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (from chaining the respective inequalities), so supx(z) <= infx(x).
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from chaining the respective inequalities), so supy(z) <= infy(x).

This means z is southwest of x. But formally, according to the definitions, this means x is NE of z.

I've checked all other cardinal directions, and none of them are consistent with these two derived constraints.

So, the relation between regions x and z is uniquely NE (North East).

One more thing just for rigorous checking: Could regions x and z have a composite cardinal direction relation? The conditions for a composite relation are:
i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

Since we've shown that the only possible single-tile relation between x and z is NE, and since composite relations are made up of multiple single-tile relations, the unique composite relation would also just be NE.

Therefore, the relation between regions x and z is uniquely NE (North East).

Actually, it's important to clarify an aspect of the definition of the problem.

We're considering regions that are in REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. These regions are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries.

Given this definition, it's clear that regions can have arbitrary shapes as long as they are topologically equivalent to a disk.

Now, I want to ensure that my derived constraints, namely:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is east of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z)

are consistent with the NE relation and inconsistent with all other cardinal directions.

Looking at the definition of NE:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

Our derived constraints match this definition exactly with x in place of a and z in place of b. So, x NE z is indeed valid.

I've already checked all other cardinal directions and verified that our constraints are inconsistent with them. So, the relation between regions x and z is uniquely NE (North East).

Let me be super rigorous one last time and check if there are other possible relations:

If x is E of y, then x is to the east of y, and x's y-projection is contained within y's. If y is NE of z, then y is to the northeast of z. The combination places x to the east and north of z.

Now, can x have any other relation to z besides NE? Let's consider the possibilities by placing x in relation to z:

For x to have a relation of B, S, SW, W, or NW with z, it would need to have at least a part of it to the west of z (or inside z's bounding box). But since x is E of y, and y is NE of z, x is completely to the east of z. So, these relations are not possible.

For x to have a relation of N with z, its x-projection would need to be contained within z's x-projection. But given that y is NE of z and x is E of y, x is completely to the east of z, not just above it. So, the N relation is not possible.

For x to have a relation of E with z, its y-projection would need to be contained within z's y-projection. But given that y is NE of z (which means y is completely above z) and x is E of y (which means x's y-projection is contained within y's), x is completely above z, not just to the east of it. So, the E relation is not possible.

For x to have a relation of SE with z, it would need to be to the east and below z. But given that y is NE of z (y is above z) and x is E of y (x's y-projection is within y's), x can't be below z. So, the SE relation is not possible.

This leaves us with the NE relation, which is consistent with our derived constraints.

Therefore, the relation between regions x and z is uniquely NE (North East).

Let us double-check all cardinal directions one last time to make sure we haven't missed anything.

If x is E of y, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not above the top of y)

If y is NE of z, then:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

These constraints are consistent with the NE relation, and inconsistent with all other cardinal directions.

Now, let's quickly check each direction relation again:

1. B: This requires x to be inside z's bounding box, but we know x is to the right of z, which means it's outside. So, B is not possible.

2. S: This requires x to be below z, but we know x is above z. So, S is not possible.

3. SW: This requires x to be to the left and below z, but we know x is to the right and above z. So, SW is not possible.

4. W: This requires x to be to the left of z, but we know x is to the right of z. So, W is not possible.

5. NW: This requires x to be to the left and above z, but we know x is to the right and above z. So, NW is not possible.

6. N: This requires x to be directly above z with x's x-projection contained within z's x-projection. But we know x is to the right of z, which contradicts this. So, N is not possible.

7. NE: This requires x to be to the right and above z, which is consistent with our derived constraints. So, NE is possible.

8. E: This requires x to be directly to the right of z with x's y-projection contained within z's y-projection. But we know x is above z, which contradicts this. So, E is not possible.

9. SE: This requires x to be to the right and below z. But we know x is to the right and above z. So, SE is not possible.

In conclusion, the relation between regions x and z is uniquely NE (North East), meaning x is to the northeast of z.

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-projection is within y's)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These two conditions match exactly the definition of the NE relation:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)

All other cardinal directions are inconsistent with these constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.
