PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Alright, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that:
- region x is N of region y
- region y is NE of region z

Let's start by unpacking what these relations mean:

1. x is N of y means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. y is NE of z means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, I need to derive the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze what we can infer about their relative positions.

From x being N of y, we know that x is above y (in the y-coordinate).
From y being NE of z, we know that y is above and to the right of z.

So transitively, we know that x is definitely above z (i.e., supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)). 

Now, let's analyze the x-coordinate:
- y is to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(y))
- x can be anywhere as long as it's within the x-bounds of y (infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y))

This means x could be:
1. Directly north of z (if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z))
2. Northeast of z (if supx(z) <= infx(x))
3. Northwest of z (if supx(x) <= infx(z))
4. Some combination of North and part of Northeast/Northwest (if x partially overlaps with z in the x-direction)

Let's analyze these one by one:

1. If x is directly north of z (N), then:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   But wait, is this possible? We know that y is NE of z, so supx(z) <= infx(y). And x is N of y, so infx(y) <= infx(x). This means supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for x to be directly north of z. So x cannot be directly N of z.

2. If x is northeast of z (NE), then:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From our given conditions, we have:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y being NE of z)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x being N of y)
   
   This gives us supx(z) <= infx(x), satisfying the first condition for NE. Also, we've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x). So x can be NE of z.

3. If x is northwest of z (NW), then:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   But we know that y is NE of z, so supx(z) <= infx(y). And x is N of y, so infx(y) <= infx(x). This means supx(z) <= infx(x), which is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z). So x cannot be NW of z.

Hmm, but i have to be careful here. Let's be more thorough. 

I know:
- x is N of y, which means supy(y) <= infy(x) and infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is NE of z, which means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's try to derive what this means for the relationship between x and z.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This confirms that x is above z.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This suggests that x is to the right of z.

OK, based on the above, we can say that x is either NE of z, or (if x spans horizontally beyond z), a combination of N, NE.

Wait, let me rethink this. Let's try to visualize the bounds.

x is N of y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

This means x is above y, and the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of y.

y is NE of z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

This means y is above and to the right of z.

Given these constraints, there are several possible arrangements of x, y, and z, and consequently, several possible relations between x and z.

Here's one possible arrangement where x is NE of z:
```
    x
  y
z
```

But there could be other arrangements. Let's explore more.

If y is barely to the right of z and x is to the right of y, then x would be NE of z.

If y is far to the right of z and x is to the left of y (but still overlapping with y in the x-direction), then x could be N of z.

If y is far to the right of z and x is to the left of y (but not overlapping with z in the x-direction), then x could be NW of z.

OK, actually, let me go back to the definitions and think more carefully:

1. x is N of y means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) 
     (the highest point of y is below or at the same level as the lowest point of x)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
     (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y)

2. y is NE of z means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
     (the rightmost point of z is to the left or at the same position as the leftmost point of y)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y)
     (the highest point of z is below or at the same level as the lowest point of y)

From these, we can infer:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) 
  (the highest point of z is below or at the same level as the lowest point of x)
  
This means x is definitely above z. Let's explore the x-coordinate relation:

- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y being NE of z)
- There's no direct relation we can infer between the x-coordinates of x and z based on the given conditions.

OK, so what are the possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z?

Given that x is definitely above z, the possible relations could be NW, N, or NE. Let's check if any of these can be ruled out:

NW: x is above and to the left of z. Is this possible?
N: x is directly above z. Is this possible?
NE: x is above and to the right of z. Is this possible?

Let's think about the x-coordinate more explicitly.

We know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y being NE of z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x being N of y)

From these, the only direct relation we can infer is:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
  (the rightmost point of z is to the left or at the same position as the leftmost point of x)

This means x is definitely to the right of z (or at the same position on the x-axis), i.e., supx(z) <= infx(x). This rules out the NW relation.

So, based on the given conditions, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (if x and z have an overlap in the x-direction, i.e., infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z))
- NE (if x is entirely to the right of z, i.e., supx(z) <= infx(x))

But wait, I'm getting confused with the definition of N. Let me clarify:

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z)

But we've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for N. So, x cannot be N of z.

Hmm, actually, let's think about this again.

Actually, wait. I need to be careful with the N definition. The definition of the N cardinal direction doesn't actually require the "contained" property. It only states:

a N b if and only if:
- supy(b) <= infy(a) (a is above b)
- infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) (the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b)

So, for x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z, which we've established)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z)

We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for N. So, x cannot be N of z.

This reinforces our conclusion: given the conditions, the only possible relation between x and z is NE (Northeast).

Actually, I'm confused. Let me go back to the drawing board and think carefully. I'll define the variables more explicitly to avoid confusion.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is NE of z

I want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the definition of N:
- x is N of y means:
  - supy(y) <= infy(x) 
    (y is below x)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
    (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y)

From the definition of NE:
- y is NE of z means:
  - supx(z) <= infx(y) 
    (z is to the left of y)
  - supy(z) <= infy(y)
    (z is below y)

From these, we can directly infer:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) 
  (z is below x)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
  (z's rightmost point is to the left of x's leftmost point)

Now, for x to be a particular cardinal direction relative to z, we need to check the conditions for each cardinal direction.

For NE:
- x is NE of z if:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x) 
    (x is to the right of z)
  - supy(z) <= infy(x)
    (x is above z)

Both of these conditions are satisfied, so x can be NE of z.

But that's just one possibility. Let's check other directions.

For N:
- x is N of z if:
  - supy(z) <= infy(x) 
    (x is above z, which is satisfied)
  - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
    (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z)

We know that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for N. So, x cannot be N of z.

Let me go through the rest of the cardinal directions to be thorough:

For NW:
- x is NW of z if:
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) 
    (x is to the left of z)
  - supy(z) <= infy(x)
    (x is above z)

We know that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z) for NW. So, x cannot be NW of z.

For W:
- x is W of z if:
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) 
    (x is to the left of z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
    (the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z)

We know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) for W. So, x cannot be W of z.

For SW:
- x is SW of z if:
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) 
    (x is to the left of z)
  - supy(x) <= infy(z)
    (x is below z)

We know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for SW. So, x cannot be SW of z.

For S:
- x is S of z if:
  - supy(x) <= infy(z) 
    (x is below z)
  - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
    (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z)

We know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for S. So, x cannot be S of z.

For SE:
- x is SE of z if:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x) 
    (x is to the right of z)
  - supy(x) <= infy(z)
    (x is below z)

We know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for SE. So, x cannot be SE of z.

For E:
- x is E of z if:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x) 
    (x is to the right of z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
    (the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z)

We know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z) for E. So, x cannot be E of z.

For B:
- x is B of z if:
  - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
    (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
    (the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z)

We know that supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x), both of which contradict the conditions for B. So, x cannot be B of z.

So, based on this thorough analysis, the only possible relation between x and z is NE. Let me double-check:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (from our derivation)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (from our derivation)

Both conditions for NE are satisfied. So, given that x is N of y and y is NE of z, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Hmm, I think I made an error. I have only assumed a specific arrangement of x, y, and z, but there are more general possibilities I haven't considered. Let me go back and think more generally.

Let's restate what we know:
- x is N of y:
  - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
  - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y)

- y is NE of z:
  - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
  - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

Now, let's deduce what we can about the relationship between x and z:

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) from (y NE z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) from (x N y)
- Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

But for the x-coordinate, the information is less direct:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) from (y NE z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) from (x N y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z is to the left of x's leftmost edge)

BUT, there's no direct relationship established between supx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(z) and supx(x). This means that while z is to the left of the leftmost edge of x, there are different possibilities for how x and z are related.

Based on just the information given, what we know for certain is:
- x is above z (supy(z) <= infy(x))
- The leftmost edge of x is to the right of the rightmost edge of z (supx(z) <= infx(x))

With these constraints, the possible cardinal directions for x relative to z seem to be:
- NE (x is northeast of z)

Let me reconsider the conditions for the remaining cardinal directions to make sure:

NW: x is to the left of z and above z. But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z. So, x is not NW of z.

N: x is directly above z. This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the condition for N. So, x is not N of z.

NE: x is to the right of z and above z. This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these conditions are met. So, x can be NE of z.

Given the constraints, it seems that the only possible cardinal direction for x relative to z is NE.

Wait a minute. Something still doesn't feel right. Let me double-check NE:

- supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is to the left of x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is below x)

Yes, NE is the only possible cardinal direction.

Actually, before I finalize, let me go back to the drawing board and be very precise. I'm getting a slightly different answer than my earlier attempt, which means I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me reconsider the definitions and constraints.

Given:
- x is N of y: This means supy(y) <= infy(x) and infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- y is NE of z: This means supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y).

From these, we can directly deduce:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x): This means z is below x.
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x): This means z is to the left of x's leftmost edge.

Let's now check all possible cardinal directions to see which ones are compatible with these constraints.

For N (x is N of z), we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This is satisfied.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z): This requires x's x-projection to be contained within z's x-projection. But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is entirely to the left of x on the x-axis. This contradicts the condition. So, x cannot be N of z.

For NE (x is NE of z), we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This is satisfied.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This is satisfied.
So, x can be NE of z.

For E (x is E of z), we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This is satisfied.
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z): This requires x's y-projection to be contained within z's y-projection. But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is entirely below x on the y-axis. This contradicts the condition. So, x cannot be E of z.

For SE (x is SE of z), we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This is satisfied.
- supy(x) <= infy(z): This requires x to be below z. But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x. This contradicts the condition. So, x cannot be SE of z.

Similarly, for S, SW, W, NW, and B, we can easily establish that the conditions are not satisfied based on the derived constraints.

Mm, I"m actually not sure about the NW possibility for it. Let me check if x can be NW.

For NW (x is NW of z), we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

We know from our deductions that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is to the left of x. Now we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), meaning z is to the left of x.
- supx(x) <= infx(z), meaning x is to the left of z.

These are inconsistent. So, x cannot be NW of z.

Let me check once more for clarity, listing all the deductions we've made from the given conditions:

1. x is N of y:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y)

2. y is NE of z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

Deductions:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (z is below x)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (z is to the left of x's leftmost edge)

These deductions, along with the transitive properties of cardinal directions, constrain the possible relations between x and z.

Checking each cardinal direction, the only one that aligns with these deductions is NE (x is to the right of z and above z). All other cardinal directions have conditions that are contradicted by our deductions.

Therefore, given that x is N of y and y is NE of z, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

OK, I'm not sure. Let's go back to the drawing board.

If x is N of y, it has these constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above y.
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), which means x is contained within the x-projection of y.

If y is NE of z, it has these constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y), which means y is to the right of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(y), which means y is above z.

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means z is below x.
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means z is to the left of the leftmost edge of x.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z:

1. For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So x cannot be NW of z.

2. For x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which implies that z is entirely to the left of x in the x-axis. This contradicts the condition for x to be N of z. So x cannot be N of z.

3. For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these conditions are satisfied based on our deductions. So x can be NE of z.

4. For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Additionally, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). So x cannot be W of z.

5. For x to be B (bounded by) of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which both contradict the conditions for B. So x cannot be B of z.

6. For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z). So x cannot be E of z.

7. For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). Additionally, we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies that z is entirely below x in the y-axis, contradicting supy(x) <= infy(z). So x cannot be SW of z.

8. For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). Additionally, we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So x cannot be S of z.

9. For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which implies that z is entirely below x in the y-axis, contradicting supy(x) <= infy(z). So x cannot be SE of z.

OK I think the only possibility is that x is NE of z.

Hmm, let me consider one more time. I want to check if there are other possible configurations:

1. x is N of y, which means:
   - x is above y (supy(y) <= infy(x)).
   - x's x-projection is within the x-projection of y (infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)).

2. y is NE of z, which means:
   - y is to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(y)).
   - y is above z (supy(z) <= infy(y)).

Now, given the above, I'm trying to deduce the possible cardinal directions that x can have with respect to z. I should be especially careful with the implications from the x and y projections.

From the given conditions:
- We know for sure that x is above z because supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NE z) and supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y), which transits to supy(z) <= infy(x).
- Also, we know z is to the left of the leftmost edge of x because supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y NE z) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y), which gives us supx(z) <= infx(x).

Actually, hang on, I want to be careful:

From x N y, I know that:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y NE z, I know that:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Deducing the relationship between x and z:
- For the y-coordinates, I can determine that supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above z.
- For the x-coordinates, it's a bit more complex. From y NE z, I know that supx(z) <= infx(y), i.e., z is to the left of y. From x N y, I know that infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), which means x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection. Combining these, I can deduce that supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).

So, while I know for sure:
- x is above z
- z's rightmost point is to the left of x's leftmost point

I don't have constraints on other properties.

With these constraints, let's check all 9 cardinal directions:

1. NW: For x to be NW of z, I need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). From my deduction, I know the x's are constrained in this way: supx(z) <= infx(x). The problem is that this arrangement says " z's rightmost point is to the left of x's leftmost point", which directly contradicts the NW requirement that " x's rightmost point is to the left of z's leftmost point". So, x cannot be NW of z.

2. N: For x to be N of z, I need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But my deduction that supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the requirement for N. So, x cannot be N of z.

3. NE: For x to be NE of z, I need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these conditions align with my deductions. So, x can be NE of z.

4. W: For x to be W of z, I need supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). From my deductions, I know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

5. B: For x to be B of z, I need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). 

   From my deductions:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - Also, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is entirely below x in the y-axis, contradicting supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   So, x cannot be B of z.

I'll check the remaining ones:

6. E: For x to be E of z, I need supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). From my deductions: supx(z) <= infx(x), which aligns with the first requirement. But supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is entirely below x in the y-axis, contradicting the E requirement that x's y-projection should be contained within z's y-projection. So, x cannot be E of z.

7. SW: For x to be SW of z, I need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). From my deductions, supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

8. S: For x to be S of z, I need supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). From my deductions, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is entirely below x, contradicting supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

9. SE: For x to be SE of z, I need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). From my deductions: supx(z) <= infx(x), which aligns with the first requirement. But supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is entirely below x in the y-axis, contradicting the SE requirement that x should be below z. So, x cannot be SE of z.

OK I've gone through each of the possible cardinal directions very carefully and I find that the only possible cardinal direction for x with respect to z is NE. This conclusion is based on direct deductions from the given conditions, without making any additional assumptions.

Therefore, the answer is: NE.

Actually, I think I've made a few errors when thinking through the possible relationships. I think I need to check my logic more carefully. 

I know:
- From x N y, I have: supy(y) <= infy(x) and infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y).
- From y NE z, I have: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y).

From these, I can directly deduce:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means z is below x.
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means z is to the left of x's leftmost point.

But I don't have direct constraints on the relative positions of supx(x) and infx(z), or supy(x) and infy(z).

Hmm, so if I look at the conditions for the cardinal direction relations:

1. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we also know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z's rightmost point is to the left of x's leftmost point. This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (which would mean x's rightmost point is to the left of z's leftmost point). So, x cannot be NW of z.

2. N: For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We know supy(z) <= infy(x), and we can possibly have infx(z) <= infx(x). But we also know supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z's rightmost point is to the left of x's leftmost point. This contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) (which would mean x's rightmost point is to the right of z's rightmost point). So, x cannot be N of z.

OK I think my problem is that I'm not carefully writing out the logical conditions. Let me be very explicit.

From x N y, I know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y NE z, I know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, I can infer (just using transitivity):
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

But I can't directly infer anything about: infx(z) vs infx(x), supx(x) vs supx(z), supy(x) vs infy(z).

Now, using the definitions of the cardinal directions, I'll reason through each possibility:

1. NW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but we also know supx(z) <= infx(x). For NW to be true, we'd need x to be to the left of z. But we know z is to the left of x's leftmost point. So, NW is not possible.

2. N: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We know supy(z) <= infy(x) and we know supx(z) <= infx(x). For N to be true, we'd need x to be contained within the x-projection of z, but we know z is to the left of x's leftmost point. So, N is not possible.

3. NE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Both of these are satisfied by our inferences. So, NE is possible.

4. W: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). For W to be true, we'd need x to be to the left of z, but we know z is to the left of x. So, W is not possible.

5. B: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). For B to be true, we'd need x to be contained within the bounding box of z, but we know z is to the left of x. So, B is not possible.

6. E: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supx(z) <= infx(x), but for E to be true, we'd also need x's y-projection to be contained within the y-projection of z. We know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is entirely below x in the y-axis. This contradicts the E condition. So, E is not possible.

7. SW: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). For SW to be true, we'd need x to be to the left of z, but we know z is to the left of x. So, SW is not possible.

8. S: Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). For S to be true, we'd need x to be below z, but we know z is below x. So, S is not possible.

9. SE: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supx(z) <= infx(x), but for SE to be true, we'd also need x to be below z. We know that supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is below x. This contradicts the SE condition. So, SE is not possible.

OK. I've gone through this very carefully, considering each of the 9 cardinal directions with a systematic and careful approach. Based on the transitive properties of the constraints from x N y and y NE z, I can conclusively state that the only possible cardinal direction for x with respect to z is NE.

Hmm, I'm really iffy about my reasoning for some reason. Let me try to check with a concrete drawing.

OK, so x is N of y, which means x is directly above y and has its x-projection contained within y's x-projection. y is NE of z, which means y is above and to the right of z. 

Let's visualize a possible configuration:
```
    xxxxx
    xxxxx
      yyy
      yyy
 zzz
 zzz
```

From this we can see:
- Region x is above y (x N y)
- Region y is above and to the right of z (y NE z)
- Region x is above and to the right of z (x NE z)

Let me check if any other arrangements are possible:

Could x have a different relation with respect to z?
- x N z would mean x is directly above z, but given that y is to the right of z and x's x-projection is contained within y's, x is also to the right of z.
- x NW z would mean x is to the left of and above z, but given that y is to the right of z, and x's x-projection is contained within y's, x is also to the right of z, not to the left.
- x NE z seems to fit the constraints: x is above and to the right of z.

OK, so I'm confident that x NE z is the only possible cardinal direction. The reason for this is:

1. We know from x N y that x's x-projection is contained within y's, and from y NE z that y is to the right of z.
2. Since x's x-projection is contained within y's, x is also to the right of z.
3. We know from x N y that x is above y, and from y NE z that y is above z.
4. Hence, x is above and to the right of z, making NE the only possible cardinal direction.

Actually let me try to draw one more time just to check if I could think of an edge case:
```
            xxxxx
            xxxxx
       yyy
       yyy
 zzz
 zzz
```

From this drawing:
- Region x is above y (x N y)
- Region y is above and to the right of z (y NE z)
- Region x is also above and to the right of z (x NE z)

I think the issue is that the constraint supx(x) <= supx(y) from x N y doesn't provide a strict enough bound on how far x can extend to the right. But the constraint infx(y) <= infx(x) from x N y, combined with supx(z) <= infx(y) from y NE z, ensures that x's leftmost edge is to the right of z's rightmost edge.

So, even with different arrangements, the cardinal direction of x with respect to z consistently comes out as NE.

Hmm, do I need to check if x can be directly above z (x N z)?

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

From what we know:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
- supx(z) <= infx(x) is derived from our constraints. This contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) needed for x N z.

So, x cannot be N of z. The only possible cardinal direction is NE.

OK, I think I have exhausted all possibilities, I'm confident that NE is the only possible relation between x and z.

Wait, let me try another test case:
```
          xxxxx
          xxxxx
      yyyy
      yyyy
          zzzzz
          zzzzz
```

In this drawing:
- Region x is above y (x N y)
- Region y is to the left of z (not NE, this is a mistake in my drawing)

This doesn't satisfy our given conditions, so it's not a valid scenario. Let me correct it:

```
          xxxxx
          xxxxx
      yyyy
      yyyy
  zzzzz
  zzzzz
```

Now:
- Region x is above y (x N y)
- Region y is above and to the right of z (y NE z)
- Region x is above and to the right of z (x NE z)

OK, so I'm consistently getting the same result. The only possible cardinal direction for x with respect to z is NE.

To recap:
Given x N y and y NE z, the possible relations between x and z is NE.

ANSWER:

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z based on the given conditions.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Let me analyze what these relations mean:

1. x is N of y means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection)

2. y is NE of z means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

From these, I can deduce:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means z is below x
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means z is to the left of x's leftmost point

Let me check all possible cardinal directions:
- For NE: Region x needs to be above and to the right of z
  * supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
  * supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓

- For N: Would require x to be directly above z with x-projection contained within z's x-projection
  * But we know supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts this requirement

- For all other cardinal directions (NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, B): Each requires conditions that contradict our deductions

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: NE
