PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1) We know that region x is S of region y, which means:
   * supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   * infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

2) We know that region y is N of region z, which means:
   * supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   * infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's first try to deduce what we can about their y-coordinates:
- From (1), we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From (2), we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

So we know that:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(x) and infy(z). We can have several cases:

1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This would mean x is S of z.
2. supy(z) ≤ infy(x): This would mean x is N of z.
3. Neither of the above: This means there's an overlap in the y projections.

Now, let's analyze the x-coordinates:
- From (1), we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From (2), we have infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This tells us that the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. But we still have multiple possibilities for the y-coordinates, leading to several possible cardinal direction relations.

Let's break this down further:

If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is south of z in some way. Given the x-coordinate constraints, the relation could be one of: S, SW, SE.

If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is north of z in some way. Given the x-coordinate constraints, the relation could be one of: N, NW, NE.

If there's an overlap in the y projections, and given the x-coordinate constraints, the relation could be one of: W, E, B.

Wait, I need to be more careful. Let's think about the x-coordinates again.

From (1), we know:
infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From (2), we know:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

So, for the x-coordinates, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z, but it's not necessarily the case that infx(x) = infx(z) or supx(x) = supx(z). So, there's still a range of possibilities.

Now, for the y-coordinates, both supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't have direct information about the relation between supy(x) and supy(z), or infy(x) and infy(z).

Let's draw some diagrams to visualize the possible arrangements.

Actually, I should reconsider my earlier statements. From the given conditions, we can't directly conclude if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) or supy(z) ≤ infy(x) or neither. We need to consider all possibilities.

Let's first list all cardinal direction relations and then check if each is possible. The relations are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.

1. x N z:
   This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   From our derived constraints, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   But we don't know if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   Let's see: We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't directly tell us about the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
   So, x N z is a possibility, but we need to check if it's consistent with the other constraints.

Actually, let me try to reason differently. We know a few facts and want to find the possible cardinal relations of x to z. 

Given:
- x is S of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is N of z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let's identify the constraints on the relationship between x and z:

For the x-coordinate:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x S y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y N z)
=> infx(z) ≤ infx(x)

- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x S y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y N z)
=> supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

So, for the x-projection, x is contained within z.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z)

This doesn't directly give us a constraint on the relationship between the y-projections of x and z.

Let's consider the possible cardinal relations:

1. x N z: This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We know that supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but we don't have direct information about supy(z) compared to infy(x). So, this is still possible.

2. x NE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've already established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

3. x E z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've already established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x E z is not possible.

4. x SE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've already established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x SE z is not possible.

5. x S z: This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We've established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we don't have direct information about supy(x) compared to infy(z). So, this is still possible.

6. x SW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've already established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

7. x W z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've already established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x W z is not possible.

8. x NW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We've already established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z: This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We've established that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we don't have direct information about the y-projections. So, this is still possible.

Based on the above analysis, the possible cardinal relations between region x and region z are: N, S, B.

But now I want to check my reasoning:

From the constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z), we can have two qualitatively different situations:

Situation 1: infy(y) is "large enough", so that both x and z are "far below y". That is, both supy(x) and supy(z) are less than infy(y). In this case, we can't determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(x) and infy(z).

Situation 2: y is "close" to x or z. This situation is more complex and might have subcases.

But actually, thinking more, the derived constraints on the x-coordinates combined with the possible relations for the y-coordinates lead to three possible cardinal directions: N, S, and B. Let me argue through each possibility directly, relying on the definitions given in the problem statement.

From the given constraints, we know:
- x is S of y, which means:
  * supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
  * infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is N of z, which means:
  * supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
  * infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, for the possible cardinal directions between x and z:

1. x N z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   From our derivation, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not directly given or derived, but it's possible.
   So, x N z is a possibility.

2. x S z: This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   Again, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) are derived.
   The constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is not directly given or derived, but it's possible.
   So, x S z is a possibility.

3. x B z: This means infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The constraints infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) are derived.
   The constraints infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) are not directly given or derived, but they're possible.
   So, x B z is a possibility.

4. x W z (and similarly, x NW z and x SW z): These require supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   But we've derived that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ supx(x) (since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) by definition of a region).
   This contradicts the requirement supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   So, x W z, x NW z, and x SW z are not possible.

5. x E z (and similarly, x NE z and x SE z): These require supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   But we've derived that supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means infx(x) ≤ supx(z) (since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) by definition of a region).
   This contradicts the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So, x E z, x NE z, and x SE z are not possible.

Ah, hm, let me be a bit more careful in my derivations. 

From the constraints:
- x is S of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is N of z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

For the x-coordinates:
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y N z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Which means infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

For the y-coordinates:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can't directly derive a relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z, so we have to consider all possibilities:

In each of the following cases, we already have the x-coordinate constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z):

1. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is N of z.
2. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is S of z.
3. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (and the above constraints don't hold), then x is B of z.

Let me also check if any of the other cardinal relations are possible:

1. x NE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   We've derived that supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (since infx(x) ≤ supx(x)).
   So, x NE z is not possible.

2. x E z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts our derived constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   So, x E z is not possible.

3. x SE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts our derived constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   So, x SE z is not possible.

4. x SW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts our derived constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So, x SW z is not possible.

5. x W z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts our derived constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So, x W z is not possible.

6. x NW z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts our derived constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So, x NW z is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible cardinal relations between region x and region z are: N, S, B.

Actually, I think I made a conceptual error in my reasoning. Let's be more careful and reconsider all the cases:

From the constraints:
- x is S of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is N of z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

For the x-coordinates:
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y N z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these, we get:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Which means infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

For the y-coordinates:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But from just these constraints, we can't determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z), or between supy(z) and infy(x). Let's consider all the possibilities:

1. x N z: This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The x-coordinate constraints are met based on our derivation.
   The y-coordinate constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not directly given, but it's a valid possibility.
   So, x N z is a possibility.

2. x NE z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   But we've derived that supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So, x NE z is not possible.

Wait, but that derivation is wrong. When we have supx(x) ≤ supx(z), it doesn't necessarily contradict supx(z) ≤ infx(x), because it's possible that infx(x) >= supx(z).

Let's reason differently. For each of the cardinal directions, let's explicitly check if it's consistent with the constraints we've derived.

From our derived constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- There's no direct constraint on the y-coordinates of x and z.

For each cardinal direction, we need to check if it's consistent with the derived constraints:

1. x N z: Requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The x-coordinate constraints match our derivation, and the y-coordinate constraint is not contradicted.
   So, x N z is a possibility.

2. x NE z: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   But we've derived that supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which, when combined with infx(x) ≤ supx(x) by definition, implies infx(x) ≤ supx(z). This contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So, x NE z is not possible.

3. x E z: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   As in the previous case, the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is contradicted.
   So, x E z is not possible.

4. x SE z: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   Again, the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is contradicted.
   So, x SE z is not possible.

5. x S z: Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The x-coordinate constraints match our derivation, and the y-coordinate constraint is not contradicted.
   So, x S z is a possibility.

6. x SW z: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   But we've derived that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which, combined with infx(x) ≤ supx(x) by definition, implies infx(z) ≤ supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   So, x SW z is not possible.

7. x W z: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   As in the previous case, the constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is contradicted.
   So, x W z is not possible.

8. x NW z: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   Again, the constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is contradicted.
   So, x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z: Requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The x-coordinate constraints match our derivation, and the y-coordinate constraints are not contradicted.
   So, x B z is a possibility.

Based on this analysis, the possible cardinal relations between region x and region z are: N, S, B.

Let me double-check if I made any errors, especially with the contradictions:

For NE, the contradiction was with supx(z) ≤ infx(x):
infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) implies infx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

For E, the contradiction was also with supx(z) ≤ infx(x), same as NE.

For SE, the contradiction was again with supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

For SW, the contradiction was with supx(x) ≤ infx(z):
infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) implies infx(z) ≤ supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

For W, the contradiction was also with supx(x) ≤ infx(z), same as SW.

For NW, the contradiction was again with supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

I realize I think this reasoning is correct, but let's more carefully look at what it is we're deriving in each of the cases.

From the constraints:
- x is S of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is N of z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

First, I'll double-check our derivation for the x-coordinates.
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y N z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

I can combine these to get:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Which gives me infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

For the y-coordinates, we have:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But these don't directly give us a relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z. So, I need to consider all possibilities consistent with these constraints.

Now, let's analyze the cardinal directions. I'll focus on the x-coordinate constraints first, since they're definitive.

For x-coordinates, we have infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This means that the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. This rules out the cardinal directions NE, E, SE, SW, W, and NW, because:

- NE, E, SE require x to be to the east of z, which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we've derived that infx(x) ≤ supx(z) (from the constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and the fact that infx(x) ≤ supx(x) for any region), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

- SW, W, NW require x to be to the west of z, which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But we've derived that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (from our constraints), which, with the fact that infx(x) ≤ supx(x) for any region, implies infx(z) ≤ supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

So, based on the x-coordinate constraints alone, the only valid cardinal relations are N, S, and B.

Now, for these three cardinal relations, we need to check if they're consistent with the constraints for the y-coordinates:

1. x N z: This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The x-coordinate constraints are satisfied, and the y-coordinate constraint supy(z) ≤ infy(x) doesn't contradict our derived constraints. Thus, x N z is a valid possibility.

2. x S z: This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The x-coordinate constraints are satisfied, and the y-coordinate constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z) doesn't contradict our derived constraints. Thus, x S z is a valid possibility.

3. x B z: This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The x-coordinate constraints are satisfied, and the y-coordinate constraints don't contradict our derived constraints. Thus, x B z is a valid possibility.

Therefore, the possible cardinal relations between region x and region z are: N, S, B.

Actually, let's also consider if we can derive more specific y-coordinate constraints from the given information.

From our constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y N z)

These tell us that both x and z are "below" y. But they don't constrain the relationship between x and z in terms of y-coordinates.

Let me think through this slightly differently. 

Given:
- X is S of Y => X is entirely below Y, with projections on the x-axis overlapping
- Y is N of Z => Y is entirely above Z, with projections on the x-axis overlapping

We want to determine the possible relations between X and Z.

From X is S of Y, we know: 
- supy(X) ≤ infy(Y) - X is entirely below Y
- infx(Y) ≤ infx(X) and supx(X) ≤ supx(Y) - X's projection on the x-axis is within Y's projection

From Y is N of Z, we know:
- supy(Z) ≤ infy(Y) - Z is entirely below Y
- infx(Z) ≤ infx(Y) and supx(Y) ≤ supx(Z) - Y's projection on the x-axis is within Z's projection

Combining the x-axis constraints:
- infx(Z) ≤ infx(Y) ≤ infx(X) => infx(Z) ≤ infx(X)
- supx(X) ≤ supx(Y) ≤ supx(Z) => supx(X) ≤ supx(Z)

Now, let's think about the y-axis constraints:
- supy(X) ≤ infy(Y) - X's top is below Y's bottom
- supy(Z) ≤ infy(Y) - Z's top is below Y's bottom

We don't have a direct constraint between X and Z in terms of y-coordinates. X and Z could be positioned in different ways relative to each other. Here are the possible scenarios:

1. X is above Z: This means supy(Z) ≤ infy(X). This, along with our x-axis constraints, gives us X N Z.

2. X is below Z: This means supy(X) ≤ infy(Z). This, along with our x-axis constraints, gives us X S Z.

3. X and Z have overlapping y-projections: This, along with our x-axis constraints, gives us X B Z.

So, the possible cardinal relations between X and Z are: N, S, and B.

Let's draw some diagrams to solidify this:

Scenario 1 (X N Z):
Z is the wider region at the bottom. X is a narrower region in the middle, and Y is the narrowest region at the top.

Scenario 2 (X S Z):
X is the wider region at the bottom. Z is a narrower region in the middle, and Y is the narrowest region at the top.

Scenario 3 (X B Z):
Y is at the top. X and Z are both below Y, with X inside Z.

These scenarios cover the possible positions of X and Z relative to each other, given the constraints. The possible cardinal relations between X and Z are: N, S, and B.

Let's actually verify the conclusion by using the given definitions:

x N z if and only if:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

We've derived that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) from the given constraints. The relation supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is not directly given but is a possibility. So, x N z is a valid possibility.

x S z if and only if:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Again, we've derived that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) from the given constraints. The relation supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is not directly given but is a possibility. So, x S z is a valid possibility.

x B z if and only if:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We've derived that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) from the given constraints. The relations infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) are not directly given but are possibilities. So, x B z is a valid possibility.

For all other cardinal directions, the required x-coordinate constraints contradict the ones we've derived, as shown in the detailed analysis above.

Therefore, the possible cardinal relations between region x and region z are: N, S, B.

Alright, so the answer is: N, S, B.

Oh wait, I just realized that the problem asks for the "possible" relations. Let me double-check a few things to make sure I haven't excluded any valid possibilities.

From the constraints:
- x is S of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is N of z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

We derived:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- No direct constraints between the y-coordinates of x and z, except that both regions are below y.

Given these derived constraints, I checked each cardinal direction to determine if it could be a possible relation between x and z. The cardinal directions NE, E, SE, SW, W, and NW were ruled out because they require x-coordinate constraints that contradict the ones we've derived. The cardinal directions N, S, and B were found to be consistent with the derived constraints.

So, the possible cardinal relations between region x and region z are: N, S, and B.

But there's a subtlety I may be missing. Let's revisit the problem's givens. Specifically, I want to make sure that the regions in the problem are indeed the ones in our definition of REG (regions homeomorphic to the closed unit disk). But, wait, I've been given exactly that the regions in question x, y, and z all belong to REG, so I'm correct on that front.

So, to conclude, the possible cardinal relations between region x and region z are: N, S, and B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

From the given:
- x is S of y: This means supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is N of z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Looking at the x-coordinate constraints:
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y N z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z, which rules out cardinal directions that require x to be east or west of z (NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW).

For the y-coordinates:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y N z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These don't give us a direct constraint between the y-coordinates of x and z, so we must consider all possibilities that are consistent with our x-coordinate constraints.

The possible relations are: N, S, B
