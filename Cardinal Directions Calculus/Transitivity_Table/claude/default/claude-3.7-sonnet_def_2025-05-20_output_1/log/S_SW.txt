PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y: This means x S y
- Region y is SW of region z: This means y SW z

Let's recall the definitions:
- x S y if and only if supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y SW z if and only if supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, I need to figure out the possible relations between x and z. To do this, I need to think about the constraints on the positions of x and z.

From x S y, we have:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or at y's left boundary)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or at y's right boundary)

From y SW z, we have:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
5. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's try to derive constraints on the positions of x and z.

From 1 and 5, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
This implies supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

From 2 and 4, we have:
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
This implies infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(y) <= infx(z), but this doesn't directly allow us to compare infx(x) and infx(z). So we can't determine the left-to-right relationship between x and z based on this.

From 3 and 4, we have:
supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
This implies supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z.

So, from the constraints, we know that x is below z and entirely to the left of z. This means x could be SW of z.

But let's check if there are any other possible relations.

If x is SW of z, then:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

We've already shown that both of these conditions are satisfied, so SW is a valid relation. 

Are there other possible relations? Let's check:

For x W z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's bottom is above or at z's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's top is below or at z's top)

We've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), but we don't have information to determine the vertical extent relationship. So I can't definitely say if W is a valid relation.

Similarly, I can't definitively determine if S, SE, NW, or other relations are valid without more constraints.

Let me try a different approach.

From the constraints:
- x is below y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is below z: supy(y) <= infy(z)
- x's horizontal extent is within y's: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is to the left of z: supx(y) <= infx(z)

Let's think about it visually.

If y is SW of z, then y is to the left and below z. If x is S of y, then x is directly below y. So, x must be to the left and below z. However, the exact relationship between x and z can't be fully determined from the given constraints.

Let's consider all the possible relations and see which ones are consistent with the derived constraints.

Given that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)) and x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), the possible relations could be:
- x SW z: This is consistent with x being below and to the left of z.
- x S z: This would require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), in addition to supy(x) <= infy(z). But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z, so x can't have a vertical alignment with z. Thus, x S z is not a valid relation.
- x W z: This would require infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), in addition to supx(x) <= infx(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z, so x can't have a horizontal alignment with z. Thus, x W z is not a valid relation.

Actually, I was confusing the notation. When we say a region x is S of region y, we mean x is to the south of y, i.e., below y. 

Let's re-do this.

Given:
- x S y: x is to the south of y, meaning x is below y.
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z, meaning y is below and to the left of z.

Visually, if y is to the southwest of z, and x is to the south of y, then x is below and possibly to the left of or right of y, but definitely to the south of z.

Given the definitions:
- x S y iff supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y SW z iff supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

We can derive some constraints:
1. From x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y)
2. From y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z)

From 1 and 2:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z).
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), so we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). But this doesn't give us a direct relation between infx(x) and infx(z).
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z).

So, we know for sure that:
- x is below z: supy(x) <= infy(z)
- x is to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)

This suggests that x is to the southwest of z, meaning x SW z.

But wait, let me also check if we can have other relations.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (check, we have this)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (we don't have info on this)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (we don't have info on this)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (check, we have this)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (we don't have info on this)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (we don't have info on this)

For x to be in the S relation with z, x would need to be horizontally aligned with z (i.e., x's horizontal extent is within z's). But we know x is to the left of z, which contradicts horizontal alignment. So, x S z is not a valid relation.

For x to be in the W relation with z, x would need to be vertically aligned with z (i.e., x's vertical extent is within z's). But we know x is below z, which contradicts vertical alignment. So, x W z is not a valid relation.

Both of the checks are slightly wrong because I'm confusing myself on the horizontal and vertical relations.

Let's be super careful and think this through once more.

For x S z, we need:
- x is below z: supy(x) <= infy(z) (true from our derivation)
- x's horizontal extent is contained within z's: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z. This contradicts the condition for S, so x S z is not a valid relation.

For x W z, we need:
- x is to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our derivation)
- x's vertical extent is contained within z's: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. This contradicts the condition for W, so x W z is not a valid relation.

So far, we've determined that the relation between x and z could be SW, but not S or W.

Let's check the other possible relations:

For x SE z, we need:
- x is to the right of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- x is below z: supy(x) <= infy(z) (true from our derivation)

We know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z. This contradicts the condition for SE, so x SE z is not a valid relation.

For x NW z, we need:
- x is to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z) (true from our derivation)
- x is above z: supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. This contradicts the condition for NW, so x NW z is not a valid relation.

For x N z, we need:
- x is above z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
- x's horizontal extent is contained within z's: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. This contradicts the condition for N, so x N z is not a valid relation.

For x NE z, we need:
- x is to the right of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- x is above z: supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z, and supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. Both of these contradict the conditions for NE, so x NE z is not a valid relation.

For x E z, we need:
- x is to the right of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- x's vertical extent is contained within z's: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z. This contradicts the condition for E, so x E z is not a valid relation.

For x B z, we need:
- x is inside z's bounding box: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z, and supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. Both of these contradict the conditions for B, so x B z is not a valid relation.

So, after checking all the possible relations, it seems like the only valid relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, I should reconsider. I've been assuming certain things about the regions, but I should be more careful.

Given:
- x S y: x is to the south of y, meaning x is below y and horizontally aligned with y.
- y SW z: y is to the southwest of z, meaning y is below and to the left of z.

From the definitions:
- x S y iff supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y SW z iff supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's derive constraints on the positions of x and z.

From the above, we established:
- x is below z: supy(x) <= infy(z)
- x is to the left of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)

Now, the possible relations between x and z would be those consistent with x being below and to the left of z. Let's check each possible relation:

- SW: x is to the southwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both conditions are satisfied, so SW is a possible relation.

- S: x is to the south of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(z), but we've also established supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is entirely to the left of z. This contradicts the condition for S, since for S, x would need to be horizontally aligned with z. So, S is not a possible relation.

- W: x is to the west of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but we've also established supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is entirely below z. This contradicts the condition for W, since for W, x would need to be vertically aligned with z. So, W is not a possible relation.

- SE: x is to the southeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(z), but we've also established supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for SE. So, SE is not a possible relation.

- NW: x is to the northwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but we've also established supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for NW. So, NW is not a possible relation.

- N: x is to the north of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for N. So, N is not a possible relation.

- NE: x is to the northeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradict both conditions for NE. So, NE is not a possible relation.

- E: x is to the east of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for E. So, E is not a possible relation.

- B: x is inside z's bounding box if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradict the conditions for B. So, B is not a possible relation.

So, after checking all the possible relations, it looks like the only valid relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, I've been a bit too absolute about the relations we can derive. The key thing to remember is that we're asked for possible relations, and the constraints we've derived might not be tight. So, we need to be careful about claiming a relation is definitively not possible.

Let's revisit and be more methodical.

Given:
- x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z).
- supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), so supx(x) <= infx(z).

These constraints tell us that x is below z and entirely to the left of z.

Let's check all the possible relations again:

- SW: x is to the southwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both constraints are satisfied, so SW is a possible relation.

- S: x is to the south of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). The latter means x is entirely to the left of z, which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for S. So, S is not a possible relation.

- W: x is to the west of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The latter means x is entirely below z, which contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for W. So, W is not a possible relation.

Actually, I was mistaken earlier. I should not conclude that x is entirely to the left of z just because supx(x) <= infx(z). This inequality means that the right boundary of x is to the left of or at the left boundary of z, which does imply that x is to the left of z.

Similarly, supy(x) <= infy(z) means that the top boundary of x is below or at the bottom boundary of z, which does imply that x is below z.

So, the constraints we've derived do tell us that x is below and to the left of z.

Given these constraints, let's check all the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

- SW: x is to the southwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both constraints are satisfied, so SW is a possible relation.

- S: x is to the south of z if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which is consistent with S. However, we also know supx(x) <= infx(z), which means the right boundary of x is to the left of or at the left boundary of z. This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for S, which requires the left boundary of x to be to the right of or at the left boundary of z. So, S is not a possible relation.

- W: x is to the west of z if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which is consistent with W. However, we also know supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top boundary of x is below or at the bottom boundary of z. This contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for W, which requires the bottom boundary of x to be above or at the bottom boundary of z. So, W is not a possible relation.

- SE: x is to the southeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which is consistent with SE. However, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) requires the left boundary of x to be to the right of or at the right boundary of z. But we've also derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which means the right boundary of x is to the left of or at the left boundary of z. These two conditions contradict each other. So, SE is not a possible relation.

- NW: x is to the northwest of z if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which is consistent with NW. However, the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) requires the bottom boundary of x to be above or at the top boundary of z. But we've also derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top boundary of x is below or at the bottom boundary of z. These two conditions contradict each other. So, NW is not a possible relation.

- N: x is to the north of z if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) requires the bottom boundary of x to be above or at the top boundary of z. But we've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top boundary of x is below or at the bottom boundary of z. These two conditions contradict each other. So, N is not a possible relation.

- NE: x is to the northeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) requires the left boundary of x to be to the right of or at the right boundary of z. But we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which means the right boundary of x is to the left of or at the left boundary of z. These two conditions contradict each other. The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) requires the bottom boundary of x to be above or at the top boundary of z. But we've derived supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top boundary of x is below or at the bottom boundary of z. Both conditions contradict, so NE is not a possible relation.

- E: x is to the east of z if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The condition supx(z) <= infx(x) requires the left boundary of x to be to the right of or at the right boundary of z. But we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which means the right boundary of x is to the left of or at the left boundary of z. These two conditions contradict each other. So, E is not a possible relation.

- B: x is inside z's bounding box if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z). We've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which means the right boundary of x is to the left of or at the left boundary of z. This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for B, which requires the left boundary of x to be to the right of or at the left boundary of z. So, B is not a possible relation.

After checking all the possible relations, I confirm that the only valid relation between x and z based on the given constraints is SW.

Actually, I'm still not being careful. I should recall that x S y and y SW z are the only constraints. I need to think about feasible configurations of x, y, and z that satisfy these constraints, and then determine the possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

First, let's list the constraints on the boundaries based on these relations:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y) (the top of x is below or at the bottom of y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) (the left of x is to the right of or at the left of y)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) (the right of x is to the left of or at the right of y)
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (the right of y is to the left of or at the left of z)
5. supy(y) <= infy(z) (the top of y is below or at the bottom of z)

From 1 and 5, we can derive:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z).
This means the top of x is below or at the bottom of z.

From 3 and 4, we can derive:
supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= infx(z).
This means the right of x is to the left of or at the left of z.

Now, let's check if each of the possible relations between x and z is consistent with these derived constraints.

1. x SW z:
   - Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - Both of these conditions are satisfied by our derived constraints. So, SW is a possible relation.

2. x S z:
   - Requires: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - We've derived: supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - If x is entirely to the left of z (which is what supx(x) <= infx(z) suggests), then x cannot be horizontally aligned with z, which is required for the S relation. So, S is not a possible relation.

3. x W z:
   - Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   - We've derived: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - The second derived constraint implies that x is entirely below z, which contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for W. So, W is not a possible relation.

For the other cardinal directions, our derived constraints either directly contradict the requirements or don't provide enough information to confirm them. For instance, for x SE z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x), but our derived constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) suggests the opposite. Similar contradictions arise for N, NE, E, NW, and B. So, none of these are possible relations.

Actually, I'm still being a bit careless. Just because we know supx(x) <= infx(z) doesn't necessarily mean x is entirely to the left of z. It just means the right boundary of x doesn't go beyond the left boundary of z. Similarly, supy(x) <= infy(z) doesn't necessarily mean x is entirely below z; it just means the top of x doesn't go above the bottom of z. Depending on the exact sizes and positions of the regions, there could be overlaps or touches.

Given the derived constraints, let's re-think the possible relations between x and z.

1. x SW z:
   - Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - Both of these are derived directly, so SW is a possible relation.

Hmm, actually, I'm overthinking this. The conditions for the cardinal direction relations are precisely defined. If a region a has a relation R with region b, then it means that region a is entirely contained within the tile R(b).

Let's go back to the definitions and think step by step.

The single-tile cardinal direction relations I've been listing (SW, S, W, ...) have specific conditions that describe the exact position of one region relative to another. For instance, x SW z means that x is entirely located in the southwest tile of z.

From the constraints we've derived:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (the top of x is below or at the bottom of z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (the right of x is to the left of or at the left of z)

These two conditions together are consistent with x being in the southwest tile of z. So, x SW z is a possible relation.

For x to have any other single-tile relation with z, the constraints would need to be consistent with the definition of that relation. But for relations like S, W, SE, NW, N, NE, E, and B, the constraints we've derived directly contradict the required conditions. For instance, for x S z, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), but we've derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x).

So, x SW z is the only single-tile relation that's consistent with the given constraints.

However, there's something I've been overlooking. While we've been checking the single-tile relations, the question asked for the possible relations between x and z, which doesn't exclude multi-tile relations. So, the answer should be the single-tile relation SW.

Actually, I'm getting confused between the usual English directions and what the mathematical definitions of the cardinal directions mean. Let's go back to the mathematical definitions and be clear.

The cardinal direction relations are defined based on the 9-intersection model, where a region relative to a reference region can be in one of the 9 tiles: B (bounding box), S (South), SW (South West), W (West), NW (North West), N (North), NE (North East), E (East), and SE (South East).

Given:
- x S y: x is in the south tile of y.
- y SW z: y is in the southwest tile of z.

The question asks for the possible relations between x and z, which means which tile(s) of z can x be in.

Let's visualize this:
- If y is in the southwest tile of z, then y is to the left and below z.
- If x is in the south tile of y, then x is below y and horizontally aligned with y.

Given these positions, where can x be relative to z? Since x is below y and y is below z, x is further below z. Since x is horizontally aligned with y and y is to the left of z, x is also to the left of z. This suggests that x is to the southwest of z, i.e., x SW z.

Let's double-check this with the mathematical definitions:
- x S y iff supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
- y SW z iff supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From these, we derived:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (the top of x is below or at the bottom of z).
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (the right of x is to the left of or at the left of z).

These align with the condition for x SW z, which is supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, the relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, let me step back and think about this problem from a clearer angle. 

Given:
- Region x is S of region y: This means x S y
- Region y is SW of region z: This means y SW z

I want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Now, let's focus on the constraints from the given relations:

x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z) (using supy(y) <= infy(z))
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (using supx(y) <= infx(z))

So, I now have the constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

The question does not provide any other constraints on the positions of x and z. For instance, there's no information about the left boundary of x relative to the left boundary of z or the bottom boundary of x relative to the bottom boundary of z.

Given the constraints I have, the only relation that is definitely satisfied is x SW z (i.e., x is in the southwest tile of z). This is because:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) means x's top is below or at z's bottom.
- supx(x) <= infx(z) means x's right is to the left of or at z's left.

And that's all the information we have. For x to be in any other tile of z, we'd need additional constraints, which are not given.

Does this makes sense? Let's check if I'm missing something.

We have determined that the following are true:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

These two constraints are precisely the conditions for x SW z.

Let's quickly check the other possible relations:

x S z requires:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (true)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (unknown from given constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (unknown from given constraints)

x W z requires:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (true)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (unknown from given constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (unknown from given constraints)

For the other tiles (SE, NW, N, NE, E, B), our derived constraints either directly contradict the requirements or don't provide enough information to confirm them.

So, it is definitely possible for x to be in the southwest tile of z (i.e., x SW z). Is there any other relation / is it possible for x to be in any other tile of z simultaneously, given just the constraints we know?

Let's break down the possible configurations of x, y, and z that would be consistent with the given constraints.

Given:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left is to the right of or at y's left)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right is to the left of or at y's right)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

The last two constraints mean that region y is entirely in the southwest tile of z. The first three constraints mean that region x is entirely in the south tile of y.

Let's think about a specific configuration. Imagine z as a unit square at the origin (0,0) to (1,1). Then, y would be a region situated to the left and below z, for example, from (-2,-2) to (-1,-1). If x is to the south of y, then x could be located, for instance, from (-2,-3) to (-1,-2).

In this configuration, x is situated to the left and below z, which means x is in the southwest tile of z. This confirms that x SW z is a possible relation.

But are there other possible configurations that satisfy the given constraints?

Let's consider a different setup. Imagine z still as a unit square at the origin (0,0) to (1,1). But this time, let's place y differently. Since y is to the southwest of z, it could be situated from (-1,-1) to (0,0). It's right at the corner of z, satisfying the constraints supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Now, if x is to the south of y, it would be below y and horizontally aligned with y. It could, for example, be situated from (-1,-2) to (0,-1).

In this configuration too, x is to the left and below z, which means x is in the southwest tile of z.

It seems like, regardless of the specific configurations I consider (as long as they satisfy the given constraints), x will always be in the southwest tile of z. This confirms x SW z as the only possible relation.

But let me check if there's a way that x could have a different relation with z.

Because of the nature of the constraints:
- x S y means x is in the south tile of y.
- y SW z means y is in the southwest tile of z.

The south tile of y is directly below the bounding box of y. And the southwest tile of z is to the left and below the bounding box of z. If y is to the left and below z, and x is directly below y, then x is to the left and below z. So, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

Given:
- x S y means x is in the south tile of y.
- y SW z means y is in the southwest tile of z.

If we visualize the regions y and z and the corresponding tiles, we can see that the south tile of y (denoted as Sy) is a region directly below y. And the southwest tile of z (denoted as SWz) is a region to the left and below z. 

Given that y is in SWz, it means y is to the left and below z. If x is in Sy, then x is directly below y. Combining these, we can say that x is to the left and below z, which means x is in the southwest tile of z.

Actually, more generally, if y is to the southwest of z and x is to the south of y, then the exact position of x relative to z depends on the specific sizes and positions of x, y, and z. It's possible for x to be directly to the south of z or even to the southeast or southwest of z.

Let's see if I can find a geometric configuration where x could be in a different tile of z.

Wait, that's not correct. The cardinal direction relations are defined based on the minimum bounding box of a region. If y is in the southwest tile of z, its entire region is to the left and below the bounding box of z. And if x is in the south tile of y, its entire region is below the bounding box of y. Given these, x can only be in the southwest tile of z.

To convince myself (and to explain more clearly): if y is to the southwest of z, then supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z). And if x is to the south of y, then supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y). 

From these, we get:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)

This means that x is entirely below z and entirely to the left of z, which satisfies the conditions for x SW z.

So, the relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, let's debug this by building the most general picture that satisfies the constraints. In particular, let's try to construct an example where x is not in the SW tile of z, while ensuring that x is S of y and y is SW of z.

Given:
- x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y).
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z), supy(y) <= infy(z).

Let's imagine a configuration. To make it concrete, let:
- y's bounding box: (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- z's bounding box: (2, 2) to (3, 3)

Given these, let's check if they satisfy y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) => 1 <= 2 (true)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) => 1 <= 2 (true)

So, y is to the southwest of z. Now, where should x be located to satisfy x S y, but not be in the southwest tile of z?

For x S y, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) => supy(x) <= 0
- infx(y) <= infx(x) => 0 <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) => supx(x) <= 1

So, x can be anywhere below y and horizontally aligned with y.

Let's consider x's bounding box to be (0, -1) to (1, 0). This satisfies x S y.

Now, is x in the southwest tile of z?
For x SW z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) => 1 <= 2 (true)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) => 0 <= 2 (true)

So, x is indeed in the southwest tile of z.

But what if we try a different configuration, like:
- x's bounding box: (0, -1) to (2, 0)

Let's check if this satisfies x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) => 0 <= 0 (true)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) => 0 <= 0 (true)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) => 2 <= 1 (false)

This doesn't satisfy x S y. So, we can't place x to the right of y.

But what about:
- x's bounding box: (-1, -1) to (0, 0)

Let's check if this satisfies x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) => 0 <= 0 (true)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) => 0 <= -1 (false)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) => 0 <= 1 (true)

This doesn't satisfy x S y either. We can't place x to the left of y.

It seems that, if we maintain the constraint that x is S of y and y is SW of z, then x will always be in the southwest tile of z. This confirms that x SW z is the only possible relation.

However, cardinal direction relations can be multi-tile. That is, a region can be in multiple tiles of another region simultaneously. Let me check if x can be in multiple tiles of z while still satisfying the constraints.

For a concrete view let's try:
- Z's bounding box: (2, 2) to (3, 3)
- Y's bounding box: (1, 1) to (2, 1.5)
- X's bounding box: (1, 0) to (2.5, 1)

Let's check these constraints first:
For y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) => 2 <= 2 (true, they touch)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) => 1.5 <= 2 (true)

For x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) => 1 <= 1 (true, they touch)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= 1 (true, they touch)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) => 2.5 <= 2 (wait, this is false)

So this is not a valid configuration. Let me try again:

- Z's bounding box: (2, 2) to (3, 3)
- Y's bounding box: (1, 1) to (2, 1.5)
- X's bounding box: (1, 0) to (2, 1)

For y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) => 2 <= 2 (true, they touch)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) => 1.5 <= 2 (true)

For x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) => 1 <= 1 (true, they touch)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= 1 (true, they touch)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) => 2 <= 2 (true, they touch)

This configuration works. Now let's check what the relation between X and Z is:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) => 2 <= 2 (true, they touch at x-axis)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) => 1 <= 2 (true)

Both of these are satisfied, which means X is in the southwest tile of Z. Let's check if X can be in any other tile of Z:

- For X to be in the South tile of Z: infx(z) <= infx(x) => 2 <= 1, which is false.
- For X to be in the West tile of Z: infy(z) <= infy(x) => 2 <= 0, which is false.

It seems like, no matter the configuration (as long as the original constraints are satisfied), X will always be in the southwest tile of Z.

Actually, I think there's a mistake in my last configuration. If Y's bounding box is (1, 1) to (2, 1.5), then the South tile of Y would be the region below Y. Given x S y, the top boundary of X should be below the bottom boundary of Y. So, let me correct this:

- Z's bounding box: (2, 2) to (3, 3)
- Y's bounding box: (1, 1) to (2, 1.5)
- X's bounding box: (1, 0) to (2, 0.5)

For y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) => 2 <= 2 (true, they touch)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) => 1.5 <= 2 (true)

For x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) => 0.5 <= 1 (true)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) => 1 <= 1 (true, they touch)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) => 2 <= 2 (true, they touch)

This configuration works. Now let's check what the relation between X and Z is:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) => 2 <= 2 (true, they touch at x-axis)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) => 0.5 <= 2 (true)

Both of these are satisfied, which means X is in the southwest tile of Z.

Let's try to generalize. If:
- Y is to the southwest of Z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).
- X is to the south of Y: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).

From these, we get:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z) (using supy(y) <= infy(z))
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (using supx(y) <= infx(z))

So, supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z), which means X is in the southwest tile of Z.

I believe x SW z is the only possible relation.

Ah, I realized what I've been missing. I've been working with the constraint supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), but this only ensures that the right boundary of X is to the left of or at the left boundary of Z. But for X to be in the southwest tile of Z, the entirety of X should be to the left and below Z. So, my focus on the bounding boxes might not have been giving the complete picture. Let's think of it from the region perspective.

But that's not quite right. The definition of cardinal direction relations is in terms of the projections of the regions. For a region to be in the southwest tile of another, its right boundary should be to the left of or at the left boundary of the other region, and its top boundary should be below or at the bottom boundary of the other region.

Given that x is S of y and y is SW of z, I've derived that:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (the top of x is below or at the bottom of z).
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (the right of x is to the left of or at the left of z).

Therefore, x could only be in the southwest tile of z which means x SW z.

To be clear, the cardinal direction relation "SW" for x and z means x is in the southwest tile of z, which is the region to the left and below the bounding box of z.

In summary, the relation between x and z is SW.

So, the answer is: SW.

ANSWER:

The question asks for possible relations between x and z given that:
- x is S of y
- y is SW of z

Let me analyze this step by step using the definitions of cardinal directions.

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

These two derived constraints mean:
- x's top boundary is below or at z's bottom boundary
- x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's left boundary

These conditions precisely match the definition of the SW relation. No other relation is possible because:
- For S: Would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), but we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- For W: Would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we know supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- All other relations similarly contradict our derived constraints

The answer is: SW
