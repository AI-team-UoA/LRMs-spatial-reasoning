PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

We're given that:
1. Region x is NE of region y
2. Region y is B of region z

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of the relations:

1. x NE y means that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
   - This means x is strictly to the northeast of y

2. y B z means that infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)
   - This means y is contained within the bounding box of z

Now, let's analyze what constraints these relations place on the relative positions of x and z.

From x NE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is strictly to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is strictly to the north of y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Now, let's combine these constraints to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
From y B z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z).

This means that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but it doesn't directly constrain the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). So x could be east of z or might overlap with z in the east-west direction.

Similarly, from x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y B z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z).

This means supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), but again, this doesn't directly constrain the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z). So x could be north of z or might overlap with z in the north-south direction.

Let's visualize some possibilities. I'll use a coordinate system where the origin is at the bottom-left.

Case 1: Region x is completely northeast of region z (x NE z)
- In this case, supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This is possible if y is positioned in such a way that it's contained within z but z doesn't extend too far east or north

Case 2: Region x is north of region z (x N z)
- In this case, infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- This happens if z extends further east than x, but x is still strictly north of z

Case 3: Region x is east of region z (x E z)
- In this case, supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- This happens if z extends further north than x, but x is still strictly east of z

Case 4: Region x overlaps with region z in the northeast (x has parts in N, NE, and E of z)
- This can occur if x extends into multiple tiles relative to z

Let me double-check Case 2 by constructing an example:

Suppose:
- Region z has coordinates (0,0) to (3,3)
- Region y has coordinates (1,1) to (2,2) (clearly y B z)
- Region x has coordinates (0.5, 3.5) to (2.5, 4.5)

In this case:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 0.5? No, this doesn't work because infx(x) should be greater than supx(y) for x to be east of y.

Let me retry:
- Region z has coordinates (0,0) to (3,3)
- Region y has coordinates (1,1) to (2,2) (clearly y B z)
- Region x has coordinates (2.5, 3.5) to (4, 4.5)

Now:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2.5 (x is east of y) ✓
- supy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 3.5 (x is north of y) ✓
- x has infx(x) = 2.5, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 3.5, supy(x) = 4.5
- z has infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3

Let's check the relationship between x and z:
- supx(z) = 3 > infx(x) = 2.5, so x is not strictly east of z (not E or NE or SE)
- supy(z) = 3 < infy(x) = 3.5, so x is strictly north of z (N, NE, or NW)
- infx(z) = 0 < infx(x) = 2.5 and supx(x) = 4 > supx(z) = 3, so x overlaps with z in the east-west direction
- Given all of the above, x is in the N position relative to z

Actually, let me re-examine this more carefully. The definition of N is:
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

In my example:
- supy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 3.5 ✓
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 2.5 ✓
- supx(x) = 4 <= supx(z) = 3 ❌

So in my example, x is not in the N position relative to z. Let me adjust:

- Region z has coordinates (0,0) to (5,3)
- Region y has coordinates (1,1) to (2,2) (clearly y B z)
- Region x has coordinates (2.5, 3.5) to (3.5, 4.5)

Now:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 2.5 (x is east of y) ✓
- supy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 3.5 (x is north of y) ✓
- x has infx(x) = 2.5, supx(x) = 3.5, infy(x) = 3.5, supy(x) = 4.5
- z has infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3

Let's check the relationship between x and z:
- supy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 3.5 ✓
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 2.5 ✓
- supx(x) = 3.5 <= supx(z) = 5 ✓

So in this example, x is in the N position relative to z.

Let me also check if x can be in the NE position relative to z. The definition of NE is:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

Let's construct another example:
- Region z has coordinates (0,0) to (2,3)
- Region y has coordinates (1,1) to (2,2) (clearly y B z)
- Region x has coordinates (3, 3.5) to (4, 4.5)

Now:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3 (x is east of y) ✓
- supy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 3.5 (x is north of y) ✓
- x has infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 3.5, supy(x) = 4.5
- z has infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3

Let's check the relationship between x and z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3 ✓
- supy(z) = 3 <= infy(x) = 3.5 ✓

So in this example, x is in the NE position relative to z.

Now, let's check if x can be in the E position relative to z. The definition of E is:
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b).

Let's construct another example:
- Region z has coordinates (0,0) to (2,5)
- Region y has coordinates (1,1) to (2,2) (clearly y B z)
- Region x has coordinates (3, 1.5) to (4, 3)

Now:
- supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3 (x is east of y) ✓
- supy(y) = 2 <= infy(x) = 1.5 ❌ This doesn't work; x needs to be north of y.

Actually, let's reconsider. If region y is B of region z, then y is contained within z. And if region x is NE of region y, then x is strictly to the northeast of y. So x is strictly to the northeast of a region that's contained within z.

Hmm, I'm having a bit of difficulty constructing a valid example for E. Let me try again with a different approach.

Actually, let me try a more systematic approach. I'll define some coordinate bounds for regions z, y, and x to see which configurations are possible.

Let's say:
- Region z has coordinates (0,0) to (Zx,Zy) (upper right corner)
- Region y has coordinates (Yinfx,Yinfy) to (Ysupx,Ysupy)
- Region x has coordinates (Xinfx,Xinfy) to (Xsupx,Xsupy)

For y B z, we need:
- 0 <= Yinfx and Ysupx <= Zx
- 0 <= Yinfy and Ysupy <= Zy

For x NE y, we need:
- Ysupx <= Xinfx
- Ysupy <= Xinfy

Now, let's check the possible relationships between x and z:

1. x NE z:
   - Zx <= Xinfx and Zy <= Xinfy

   Since Ysupx <= Xinfx and Ysupx <= Zx (from y B z), it's possible that Zx <= Xinfx, which would make x east of z.
   Similarly, since Ysupy <= Xinfy and Ysupy <= Zy, it's possible that Zy <= Xinfy, which would make x north of z.
   
   So, x can be NE of z.

2. x N z:
   - 0 <= Xinfx and Xsupx <= Zx and Zy <= Xinfy

   Again, Ysupy <= Xinfy and Ysupy <= Zy, so it's possible that Zy <= Xinfy.
   And we can position x and z such that 0 <= Xinfx and Xsupx <= Zx.
   
   So, x can be N of z.

3. x E z:
   - Zx <= Xinfx and 0 <= Xinfy and Xsupy <= Zy

   Ysupx <= Xinfx and Ysupx <= Zx, so it's possible that Zx <= Xinfx.
   Also, we can position x and z such that 0 <= Xinfy and Xsupy <= Zy.
   
   So, x can be E of z.

4. x NW z:
   - Xsupx <= 0? This doesn't work as x would be to the west of the origin, which doesn't make sense in our setup.
   
   So, x cannot be NW of z.

5. x W z:
   - Similarly, this can't work because x needs to be east of y, which is contained within z.
   
   So, x cannot be W of z.

6. x SW z:
   - Similarly, this can't work.
   
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

7. x S z:
   - This would require x to be south of z, but since x is north of y (which is contained within z), this isn't possible.
   
   So, x cannot be S of z.

8. x SE z:
   - This would require x to be south of z, but since x is north of y (which is contained within z), this isn't possible.
   
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

9. x B z:
   - This would require x to be contained within z. But since x is strictly east and north of y (which is contained within z), x cannot be contained within z.
   
   So, x cannot be B of z.

But wait, there could be another possibility. Let me reconsider the constraints.

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Now, combining these:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). So x could be east of z or might overlap with z in the east-west direction.
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z). So x could be north of z or might overlap with z in the north-south direction.

So, possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (x is strictly northeast of z)
- N (x is strictly north of z, but overlaps in the east-west direction)
- E (x is strictly east of z, but overlaps in the north-south direction)

Wait, I think I'm making things too complicated. Let me just visualize some specific examples to see if there are any other possible relationships.

First, let's check NW. Can x be NW of z?

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- Xsupx <= Zinfx and Zsupy <= Xinfy

But since x NE y and y B z, we have:
- Ysupx <= Xinfx (from x NE y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

This means Ysupx <= Xinfx and infx(z) <= infx(y) <= Ysupx.
So, infx(z) <= Xinfx, which contradicts Xsupx <= Zinfx (unless Xinfx = Xsupx, which isn't possible for a region with non-zero width).

So, x cannot be NW of z.

I've already established that x can't be W, SW, S, SE, or B of z because x is northeast of y, which is contained within z.

That leaves NE, N, and E as the possible relations I've already shown are possible.

But wait, I should also check if x can be in the bounding box of z (B).

For x to be B of z, we need:
- Zinfx <= Xinfx and Xsupx <= Zsupx
- Zinfy <= Xinfy and Xsupy <= Zsupy

From x NE y and y B z, we have:
- Ysupx <= Xinfx (from x NE y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

This means Ysupx <= Xinfx and Ysupx <= Zsupx.
But this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between Xinfx and Zsupx.

OK, so let's try again. If "region y is B of region z," that means region y is completely within the bounding box of region z. If "region x is NE of region y," then region x is entirely to the northeast of region y.

So, region x is entirely to the northeast of a region that's completely inside another region. Let's visualize this.

Since y is completely inside z, it means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Since x is northeast of y, it means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

1. If x is completely to the northeast of z (x NE z), then:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   Is this possible given our constraints? Let's check:
   - We know supx(y) <= supx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - It's possible (but not necessary) that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - Similarly, we know supy(y) <= supy(z) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - It's possible (but not necessary) that supy(z) <= infy(x).

   So, x can be NE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

2. If x is just north of z (x N z), then:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   Is this possible?
   - We know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - It's not guaranteed that infx(z) <= infx(x), but it's possible.
   - Similarly, it's possible to position x and z such that supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - For the north constraint, as we saw earlier, it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x).

   So, x can be N of z.

3. If x is just east of z (x E z), then:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   Is this possible?
   - We already established it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - It's not directly clear from our constraints if infy(z) <= infy(x) is guaranteed, but it's certainly possible.
   - Similarly, it's possible to position x and z such that supy(x) <= supy(z).

   So, x can be E of z.

4. Let's check if x can be in the bounding box of z (x B z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y). This means infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). So, infx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   For the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z), it's not directly clear from our given constraints, but it's possible.
   
   Similarly, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This means infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). So, infy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   For the constraint supy(x) <= supy(z), it's not directly clear from our given constraints, but it's possible.

   So, x can be B of z.

5. Since x is northeast of y and y is contained in z, it seems impossible for x to be W, SW, S, SE, or NW of z. These would require x to be positioned in ways that contradict its northeast relationship with y.

So, from my analysis, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (x is strictly northeast of z)
- N (x is strictly north of z, but overlaps in the east-west direction)
- E (x is strictly east of z, but overlaps in the north-south direction)
- B (x is contained within the bounding box of z)

Let me double-check B by constructing a specific example. I was a bit surprised by that result.

Actually I'm still confused, so let me carefully check whether x can be B of z.

For x to be B of z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From y B z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

Now, I'll check each constraint of "x B z" to see if it's consistent with the given constraints.

1. infx(z) <= infx(x):
   From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).
   From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
   Now, infx(y) <= supx(y) (by definition of a region).
   So, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
   Hence, infx(z) <= infx(x) is consistent.

2. supx(x) <= supx(z):
   From y B z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z).
   From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
   But this doesn't directly constrain supx(x) relative to supx(z).
   It's possible to position x and z such that supx(x) <= supx(z), but it's not guaranteed.

3. infy(z) <= infy(x):
   From y B z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y).
   From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
   If infy(y) <= supy(y) (which is true by definition of a region), then infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
   Hence, infy(z) <= infy(x) is consistent.

4. supy(x) <= supy(z):
   From y B z, we have supy(y) <= supy(z).
   From x NE y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x).
   But this doesn't directly constrain supy(x) relative to supy(z).
   It's possible to position x and z such that supy(x) <= supy(z), but it's not guaranteed.

So, for x to be B of z, we need to ensure the two additional constraints:
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's see if it's possible to position x, y, and z in such a way that all constraints are satisfied.

I'll define some specific dimensions:
- Region z: (0,0) to (10,10)
- Region y: (2,2) to (4,4) (clearly y B z)
- Region x: (6,6) to (8,8)

For x NE y, we need:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- supx(x) = 8 <= supx(z) = 10 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓
- supy(x) = 8 <= supy(z) = 10 ✓

So, with these dimensions, x is NE of y and x is B of z.

Given that there is the possiblity that x can be B of z, but I'm not sure about other relations, let's check those too.

First, can x be NE of z?
For this, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's set:
- Region z: (0,0) to (5,5)
- Region y: (2,2) to (4,4) (clearly y B z)
- Region x: (6,6) to (8,8)

For x NE y, we check:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓

For x NE z, we check:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- supy(z) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓

So, with these dimensions, x is NE of y and x is NE of z. So x can be NE of z.

Next, can x be N of z?
For this, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's set:
- Region z: (0,0) to (10,5)
- Region y: (2,2) to (4,4) (clearly y B z)
- Region x: (2,6) to (8,8)

For x NE y, we check:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 2 ❌ This doesn't work.

Hmm, I'm making a mistake. Let's position the regions carefully.

For x to be NE of y, x must be strictly to the northeast of y. Let's use the definitions I provided earlier:

x NE y means that supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

So, for x to be to the northeast of y, the westernmost point of x must be to the east of the easternmost point of y, and the southernmost point of x must be to the north of the northernmost point of y.

Now, can x be N of z?
For this, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Let's set:
- Region z: (0,0) to (10,5)
- Region y: (2,2) to (4,4) (clearly y B z)
- Region x: (5,6) to (9,8)

For x NE y, we check:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 5 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓

For x N z, we check:
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 5 ✓
- supx(x) = 9 <= supx(z) = 10 ✓
- supy(z) = 5 <= infy(x) = 6 ✓

So, with these dimensions, x is NE of y and x is N of z.

Similarly, we can check if x can be E of z:
For this, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's set:
- Region z: (0,0) to (5,10)
- Region y: (2,2) to (4,4) (clearly y B z)
- Region x: (6,3) to (8,7)

For x NE y, we check:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 3 ❌ This doesn't work for NE, because the southernmost point of x (which is at y=3) is below the northernmost point of y (which is at y=4). To be northeast, x should be strictly northeast of y.

Actually, it seems like I've been making a fundamental error in thinking about the "NE" relationship. Let's get back to the definition of "NE". For x to be NE of y, the condition is: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

supx(y) <= infx(x) means the easternmost point of y is to the west of the westernmost point of x. In simpler terms, x is completely to the east of y.

supy(y) <= infy(x) means the northernmost point of y is to the south of the southernmost point of x. In simpler terms, x is completely to the north of y.

So, for x to be NE of y, x must be both completely east of y and completely north of y.

OK, let's check again if x can be E of z:
For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's set:
- Region z: (0,0) to (5,10)
- Region y: (2,2) to (4,4) (clearly y B z)
- Region x: (6,5) to (8,7)

For x NE y, we check:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 ✓

For x E z, we check:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 5 ✓
- supy(x) = 7 <= supy(z) = 10 ✓

So, with these dimensions, x is NE of y and x is E of z.

Let's check if x can have other relations with z, such as NW.
For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

But since x is NE of y and y is B of z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

This implies infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
So, infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (unless x is a single point, which doesn't fit our definition of regions).

Thus, x cannot be NW of z.

Similarly, we can check other relations. I believe the ones I've already found (NE, N, E, B) are the only possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

To double check, let's list all the constraints:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is strictly east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is strictly north of y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

From these, we can infer a few relationships between x and z:
1. infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x). This means the westmost point of x is east of the westmost point of z, but it's possible that x and z overlap in the east-west direction.
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This means the southmost point of x is north of the southmost point of z, but it's possible that x and z overlap in the north-south direction.

Based on these constraints, let's check each of the 9 possible relations between x and z:

1. x B z (x is in the bounding box of z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   We've already established that infx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x).
   For the other two constraints, it's possible to position x and z such that supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   So, x can be B of z.

2. x S z (x is south of z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   We've established infx(z) <= infx(x), and it's possible for supx(x) <= supx(z).
   But the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts what we derived: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
   
   So, x cannot be S of z.

3. x SW z (x is southwest of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   The constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts what we derived: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x).
   
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

4. x W z (x is west of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   The constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) still contradicts what we derived.
   
   So, x cannot be W of z.

5. x NW z (x is northwest of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   The constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) still contradicts what we derived.
   
   So, x cannot be NW of z.

6. x N z (x is north of z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   We've established infx(z) <= infx(x), and it's possible for supx(x) <= supx(z).
   For supy(z) <= infy(x), we derived infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), but this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). However, it's possible to position z and x such that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   So, x can be N of z.

7. x NE z (x is northeast of z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   From what we derived, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). However, it's possible to position z and x such that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   For supy(z) <= infy(x), as mentioned above, it's possible.
   
   So, x can be NE of z.

8. x E z (x is east of z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   We've established that it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x).
   For supy(x) <= supy(z), it's possible to position x and z such that this constraint is satisfied.
   
   So, x can be E of z.

9. x SE z (x is southeast of z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   We've established that it's possible for supx(z) <= infx(x).
   But the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts what we derived: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x).
   
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

I should also just double-check that it's possible for region x to have a bounding box relation (B) with region z, given that region x is NE of region y and region y is B of region z.

We know that, from a NE b:
supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

And from b B c:
infx(c) <= infx(b) and supx(b) <= supx(c) and infy(c) <= infy(b) and supy(b) <= supy(c)

For x B z, we need:
infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From x NE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For the first condition of x B z, we can derive: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x).
So, infx(z) <= infx(x).

For the third condition of x B z, we can derive: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).
So, infy(z) <= infy(x).

The second and fourth conditions, supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), are not directly constrained by the given relationships. 

It's possible to have regions where these constraints are satisfied. For example, if region z is very large, and region y is a small box in the southwest corner of z, then region x could be a small box in the northeast corner of z. In this setup, x would be NE of y, y would be B of z, and x would be B of z.

Let me try to construct a concrete example:
- Region z: (0,0) to (10,10)
- Region y: (1,1) to (3,3)
- Region x: (7,7) to (9,9)

For y B z, we check:
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(y) = 1 ✓
- supx(y) = 3 <= supx(z) = 10 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 1 ✓
- supy(y) = 3 <= supy(z) = 10 ✓

For x NE y, we check:
- supx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 7 ✓
- supy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 7 ✓

For x B z, we check:
- infx(z) = 0 <= infx(x) = 7 ✓
- supx(x) = 9 <= supx(z) = 10 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 7 ✓
- supy(x) = 9 <= supy(z) = 10 ✓

Yes, so I've confirmed that it's possible for x to have a B relation with z.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are:
- B (x is in the bounding box of z)
- N (x is north of z)
- NE (x is northeast of z)
- E (x is east of z)

Let me try once more to verify whether there are any other possible relations between x and z.

I'm going to reason about this step-by-step to avoid any confusion.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is B of region z

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

For region x to be NE of region y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)

For region y to be B of region z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the east-west bounds of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is within the north-south bounds of z)

From these, we can infer:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (z extends at least as far west as y, which is west of x)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (z extends at least as far south as y, which is south of x)

Now, let's analyze the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z using these inferences.

1. z B x (z bounds x):
   - infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x) (z is within the east-west bounds of x)
   - infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x) (z is within the north-south bounds of x)
   
   From our inferences, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) <= infx(z).
   
   So, z cannot be B of x.

2. x B z (x is in the bounding box of z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the east-west bounds of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the north-south bounds of z)
   
   From our inferences, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x).
   The conditions supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are not directly inferred, but they are possible.
   
   So, x can be B of z.

3. x S z (x is south of z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the east-west bounds of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
   
   From our inferences, we have infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (unless x is a horizontal line, which doesn't fit our definition of regions).
   
   So, x cannot be S of z.

4. z S x (z is south of x):
   - infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(z) <= supx(x) (z is within the east-west bounds of x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is below x)
   
   From our inferences, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(x) <= infx(z).
   
   So, z cannot be S of x.

5. x SW z (x is southwest of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is west of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is south of z)
   
   From our inferences, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) <= supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (unless x is a vertical line, which doesn't fit our definition of regions).
   
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

Let's continue with similar reasoning for the remaining cardinal direction relations.

6. z SW x (z is southwest of x):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is west of x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (z is south of x)
   
   From our inferences, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x), but it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   
   From our inferences, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
   This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), but it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   So, z can be SW of x, which means x can be NE of z.

7. x W z (x is west of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is west of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the north-south bounds of z)
   
   From our inferences, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) <= supx(x). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (unless x is a vertical line).
   
   So, x cannot be W of z.

8. z W x (z is west of x):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (z is west of x)
   - infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x) (z is within the north-south bounds of x)
   
   We've already noted it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   From our inferences, we have infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(x) <= infy(z) (unless x and z share a boundary).
   
   So, z cannot be W of x, which means x cannot be E of z.

Actually, hold on. I think I'm making a mistake in my reasoning. Let's be clear about the cardinal direction relations.

If x is E of z, then:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is strictly east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the north-south bounds of z)

From our inferences, we have infx(z) <= infx(x). It's possible (but not necessary) that supx(z) <= infx(x).

From our inferences, we have infy(z) <= infy(x). The condition supy(x) <= supy(z) is not directly inferred, but it's possible.

So, x can be E of z.

OK, let me take a more careful approach. Let's check each of the 9 possible cardinal direction relations between x and z, based on the constraints we've deduced.

From x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)

From y B z, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the east-west bounds of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is within the north-south bounds of z)

From these, we can infer:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (z extends at least as far west as y, which is west of x)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (z extends at least as far south as y, which is south of x)

Now, let's analyze the 9 possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

1. x B z (x is in the bounding box of z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the east-west bounds of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the north-south bounds of z)
   
   From our inferences, we have infx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x).
   The conditions supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are not directly inferred, but they are possible.
   
   So, x can be B of z.

2. x S z (x is south of z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the east-west bounds of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
   
   From our inferences, we have infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(x) (since infy(x) <= supy(x) by definition of a region). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   So, x cannot be S of z.

3. x SW z (x is southwest of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is west of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is south of z)
   
   From our inferences, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) <= supx(x) (since infx(x) <= supx(x) by definition of a region). This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).
   
   So, x cannot be SW of z.

4. x W z (x is west of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is west of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the north-south bounds of z)
   
   As with the SW case, this would contradict our inferences.
   
   So, x cannot be W of z.

5. x NW z (x is northwest of z):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is west of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z)
   
   As with the SW case, the first condition would contradict our inferences.
   
   So, x cannot be NW of z.

6. x N z (x is north of z):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the east-west bounds of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z)
   
   From our inferences, we have infx(z) <= infx(x).
   The condition supx(x) <= supx(z) is not directly inferred, but it's possible.
   From our inferences, we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x), but it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   So, x can be N of z.

7. x NE z (x is northeast of z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is east of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z)
   
   From our inferences, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x), but it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   As mentioned in the N case, it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   So, x can be NE of z.

8. x E z (x is east of z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is east of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the north-south bounds of z)
   
   As mentioned in the NE case, it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   From our inferences, we have infy(z) <= infy(x).
   The condition supy(x) <= supy(z) is not directly inferred, but it's possible.
   
   So, x can be E of z.

9. x SE z (x is southeast of z):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is east of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is south of z)
   
   As mentioned in the E case, it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x).
   But from our inferences, we have infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(x) (since infy(x) <= supy(x) by definition of a region). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning for why E is possible.

If x is E of z, then:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is strictly east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is within the north-south bounds of z)

From x NE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is east of y)

From y B z, we have:
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y is within the east-west bounds of z)

So, supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). It's possible to have supx(z) < infx(x), which would mean x is strictly east of z (satisfying the first condition for x E z).

From our inferences, we have infy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies the first part of the second condition for x E z.

The remaining part, supy(x) <= supy(z), is not directly inferred, but it's possible to have it satisfied.

So, x can be E of z.

Actually, I'm still a little unhappy with my reasoning here, so let me double-check the E relation one more time.

To verify if x can be E of z, I'll try to construct a specific example where all constraints are satisfied.

Let's say:
- Region z: (0,0) to (5,10)
- Region y: (2,2) to (4,4) (clearly y B z)
- Region x: (6,3) to (8,7)

For x NE y, we check:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 3 ❌ This doesn't work.

That's right. For x NE y, not only does x have to be to the east of y, but it also needs to be to the north of y!

Let me revise the example:
- Region z: (0,0) to (5,10)
- Region y: (2,2) to (4,4) (clearly y B z)
- Region x: (6,5) to (8,7)

For x NE y, we check:
- supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- supy(y) = 4 <= infy(x) = 5 ✓

For x E z, we check:
- supx(z) = 5 <= infx(x) = 6 ✓
- infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 5 ✓
- supy(x) = 7 <= supy(z) = 10 ✓

So, with these dimensions, x is NE of y and x is E of z. So x can indeed be E of z.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

Actually, I just realized that there's a cardinal direction relation which I haven't been considering properly, which is the multi-tile case. A cardinal direction could be a combination of tiles, like NE:E or N:NE:E. Given the definition in the problem, I should be considering only single-tile relations: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE. So my current conclusion is correct.

So my final answer is the possible relations between x and z are: B, N, NE, and E.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is B of region z

From "x NE y", we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is strictly east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly north of y)

From "y B z", we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within x-bounds of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is within y-bounds of z)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. B (Bounding box):
   - If z is large enough to contain both y and x within its bounding box
   - Example: z (0,0)-(10,10), y (2,2)-(4,4), x (7,7)-(9,9)

2. NE (Northeast):
   - If z is positioned such that x is strictly northeast of it
   - Example: z (0,0)-(5,5), y (2,2)-(4,4), x (6,6)-(8,8)

3. N (North):
   - If x is directly north of z but overlaps with z in the east-west direction
   - Example: z (0,0)-(10,5), y (2,2)-(4,4), x (3,6)-(8,8)

4. E (East):
   - If x is directly east of z but overlaps with z in the north-south direction
   - Example: z (0,0)-(5,10), y (2,2)-(4,4), x (6,5)-(8,7)

The possible relations are: B, N, NE, E
