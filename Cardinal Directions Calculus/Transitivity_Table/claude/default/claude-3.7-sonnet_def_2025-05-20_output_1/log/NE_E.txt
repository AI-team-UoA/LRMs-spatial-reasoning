PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step-by-step.

Given information:
- x is NE of y
- y is E of z

We need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

First, let's recall the definitions of these cardinal directions:

x NE y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

y E z means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y has vertical overlap with z)

Now, let's reason about the relationship between x and z.

From x NE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's combine these constraints:

From supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), we can deduce:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
This means x is to the east of z.

Now for the north-south relationship:
- From y E z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
- From x NE y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x)

Combining these:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

However, this doesn't definitively tell us whether x is entirely north of z or has some vertical overlap with z.

Let's consider a few cases:

Case 1: If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is entirely north of z, which means x NE z.

Case 2: If infy(x) <= supy(z), then x has some vertical overlap with z. Given that x is to the east of z, this would mean x E z.

Case 3: If x is positioned such that it's completely contained within the northern extension of z, but also to the east, then x NE z.

Case 4: If x extends beyond the northern boundary of z but also has some vertical overlap, it's a combination of N and E, which is NE.

Hmm, I think I need to be more careful and precise. Let me reconsider the definitions and the implications.

From x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

The east-west relationship is clear: x is to the east of z because:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

For the north-south relationship:
- From y E z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
- From x NE y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x)

So we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

This doesn't give us a direct inequality between infy(x) and supy(z). So, there are two possibilities:

1. infy(x) > supy(z): This means x is entirely north of z, so combined with the east constraint, x is NE of z.

2. infy(x) <= supy(z): This means x has some vertical overlap with z. Since x is to the east of z, the relation would be E.

Wait, I think I'm slightly complicating things. Let's just consider the possible positions of x relative to z based on the constraints from the given relations.

From our established constraints:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)
3. infy(z) <= infy(y) (z stretches at least as far south as y)
4. supy(y) <= supy(z) (z stretches at least as far north as y)

These constraints allow for multiple possible positions of x relative to z:

1. x could be entirely north and east of z, which would be NE.
2. x could have some vertical overlap with z but still be to the east, which would be E.

Actually, let's think more carefully about the vertical positioning based on the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x).

From y E z, we know:
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

From x NE y, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

These mean:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)

So, infy(z) <= infy(x). But this doesn't tell us whether infy(x) is greater than or less than supy(z).

If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is completely north of z, so the relation is NE.
If infy(x) <= supy(z), then there's vertical overlap, so the relation is E.

Furthermore, if infy(x) <= supy(z), there are additional constraints for where x can be positioned. It could be:
- Entirely within the vertical extent of z, which is E.
- Partly overlapping with the upper part of z and extending northward, which is still E.
- Completely within the northern half of z, which is also E.

In all these cases, the relation would be E, as long as infy(x) <= supy(z) and x is to the east of z.

So, the possible relations are NE and E.

Actually, now that I think of it, there could be another possibility:

Since x is NE of y, and y is E of z, we know x is to the north of y, and y is to the east of z. But we don't have a direct constraint on the northern extent of z. If supy(z) is large enough, x might actually be contained within the vertical range of z, making x E of z.

Let me double check by drawing my own simple example.

Let's make z the reference box, and place y to the east of z. Then, place x to the northeast of y.

Z:
```
+------+
|      |
|  z   |
|      |
+------+
```

Y (to the east of z):
```
+------+    +---+
|      |    |   |
|  z   |    | y |
|      |    |   |
+------+    +---+
```

X (to the northeast of y):
```
            +---+
            | x |
            +---+
+------+    +---+
|      |    |   |
|  z   |    | y |
|      |    |   |
+------+    +---+
```

In this configuration, x is NE of z.

But, I can also imagine a scenario where z extends further northward:

```
+------+
|      |
|      |    +---+
|  z   |    | x |
|      |    +---+
|      |    +---+
|      |    |   |
+------+    | y |
            |   |
            +---+
```

In this configuration, x is E of z.

So, based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (if x is entirely north of z)
- E (if x has some vertical overlap with z)

Actually, let me double-check one more time to ensure these are the only possible relations.

From our established constraints, we know that:

1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)
3. infy(z) <= infy(y) (z stretches at least as far south as y)
4. supy(y) <= supy(z) (z stretches at least as far north as y)

Let me check if x can be SE of z. For that, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (already satisfied)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From the constraints, we have:
- infy(x) >= supy(y) (from constraint 2)
- infy(y) >= infy(z) (from constraint 3)

Since infy(x) >= supy(y) and regions have non-zero height, we know that supy(x) > supy(y). And since infy(y) >= infy(z), it's possible that infy(z) < supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x). In that case, it wouldn't be true that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x can't be SE of z.

Can x be NE of z? Yes, as I already showed with an example.

Can x be E of z? For this, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (already satisfied)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the constraints, we have:
- infy(x) >= supy(y) (from constraint 2)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from constraint 3)

Since infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), we can't determine if infy(z) <= infy(x) based on just these constraints. But we can imagine a scenario where infy(z) is much smaller than infy(y), making it so that infy(z) <= infy(x). So, it's possible for x to be E of z.

For supy(x) <= supy(z), there's no direct constraint. But if z has a large enough vertical extent, this constraint can be satisfied. So, E is a possibility.

Let's check if there are other possible relations.

Can x be in the NW, W, or SW tiles relative to z? No, because we established that x is to the east of z.

Can x be in the S tile relative to z? For this, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

But we've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x can't be S of z.

Can x be in the N tile relative to z? For this, we would need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Again, supx(z) <= infx(x) is already established, which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x can't be N of z.

Can x be in the B tile relative to z? For this, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

But, as before, supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x can't be B of z.

Actually, let's carefully check if x can also be in the NE tile. For this, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

The first constraint is already established. For the second constraint, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from constraint 2)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from constraint 4)

From these, we can't conclusively derive that supy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(z) > supy(y), then we can have infy(x) > supy(y) but infy(x) <= supy(z). In such a case, x would not be in the NE tile relative to z, but rather in the E tile.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE
- E

Actually, let me check if x can also be in the SE tile. For this, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The first constraint is already established. For the second constraint, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from constraint 2)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from constraint 3)

If infy(z) >= supy(x), then x would be in the SE tile relative to z. But from the constraints, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x), meaning that infy(x) is above supy(y). Given that regions have a non-zero height, supy(x) is even higher than infy(x).

Now, infy(z) <= infy(y) implies that infy(z) is below or at the same level as infy(y). There's no constraint that directly relates infy(z) to supy(y), but we can imagine a scenario where z has a small vertical extent, such that infy(z) is just slightly below infy(y) and supy(z) is only slightly above infy(y). In such a case, infy(z) < infy(y) < supy(y) < infy(x) < supy(x). This would mean infy(z) << supy(x), and the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) is not satisfied. So, x can't be SE of z.

By the way, let me double-check if x could be NE of z.

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (already established)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from constraint 2)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from constraint 4)

We cannot clearly infer whether supy(z) <= infy(x) or supy(z) > infy(x) from the given constraints. If supy(z) <= infy(x) (Z doesn't stretch too far north), then x is NE of z. Otherwise, if supy(z) > infy(x) (Z stretches further north than the lower edge of x), then x has some vertical overlap with z, and thus, x is E of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (if z doesn't stretch too far north)
- E (if z stretches further north, allowing for vertical overlap with x)

Let me double check that these are the only possible relations given the constraints.

Can x be in the S tile relative to z? For this, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

But we know that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement that supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

Can x be in the SE tile relative to z? For this, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

The first constraint is already established. For the second constraint, we know that supy(y) <= infy(x) (from constraint 2) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from constraint 3). But we don't have a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z). If infy(z) <= infy(y) << infy(x) <= supy(x), then x is higher than infy(z), which means it's not in the SE tile. But if z's vertical extent is thin (i.e., infy(z) ≈ supy(z)) and z is positioned such that supy(y) <= supy(z) ≈ infy(z), then supy(x) <= infy(z) and x is in the SE tile relative to z.

Actually, this seems a bit off. let me draw a simple example to verify.

Let's represent infy(a) as a⊥ and supy(a) as a⊤, and similarly for the x-coordinates.

Given constraints:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) (from the fact that regions are connected)
3. supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
6. supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

If z and y look like:
```
z⊤
 +------+
 |      |
 |  z   |
 |      |
z⊥+------+    y⊤
                +---+
                |   |
                | y |
                |   |
              y⊥+---+
```

And if x is NE of y:
```
                x⊤
              +---+
              |   |
              | x |
              |   |
            x⊥+---+
z⊤
 +------+
 |      |
 |  z   |
 |      |
z⊥+------+    y⊤
                +---+
                |   |
                | y |
                |   |
              y⊥+---+
```

Here, x is NE of z.

But if z extends further north:
```
                x⊤
              +---+
              |   |
              | x |
              |   |
z⊤         x⊥+---+
 +------+
 |      |
 |  z   |
 |      |
z⊥+------+    y⊤
                +---+
                |   |
                | y |
                |   |
              y⊥+---+
```

Here, x is E of z.

Not let me check if SE is possible. For that, x would need to be below z:
```
z⊤
 +------+
 |      |
 |  z   |
 |      |
z⊥+------+    y⊤
                +---+
                |   |
                | y |     x⊤
                |   |   +---+
              y⊥+---+   |   |
                        | x |
                        |   |
                      x⊥+---+
```

But this violates the constraint that supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y). So, x cannot be SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given the constraints, are:
- NE
- E

Let me check one more time using the formal definitions.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

For x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the constraints, we have:
1. supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
2. supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
3. supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From (1) and (2), we get supx(z) <= infx(x), which ensures the east condition for both NE and E.

For the north condition of NE, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). From (3) and (5), we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). These don't conclusively tell us if supy(z) <= infy(x). 

If supy(z) is at or just above supy(y), then supy(z) can be less than or equal to infy(x), making NE a possible relation. But if supy(z) is much higher than supy(y), such that supy(z) > infy(x), then x would have some vertical overlap with z and the relation would be E.

For the north condition of E, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). 

From (3) and (4), we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). These don't directly tell us if infy(z) <= infy(x). However, if infy(z) is much smaller than infy(y), such that infy(z) < infy(y) << supy(y) <= infy(x), then infy(z) <= infy(x), making the first part of the north condition for E.

For the second part, supy(x) <= supy(z), there's no direct constraint from the given information. If supy(z) is high enough, then this condition is satisfied.

So, depending on the exact values, both NE and E are potential relations between x and z.

Actually, let me analyze one more time:

From the constraints, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z)
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x NE y)
- Therefore, supx(z) <= infx(x).

This means x is to the east of z.

Let's consider the vertical position:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)

We cannot directly determine the north-south relationship between x and z from these. But we can infer two possibilities:
1. If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is entirely north of z.
2. If supy(z) > infy(x), then there's vertical overlap between x and z.

In case 1, the relation is NE.
In case 2, the relation could be E if the other condition for E is met: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From the constraints, infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.

For supy(x) <= supy(z), there's no direct constraint. If supy(z) is large enough, this is satisfied.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (if supy(z) <= infy(x))
- E (if supy(z) > infy(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z))

Actually I made a small error. We can simplify the reasoning:

- supx(z) <= infx(x) (we already established this)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) (from y E z and x NE y)

This gives us infy(z) <= infy(x), meaning the lower bound of x is above or at the same level as the lower bound of z.

Looking back at the definition of E, the vertical constraint is:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x). So, if supy(x) <= supy(z), then x would be E of z. If supy(x) > supy(z), then we'd need to determine the precise relation.

Actually, let's consider the definition of NE:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (already established)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x would be NE of z.

So, it boils down to:
- If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NE of z.
- If supy(z) > infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.
- If supy(z) > infy(x) and supy(x) > supy(z), then what is the relation?

Actually, looking back the the definitions of simple directions, only the center to center vector matters. I only care about the 9 tiles. This means in the third case I'm considering, it would be NE, since I've placed x in the NE sector of the plane with respect to z's center.

Let me rethink this. I'm given two constraints, and I want to infer the possible relationships between x and z:
1. x NE y
2. y E z

From these, I've established the following in terms of the bounds:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the lower bound of x is above or at the same level as the lower bound of z)

Using the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

For NE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (undetermined from the given constraints)

For E, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (satisfied)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (partially satisfied)

Let me try to narrow this down further.

From our constraints, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

Without further information, we can't determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) or supy(z) > infy(x).

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x would be NE of z.

If supy(z) > infy(x), then the NE condition isn't satisfied. In this case, x is overlapping with z vertically. For x to be E of z, we'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) (which is satisfied) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Without further constraints, we can't determine if supy(x) <= supy(z) or supy(x) > supy(z).

Actually, I think I was overthinking this. Let's reconsider.

1. x NE y means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)

2. y E z means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (combining the first constraint from both relations), so x is to the east of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) (combining the north constraints), so x's lower bound is above z's lower bound.

We know x is to the east of z and x's lower bound is above z's lower bound. The remaining question is where x's upper bound is in relation to z's upper bound.

If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is entirely contained within z's vertical extent (though to the east). This would make the relation E.

If supy(x) > supy(z), then x extends above z. 

Wait, actually let's get back to the definition. NE means:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

And E means:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

So, from our constraints, we've derived:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (This satisfies the first condition for both NE and E)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (This partly satisfies the second condition for E)

We don't know if supy(z) <= infy(x) or if supy(x) <= supy(z).

If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is in the NE tile relative to z.
If supy(z) > infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is in the E tile relative to z.

Wait, what if supy(z) > infy(x) and supy(x) > supy(z)? Where does x lie then?

In this case, x would partially overlap with z vertically, while being to the east of z. But neither the NE nor the E conditions are fully met. Let me examine the definitions more closely to see if there's another relation that fits this situation.

Wait, this isn't right. I think I'm mixing the definitions. Let's start with x NE y:
- x is to the northeast of y
  - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
  - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

And y E z:
- y is to the east of z
  - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y has vertical overlap with z)

We can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x) (so x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x) (so x's lower bound is above z's lower bound)

If we go by the definitions:

For NE, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (we've already established this)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (we don't know this for sure)

From the constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). But this doesn't tell us for sure whether supy(z) <= infy(x) or supy(z) > infy(x).

Using a graphical representation at the extreme case (not to scale):
```
                x⊤
              +---+
              |   |
              | x |
              |   |
z⊤         x⊥+---+
 +------+
 |      |
 |  z   |
 |      |
z⊥+------+    y⊤
                +---+
                |   |
                | y |
                |   |
              y⊥+---+
```

In this case, supy(z) > infy(x), so x would not be NE of z.

For E, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (we've already established this)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know for sure if supy(x) <= supy(z). In the above graphical representation, it looks like supy(x) < supy(z), so x would be E of z.

But, if z's upper bound is just slightly above y's, and x's upper bound is quite high, we might have supy(x) > supy(z). In that case, x would overlap with z vertically from below, but would extend above z. This doesn't fit cleanly into the NE or E relation.

Let me reconsider again:

From the constraints, we know x is to the east of z, and x's lower bound is above z's lower bound. 

1. If supy(z) <= infy(x), x is NE of z.
2. If supy(z) > infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), x is E of z.
3. If supy(z) > infy(x) and supy(x) > supy(z), the relation doesn't neatly fit into NE or E.

Let's think about this more carefully. If we consider the definitions again:

x NE z means:
- x is strictly in the northeast of z.
  - z is to the southwest of x.
  - Points in x are all to the north and east of points in z.

x E z means:
- x is strictly to the east of z.
  - z is to the west of x.
  - Points in x are all to the east of points in z.
  - x and z may overlap vertically, but not horizontally.

Let's say we're in case 3, where supy(z) > infy(x) and supy(x) > supy(z). 

In this case, there could be points in x that are to the north and east of all points in z (the portions of x above supy(z)), and there could be points in x that are just to the east of points in z (the portions of x below supy(z) but above infy(x)).

So, it seems like the relation in case 3 is a combination of NE and E. If we allow multi-tile descriptions, it would be "NE : E" to indicate that x spans both the NE and E tiles relative to z.

Actually wait. I've been confusing myself, because I don't think I understand the problem correctly. Let me reread the original problem to see what it's asking.

Actually, let's examine the definitions one more time:

1. x NE y means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)

2. y E z means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Actually, the way the cardinal directions are defined for regions, the region must be entirely within one of the 9 tiles (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B) with respect to the reference region. If a region spans multiple tiles, then the relation would be a combination of these tiles.

So, what we're looking for is the possible tiles that x can occupy with respect to z, given that x NE y and y E z.

We've established two facts:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) (x's lower bound is above z's lower bound)

From the first fact, we know that x can only be in one of the eastern tiles relative to z: NE, E, or SE.

From the second fact, we know x can't be in the S or SE tiles. So, x can only be in the NE or E tiles.

Now, to distinguish between NE and E, we'd look at the vertical relationship. For x to be in the NE tile, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). For x to be in the E tile, we'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) (which is satisfied) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Given our constrints, both NE and E are possible. So the possible relations between x and z are NE and E.

Actually, I need to be more careful. For a cardinal directions, there's a notion of a single-tile cardinal direction relation and their disjunctions. Let me reconsider.

For a region to be in the NE tile with respect to another region, it means that the region x is entirely to the northeast of the region z. In other words, all points in x are to the north and east of all points in z.

Similarly, for a region to be in the E tile with respect to another region, it means that the region x is entirely to the east of the region z, and there is a vertical overlap between x and z.

Now let me figure out is x NE z is possible. For x NE z

1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supy(z) <= infy(x)

From our constraints, we know (1) holds. We're not sure about (2). If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x NE z is possible.

Now, let's check if x E z is possible.

For x E z: 

1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints, we know (1) holds and infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied. If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x E z is possible.

So, both NE and E are possible relations between x and z, depending on the exact positions and extents of the regions.

Let me check if there's another possible relation I haven't considered.

For x to be in the SE tile with respect to z, we'd need:
1. supx(z) <= infx(x)
2. supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints, we know (1) holds. But for (2), we've already derived that infy(z) <= infy(x). Since regions have non-zero height, supy(x) > infy(x) > infy(z). This contradicts the requirement for x to be in the SE tile, which is supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x can't be in the SE tile.

For x to be in the N tile with respect to z, we'd need:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x)
2. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

From our constraints, (1) might hold (as we've discussed), but (2) doesn't. We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means that infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) can't be true. So, x can't be in the N tile.

For x to be in the S, SW, W, or NW tile with respect to z, one of the requirements would be that either x is to the west of z (for SW, W, NW) or x is entirely below z (for S). But we've already established that x is to the east of z and x's lower bound is above z's lower bound. So, x can't be in any of these tiles.

For x to be in the B tile with respect to z, we'd need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
2. infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

From our constraints, we know that supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts (1). So, x can't be in the B tile.

So in conclusion, the possible relations between x and z, given that x NE y and y E z, are:
- NE
- E

This aligns with our earlier conclusion. So, the answer is that x can be either NE of z or E of z, depending on the exact positions and extents of the regions.

Actually I realized I was overthinking things. Let me make a simple example:

Given that:
1. x NE y
2. y E z

Let me draw a simple case where x is NE of z:
```
                x⊤
              +---+
              |   |
              | x |
              |   |
            x⊥+---+
z⊤
 +------+
 |      |
 |  z   |
 |      |
z⊥+------+    y⊤
                +---+
                |   |
                | y |
                |   |
              y⊥+---+
```

This clearly shows that it's possible for x to be NE of z.

Let's make a simple case where x is E of z:
```
z⊤
 +------+
 |      |    y⊤      x⊤
 |  z   |    +---+  +---+
 |      |    |   |  |   |
 |      |    | y |  | x |
 |      |    |   |  |   |
z⊥+------+  y⊥+---+x⊥+---+
```

In this case, x and z have vertical overlap, and x is to the east of z, so x is E of z.

Are there other possibilities?

What if z extends higher than shown in the first example, but not high enough to reach x? x would still be NE of z.

What if z extends lower than shown in the second example? As long as x is entirely to the east of z and there's vertical overlap, x is E of z.

What if z is tall enough that it has some vertical overlap with x, but x also extends above z?
```
               x⊤
              +---+
              |   |
z⊤           | x |
 +------+    |   |
 |      |  x⊥+---+
 |  z   |   y⊤
 |      |   +---+
 |      |   |   |
 |      |   | y |
 |      |   |   |
z⊥+------+ y⊥+---+
```

In this case, x is not entirely to the NE of z, nor is it entirely E of z. It's both. For the notion of a single-tile cardinal direction, x would be E of z.

But I think we're supposed to be looking for single-tile relations.

So the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE (if x is entirely to the northeast of z)
- E (if x has vertical overlap with z while being to the east)

Let me double-check to be sure.

If x is completely above z, does that by definition mean x is to the north of z? Not necessarily. For x to be N of z, it would need to be directly above z, with horizontal overlap. Since x is to the east of z, it can't be N of z. If x is both above and to the east of z, it's NE of z.

I've checked the definitions and indeed, if x is to the north and east of region z (entirely), then x is NE of z. If x has vertical overlap with z while being to the east of z, then x is E of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z, given that x NE y and y E z, are:
- NE
- E

I'm confident in this answer.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

- NE
- E

I derived this by using the definitions and constraints:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y has vertical overlap with z)

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) → x is east of z
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x) → x's lower bound is above z's lower bound

This means x is definitely east of z, but the vertical relationship depends on whether:
- If supy(z) ≤ infy(x): x is completely north of z → NE relation
- If supy(z) > infy(x) and there's vertical overlap: x is E of z
