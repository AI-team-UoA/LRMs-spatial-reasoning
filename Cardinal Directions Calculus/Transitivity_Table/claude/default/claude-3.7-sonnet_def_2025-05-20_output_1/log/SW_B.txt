PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, let's understand what we know:
- Region x is SW of region y, which means:
  * supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
  * supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

- Region y is B of region z, which means:
  * infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's minimum x is greater than or equal to z's minimum x)
  * supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's maximum x is less than or equal to z's maximum x)
  * infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's minimum y is greater than or equal to z's minimum y)
  * supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's maximum y is less than or equal to z's maximum y)

Now, we want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's consider what we can deduce about the relative positions of x and z.

From x being SW of y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y being B of z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's see if we can derive the relationship between x and z:

Regarding the x-coordinates:
- We know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x SW y)
- And infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

We can't directly relate supx(x) and infx(z) from these inequalities. It's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z), meaning x is to the west of z. But it's also possible that infx(z) < supx(x), meaning there's some overlap in the x-coordinates of x and z.

Regarding the y-coordinates:
- We know supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SW y)
- And infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)

Again, we can't directly relate supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), meaning x is to the south of z. But it's also possible that infy(z) < supy(x), meaning there's some overlap in the y-coordinates of x and z.

Given these possibilities, region x could be related to region z in multiple ways.

Let's consider the possible relationships:

1. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SW of z.
2. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is W of z.
3. If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then x is NW of z.
4. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is S of z.
5. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is S of z.
6. If supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z.
7. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is B of z.
8. If supx(z) < infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x is E of z.
9. If supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(z) < infy(x), then x is NE of z.
10. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) < infy(x), then x is N of z.
11. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) < infy(x), then x is N of z.

But we need to check if all of these are consistent with the given constraints.

Actually, I need to be more careful here. Let me reconsider the constraints we have:

1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x SW y)
2. supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SW y)
3. infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
4. supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From 1 and 3, we get:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
But this doesn't give us a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z).

From 2 and 5, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
But again, this doesn't give us a direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z).

So, we can't determine a definitive relation between x and z based on the information given.

Let me approach this differently. Given the constraints, what are the scenarios that can occur?

First, let's visualize a simple case:

Suppose:
- Region z is a large square with a corner at the origin (0, 0).
- Region y is a smaller square, strictly inside z, with a corner at (1, 1).
- Region x is a small square southwest of y.

Given the constraints:
- x is SW of y
- y is B of z

We know:
- y is inside z
- x is southwest of y

So, x could be:
- SW of z, if x is completely outside the boundary of z.
- S of z, if x is in the south part of z but has some overlap in the x-direction.
- W of z, if x is in the west part of z but has some overlap in the y-direction.
- B of z, if x is completely inside z.

Let's try another example:

Suppose:
- Region z is a large square with a corner at the origin (0, 0).
- Region y is a smaller square, also with a corner at the origin (0, 0) but extends less in the x and y directions.
- Region x is a small square southwest of y.

In this case, x would definitely be SW of z.

The key insight here is that y being B of z means y is inside z. And x being SW of y means x is southwest of y. The relation between x and z depends on the specific positioning and sizes of the regions, which we don't know.

Let's list out the possible relations based on the scenarios:

x could be:
- SW of z
- S of z
- W of z
- B of z

Now, let's double-check whether these are the only possible relations.

Can x be SE of z?
If x is SW of y and y is inside z, then x cannot be in the SE of z because x is already to the west of y.

Similarly, x cannot be E, NE, or N of z.

Could x be NW of z?
If x is SW of y, then x is south of y. If y is inside z, then y is also south of the north boundary of z. So, x cannot be north of z, which means x cannot be NW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW of z
- S of z
- W of z
- B of z

Actually, let me revisit this. I'm not entirely sure if the list I provided is exhaustive or correct. Let me check again systematically.

Region x is SW of region y, which means:
- x is south of y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- x is west of y: supx(x) <= infx(y)

Region y is B of region z, which means y is inside z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z.

1. SW Relation: x is SW of z if:
   - x is west of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - x is south of z: supy(x) <= infy(z)

   Given our constraints:
   From x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
   From y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y)
   
   These mean: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
   
   We can't definitively say supx(x) <= infx(z), so x may or may not be west of z.
   
   Similarly, for the y-coordinate:
   From x SW y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
   From y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y)
   
   These mean: supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
   
   We can't definitively say supy(x) <= infy(z), so x may or may not be south of z.
   
   So, x can be SW of z, but that's not guaranteed.

2. S Relation: x is S of z if:
   - x is south of z: supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - x has some x-overlap with z: infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(z) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (or x is completely within the x-span of z)
   
   Given our constraints, as we've seen, x may or may not be south of z. And for the x-overlap, we can't derive a direct relation from the given constraints.
   
   So, x can be S of z, but that's not guaranteed.

3. W Relation: x is W of z if:
   - x is west of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - x has some y-overlap with z: infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z) or infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) (or x is completely within the y-span of z)
   
   Given our constraints, as we've seen, x may or may not be west of z. And for the y-overlap, we can't derive a direct relation from the given constraints.
   
   So, x can be W of z, but that's not guaranteed.

4. B Relation: x is B of z if:
   - x is inside z: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   Given our constraints, we can't derive a direct relation to determine if x is inside z.
   
   So, x can be B of z, but that's not guaranteed.

5. SE Relation: x is SE of z if:
   - x is south of z: supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - x is east of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
   
   Given our constraints, as we've seen, x may or may not be south of z.
   
   For the east relation, we have:
   From x SW y: supx(x) <= infx(y)
   From y B z: supx(y) <= supx(z)
   
   These mean: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
   
   There's no direct relation between supx(z) and infx(x) that we can derive.
   
   So, I made a mistake earlier. x can potentially be SE of z.

6. E Relation: x is E of z if:
   - x is east of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - x has some y-overlap with z
   
   Given our constraints, we can't rule out the possibility that x is east of z.
   
   So, x can be E of z, but that's not guaranteed.

7. NE Relation: x is NE of z if:
   - x is north of z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - x is east of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
   
   For the north relation, we have:
   From x SW y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
   From y B z: supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   These mean: supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   From this, we can derive: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   So, supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   Now, for x to be north of z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   But we've just derived: supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   It's not possible for both supy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true, unless x is a very specific region where infy(x) = supy(x) and supy(x) = supy(z). But in that case, x would be a line, not a closed, connected region as defined. So, x cannot be NE of z.

8. N Relation: x is N of z if:
   - x is north of z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - x has some x-overlap with z
   
   As we've seen, x cannot be north of z, so x cannot be N of z.

9. NW Relation: x is NW of z if:
   - x is north of z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - x is west of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   As we've seen, x cannot be north of z, so x cannot be NW of z.

So, after this more careful analysis, I'd say the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- W
- B
- SE
- E

Let me double-check these:

Actually, let's be more careful. Let me use the transitive properties of the relations directly.

Given:
- x is SW of y: this means x is both south and west of y.
- y is B of z: this means y is inside z.

Now, let's consider the possible relations between x and z:

1. x could be SW of z if x is both south and west of z. Since y is inside z, and x is southwest of y, it's possible that x is southwest of z. This is a valid possibility.

2. x could be S of z if x is south of z but not west or east of z. Since y is inside z, and x is south of y, it's possible that x is south of z. This is a valid possibility.

3. x could be W of z if x is west of z but not south or north of z. Since y is inside z, and x is west of y, it's possible that x is west of z. This is a valid possibility.

4. x could be B of z if x is inside z. Since y is inside z, and x is southwest of y, it's possible that x is still inside z (if z is large enough). This is a valid possibility.

5. Can x be SE of z? If x is southwest of y, then x is west of y. If y is inside z, then y is west of the eastern boundary of z. By transitivity, x is west of the eastern boundary of z. So, x cannot be east of z, which means x cannot be SE of z.

6. Similarly, x cannot be E, NE, N, or NW of z by similar reasoning.

So, after this reconsideration, I believe the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- W
- B

Actually wait, I don't think this was quite right yet. Let me be very systematic here, using the definitions and the given constraints.

Given:
- x is SW of y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y is B of z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

For x to be in relation R with z, we need to check if the defining conditions of R are satisfied given the constraints.

Let's check each relation:

1. x is SW of z if: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   From the constraints, we have:
   supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
   supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
   
   We can't directly derive that supx(x) <= infx(z) or supy(x) <= infy(z). But they are possible.
   
   So, x can be SW of z, but it's not guaranteed.

2. x is S of z if: supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   From the constraints, we can't derive these conditions directly. But they are possible.
   
   So, x can be S of z, but it's not guaranteed.

3. x is W of z if: supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   From the constraints, we can't derive these conditions directly. But they are possible.
   
   So, x can be W of z, but it's not guaranteed.

4. x is B of z if: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   From the constraints, we can't derive these conditions directly. But they are possible.
   
   So, x can be B of z, but it's not guaranteed.

5. x is SE of z if: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   From the constraints, we have:
   supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
   
   This leads to: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
   
   So, supx(x) <= supx(z). For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). It's not possible for both supx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) to be true simultaneously, unless x is a very specific region where infx(x) = supx(x) and supx(x) = supx(z). But in that case, x would be a line, not a closed, connected region as defined.
   
   So, x cannot be SE of z.

6. x is E of z if: supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   As we've shown, supx(x) <= supx(z). For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). It's not possible for both to be true simultaneously.
   
   So, x cannot be E of z.

7. x is NE of z if: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   As we've shown, supx(x) <= supx(z). For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). It's not possible for both to be true simultaneously.
   
   So, x cannot be NE of z.

8. x is N of z if: supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   From the constraints, we have:
   supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   This leads to: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   So, supy(x) <= supy(z). For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). It's not possible for both supy(x) <= supy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) to be true simultaneously, unless x is a line.
   
   So, x cannot be N of z.

9. x is NW of z if: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   As we've shown, supy(x) <= supy(z). For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). It's not possible for both to be true simultaneously, unless x is a line.
   
   So, x cannot be NW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- W
- B

Great, now I'm confident this is right.

Let's double check:

Let's refer back to the definitions:

Region x is SW of region y, which means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

Region y is B of region z, which means y is inside z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's systematically check each cardinal direction:

1. SW:
   - For x to be SW of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Given the constraints: supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can't definitively say supx(x) <= infx(z).
   - Similarly, from supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we can't definitively say supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - But these conditions might be satisfied in some specific cases. For example, if infx(z) = infx(y) and infy(z) = infy(y), then x would definitely be SW of z.
   - So, x can be SW of z.

2. S:
   - For x to be S of z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - From the constraints, we can't definitively derive these conditions.
   - But they might be satisfied in some specific cases. For example, if y is positioned such that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and infy(z) = infy(y), then x would be S of z.
   - So, x can be S of z.

3. W:
   - For x to be W of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From the constraints, we can't definitively derive these conditions.
   - But they might be satisfied in some specific cases.
   - So, x can be W of z.

4. B:
   - For x to be B of z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From the constraints, we can't definitively derive these conditions.
   - But they might be satisfied in some specific cases. For example, if z is large enough, then x might be inside z.
   - So, x can be B of z.

5. SE:
   - For x to be SE of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From the constraints, we have:
     * supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x SW y)
     * supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
   - We cannot derive supx(z) <= infx(x) from these. In fact, based on the transitive property, we would have supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). So, supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), which would mean supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which would mean supx(z) <= supx(x).
   - This contradicts the derived constraint that supx(x) <= supx(z), unless supx(x) = supx(z).
   - However, for a region, we can't have infx(x) = supx(x) (unless x is a vertical line, which isn't a region in the context provided).
   - So, x cannot be SE of z.

6. E:
   - Using the same logic as for SE, x cannot be E of z.

7. NE:
   - For x to be NE of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - As we saw with SE, it's not possible to have supx(z) <= infx(x) given the constraints.
   - So, x cannot be NE of z.

8. N:
   - For x to be N of z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - From the constraints, we have:
     * supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x SW y)
     * supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)
   - We cannot derive supy(z) <= infy(x) from these. In fact, based on the transitive property, we would have supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So, supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), which would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which would mean supy(z) <= supy(x).
   - This contradicts the derived constraint that supy(x) <= supy(z), unless supy(x) = supy(z).
   - However, for a region, we can't have infy(x) = supy(x) (unless x is a horizontal line, which isn't a region in the context provided).
   - So, x cannot be N of z.

9. NW:
   - Using the same logic as for N, x cannot be NW of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW
- S
- W
- B

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is B of z: This means infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Analyzing each possible relation:

1. SW: Region x can be SW of z. This occurs when both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

2. S: Region x can be S of z. This occurs when supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and x has x-coordinate overlap with z.

3. W: Region x can be W of z. This occurs when supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and x has y-coordinate overlap with z.

4. B: Region x can be B of z (inside z). This is possible if z is large enough to contain both y and x.

5. For other relations (SE, E, NE, N, NW): These are impossible because x is southwest of y, and y is inside z. This positioning prevents x from being east or north of z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, W, B
