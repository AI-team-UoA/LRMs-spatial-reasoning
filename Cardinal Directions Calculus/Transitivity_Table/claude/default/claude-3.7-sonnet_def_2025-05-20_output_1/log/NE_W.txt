PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down this problem:

1. Region x is NE of region y. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. Region y is W of region z. This means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-coordinates are within z's y-coordinates range)

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's think step by step.

From the information we have:
- Region x is east of y
- Region y is west of z

So, in terms of the x-coordinate:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)

This doesn't directly tell us the relation between x and z along the x-axis. x could be west of z, overlap with z, or be east of z.

In terms of the y-coordinate:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-coordinates are within z's y-coordinates range)

From these, we can deduce that:
infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)

This means supy(z) might be less than infy(x), in which case x would be north of z.
But it's also possible that infy(x) <= supy(z), in which case x and z would overlap in the y-dimension.

Now let's list out the possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z:

1. **N (North)**: 
   - This would require x to be directly north of z, with their x-coordinates overlapping.
   - For this to be true, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-coordinates are within z's x-coordinates range).
   - And supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z).
   - Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be north of z if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

2. **NE (North East)**:
   - This would require x to be north and east of z.
   - For this to be true, supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z).
   - And supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z).
   - Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be northeast of z if supx(z) <= infx(x).

3. **E (East)**:
   - This would require x to be directly east of z, with their y-coordinates overlapping.
   - For this to be true, supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z).
   - And infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-coordinates are within z's y-coordinates range).
   - Given the constraints, it's possible for x to be east of z if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Are there any other possibilities? Let's continue to check.

4. **SE (South East)**:
   - This would require x to be south and east of z.
   - For this to be true, supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z).
   - And supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z).
   - Given our constraint that infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), it follows that infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - But we know infy(x) > supy(y) >= infy(z), so it's impossible for supy(x) to be less than infy(z).
   - Therefore, x cannot be south-east of z.

5. **S (South)**:
   - Similar to the argument for SE, for x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - But we know infy(x) > supy(y) >= infy(z), so it's impossible for supy(x) to be less than infy(z).
   - Therefore, x cannot be south of z.

6. **SW (South West)**:
   - This would require x to be south and west of z.
   - For this to be true, supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z).
   - And supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z).
   - We've already established that x cannot be south of z.
   - Also, given the constraints, it seems like x is more likely to be east of z than west.
   - However, the constraints don't strictly rule out the possibility of x being west of z. So, I'll check this further.

7. **W (West)**:
   - This would require x to be directly west of z, with their y-coordinates overlapping.
   - For this to be true, supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z).
   - And infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-coordinates are within z's y-coordinates range).
   - We know that supx(y) <= infx(x) (from the first constraint).
   - We also know that supx(y) <= infx(z) (from the second constraint).
   - These constraints don't directly tell us the relation between infx(x) and infx(z).
   - It's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z), in which case x would be west of z.
   - However, given that x is NE of y and y is W of z, it would mean that x jumped over z to be on its west, which seems unlikely. But let's double check to be sure.

   If x is NE of y, then supx(y) <= infx(x).
   If y is W of z, then supx(y) <= infx(z).
   For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).

   Now, from supx(y) <= infx(x), we know that infx(x) > supx(y). If supx(x) <= infx(z), then infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z). This gives us infx(x) < infx(z).
   
   From supx(y) <= infx(z), we know that infx(z) > supx(y).
   
   Combining these, we get supx(y) < infx(x) < infx(z), which means infx(x) is between supx(y) and infx(z).
   
   Now, for x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). This is not contraindicated by the previous findings. So, x being west of z is a possibility.

   Umm, let's double-check. If x is NE of y, then x is above and to the right of y. If y is W of z, then y is to the left of z. So, x is above and to the right of y, which is to the left of z. Intuitively, this would place x above z, possibly to the right or left of z, depending on the relative positions. 

   Let's revisit more carefully. If x is NE of y, then:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)
   
   If y is W of z, then:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   For x to be W of z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   Given that supx(y) <= infx(x), it means that supx(x) > supx(y). We also know supx(y) <= infx(z). But these constraints don't directly tell us whether supx(x) <= infx(z).

   I think I'm making an error in my reasoning. Let's start afresh.
   
   If x is NE of y, then supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
   If y is W of z, then supx(y) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
   
   From these, we cannot conclusively say whether x is to the left, right, or overlapping with z along the x-axis. However, given that x is to the right of y and y is to the left of z, it's intuitively more likely for x to be somewhere on the right (east) of z or overlapping with it, rather than to its left (west).
   
   Additionally, given that x is above y and y's y-coordinates are within z's y-coordinates range, x is likely to be above or in the same y-coordinate range as z.
   
   Let's reconsider the possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z:

   1. **N (North)**: 
   - This would require infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Given these constraints, it's possible for x to be north of z.

2. **NE (North East)**:
   - This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(z) >= supy(y). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - Given these constraints, it's possible for x to be northeast of z.

3. **E (East)**:
   - This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Given these constraints, it's possible for x to be east of z.

I think I need to be more careful with this analysis.

If x is NE of y, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)  (x is to the north of y)

If y is W of z, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)  (y's y-coordinates are within z's y-coordinates range)

Now let's think about the possible relationships between x and z:

1. **N (North)**: For x to be north of z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - From the constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). 
   - But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x). x could be north of z if supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Also, the constraints don't directly indicate the relation between infx(x) and infx(z) or supx(x) and supx(z). So x being north of z is a possibility.

2. **NE (North East)**: For x to be northeast of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - From the constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), but this doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
   - Similarly, as mentioned for north, the constraints don't directly indicate the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - So, x being northeast of z is a possibility.

3. **E (East)**: For x to be east of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From the constraints, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), but this doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
   - We also know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), which indicates infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), meaning infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Lastly, the constraints don't directly indicate the relation between supy(x) and supy(z). So, x being east of z is a possibility.

4. **SE (South East)**: For x to be southeast of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x). For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Given infy(x) > infy(z), it's possible for supy(x) to be less than infy(z) only if x is a very tall region, spanning from far south of z to far north of z. But that would contradict the constraint that x is NE of y, which implies x is to the north of y.
   - Therefore, it's unlikely for x to be southeast of z. However, the constraints don't strictly rule it out, so I'll include it as a possibility.

5. **S (South)**: For x to be south of z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Similar to the argument for SE, it's unlikely for x to be south of z but the constraints don't strictly rule it out.

6. **SW (South West)**: For x to be southwest of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). This means x and z are both to the east of y. But the constraints don't directly tell us the relation between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - Again, similar to the argument for SE and S, it's unlikely for x to be south of z but the constraints don't strictly rule it out.

7. **W (West)**: For x to be west of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). This means x and z are both to the east of y. But the constraints don't directly tell us the relation between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - We've also established that infy(z) <= infy(x). And the constraints don't directly indicate the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).
   - So, x being west of z is a possibility.

8. **NW (North West)**: For x to be northwest of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Similar to the argument for W, the constraints don't directly rule out the possibility of x being northwest of z.

9. **B (Bounding Box)**: For x to be within the bounding box of z, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've already established that infy(z) <= infy(x). And the constraints don't directly indicate the other relations.
   - So, x being within the bounding box of z is a possibility.

Wait, I'm not thinking clearly I think. Let's try to visualize this based on the definition. 

Given:
- x is NE of y: This means x is in the northeast quadrant of y's reference frame.
- y is W of z: This means y is in the west tile of z's reference frame.

Let me re-read the definitions more carefully:

From the definitions I see:
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So:
- x NE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Visually, we have:
- x is to the right of y (east) and above y (north).
- y is to the left of z (west).
- y's y-coordinate range is within z's y-coordinate range.

This makes it clearer. Given these positions, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's start with the x-coordinate. We know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)

Looking at these two constraints, we can see that both x and z are to the east of y, but we can't directly determine their relative positions. x could be to the east, west, or even overlapping with z in terms of the x-coordinate.

For the y-coordinate, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's y-coordinates are within z's y-coordinates range)

From these, we can deduce:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)
- This implies infy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x's bottom edge is at least as high as z's bottom edge.
- It's possible that x's bottom edge is exactly at z's bottom edge (infy(z) = infy(x)) or higher (infy(z) < infy(x)).

However, these constraints don't tell us about the relation between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(z). So, x could be completely above z (supy(z) <= infy(x)), or it could overlap with z in the y-direction (infy(x) <= supy(z)).

Let's think about it differently. The constraints we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z) [from x NE y and y W z]
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) [from x NE y and y W z]

Given these constraints:

**For the x-coordinate direction**:
- x is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- z is to the east of y: supx(y) <= infx(z)
- But we don't know the direct relation between x and z in the x-coordinate. x could be to the east, west, or even overlapping with z.

**For the y-coordinate direction**:
- x is to the north of y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y's y-coordinates are within z's y-coordinates range: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
- From these, we can infer: infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= infy(x).
- But we don't know the direct relation between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(z). So, x could be completely above z, or it could overlap with z in the y-direction.

Let's now list all possible cardinal directions of x with respect to z:

1. **N (North)**: 
   - Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x) but not the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - Possible. We don't have constraints on the x-coordinate overlap, so this is a valid possibility.

2. **NE (North East)**:
   - Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x) but not the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - Possible. We don't have constraints on the x-coordinate difference, but z may be to the west of x.

3. **E (East)**:
   - Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x) but not the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).
   - Possible. We don't have constraints on the x-coordinate difference, but z may be to the west of x.

4. **SE (South East)**:
   - Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(x) > infy(x) and hence supy(x) > infy(z).
   - Not possible. The y-coordinate requirement can't be met.

5. **S (South)**:
   - Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(x) > infy(x) and hence supy(x) > infy(z).
   - Not possible. The y-coordinate requirement can't be met.

6. **SW (South West)**:
   - Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x), which implies supy(x) > infy(x) and hence supy(x) > infy(z).
   - Not possible. The y-coordinate requirement can't be met.

7. **W (West)**:
   - Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x), so x is to the east of y. And we know supx(y) <= infx(z), so z is also to the east of y.
   - For x to be west of z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z). But the only constraints we have are supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
   - Since x is to the east of y and z is also to the east of y, it's not immediately clear which one (x or z) is further east. So, x being west of z is possible.

8. **NW (North West)**:
   - Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x) but not the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - As discussed in the W case, x being west of z is possible.
   - Possible. We don't have constraints on the x-coordinate difference or the y-coordinate upper bound relation.

9. **B (Bounding Box)**:
   - Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x) but not the relations for the other constraints.
   - Possible. We don't have sufficient constraints to rule it out.

Wait, I think I'm still not reasoning correctly for certain cases. Let me re-check:

For the case where x is **North** of z:
- We know infy(z) <= infy(x).
- For x to be north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But from the constraints, we also have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). So, supy(z) >= supy(y), and the constraints don't directly tell us if supy(z) <= infy(x).
- So, it's possible for x to be north of z if supy(z) <= infy(x).

For the case where x is **South** of z:
- We know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- This implies infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), or simply infy(z) <= infy(x).
- For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). Given infy(z) <= infy(x), this would require supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction.
- Therefore, x cannot be south of z. This rules out S, SE, and SW as possible cardinal directions.

For the case where x is **East** of z:
- For x to be east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). The constraints don't directly tell us this relationship.
- However, given that x is NE of y and y is W of z, it's intuitively likely that x is east of z or at least overlaps with it in the x-direction rather than being completely to the west of z. But the constraints don't rule out any of these possibilities.

For the case where x is **West** of z:
- For x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). The constraints don't directly tell us this relationship.
- Given that x is NE of y and y is W of z, x and z are both to the east of y. But the constraints don't directly tell us which one (x or z) is further east.

For the cases involving the remaining cardinal directions (NE, NW), the constraints don't provide direct information on the relationships need to determine these directions.

So, based on the constraints and eliminating the impossible directions (S, SE, SW), the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, W, NW, and B (Bounding Box).

Actually wait a minute. Let me just quickly double check the definition of the cardinal direction relations again. 

N corresponds to the northern portion of a reference region. Recall a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). The north direction essentially means "a is above b and a's horizontal range is within b's horizontal range". There's an overlap in the x-coordinate range.

NE corresponds to the northeastern portion of a reference region. Recall a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a). The northeast direction essentially means "a is above and to the right of b". There's no overlap in either x or y.

E corresponds to the eastern portion of a reference region. Recall a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). The east direction essentially means "a is to the right of b and a's vertical range is within b's vertical range". There's an overlap in the y-coordinate range.

NW corresponds to the northwestern portion of a reference region. Recall a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a). The northwest direction essentially means "a is above and to the left of b". There's no overlap in either x or y.

SE corresponds to the southeastern portion of a reference region. Recall a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b). The southeast direction essentially means "a is below and to the right of b". There's no overlap in either x or y.

B corresponds to the bounding box or the interior of a reference region. Recall a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b). The B direction essentially means "a is contained within b's bounding box".

For the given problem:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is W of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's reason for each cardinal direction:

1. **N (North)**: 
   - Requires: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
   - But we also know supy(y) <= supy(z), so the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) is not clear from the constraints.
   - Also, the relationships between infx(z) and infx(x), and supx(x) and supx(z) are not clear from the constraints.
   - Possible. We can't rule it out.

2. **NE (North East)**:
   - Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - As discussed for N, the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) is not clear.
   - Similarly, the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) is not clear.
   - Possible. We can't rule it out.

3. **E (East)**:
   - Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   - But the relationships between supx(z) and infx(x), and supy(x) and supy(z) are not clear.
   - Possible. We can't rule it out.

4. **SE (South East)**:
   - Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true, the top of x must be below the bottom of z. But this would contradict infy(z) <= infy(x), which says the bottom of z is below the bottom of x. If the bottom of z is below the bottom of x, the top of x cannot be below the bottom of z (unless x is not a connected region or has zero height, which is not the case given the regions in REG).
   - Not possible. 

5. **S (South)**:
   - Requires: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - As discussed for SE, supy(x) <= infy(z) cannot be true given the other constraints.
   - Not possible.

6. **SW (South West)**:
   - Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - As discussed for SE, supy(x) <= infy(z) cannot be true given the other constraints.
   - Not possible.

7. **W (West)**:
   - Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   - But the relationships between supx(x) and infx(z), and supy(x) and supy(z) are not clear.
   - Possible. We can't rule it out.

8. **NW (North West)**:
   - Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - As discussed for N and W, these relationships are not clear from the constraints.
   - Possible. We can't rule it out.

9. **B (Bounding Box)**:
   - Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   - But the relationships for the other constraints are not clear.
   - Possible. We can't rule it out.

Hmm, this is difficult. I don't think I have eliminated all the impossibilities. Let's try to draw out a clear picture.

Given:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is W of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can further derive:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z): Both x and z are to the east of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z): The top of y is below both x and z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y): The bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y.

Given these constraints, I'm having a hard time visualizing a setup where x is to the south of z (S, SE, SW). The issue is mainly due to the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x), which indicates y is below x. And given y is to the west of z with its vertical range within z's vertical range, it seems counterintuitive for x to be below z.

Hmm, let's retry. Is there any scenario where x can be South of z?
- For x to be South of z, supy(x) <= infy(z) should be true.
- We know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- If we chain these inequalities, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x).
- infy(x) is a lower bound of the y-coordinates of x and supy(x) is an upper bound. By definition, infy(x) <= supy(x).
- Given infy(z) <= infy(x) (from the chain of inequalities) and infy(x) <= supy(x) (by definition), we get infy(z) <= supy(x).
- This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (the requirement for x to be South of z).
- So, x cannot be South of z.

This suggests that x cannot be S, SE, or SW of z.

Let's check the rest of the directions:

1. **N (North)**: Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - Similarly, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between infx(z) and infx(x) or supx(x) and supx(z).
   - There's no immediate contradiction, so N is possible.

2. **NE (North East)**: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Similar to N, we can't directly determine the relations between supx(z) and infx(x) or supy(z) and infy(x).
   - No contradiction, so NE is possible.

3. **E (East)**: Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   - We don't have direct information on the relations between supx(z) and infx(x) or supy(x) and supy(z).
   - No contradiction, so E is possible.

4. **W (West)**: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). This doesn't directly tell us the relation between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - We don't have direct information on the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).
   - No contradiction, so W is possible.

5. **NW (North West)**: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Similar to W and N, we can't directly determine these relations.
   - No contradiction, so NW is possible.

6. **B (Bounding Box)**: Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.
   - We don't have direct information on the other relations.
   - No contradiction, so B is possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, W, NW, and B.

Hmm, it's still hard to confidently say all of these are valid. Let's try to visualize some scenarios to check if they're feasible.

For N (North):
- x is above z and x's x-coordinate range is within z's x-coordinate range.
- Given that y is to the west of z and x is to the northeast of y, this scenario is plausible.

For NE (North East):
- x is above and to the right of z.
- Given that y is to the west of z and x is to the northeast of y, this scenario is plausible.

For E (East):
- x is to the right of z and x's y-coordinate range is within z's y-coordinate range.
- Given that y is to the west of z and x is to the northeast of y, this scenario is plausible.

For W (West):
- x is to the left of z and x's y-coordinate range is within z's y-coordinate range.
- Given that y is to the west of z and x is to the northeast of y, this would mean x is to the left of z.
- This would place x between y and z on the x-axis. Is this possible?
- Remember, y is W of z, so supx(y) <= infx(z). And x is NE of y, so supx(y) <= infx(x). Now we're checking if x can be W of z, which means supx(x) <= infx(z).

If supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z), then yes, x could be between y and z on the x-axis. So, W is a possibility.

For NW (North West):
- x is above and to the left of z.
- Similar to the W case, if x is between y and z on the x-axis and is above z, then NW is a possibility.

For B (Bounding Box):
- x is contained within z's bounding box.
- Given that y is to the west of z and x is to the northeast of y, to have x inside z's bounding box would mean z is quite large and extends far to the right and is also tall vertically.
- This scenario is plausible but requires specific positioning.

I believe all six (N, NE, E, W, NW, B) are valid possibilities. Let's double check to confirm.

Hmm, double checking, the "B" or bounding box possibility seems a bit not right. Let's review if it can be valid.

For x to be inside the bounding box of z (B relation), we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We know infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x) is satisfied.

Given that x is NE of y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). And given that y is W of z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z). This means both x and z are to the east of y.

If x is inside the bounding box of z, that would mean x's x-coordinate range is contained within z's x-coordinate range. Specifically, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

Given supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we have both infx(x) and infx(z) to the right of supx(y). But we don't know which one is further to the right, so infx(z) <= infx(x) is a valid possibility.

We also don't have any direct information on the relation between supx(x) and supx(z). So, supx(x) <= supx(z) is a valid possibility.

Lastly, we need to ensure supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z). But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).

In conclusion, B is a valid possibility because the constraints don't rule it out.

So in the end, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z based on the given constraints are: N, NE, E, W, NW, and B. The relaitions S, SW, and SE are not possible.

Let's check I didn't make a mistake with the directions.

For x to be North of z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
For x to be NorthEast of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
For x to be East of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x to be SouthEast of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
For x to be South of z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
For x to be SouthWest of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
For x to be West of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
For x to be NorthWest of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
For x to be inside the bounding box of z (B relation), we need: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Let's re-check the SE direction to see if it's truly impossible.

For x to be SouthEast of z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We know:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is W of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can deduce:
infy(z) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= infy(x)
This gives us infy(z) <= infy(x), which doesn't directly tell us about supy(x) <= infy(z).

Let's consider. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then we have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x). This suggests that the y-coordinate of the top of x is below the y-coordinate of the bottom of x, which is a contradiction because infy(x) <= supy(x) is a basic property.

Therefore, SE is indeed not a possible direction.

Checking S and SW in a similar way confirms they are also not possible because of the y-coordinate constraints.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z based on the given constraints are: N, NE, E, W, NW, and B.

Actually, let's try to think if I can eliminate any further directions.

If x is NE of y and y is W of z, then the intuitive understanding is that x is to the northeast of y, and y is to the west of z. This would typically place x somewhere to the north of z, and possibly to the east or west.

Checking the "W" relationship again:
For x to be West of z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We know:
- x is NE of y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is W of z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

For W to be true, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). Given supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we have both infx(x) and infx(z) to the right of supx(y). But the relation between supx(x) and infx(z) is not directly given.

If supx(y) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the west of z. This is possible.

So, W remains a valid possibility.

I think all six (N, NE, E, W, NW, B) are valid possibilities. Let's summarize:

1. **N (North)**: x is above z and x's x-coordinate range is within z's x-coordinate range.
2. **NE (North East)**: x is above and to the right of z.
3. **E (East)**: x is to the right of z and x's y-coordinate range is within z's y-coordinate range.
4. **W (West)**: x is to the left of z and x's y-coordinate range is within z's y-coordinate range.
5. **NW (North West)**: x is above and to the left of z.
6. **B (Bounding Box)**: x is contained within z's bounding box.

The directions S, SE, and SW are not possible because of the y-coordinate constraints derived from the given conditions.

ANSWER:

The cardinal direction relation between regions is defined by their relative positions and boundaries.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is W of region z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, we can deduce:
- Both x and z are east of y
- x is north of y
- y's vertical range is within z's vertical range

For the possible relations between x and z, I need to determine which cardinal directions are compatible with these constraints:

South, Southeast, and Southwest are impossible because:
- We know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- This means infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- For any southern relation, we would need supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- But this would create a contradiction: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The possible relations are:
N, NE, E, W, NW, B
