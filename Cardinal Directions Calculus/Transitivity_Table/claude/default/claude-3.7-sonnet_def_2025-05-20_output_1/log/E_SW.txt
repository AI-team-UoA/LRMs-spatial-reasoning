PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze the situation step by step.

We have:
- Region x is E of region y (x E y)
- Region y is SW of region z (y SW z)
- We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z (x ? z)

Let's recall the definitions of the cardinal directions:

For x E y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

For y SW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, I need to determine the possible relationships between x and z based on the transitive reasoning.

From x E y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)

However, this doesn't give us a direct constraint between x and z on the x-axis. x could be to the east, southeast, or northeast of z, or even overlap with z on the x-axis.

From x E y, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

This means supy(x) <= infy(z), which indicates that x is below z on the y-axis. This rules out relations where x would be north of z (N, NE, NW).

Given these constraints, x could be:
- S of z (if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z))
- SE of z (if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z))
- SW of z (if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z))
- E of z (if supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))
- W of z (if supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z))
- B of z (if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z))

Let's analyze each of these possibilities more carefully.

SW (x SW z): This would require supx(x) <= infx(z). But from x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), and from y SW z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z). So there's no direct constraint that would force supx(x) <= infx(z). So SW is a possibility.

W (x W z): This would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement for W that infy(z) <= infy(x). So W is not a valid relation.

B (x B z): This would require infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement for B that infy(z) <= infy(x). So B is not a valid relation.

Let me try a different approach. I'll create a spatial layout and see what positions x can occupy in relation to z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

Let's place z at the origin, and y to the southwest of z, and x to the east of y.

```
      z
     /
    /
   y---x
```

In this diagram, y is SW of z, and x is E of y. Now, what are the possible relations between x and z?

x could be:
- S of z (if x is directly below z on the y-axis and aligned on the x-axis)
- SE of z (if x is to the right and below z)
- E of z (if x is directly to the right of z on the x-axis and aligned on the y-axis)

Let's make sure these are consistent with the constraints.

S (x S z): This would require supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is aligned with z on the x-axis). From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z), satisfying the first constraint. However, there's no guarantee that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So S is a possibility but not guaranteed.

SE (x SE z): This would require supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z) and supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z). From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z), satisfying the first constraint. From y SW z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z). From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't necessarily imply supx(z) <= infx(x). So SE is a possibility but not guaranteed.

E (x E z): This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is aligned with z on the y-axis). From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). Thus, supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement for E that infy(z) <= infy(x). So E is not a valid relation.

Actually, let me redo this. We have the constraints on (x, y) and (y, z), and we want to find valid values for (x, z).

Using the definitions:

For x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not above the top of y)

For y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z.

For x to be SW of z, we would need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

From y SW z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z). From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). This doesn't give us a direct constraint on supx(x) and infx(z). So, x could be to the left or right of z. And from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

Let's systematically check each cardinal direction:

N (x N z): Would require supy(z) <= infy(x). But we've established supy(x) <= infy(z), which is the opposite. So N is not possible.

NE (x NE z): Would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Again, we've established supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the second condition. So NE is not possible.

E (x E z): Would require supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The second condition (infy(z) <= infy(x)) contradicts our established supy(x) <= infy(z). So E is not possible.

SE (x SE z): Would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition is already established. The first condition is possible, especially if x is far to the right. So SE is a possible relation.

S (x S z): Would require supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The first condition is already established. The second and third conditions are possible if x is aligned with z on the x-axis. So S is a possible relation.

SW (x SW z): Would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The second condition is already established. The first condition is possible, especially if x is far to the left. So SW is a possible relation.

W (x W z): Would require supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is possible, but the second condition (infy(z) <= infy(x)) contradicts our established supy(x) <= infy(z). So W is not possible.

NW (x NW z): Would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The second condition contradicts our established supy(x) <= infy(z). So NW is not possible.

B (x B z): Would require infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The third condition (infy(z) <= infy(x)) contradicts our established supy(x) <= infy(z). So B is not possible.

So, the possible relations are SE, S, and SW.

Let me double-check this by thinking about specific spatial arrangements. Imagine z at the origin, y to the southwest of z, and x to the east of y.

```
      z
     /
    /
   y---x
```

In this arrangement, it looks like x is SE of z, which aligns with one of our possibilities.

Now, let's adjust the position of x to see if we can get the other two possibilities:

```
      z
     /
    /
   y
   |
   x
```

Here, x is S of z, which aligns with another of our possibilities.

```
z
 \
  \
   y
  /
 /
x
```

Here, x is SW of z, which aligns with our third possibility.

So, the possible relations are SE, S, and SW.

Actually, let me explore one more configuration: the case where x could be directly east of z.

```
z---y---x
```

In this arrangement, y is west of z (not SW). So, this doesn't meet our given constraints.

Actually, it's more like:

```
  z
 /
/
y---x
```

In this arrangement, x could be SE, S, or SW of z, depending on how far east x is from y.

I think our conclusion stands: the possible relations between x and z are SE, S, and SW.

Actually, I noticed a potential error in my analysis. Let me revisit the condition x E y.

For x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not above the top of y)

This means that x could be anywhere to the right of y, but its y-coordinates must be contained within the y-coordinates of y.

Given this, let's revisit the problem.

If region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

For y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

For x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not above the top of y)

From x E y, we get supx(y) <= infx(x), and from y SW z, we get supx(y) <= infx(z). However, these don't directly give us a constraint on infx(x) and infx(z) or on supx(x) and supx(z).

From x E y, we get infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). From y SW z, we get supy(y) <= infy(z). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

Now, let's consider the x-coordinate. From x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). From y SW z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z). These combined don't directly constrain the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). Given that y is SW of z, y is to the left of z. Since x is to the right of y, x could be to the left of z, aligned with z, or to the right of z, depending on how far right x is from y and how far right z is from y.

Given the constraints:
- If x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)), and given that x is below z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), then x is SW of z.
- If x is aligned with z on the x-axis (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)), and given that x is below z, then x is S of z.
- If x is to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)), and given that x is below z, then x is SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are SW, S, and SE. This aligns with my earlier conclusion.

Let me double-check my work to see if I've overlooked any possibilities.

For x to be directly E of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z)

The first condition is possible. For the second condition, from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be E of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

For x to be NE of z, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

The first condition is possible. However, for the second condition, from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies infy(x) >= infy(y) and supy(x) <= supy(y). There's no direct constraint that ensures supy(z) <= infy(x). But given supy(y) <= infy(z), we know supy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be NE of z (because infy(z) and supy(z) are points on the border of z, so infy(z) <= supy(z). We already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), so we have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z). This implies supy(x) <= supy(z), which is consistent with the requirement for E, but it doesn't guarantee the condition supy(z) <= infy(x) for NE). So, x cannot be NE of z.

For x to be B of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z)

The first two conditions are possible. However, for the third condition, from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be B of z. So, x cannot be B of z.

Actually I was confused in my explanation of NE. Let me be more careful.

Hmm, actually let me look more precisely again at the original definitions:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top of x is not above the top of y)

For y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's consider each possible relation between x and z:

For x N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of z)

From y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that infy(z) <= supy(z) (they are points on the border of z), we have supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be N of z. So, x cannot be N of z.

For x NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

The first condition is possible. But from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that infy(z) <= supy(z) (they are points on the border of z), we have supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be NE of z. So, x cannot be NE of z.

For x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z)

The first and third conditions are possible. However, from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z). But if supy(x) <= infy(z), then it's not possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) (the second condition for x to be E of z) unless supy(x) = infy(z). But since regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they are non-degenerate, and we wouldn't have supy(x) = infy(z). So, x cannot be E of z.

For x SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

The first condition is possible. The second condition is already derived from the given constraints. So, x can be SE of z.

For x S z:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of z)

The first condition is already derived from the given constraints. The second and third conditions are possible if x is aligned with z on the x-axis. So, x can be S of z.

For x SW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

The first condition is possible. The second condition is already derived from the given constraints. So, x can be SW of z.

For x W z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z)

The first and third conditions are possible. However, from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z). But if supy(x) <= infy(z), then it's not possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) (the second condition for x to be W of z) unless supy(x) = infy(z). But since regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they are non-degenerate, and we wouldn't have supy(x) = infy(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

The first condition is possible. But from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z). Given that infy(z) <= supy(z) (they are points on the border of z), we have supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be NW of z. So, x cannot be NW of z.

For x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z)

The first, second, and fourth conditions are possible. However, from y SW z, we know supy(y) <= infy(z). From x E y, we know supy(x) <= supy(y). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z). But if supy(x) <= infy(z), then it's not possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) (the third condition for x to be B of z) unless supy(x) = infy(z). But since regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they are non-degenerate, and we wouldn't have supy(x) = infy(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

Alright, after careful examination, I can confidently say that the possible relations between x and z are SE, S, and SW.

Actually, if we look at the problem description, it says regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This means they are solid and have no holes. It doesn't necessarily imply that the regions cannot touch at a single point. So, let me reconsider the cases where I said "But since regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, they are non-degenerate, and we wouldn't have supy(x) = infy(z)".

However, even if regions can touch at a single point, it still doesn't change the conclusion for the relations E, W, and B because we would have infy(z) = supy(x), but we can't have infy(z) < infy(x) (which is required for the relations E, W, and B). 

Actually, that's not right. infy(z) = supy(x) doesn't contradict infy(z) <= infy(x). Let me rethink. If supy(x) = infy(z), it means the top of x touches the bottom of z. Given that x is a region, we still need infy(x) to be less than supy(x). If infy(z) = supy(x), then indeed it is also true that infy(z) <= infy(x). But this is only valid at the specific point where they touch.

Let me re-examine the constraints and reasoning for the relations E, W, and B.

For x E z:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z)

We know supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z). This implies supy(x) <= infy(z). Now, if infy(z) = supy(x), then infy(z) <= infy(x) is true only if infy(z) <= infy(x), which requires infy(x) to be exactly at the point where x touches z. But since x is a region, its top and bottom cannot be at the same point; there must be a non-zero height. This means infy(x) < supy(x). And if infy(x) < supy(x) = infy(z), then infy(x) < infy(z), which contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be E of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

Similarly, x cannot be W of z.

For x B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left edge of x is not to the left of the left edge of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right edge of x is not to the right of the right edge of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom of x is not below the bottom of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top of x is not above the top of z)

As we've seen, the third condition (infy(z) <= infy(x)) contradicts the derived constraint supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

Actually, I don't need to be overthinking this. Let's take a step back.

From the given constraints, we've derived that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, the only possible relations between x and z are those consistent with x being below z, which are SE, S, and SW.

Let me draw a figure to illustrate this:

```
     z
    /
   /
  y
  |
  x
```

Here, y is SW of z and x is E of y. As we can see, x can be S of z if it's aligned with z on the x-axis.

```
     z
    /
   /
  y---x
```

Here, y is SW of z and x is E of y. As we can see, x can be SE of z if it's to the right of z.

```
     z
    / \
   /   \
  y     |
 /      |
x       |
```

Here, y is SW of z and x is E of y. As we can see, x can be SW of z if it's to the left of z.

And to show that x can't be E of z, let's represent it:

```
     z---x
    /
   /

In this figure, x is E of z, but y isn't SW of z; it's more like S of z. If y were truly SW of z, and x is E of y, then x would not be E of z because the y-coordinates of x wouldn't line up with z.

Given all the rigorous analysis, I can confidently say that the possible relations between x and z are SE, S, and SW.

Actually if x is E of y, then the definition says supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y). If we plug this into our diagram, it means that x is to the right of y, but the y-coordinates of x can't extend beyond the y-coordinates of y (not higher than y's top and not lower than y's bottom).

If y is SW of z, then the definition says supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z). This means that y is to the left and below z.

So, in our diagram, it should look more like:

```
      z
     /|
    / |
   /  |
  y   |
  |   |
  x   |
```

Here, y is SW of z. If x is E of y, then the y-coordinates of x are contained within the y-coordinates of y, and x is to the right of y.

The key constraint is that from y SW z, we have supy(y) <= infy(z), which means the top of y is not above the bottom of z. From x E y, we have supy(x) <= supy(y), which means the top of x is not above the top of y. Combining these: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) <= infy(z). This means that x is below z.

Additionally, from x E y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of y. From y SW z, we know supx(y) <= infx(z), which means y is to the left of z. These combined doesn't provide a direct constraint on the relationship between x and z along the x-axis.

Given these constraints:
- x is below z
- x's position relative to z on the x-axis is not constrained directly

So, x can be SE, S, or SW of z, depending on its position on the x-axis.

Alright, I believe our conclusion is correct. The possible relations between x and z, given x E y and y SW z, are SE, S, and SW.

In summary, if region x is E of region y and region y is SW of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z are SE, S, and SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x E y (x is East of y)
- y SW z (y is Southwest of z)

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of x not below bottom of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x not above top of y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these constraints:
- From x E y and y SW z, we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z.
- The x-coordinate relationship between x and z is not directly constrained - x could be to the left, aligned with, or to the right of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is to the left of z)
- S (if x is aligned with z on the x-axis)
- SE (if x is to the right of z)
