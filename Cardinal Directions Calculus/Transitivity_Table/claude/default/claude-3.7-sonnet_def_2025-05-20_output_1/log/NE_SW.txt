PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this step-by-step:

We are given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of these relations:
- x NE y means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SW z means supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's combine these to determine the relationship between x and z.

From x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's analyze what we can conclude:

1. For the x-coordinate:
   We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
   
   This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). Region x could be to the east of z, or they could overlap in the x-coordinate.

2. For the y-coordinate:
   We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
   
   Again, this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). Region x could be to the north of z, or they could overlap in the y-coordinate.

Since we don't have direct inequalities between the coordinates of x and z, we need to consider all possible configurations that satisfy the given constraints.

Let's enumerate the possibilities:

1. If infx(x) > infx(z) and infy(x) > infy(z):
   This would mean x is northeast of z, giving x NE z.

2. If infx(x) > infx(z) and infy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(x):
   This would mean x is east of z, giving x E z.

3. If infx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(x) and infy(x) > infy(z):
   This would mean x is north of z, giving x N z.

4. If infx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(x) and infy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(x):
   This would mean x overlaps with z or is inside z, giving x B z.

5. If supx(x) < infx(z) and infy(x) > infy(z):
   This would mean x is northwest of z, giving x NW z.

6. If supx(x) < infx(z) and infy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(x):
   This would mean x is west of z, giving x W z.

7. If supx(x) < infx(z) and supy(x) < infy(z):
   This would mean x is southwest of z, giving x SW z.

8. If infx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(x) and supy(x) < infy(z):
   This would mean x is south of z, giving x S z.

9. If infx(x) > infx(z) and supy(x) < infy(z):
   This would mean x is southeast of z, giving x SE z.

Let me check if all of these configurations are consistent with the given constraints.

Actually, let me approach this differently. Let's create a constraint graph:

- x NE y means x is to the northeast of y
- y SW z means y is to the southwest of z

Let's visualize this:

```
    z
   /
  y
 /
x
```

Where the x-coordinate increases from left to right, and the y-coordinate increases from bottom to top.

Given the definitions:
- x NE y means x is above and to the right of y
- y SW z means y is below and to the left of z

From this, we can see that z could be anywhere in the region above and to the right of y. Similarly, x is anywhere above and to the right of y.

This means x and z could have various relationships depending on their exact positions. Let's enumerate them:

1. x could be to the northeast of z (x NE z)
2. x could be to the north of z (x N z)
3. x could be to the northwest of z (x NW z)
4. x could be to the east of z (x E z)
5. x could overlap with z (x B z)
6. x could be to the west of z (x W z)
7. x could be to the southeast of z (x SE z)
8. x could be to the south of z (x S z)
9. x could be to the southwest of z (x SW z)

Actually, let me reconsider. I need to check these more carefully.

The constraint x NE y, combined with y SW z, should provide some constraints on the relationship between x and z.

Let's go back to the definitions:

- x NE y means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SW z means supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can't directly derive a constraint on the relationship between x and z. We'd need more information about the specific positions of x, y, and z.

For instance, consider the case where x is just slightly to the northeast of y, and z is far to the northeast of y. In this scenario, x could be to the southwest of z (i.e., x SW z).

But if x is far to the northeast of y, and z is just slightly to the northeast of y, then x could be to the northeast of z (i.e., x NE z).

Without more specific information, it seems like x could have any of the 9 possible cardinal direction relations with z.

Actually, let me make sure that all 9 cardinal directions are possible by constructing a concrete example for each.

1. x NE z (x is to the northeast of z):
   - Imagine y is at the origin (0, 0).
   - z is slightly northeast at (1, 1).
   - x is far northeast at (3, 3).
   - This satisfies: x NE y and y SW z, and gives us x NE z.

2. x N z (x is to the north of z):
   - y is at the origin (0, 0).
   - z is at (0, 1).
   - x is at (0, 3).
   - This satisfies: x NE y (since x is at the same x-coordinate as y, but has a higher y-coordinate) and y SW z, and gives us x N z.

Actually, I notice there might be an issue with my reasoning. Let me reconsider.

The cardinal directions are more specific:
- NE (Northeast): x-coordinate is greater and y-coordinate is greater
- SW (Southwest): x-coordinate is lesser and y-coordinate is lesser

So, x NE y means infx(x) >= supx(y) and infy(x) >= supy(y).
And, y SW z means supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From these, we get:
- infx(x) >= supx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), which doesn't directly relate infx(x) and infx(z).
- infy(x) >= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which doesn't directly relate infy(x) and infy(z).

So, without more specific information, x could indeed have any of the 9 possible cardinal direction relations with z.

Let me reason more carefully.

From x NE y, we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
2. supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y SW z, we have:
3. supx(y) <= infx(z) (z is to the east of y)
4. supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is to the north of y)

Now, let's try to relate x and z:
Combining 1 and 3, we have: supx(y) <= min(infx(x), infx(z))
Combining 2 and 4, we have: supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z))

This still doesn't directly give us a relation between x and z.

Alright, let's re-approach this problem by drawing a concrete example.

Imagine the 2D plane divided by the lines passing through the reference region y:

```
|    NW    |    N    |    NE    |
|----------|---------|----------|
|    W     |    B    |    E     |
|----------|---------|----------|
|    SW    |    S    |    SE    |
```

If x is in the NE region relative to y, and y is in the SW region relative to z, then z is somewhere in the region bounded by:
- x-coordinates >= max(x, y)
- y-coordinates >= max(x, y)

Since x is in the NE region of y, it's outside of these bounds.

I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let's try a different approach. Let's visualize the plane with y as the reference:

```
        North
        ^
        |
West <--+--> East
        |
        v
       South
```

If x is NE of y, then x is in the upper-right quadrant from y.
If z is to the NE of y, then y is SW of z. So, z is also in the upper-right quadrant from y.

Now, the relationship between x and z depends on their relative positions in this quadrant. They could be in any of the 9 possible cardinal relations to each other.

I believe the correct answer is that x can have any of the 9 possible cardinal direction relations with z, based on the limited constraints provided.

Actually, let me double-check this by constructing a specific example for each possible relation.

Let's set up a coordinate system with y at the origin (0, 0). Since x NE y, we have x in the first quadrant. Since y SW z, we have z in the first quadrant as well. Now, let's check each possible relation between x and z:

1. x NE z:
   - Let x be at (3, 3) and z be at (1, 1).
   - x is NE of y since (3, 3) is in the first quadrant.
   - y is SW of z since (0, 0) is SW of (1, 1).
   - And (3, 3) is NE of (1, 1), so x NE z.

2. x N z:
   - Let x be at (1, 3) and z be at (1, 1).
   - x is NE of y since (1, 3) is in the first quadrant.
   - y is SW of z since (0, 0) is SW of (1, 1).
   - And (1, 3) is N of (1, 1), so x N z.

3. x NW z:
   - Let x be at (1, 3) and z be at (3, 1).
   - x is NE of y since (1, 3) is in the first quadrant.
   - y is SW of z since (0, 0) is SW of (3, 1).
   - And (1, 3) is NW of (3, 1), so x NW z.

4. x E z:
   - Let x be at (3, 1) and z be at (1, 1).
   - x is NE of y since (3, 1) is in the first quadrant.
   - y is SW of z since (0, 0) is SW of (1, 1).
   - And (3, 1) is E of (1, 1), so x E z.

5. x B z:
   Actually, if z is B x, it means z bounding box completely contains x. This is possible if z is very large and covers the entire first quadrant. But I'm not sure if this direction is possible the other way around.

Let me rethink "B". 

"a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)", which means a is inside b.

So, if x B z, it means:
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let me rethink.

If regions are points, then B is not possible. But if regions have non-zero area, then one region can be inside or overlapping with another.

So let's define these regions:
y: A small region centered at (0, 0), let's say a square from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
z: A large region covering the entire first quadrant, let's say from (1, 1) to (10, 10).
x: A small region inside z, let's say from (3, 3) to (4, 4).

With these definitions:
- x is NE of y since x is in the first quadrant and doesn't overlap with y.
- y is SW of z since y is at the origin and z is in the first quadrant. They don't overlap.
- And x is inside z, so x B z.

6. x W z:
   - Let x be at (1, 1) and z be at (3, 1).
   - x is NE of y since (1, 1) is in the first quadrant.
   - y is SW of z since (0, 0) is SW of (3, 1).
   - And (1, 1) is W of (3, 1), so x W z.

7. x SE z:
   - Let x be at (3, 1) and z be at (1, 3).
   - x is NE of y since (3, 1) is in the first quadrant.
   - y is SW of z since (0, 0) is SW of (1, 3).
   - And (3, 1) is SE of (1, 3), so x SE z.

8. x S z:
   - Let x be at (1, 1) and z be at (1, 3).
   - x is NE of y since (1, 1) is in the first quadrant.
   - y is SW of z since (0, 0) is SW of (1, 3).
   - And (1, 1) is S of (1, 3), so x S z.

9. x SW z:
   - Let x be at (1, 1) and z be at (3, 3).
   - x is NE of y since (1, 1) is in the first quadrant.
   - y is SW of z since (0, 0) is SW of (3, 3).
   - And (1, 1) is SW of (3, 3), so x SW z.

So, it seems like all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z based on the constraints given.

Actually, let me make sure that I have the right definition for "B". I'm thinking of it as "inside", but let me re-verify.

From the definition given:
"a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)"

This does describe "a is inside b". Specifically, it says the bounding box of a is contained within the bounding box of b.

So, my example for x B z is correct. And the conclusion that all 9 cardinal directions are possible for the relation between x and z holds.

Actually, I'm not sure if my visualization with y at the origin is the most general. Let's see if there any constraints I might have missed.

From the cardinal direction definitions given:

x NE y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

y SW z means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (z is to the east of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is to the north of y)

Now, let's try to derive the possible relations between x and z.

Let's consider the 9 possible cardinal direction relations:

1. x NE z:
   This means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   Can this configuration satisfy the given constraints? Yes, if x is far enough NE, and z is just slightly NE of y.

2. x N z:
   This means:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the x-extent of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   Can this configuration satisfy the given constraints? Yes, if x is directly N of z, and both are NE of y.

3. x NW z:
   This means:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   Can this configuration satisfy the given constraints? Yes, if z is far enough E, x is directly N of y, and z is NE of y.

Let's be more systematic. Let me construct an example for x NE y and y SW z, which I'll use as a base for all 9 possible relations between x and z.

Let's define y as a 2x2 square centered at (0, 0), i.e., the box from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).

For x NE y, x should be in the NE quadrant. Let's define x as a 2x2 square centered at (3, 3), i.e., the box from (2, 2) to (4, 4).

For y SW z, z should be in the NE quadrant relative to y. Let's define z as a 2x2 square centered at (3, 3), i.e., the box from (2, 2) to (4, 4).

Oh, if z and x are defined the same way, then they're the exact same region, and the relation is B. So, x B z is possible. In that case, I'd expect most of the other relations to be possible too.

I think my earlier approach is on the right track. Let's just double check all possible relations:
(Let's assume x and z are both axis-aligned rectangles.)

1. x NE z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2.
   - Let x be a square at (6, 6) with side length 2.
   - x is NE of y, y is SW of z, and x is NE of z.

2. x N z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 6) with side length 2.
   - x is NE of y, y is SW of z, and x is N of z.

3. x NW z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2.
   - Let z be a square at (6, 3) with side length 2.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 6) with side length 2.
   - x is NE of y, y is SW of z, and x is NW of z.

4. x E z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2.
   - Let x be a square at (6, 3) with side length 2.
   - x is NE of y, y is SW of z, and x is E of z.

5. x B z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 3) with side length 4.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2.
   - x is NE of y, y is SW of z, and x is B z.

6. x W z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2.
   - Let z be a square at (6, 3) with side length 2.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2.
   - x is NE of y, y is SW of z, and x is W of z.

7. x SE z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 6) with side length 2.
   - Let x be a square at (6, 3) with side length 2.
   - x is NE of y, y is SW of z, and x is SE of z.

8. x S z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 6) with side length 2.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2.
   - x is NE of y, y is SW of z, and x is S of z.

9. x SW z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2.
   - Let z be a square at (6, 6) with side length 2.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2.
   - x is NE of y, y is SW of z, and x is SW of z.

So, all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z based on the constraints given.

Actually I want to double-check the definition of SW to make sure I'm getting it right:

"a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)"

This means a is to the southwest of b, or in other words, a has to be to the left of b and below b, with no overlap.

I've defined y at (0, 0) with side length 2. So y extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.

For z to be in the NE of y, we need:
supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
So, 1 <= infx(z) and 1 <= infy(z).

I think my approach is correct. All 9 cardinal direction relations are possible.

Let me know if I did the check above right here:
5. x B z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2, so it extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
     infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 3) with side length 4, so it extends from (1, 1) to (5, 5).
     infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 5.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 2) to (4, 4).
     infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4.

Let's check the conditions:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
  1 <= 1 and 1 <= 1. This holds.
- x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
  1 <= 2, 4 <= 5, 1 <= 2, and 4 <= 5. This holds.

So, the conditions for x B z are satisfied.

Let me check the case for x NW z also:
3. x NW z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2, so it extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
     infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.
   - Let z be a square at (6, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (5, 2) to (7, 4).
     infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 4.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 6) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 5) to (4, 7).
     infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 7.

Let's check the conditions:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 5. This holds.
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
  1 <= 5 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  4 <= 5 and 4 <= 5. This holds.

So, the conditions for x NW z are satisfied.

I'm convinced that all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z, given the constraints x NE y and y SW z.

So my final answer is that the possible relations between x and z, given that x is NE of y and y is SW of z, are: NE, N, NW, E, B, W, SE, S, and SW.

Actually, I should double check my computation for the case x NW z:
- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  4 <= 5 and 4 <= 5. This holds.

Actually, the check above is wrong. The correct check is:
- x NW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  4 <= 5 and 4 <= 5. Actually I need to double check the second inequality: supy(z) <= infy(x). Here supy(z) = 4 and infy(x) = 5. 4 < 5, so this is satisfies. Thus, the NW condition holds.

So, all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z, given the constraints x NE y and y SW z. The answer is NE, N, NW, E, B, W, SE, S, and SW.

Actually, let me double check my computation for the case x SE z:
7. x SE z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2, so it extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
     infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 6) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 5) to (4, 7).
     infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 5, supy(z) = 7.
   - Let x be a square at (6, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (5, 2) to (7, 4).
     infx(x) = 5, supx(x) = 7, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4.

Let's check the conditions:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  1 <= 5 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 5. This holds.
- x SE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
  4 <= 5 and 4 <= 5. This holds.

So, the conditions for x SE z are satisfied.

Let me double check my computation for the case x SW z:
9. x SW z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2, so it extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
     infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.
   - Let z be a square at (6, 6) with side length 2, so it extends from (5, 5) to (7, 7).
     infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 5, supy(z) = 7.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 2) to (4, 4).
     infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4.

Let's check the conditions:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
  1 <= 5 and 1 <= 5. This holds.
- x SW z: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
  4 <= 5 and 4 <= 5. This holds.

So, the conditions for x SW z are satisfied.

Let me double check my computation for the case x S z:
8. x S z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2, so it extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
     infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 6) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 5) to (4, 7).

  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

  2 <= 2, 4 <= 4, and 4 <= 5. This holds.

So, the conditions for x S z are satisfied.

Let me double check my computation for the case x E z:
4. x E z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2, so it extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
     infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 2) to (4, 4).
     infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 4.
   - Let x be a square at (6, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (5, 2) to (7, 4).
     infx(x) = 5, supx(x) = 7, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4.

Let's check the conditions:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  1 <= 5 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 2. This holds.

  4 <= 5, 2 <= 2, and 4 <= 4. This holds.

So, the conditions for x E z are satisfied.

Let me double check my computation for the case x W z:
6. x W z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2, so it extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
     infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.
   - Let z be a square at (6, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (5, 2) to (7, 4).
     infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 4.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 2) to (4, 4).
     infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 4.

Let's check the conditions:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
  1 <= 5 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
  4 <= 5, 2 <= 2, and 4 <= 4. This holds.

So, the conditions for x W z are satisfied.

Let me double check my computation for the case x N z:
2. x N z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2, so it extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
     infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 2) to (4, 4).
     infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 4.
   - Let x be a square at (3, 6) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 5) to (4, 7).
     infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 7.

Let's check the conditions:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 5. This holds.
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- x N z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  2 <= 2, 4 <= 4, and 4 <= 5. This holds.

Actually, wait, there's an error in my check. The correct check for x N z should be:
- x N z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  2 <= 2, 4 <= 4, and 4 <= 5. But actually infx(z) <= infx(x) means 2 <= 2 and supx(x) <= supx(z) means 4 <= as well, which means the projections of x and z onto the x-axis are the same. This is incorrect for the N relation. I need to redo this.

the definition of N "a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)"

So:
- x N z: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
  4 <= 5, 2 <= 2, and 4 <= 4. This holds. So x N z is possible.

Let me double check my computation for the case x NE z:
1. x NE z:
   - Let y be a square at (0, 0) with side length 2, so it extends from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).
     infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 1, infy(y) = -1, supy(y) = 1.
   - Let z be a square at (3, 3) with side length 2, so it extends from (2, 2) to (4, 4).
     infx(z) = 2, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 4.
   - Let x be a square at (6, 6) with side length 2, so it extends from (5, 5) to (7, 7).
     infx(x) = 5, supx(x) = 7, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 7.

Let's check the conditions:
- x NE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
  1 <= 5 and 1 <= 5. This holds.
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)
  1 <= 2 and 1 <= 2. This holds.
- x NE z: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
  4 <= 5 and 4 <= 5. This holds.

So, the conditions for x NE z are satisfied.

In conclusion, all 9 cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z, given the constraints x NE y and y SW z. The set of all possible relations between x and z is {N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B}.

So the answer is N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B

ANSWER:

Based on the given relations:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

I need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let me analyze what we know:
- x NE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y SW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This places both regions x and z in the northeast quadrant relative to y, but doesn't directly constrain their relation to each other. I can verify all possible relations by constructing specific examples:

1. N: When x is directly north of z (same x-coordinates, x higher than z)
2. NE: When x is northeast of z (x is east and north of z)
3. E: When x is directly east of z (same y-coordinates, x right of z)
4. SE: When x is southeast of z (x is east and south of z)
5. S: When x is directly south of z (same x-coordinates, x lower than z)
6. SW: When x is southwest of z (x is west and south of z)
7. W: When x is directly west of z (same y-coordinates, x left of z)
8. NW: When x is northwest of z (x is west and north of z)
9. B: When x is inside z (z completely contains x)

All nine cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.
