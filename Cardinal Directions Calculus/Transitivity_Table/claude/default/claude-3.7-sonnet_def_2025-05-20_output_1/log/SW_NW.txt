PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step-by-step. We have:
- x is SW of y
- y is NW of z

We need to find the possible relations between x and z.

First, let me recall what the relations mean:
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, I'll analyze what these conditions tell us about x and z:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about x relative to z:

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y NW z)
By transitivity: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
This means x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NW z)

These two constraints don't directly give us a transitive relation between the y-coordinates of x and z. We know x is south of y and z is south of y, but we don't know the relative position of x and z in the y-direction.

So, what are the possible cardinal directions of x relative to z?

Since we know x is to the west of z, the possible relations are: W, NW, SW.

Let's check each one:

1. x W z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but we can't determine the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(x) and infy(z).
   - So, x W z is a possibility.

2. x NW z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we don't know the relationship between infy(x) and infy(y).
   - So, x NW z is also a possibility if infy(x) ≥ supy(z).

3. x SW z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - We don't have direct constraints on supy(x) and infy(z).
   - So, x SW z is also a possibility.

Additionally, let's check if x B z is a possibility:
x B z would mean infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
But we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x and z don't overlap in the x-direction. So, x B z is not a possibility.

Let's also check the other cardinal directions:

4. x N z: This would mean supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   But we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the west of z. This contradicts the condition for x N z. So, x N z is not a possibility.

5. x NE z: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   But we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x NE z is not a possibility.

6. x E z: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   But we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x E z is not a possibility.

7. x SE z: This would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   But we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x SE z is not a possibility.

8. x S z: This would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   But we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradiicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x S z is not a possibility.

Wait, let me re-check my reasoning. 

From x SW y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

For the x-coordinate, by transitivity:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, x is to the west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

OK, wait. What we know here is that both x and z are below y. But we don't know how x and z relate to each other in the y-direction.

Let me visualize this. The constraints we have put y in the northwest, z in the southeast, and x in the southwest of the coordinate system. But the relationship between x and z in the y-direction is not constrained.

Let's verify the possible relations considering their definitions:

- x W z if and only if: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
  We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we don't have constraints on how infy(x) relates to infy(z) or how supy(x) relates to supy(z). So, W is a possibility if those constraints are satisfied.

- x NW z if and only if: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we don't have a constraint on how supy(z) relates to infy(x). So, NW is a possibility if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

- x SW z if and only if: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
  We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we don't have a constraint on how supy(x) relates to infy(z). So, SW is a possibility if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hmm, depending on the specific regions, x can be W, NW, or SW of z.

Actually let me be a tiny bit more careful. I said this earlier:

"For the x-coordinate, by transitivity:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, x is to the west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)"

But there's a mistake here: we don't know that infx(y) ≤ supx(y). This isn't given by the constraints. Actually, it's always true that infx(y) ≤ supx(y) for any region y, since the infimum is the greatest lower bound and the supremum is the least upper bound.

So, the correct chain of inequalities is:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y NW z)

Now, it's not immediately obvious that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) without knowing the relation between infx(y) and supx(y). But since y is a region, we know infx(y) ≤ supx(y).

So, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
Which gives us supx(x) ≤ infx(z), confirming that x is to the west of z.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are:
- W (if the y-bounds of x encompass the y-bounds of z)
- NW (if x is to the north of z)
- SW (if x is to the south of z)

Given the constraints, x is definitely to the west of z, but its north-south relation with z is undetermined. So, the possible cardinal direction relations are W, NW, and SW.

Hmm, wait a moment. Let us think about this more carefully. Let me draw a diagram:

(y is NW of z)
y
 \
  \
   \
    z

(x is SW of y)
  y
 /
/
x

Combining the two, with the given constraints:

    y
   / \
  /   \
 x     z

From this visual representation, it seems that x and z could be at the same "height" (y-coordinate), or x could be to the north of z, or x could be to the south of z.

But, in the definition of the cardinal direction relations, we're not just considering the strict "north" or "south" but the bounding boxes of the regions.

Let's revisit the constraints for x and z:

From the given information, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z in the x-axis)
- No direct constraint on their y-coordinates.

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z based on this are:
- x W z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- x NW z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- x SW z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Actually, I think my reasoning should be a bit different. We have:

- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

What we want are constraints on the coordinates of x and z.

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y NW z)
By transitivity: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
This means x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate, the constraints are:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NW z)

These don't directly give us a constraint on the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z. All we know is that both x and z are below y. We don't know their relative positions in the y-axis.

So, given the constraints, x is definitely to the west of z, but its north-south relation with z is undetermined. The possible cardinal direction relations are:
- W (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
- NW (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- SW (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z))

Now, are these the only possibilities? Let's check the other directions:

- N (supx(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z))
  We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the west of z. This contradicts the requirement for N, so N is not a possibility.

- NE (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
  We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the west of z and z is strictly to the east of x. This contradicts the requirement for NE, so NE is not a possibility.

- E (supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
  We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the west of z and z is strictly to the east of x. This contradicts the requirement for E, so E is not a possibility.

- SE (supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
  We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the west of z and z is strictly to the east of x. This contradicts the requirement for SE, so SE is not a possibility.

- S (supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z))
  We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the west of z and z is strictly to the east of x. This contradicts the requirement for S, so S is not a possibility.

- B (infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
  We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the west of z. This contradicts the requirement for B, so B is not a possibility.

So, the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Actually, let me just verify that I'm using the right definitions again:

- a W b: supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- a NW b: supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- a SW b: supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

Yes, my earlier analysis was based on the correct definitions. So we know that the answer is W, NW or SW.

Actually, wait, let's me re-check our constraints again.

- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From the first constraint, we get that x is to the southwest of y, or in other words, x is at the lower left of y. And from the second constraint, we get that y is to the northwest of z, or in other words, y is to the upper left of z.

Let's try to visualize this more concretely. We can imagine placing y at the origin (0, 0). Then, x would be in the lower left quadrant, and z would be in the lower right quadrant.

Now, if we consider the relationship between x and z, we know that x is to the left of y, which is to the left of z. So, x is definitely to the left of z.

But in terms of the y-coordinate, x is below y and z is below y. We don't know the relative positions of x and z in the y-axis.

If x is above z, then x is in the NW direction from z.
If x is below z, then x is in the SW direction from z.
If x is neither above nor below z (i.e., they have the same y range or their y ranges overlap), then x is in the W direction from z.

Given the constraints, these are the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z. All other relations would contradict the fact that x is to the left of z.

So we have W, NW, and SW as the possible relations. Are any others possible? Let me double check my reasoning.

Wait, let me think of a concrete example. Say we have:

- y is located at (0, 0)
- x is located at (-2, -1)
- z is located at (1, -2)

Then, x is SW of y ((-2, -1) is southwest of (0, 0)).
And y is NW of z ((0, 0) is northwest of (1, -2)).

Now, what is the relationship between x and z?
x is located at (-2, -1) and z is located at (1, -2).

Using the definitions:
- x W z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 1. This is true.
  infy(z) = -2 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true.
  supy(x) = -1 ≤ supy(z) = -2. This is false.
  So, x is not W of z based on our chosen coordinates.

- x NW z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 1. This is true.
  supy(z) = -2 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true.
  So, x is NW of z based on our chosen coordinates.

- x SW z: This would mean supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 1. This is true.
  supy(x) = -1 ≤ infy(z) = -2. This is false.
  So, x is not SW of z based on our chosen coordinates.

Ah, I see I need to be much more precise about the coordinates. I was being sloppy. OK, since I'm thinking of regions as single points, the min and max are the same for each region.

For y: infx(y) = supx(y) = 0, infy(y) = supy(y) = 0
For x: infx(x) = supx(x) = -2, infy(x) = supy(x) = -1
For z: infx(z) = supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = supy(z) = -2

So now:
- x W z: 
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 1. This is true.
  infy(z) = -2 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true.
  supy(x) = -1 ≤ supy(z) = -2. This is false.
  So, x is not W of z.

- x NW z: 
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 1. This is true.
  supy(z) = -2 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true.
  So, x is NW of z.

- x SW z: 
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 1. This is true.
  supy(x) = -1 ≤ infy(z) = -2. This is false.
  So, x is not SW of z.

OK so only the NW relation holds for my made-up example. But the fact that I was able to generate an example that confirms the NW relation confirms that NW is a possible relation. 

So at least NW is one of the possible relations.

Let me see if I can contrived an example for the SW relation.

Let's try:
- y is located at (0, 0)
- x is located at (-2, -3)
- z is located at (1, -1)

Then, 
- x is SW of y: supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(y) = 0, supy(x) = -3 ≤ infy(y) = 0
- y is NW of z: supx(y) = 0 ≤ infx(z) = 1, supy(z) = -1 ≤ infy(y) = 0

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x SW z: 
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 1. This is true.
  supy(x) = -3 ≤ infy(z) = -1. This is true.
  So, x is SW of z.

Great, so SW is also a possible relation.

Now, let me see if I can contrive an example for the W relation.

Let's try:
- y is located at (0, 0)
- x is located at (-2, -1)
- z is located at (1, -1)

Then, 
- x is SW of y: supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(y) = 0, supy(x) = -1 ≤ infy(y) = 0
- y is NW of z: supx(y) = 0 ≤ infx(z) = 1, supy(z) = -1 ≤ infy(y) = 0

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x W z: 
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 1. This is true.
  infy(z) = -1 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true (both are equal).
  supy(x) = -1 ≤ supy(z) = -1. This is true (both are equal).
  So, x is W of z.

OK so the W relation is also possible.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The definition of the W relation is:
- a W b if and only if: supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)

So, x W z would mean: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

In our example, we have:
supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 1. This is true.
infy(z) = -1 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true (both are equal).
supy(x) = -1 ≤ supy(z) = -1. This is true (both are equal).

So, x is W of z as I had correctly concluded in the original analysis. 

Actually wait, let's think about this again. The y-coordinate relation is as follows:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z)

These can only be both satisfied if the y range of z entirely contains the y range of x.

Actually I think I've been sloppy so far, because I'm treating regions as points. Let's go back to the cardinal direction definitions and be more careful.

- a W b: supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- a NW b: supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- a SW b: supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

Let's try again, with an example where regions are not just points.

For W:
Let's try:
- y is located in the region [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- x is located in the region [-3, -2] × [-1, 0]
- z is located in the region [2, 3] × [-2, 1]

Then, 
- x is SW of y: supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(y) = 0, supy(x) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 0.  This is true.
- y is NW of z: supx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 2, supy(z) = -2 ≤ infy(y) = 0. This is true.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x W z: 
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 2. This is true.
  infy(z) = -2 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true.
  supy(x) = 0 ≤ supy(z) = 1. This is true.
  So, x is W of z.

For NW:
- y is located in the region [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- x is located in the region [-3, -2] × [2, 3]
- z is located in the region [2, 3] × [-2, -1]

Then, 
- x is SW of y: supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(y) = 0. This is true. But supy(x) = 3 ≰ infy(y) = 0. This is false. So xSWy is not true..

Hmm that doesn't work, let me try again.

For NW:
- y is located in the region [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- x is located in the region [-3, -2] × [-1, 0]
- z is located in the region [2, 3] × [-3, -2]

Then, 
- x is SW of y: supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(y) = 0. This is true. But supy(x) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 0. This is true.
- y is NW of z: supx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 2. This is true. And supy(z) = -3 ≤ infy(y) = 0. This is true.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x NW z: 
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 2. This is true.
  supy(z) = -3 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true.
  So, x is NW of z.

For SW:
- y is located in the region [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- x is located in the region [-3, -2] × [-3, -2]
- z is located in the region [2, 3] × [-1, 0]

Then, 
- x is SW of y: supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(y) = 0. This is true. supy(x) = -2 ≤ infy(y) = 0. This is true.
- y is NW of z: supx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 2. This is true. And supy(z) = -1 ≤ infy(y) = 0. This is true.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x SW z: 
  supx(x) = -2 ≤ infx(z) = 2. This is true.
  supy(x) = -2 ≤ infy(z) = -1. This is true.
  So, x is SW of z.

Great, so I've got concrete example with non-point regions where x W z, x NW z, and x SW z are all possible, depending on the specific regions.

So the answer is that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- W
- NW
- SW

This makes sense intuitively as well: W is definitely a constraint, and the regions x and z can be arranged in the y-direction in different ways.

Wait, for completeness, let me make sure we haven't missed any other possible relations.

Actually let's see if there's any edge cases. Let's try to have regions that intuitively should "touch" in the NW relation. The constraint for a NW b is: supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).

So let's try:
- y is located in the region [0, 1] × [0, 1]
- x is located in the region [-1, -0.1] × [0.9, 1.1]
- z is located in the region [2, 3] × [-1, -0.9]

Then, 
- x is SW of y?: supx(x) = -0.1 ≤ infx(y) = 0. This is true. And supy(x) = 1.1 ≰ infy(y) = 0. This is false. So x is not SW of y.

Hmm, we need to ensure that the constraints are satisfied. Let me try again.

Let's try:
- y is located in the region [0, 1] × [1, 2]
- x is located in the region [-2, -1] × [-1, 0]
- z is located in the region [2, 3] × [-3, -2]

Then, 
- x is SW of y: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(y) = 0. This is true. supy(x) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 1. This is true.
- y is NW of z: supx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 2. This is true. supy(z) = -3 ≤ infy(y) = 1. This is true.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x N z?
  - supy(z) = -3 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true. But infx(z) = 2 ≰ infx(x) = -2. This is false. So, x is not N of z.
- x NE z?
  - supy(z) = -3 ≤ infy(x) = -1. This is true. But supx(z) = 3 ≰ infx(x) = -2. This is false. So, x is not NE of z.

Actually, I should just be systematic from the beginning.

From the given:
- x is SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

We derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

For the y-direction, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

So both x and z are below y, but their relationship in the y-direction isn't constrained.

Now let me check the W, NW, and SW relations. Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z), we need to examine the constraints on the y-coordinate:

- For W: We need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- For NW: We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- For SW: We need supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Are any of these constraints contradicted by the original constraints? Let's check.

From the original constraints, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These don't provide any constraints on the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z directly. So, all three relations (W, NW, and SW) are possible.

Are there any other possible relations? Let's check the other cardinal directions given supx(x) ≤ infx(z):

- For N: We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be contradicted. So, N is not a possibility.

- For NE: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be contradicted. So, NE is not a possibility.

- For E: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be contradicted. So, E is not a possibility.

- For SE: We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be contradicted. So, SE is not a possibility.

- For S: We need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be contradicted. So, S is not a possibility.

- For B: We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), the constraint infx(z) ≤ infx(x) would be contradicted. So, B is not a possibility.

So just W, NW, and SW are the possible relations between x and z.

Let's double check.

Here's what we know:
- x is SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is NW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these direct constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y)

Now, by transitivity:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is west of z.

For the y-coordinate:
From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), we know both x and z are below y. However, we don't have a direct constraint on their relative positions in the y-axis.

Based on the cardinal direction definitions:
- x W z if: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- x NW z if: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- x SW z if: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Given supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and the absence of other constraints on the y-coordinates of x and z, all three relations (W, NW, and SW) are possible depending on the specific y-coordinates.

Can any other relation be possible? Let's check:
- For any relation other than W, NW, and SW, we'd need a constraint that either contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z) or is not derivable from the given constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Specifically, x is to the west of z and the north-south relationship between x and z can be such that x is to the north of z, south of z, or spans the same height as z.

Let's double check once more. The given constraints are:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
2. supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
3. supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
4. supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From 1 and 3, we get: supx(x) ≤ infx(z). 

This means x is to the west of z. Given the definition of the cardinal direction relations, the only directions that allow one region to be west of another are:

- W (west: the region is to the left, with vertically overlapping boundaries)
- NW (northwest: the region is to the upper left)
- SW (southwest: the region is to the lower left)

The specific cardinal direction relation will depend on the up/down relationship between x and z, which isn't fully constrained by the given information.

OK so I'm confident that W, NW, SW are the only possible relations.

So the final answer is: W, NW, SW.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

W, NW, SW

These are the only possible relations because:

1. From "x is SW of y" we know that:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

2. From "y is NW of z" we know that:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is south of y)

3. By transitivity:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This confirms that x must be west of z. However, the north-south relationship between x and z is not fully constrained by the given information. Both x and z are south of y, but their relative positions to each other in the y-direction can vary.
