PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think about this problem step by step.

We know that:
- x is S of y
- y is E of z

From the definitions provided:
- x S y means that supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y E z means that supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's see what these constraints imply for the relationship between x and z.

From x S y:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y E z:
4. supx(z) <= infx(y)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, I want to determine the possible relations between x and z using these constraints.

From (1) and (5):
supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
This doesn't directly give us a relation between supy(x) and infy(z). But we can infer that y is above x, and z is either level with y or extends below y.

From (2) and (4):
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(y)
Combining these: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x). This indicates that x is to the right of z.

For the other bounds, we have:
From (3): supx(x) <= supx(y)
From (6): supy(y) <= supy(z)

Using all these constraints, let's check each of the possible relations between x and z:

1. x N z: This would require supy(z) <= infy(x), which doesn't follow from our constraints. In fact, we deduced supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), which suggests x is not necessarily north of z.

2. x NE z: This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established supx(z) <= infx(x), but not necessarily supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x might be NE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

3. x E z: This would require supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've established supx(z) <= infx(x), but the other constraints are not directly implied. However, given supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we know supy(x) <= supy(z). The constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) is not guaranteed. So, x might be E of z, but it's not certain.

4. x SE z: This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). We've established supx(z) <= infx(x), but the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) is not directly implied by our given constraints. So, x might be SE of z, but it's not guaranteed.

5. x S z: This would require supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) unless x and z do not overlap horizontally. Therefore, x cannot be S of z.

Wait, there's a contradiction in my reasoning or I'm misinterpreting the constraints. Let me be more careful.

From (2) and (4):
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(y)
This gives supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x).
This condition aligns with the following possible relations: NW, W, SW, N, S, NE, E, SE (but not B).

From (1) and (6):
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
This gives supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
There's no direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z) from these.

Hmm, I'm struggling to make strong conclusions about the y-coordinates. Let me reformulate the problem.

I have:
- x S y: x is below y and overlaps with y horizontally.
- y E z: y is to the right of z and overlaps with z vertically.

Let's visualize this:

```
    z
     +---+
     |   |
     |   |  y
     |   |  +---+
     |   |  |   |
     +---+  |   |
            |   |
            +---+
               
               x
             +---+
             |   |
             |   |
             +---+
```

From this visual, it seems x could be SE, S, or SW of z, or perhaps E or W of z if there's vertical overlap. Let me be more systematic by checking all the constraints.

From x S y:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(y) (x horizontally overlaps with y)

From y E z:
3. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
4. infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(z) (y vertically overlaps with z)

Given these, the possible relations between x and z are:

x SE z:
This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
From (3), we have supx(z) <= infx(y).
From (2), we have infx(y) <= infx(x).
So, supx(z) <= infx(x).
But for supy(x) <= infy(z), we only have supy(x) <= infy(y) from (1).
Given that infy(z) can be less than infy(y) (from (4)), it's not guaranteed that supy(x) <= infy(z).
So, x might not always be SE of z.

Actually, I need to be more precise about the constraints. With x S y, we don't just have x horizontally overlapping with y, but more specifically:
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

Let's use the given constraints and check the possible relations between x and z.

From x S y:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y E z:
4. supx(z) <= infx(y)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z)

Given our constraints:

For x SE z to be true:
We need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
We have: supx(z) <= infx(y) (from 4) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (from 2).
So, supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied.
We also have: supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 1) but infy(z) <= infy(y) (from 5).
We don't necessarily have supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SE z is not guaranteed.

If infy(z) >= infy(y), then we would have supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z), which means supy(x) <= infy(z), satisfying the SE relation. But if infy(z) < infy(y), the relation might not hold.

Ok, let me analyze this problem differently. instead of checking each relation, let me think about what region x position can be relative to region z, based on the constraints.

From the constraints:
- x is below y
- x horizontally overlaps with y
- y is to the right of z
- y vertically overlaps with z

Given that y is to the right of z and x horizontally overlaps with y, the x-coordinate of region x can be:
- completely to the right of z (if infx(x) >= supx(z))
- partially overlapping with z horizontally (if infx(x) < supx(z) and supx(x) > infx(z))
- completely to the left of z (if supx(x) <= infx(z))

But from (4) and (2), we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means region x is completely to the right of z.

Given that y vertically overlaps with z and x is below y, the y-coordinate of region x can be:
- below z (if supy(x) <= infy(z))
- partially overlapping with z vertically (if infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) > infy(z))
- above z (if infy(x) >= supy(z))

From (1) and (5), we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This doesn't give a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible for x to be below z (if supy(x) <= infy(z)), or partially overlapping with z vertically (if supy(x) > infy(z)).

Given these possibilities:
1. If x is completely to the right of z (which it is) and below z, then x is SE of z.
2. If x is completely to the right of z (which it is) and overlaps with z vertically, then x is E of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are SE and E. Is there any relation I'm missing?

Wait, let me double-check the implications of the constraints.

From x S y:
1. supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
2. infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge)
3. supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of y's right edge)

From y E z:
4. supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
5. infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom is below or at y's bottom)
6. supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top is below or at z's top)

From (4) and (2), we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which implies supx(z) <= infx(x), meaning x is to the right of z.

To determine the vertical relationship, we can't directly infer from (1), (5), and (6) without more information.
If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is below z, making the relation x SE z.
If infy(z) < supy(x) <= infy(y), then x and z partially overlap vertically, making the relation x E z.
If infy(y) < supy(x), it would contradict constraint (1). So this case is not possible.

Though, there's still a gap in my understanding based on the constraints. Let me simplify:
- x is south of y.
- y is east of z.

Let me go back to basics. South means below, and East means to the right. So, x is below y, and y is to the right of z.

Given this, x is somewhere below and to the right of z. It could be directly to the right, in which case, x would be E of z. Or it could be below and to the right, in which case, x would be SE of z.

But now I'm realizing there's more. If x extends westwards such that there's a horizontal overlap with z, then x could be S of z. And if x is west of z, then it could be SW of z.

Let me rethink this carefully using the constraints:

From (4) and (2), we have supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). Hence we have region x to be to the right of z.

That means the possible relations could be NE, E, SE

Constraints along they y-axis:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from 1)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from 5)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from 6)

From these, we can infer:
supy(x) <= infy(y)

While we know infy(z) <= infy(y), we can't directly compare supy(x) and infy(z) or supy(x) and supy(z) based on the given constraints. The relationship between x and z along the y-axis is not fully determined.

Actually, let me try to see this problem differently.

Direction relations are defined using the minimum bounding boxes of the regions. Let's consider a simple case where regions x, y, and z are represented by their bounding boxes for convenience.

Given that x is S of y, the following conditions are true:
- y's bottom edge is above x's top edge (supy(x) <= infy(y)).
- Both x and y have some horizontal overlap.

Given that y is E of z, the following conditions are true:
- z's right edge is to the left of y's left edge (supx(z) <= infx(y)).
- Both y and z have some vertical overlap.

Let me represent these regions as coordinate intervals. Let's denote:
- x: [x_left, x_right] × [x_bottom, x_top]
- y: [y_left, y_right] × [y_bottom, y_top]
- z: [z_left, z_right] × [z_bottom, z_top]

Given that x is S of y:
- x_top <= y_bottom
- y_left <= x_left and x_right <= y_right (horizontal overlap)

Given that y is E of z:
- z_right <= y_left
- z_bottom <= y_bottom and y_top <= z_top (vertical overlap)

Now, what's the relation between x and z?

From the above constraints, we know:
- z_right <= y_left <= x_left, so x is the right of z.
- x_top <= y_bottom (x is below y) and z_bottom <= y_bottom (z's bottom is below or at y's bottom).

This means region z could extend below y, in which case, x could be either E of z (if they have vertical overlap) or SE of z (if x is below z). But I don't think region z can be below region x, because from our constraints x is below y and y can only go as low as the bottom of z.

Let's try to list possible scenarios to better understand:

1. z_bottom = y_bottom, we know x_top <= y_bottom, so this x_top <= z_bottom, meaning x is SE of z.
2. z_bottom < y_bottom, we have x_top <= y_bottom, we also have to compare x_top with z_bottom:
    a. If x_top <= z_bottom, then x is completely below z, making it SE of z.
    b. If x_top > z_bottom, then x and z have some vertical overlap, making it E of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are SE and E.

Let me check if there are any other possible relations that I'm not seeing.

The relationship along the x-axis is clear: region x is to the right of region z. This means the possible relations could only be NE, E, or SE.

For NE, we would need x_bottom > z_top (or infy(x) > supy(z)), which we can't infer from the given constraints. If anything, as I've reasoned, z might extend below y, and since we know x is below y, it seems unlikely.

So I'll stick with E and SE as the possible relations between x and z.

Actually, I think I'm still missing something.

If region x overlaps with region y horizontally and region y is to the right of region z, does it just mean region x is to the right of region z? Not necessarily. Let me clarify.

The conditions for x S y are:
supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x horizontally overlaps with y)

The conditions for y E z are:
supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y vertically overlaps with z)

Since infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(y), we get supx(z) <= infx(x). This means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x, which confirms that region x is to the right of region z.

Ok, so back to analysis of the y-coordinates:

Given that supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y), x is below y.
And given that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z), y is both above the bottom of z and below the top of z.

If I were to rank their top and bottom edges, we have:
x_top <= y_bottom (from x S y)
z_bottom <= y_bottom (from y E z)
y_top <= z_top (from y E z)

From these, we know:
x_top <= y_bottom, so x is below the bottom edge of y.
y_bottom can be above or equal to z_bottom, and I need the relationship between x_top and z_bottom to determine if x is below z or if there's some vertical overlap.

If x_top <= z_bottom, then x is entirely below z, making it SE of z.
If x_top > z_bottom, then there's some vertical overlap between x and z, making it E of z.

Since z_bottom can be as high as y_bottom (from the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y)), and we've established that x_top <= y_bottom, it's possible that x_top <= z_bottom. It's also possible that z_bottom is lower, and there's some overlap between x and z vertically.

So we're back to saying the possible relations between x and z are SE and E.

After reading the definitions again, here's the concise reasoning:

1. For the relation SE, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   From our constraints, we have:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which gives us supx(z) <= infx(x). This satisfies the first condition for SE.
   - For the second condition, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). It's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), but not necessary. If supy(x) <= infy(z), then the relation would be SE.

2. For the relation E, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From our constraints:
   - We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - For the second part, we do not have direct information about infy(x) or the relation between infy(z) and infy(x). 
   - We do know that supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), but this doesn't directly give us the relation between supy(x) and supy(z).
   
   However, if there's a configuration where region z extends below region y such that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) holds, then the relation would be E.

3. For the relation S, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   From our constraints:
   - The first condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), might be satisfied as discussed earlier.
   - But the second condition, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), is contradicted by supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
   
   So, the relation S is not possible.

None of the other relations seem to be compatible with our constraints.

So, based on our analysis, I think the possible relations between x and z are SE and E. But let me try to think of concrete examples to confirm this.

Let's say:
- Region z spans from (0, 0) to (3, 6).
- Region y spans from (4, 2) to (7, 5).
- Region x spans from (5, 0) to (6, 1).

In this scenario:
- x S y because x's top edge (1) is below y's bottom edge (2) and x horizontally overlaps with y. Specifically, y_left (4) <= x_left (5) and x_right (6) <= y_right (7).
- y E z because y's left edge (4) is to the right of z's right edge (3) and y vertically overlaps with z. In particular, z_bottom (0) <= y_bottom (2) and y_top (5) <= z_top (6).
- For the relation between x and z, we have supx(z) (3) <= infx(x) (5) and supy(x) (1) <= infy(z) (0) is not true. However, infy(z) (0) <= infy(x) (0) and supy(x) (1) <= supy(z) (6) are both true. This means x is E of z.

Let me try another example:
- Region z spans from (0, 2) to (3, 6).
- Region y spans from (4, 2) to (7, 5).
- Region x spans from (5, 0) to (6, 1).

In this case:
- x S y.
- y E z.
- For the relation between x and z, we have supx(z) (3) <= infx(x) (5) and supy(x) (1) <= infy(z) (2). This means x is SE of z.

But I also think there could be an example where x SW is of z, wait let me think about it...

For the relation SW, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

But from our constraints, we have:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This gives us supx(z) <= infx(x), which doesn't directly contradict supx(x) <= infx(z). But if we take into account that regions are connected, I think it might be challenging to construct an example where both supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z) are true, but I could try:

Actually, I think I was wrong about there being a case where region x is SW of region z. For x to be SW of z, the right edge of x would have to be to the left of the left edge of z, which would mean supx(x) <= infx(z). But from our constraints, we also have supx(z) <= infx(x), which would mean supx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z). That is, z is completely to the left of x, and x is completely to the left of z, which is a contradiction unless both regions are degenerate.

So, reaffirming my analysis, the possible relations between x and z are E and SE.

Actually, I think I need to recheck my analysis because the relations E and SE are both based on supx(z) <= infx(x), but E requires vertical overlap (infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)) while SE requires supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given the constraints:
- From x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y E z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

We can't directly infer supy(x) <= infy(z) or infy(z) <= infy(x). Both might be possible based on the actual positions of the regions.

Let me try to reason through all the possibilities.

From x S y and y E z, the only definite constraint we have on the x-coordinate is supx(z) <= infx(x). This indicates that region x is to the right of region z. Now, for the y-coordinate:

1. supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
3. supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is below z, and combined with x being to the right of z, this would give the SE relation.

If infy(z) < supy(x) and infy(x) < supy(z), then x and z have some vertical overlap. Combined with x being to the right of z, this would give the E relation.

Now, I can't directly check if infy(z) < supy(x) from our constraints because I only have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). If infy(z) < infy(y), there might be cases where infy(z) < supy(x) <= infy(y), allowing for vertical overlap. Conversely, if infy(z) = infy(y), then we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z), which would point to the SE relation.

Regarding infy(x) < supy(z), we don't have direct constraints. However, if we consider a case where x is completely below y and y is somewhere vertically within z, it's plausible that x is below z (SE relation). Conversely, if z extends significantly below y, then x might have some vertical overlap with z (E relation).

So, given the constraints, both the SE and E relations are possible between x and z, depending on the actual positioning of the regions.

Finally, I don't think there are any other possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z. The fact that x is to the right of z immediately rules out NW, W, SW, B. Also, if the horizontal projections of the regions don't overlap, then N and S are also ruled out. Given the only guarantee is that x is to the right of z (i.e., supx(z) <= infx(x)), the possible directions are NE, E, and SE.

Now, to further narrow this down:

For NE, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). From our constraints, we know:
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)

But there's no relation between supy(z) and infy(x) deducible from our constraints. We could have infy(x) > supy(z) making NE possible, but we could also have infy(x) <= supy(z) making NE not applicable. 

I think NE is potentially possible, but I need to double check:

Let's construct a concrete example:
- Say we have region z at (0, 0) to (3, 2)
- Region y at (4, 0) to (5, 1) (which is E of z)
- Region x at (4, 3) to (5, 4) (which is N of y)

Wait, this doesn't work because x would then be N of y, not S. Let me adjust:

- Region z at (0, 0) to (3, 4)
- Region y at (4, 1) to (5, 3) (which is E of z)
- Region x at (4, 0) to (5, 0.5) (which is S of y)

This satisfies the relation x S y and y E z, but x is E of z, not NE. Actually, I think I'm confused about the example.

Let's try with:
- Region z at (0, 0) to (3, 10)
- Region y at (4, 5) to (5, 7) (which is E of z)
- Region x at (4, 4) to (5, 4.5) (which is S of y)

Now, x is S of y, y is E of z, and x is also E of z (not NE).

I think I misunderstood again. Let's try once more but check carefully based on the definitions:

- Region z at (0, 0) to (3, 10)
- Region y at (4, 2) to (6, 5) (y is E of z because supx(z) (3) <= infx(y) (4) and infy(z) (0) <= infy(y) (2) <= supy(z) (10) and supy(y) (5) <= supy(z) (10))
- Region x at (5, 0) to (7, 1) (x is S of y because supy(x) (1) <= infy(y) (2) and infx(y) (4) <= infx(x) (5) <= supx(y) (6))

Now, x is S of y, y is E of z, and for the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) (3) <= infx(x) (5) (satisfies condition for E, NE, SE)
- infy(z) (0) <= infy(x) (0) and supy(x) (1) <= supy(z) (10) (satisfies condition for E)

So, x is E of z in this example.

If I adjust the regions a bit:
- Region z at (0, 2) to (3, 10)
- Region y at (4, 2) to (6, 5) (y is E of z)
- Region x at (5, 0) to (7, 1) (x is S of y)

Now, x is S of y, y is E of z, and for the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) (3) <= infx(x) (5) (satisfies condition for E, NE, SE)
- supy(x) (1) <= infy(z) (2) (satisfies condition for SE)

So, x is SE of z in this adjusted example.

Let's try for NE:
- Region z at (0, 0) to (3, 3)
- Region y at (4, 2) to (6, 3) (y is E of z)
- Region x at (5, 4) to (7, 5) (x is S of y)

Wait, if x is at (5, 4) to (7, 5), it's N of y, not S. I wanted region x to be S of y!

Ok, let me rethink and make sure my understanding of the definitions is clear.

For x S y, I need:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (for horizontal overlap)

So, region x needs to be completely below region y, and there should be a horizontal overlap.

For y E z, I need:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (for vertical overlap)

So, region y needs to be completely to the right of region z, and there should be a vertical overlap.

Let's construct a scenario for NE:
- Region z at (0, 0) to (3, 3)
- Region y at (4, 0) to (7, 2) (y is E of z because supx(z) (3) <= infx(y) (4) and infy(z) (0) <= infy(y) (0) and supy(y) (2) <= supy(z) (3))
- Region x at (5, -2) to (6, -1) (x is S of y because supy(x) (-1) <= infy(y) (0) and infx(y) (4) <= infx(x) (5) and supx(x) (6) <= supx(y) (7))

For the relation between x and z, I need to check if x is NE of z:
- supx(z) (3) <= infx(x) (5) (first condition satisfied)
- supy(z) (3) <= infy(x) (-2) => 3 <= -2 (False!)

My mistake. For x to be NE of z, I'd need the bottom of x to be above the top of z, but that's not true in our construction. Let's revise.

For NE, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x).

Given our constraints, we know:
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)

The relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) can't be deduced directly from our constraints. But given that x is below y (from x S y), I don't think x could be above z, which is the requirement for NE.

Specifically, supy(x) <= infy(y) means the top of x is below the bottom of y. And if y vertically overlaps with z (from y E z), the top of z is at least as high as the top of y. This places z at a higher vertical position than x, making it unlikely for x to be NE of z.

So I think the most plausible relations are SE and E.

Actually, let's go back the original definition in the problem:

For the relation SE, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

Putting in our constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z) and infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y) imply supx(z) <= infx(x).
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z) don't directly give us a relation between supy(x) and infy(z). It depends on the actual positioning.

For the relation E, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've already established supx(z) <= infx(x).
For the other conditions:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z) and there's no direct relation between infy(y) and infy(x). It will need to be determined.
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z), which don't directly determine a relation between supy(x) and supy(z), but from my intuition, supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= supy(z). So, the third condition for E (supy(x) <= supy(z)) is satisfied.

Since we only need to check possible relations between x and z, let's see:

From the given constraints, we have:
1. x is to the right of z (supx(z) <= infx(x)).
2. The top of x is below the bottom of y (supy(x) <= infy(y)).
3. z and y have vertical overlap (infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)).

The relation between x and z can be:
- SE if supy(x) <= infy(z).
- E if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- NE if supy(z) <= infy(x).

Given our constraints, NE is unlikely because if x is below y and z extends at least as high as y, then x is unlikely to be above z.

For E, the first condition is dependent on the specific positioning. But given that x is below y and z overlaps with y vertically, there's a reasonable possibility of infy(z) <= infy(x).

For SE, if infy(z) > supy(x), then x is SE of z. This is also a strong possibility, especially if z has its bottom edge not much below y's bottom edge.

To create an example for the NE relation, I'd need z to have a much lower top edge than y. That doesn't align with the constraint supy(y) <= supy(z). So NE isn't a possibility.

I am convinced based on the constraints, the only possible relations are SE and E.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are SE and E:
- SE if the top of x is below the bottom of z.
- E if x and z have some vertical overlap, with x being to the right of z.

Come to think of it, let me think through this one more time.

Given that x is S of y and y is E of z, I'm trying to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

The constraint x S y gives: supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).
The constraint y E z gives: supx(z) <= infx(y), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From these, we can deduce:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which gives supx(z) <= infx(x). This confirms that x is always to the right of z.

Now, we need to figure out the vertical relations:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

The key uncertain relation is between supy(x) and infy(z). If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is below z, making it SE. If supy(x) > infy(z), there's some vertical overlap, making it E.

Wait, I want to double check the E relation. 

For E, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've established:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

From these, we can determine:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (first condition for E is met)
- infy(z) <= infy(y), but we need infy(z) <= infy(x). These might not be the same.
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), so we can say supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z). Thus the third condition is met.

So, for the E relation, the question is: can infy(z) <= infy(x)?

Given that x is S of y (supy(x) <= infy(y)), there's a gap between the top of x and the bottom of y. If infy(x) is close to supy(x) (i.e., x is a relatively flat region), and if infy(z) is well below infy(y), then it's plausible that infy(z) <= infy(x).

Conversely, if infy(x) is much lower than supy(x) and infy(z) is close to infy(y), then it's possible that infy(z) > infy(x).

Without more constraints, both scenarios are possible.

Let me also check the possibility of the NE relation.

For NE, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

We've already established:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (first condition is met)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y E z)

If supy(y) = supy(z) and infy(x) > supy(y), then NE would be a possible relation.

But given supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y), it's clear that the top of x is below the bottom of y. So, infy(x) is at or below supy(x), which is at or below infy(y).

So, infy(x) <= infy(y), while on the other hand, supy(y) <= supy(z). Combining these, we get infy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).

This gives us infy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the second condition for NE (supy(z) <= infy(x)). Thus NE and N are not possible.

For the S relation, we'd need:
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've already established:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from x S y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y E z). These don't directly give a relation between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), but it's also possible that supy(x) > infy(z).
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x S y) and supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y E z). These give us supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the second condition for S (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)).

So, the S relation is not possible.

Similarly, the SW, W, NW, and B relations are all not possible because of the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), which indicates that x is always to the right of z.

In conclusion, after checking all the possible cardinal directions, the only possible relations between x and z are SE and E.

Hold on I think I misunderstood one of the constraints. For x S y, I stated infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), meaning x is horizontally contained within y. However, the definition says:

a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

So for x S y, the constraints are:
supy(x) <= infy(y), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y).

Which is what I had before. Reviewing the definitions, I believe I considered the right constraints for both x S y and y E z.

I'll review once more just to be sure.

For x S y, I need:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally contained within y)

For y E z, I need:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y is vertically contained within z)

From these, I've already deduced:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- The relation between supy(x) and infy(z) can't be determined for certain from these constraints. It could be either supy(x) <= infy(z) or supy(x) > infy(z).

If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SE of z. If supy(x) > infy(z) and other conditions are met, x could be E of z.

I've also ruled out the possibility of x being NE, N, NW, W, SW, S, or B in relation to z.

In conclusion, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SE and E.

So the answer to the original question is: E and SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints:
1. x is S of y: This means x is below y with horizontal overlap.
2. y is E of z: This means y is to the right of z with vertical overlap.

From these constraints, I can determine:

For the x-coordinate relationship:
- From y E z: supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x S y: infx(y) <= infx(x)
- Therefore: supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means region x is always to the right of region z, which immediately rules out W, NW, SW, and B relations.

For the y-coordinate relationship:
- From x S y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y E z: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

These constraints lead to two possible scenarios:
1. If supy(x) <= infy(z): Then x is SE of z
2. If infy(z) < supy(x) and other conditions for E are met: Then x is E of z

The N, NE, and S relations are not possible given our constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: E, SE
