PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y. This means x is in the Northwest direction from y.
- Region y is SE of region z. This means y is in the Southeast direction from z.

We need to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's recall the definitions:
- a NW b means: supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a SE b means: supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So:
- x NW y means: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about the relation between x and z.

From x NW y, we know:
1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
2) supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y SE z, we know:
3) supx(z) <= infx(y)
4) supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these, we can say:
5) supx(x) <= infx(y) (from 1)
6) supx(z) <= infx(y) (from 3)

We can't directly compare supx(x) and supx(z) or infx(x) and infx(z) using the given information. Same for the y-coordinates.

Let's try to visualize this. We know that:
- x is to the left (west) of y, and also above (north) of y.
- z is to the left (west) of y, and also above (north) of y.

This means both x and z are in the northwest quadrant relative to y. But their relative positions to each other can vary. 

Let's consider possible cases:

Case 1: x is to the left of z.
This means supx(x) <= infx(z). Combined with supx(z) <= infx(y), we get supx(x) <= infx(y), which is already given.

Case 2: x is to the right of z.
This means supx(z) <= infx(x). 

Case 3: x overlaps with z along the x-axis.
This means there's some portion of x and z that have the same x-coordinates.

Similarly, for the y-coordinate:

Case A: x is above z.
This means supy(z) <= infy(x). Combined with supy(y) <= infy(z), we get supy(y) <= infy(x), which is already given.

Case B: x is below z.
This means supy(x) <= infy(z).

Case C: x overlaps with z along the y-axis.
This means there's some portion of x and z that have the same y-coordinates.

Now, let's combine these cases to find all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

Case 1A: x is to the left and above z.
This corresponds to the NW relation: x NW z.

Case 1B: x is to the left and below z.
This corresponds to the SW relation: x SW z.

Case 1C: x is to the left and overlaps with z along the y-axis.
This corresponds to the W relation: x W z.

Case 2A: x is to the right and above z.
This corresponds to the NE relation: x NE z.

Case 2B: x is to the right and below z.
This corresponds to the SE relation: x SE z.

Case 2C: x is to the right and overlaps with z along the y-axis.
This corresponds to the E relation: x E z.

Case 3A: x overlaps with z along the x-axis and is above z.
This corresponds to the N relation: x N z.

Case 3B: x overlaps with z along the x-axis and is below z.
This corresponds to the S relation: x S z.

Case 3C: x completely overlaps with z.
This corresponds to the B relation: x B z or z B x.

However, I think I need to be more careful in my reasoning. Let's reconsider by directly using the constraints we have.

From x NW y, we know:
1) supx(x) <= infx(y)
2) supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y SE z, we know:
3) supx(z) <= infx(y)
4) supy(y) <= infy(z)

From 1) and 3), we have:
5) supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y)

This doesn't directly tell us anything about the relative positions of x and z along the x-axis. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or overlap with z along the x-axis.

From 2) and 4), we have:
6) supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Again, this doesn't directly tell us anything about the relative positions of x and z along the y-axis. x could be above z, below z, or overlap with z along the y-axis.

So, based on this, any of the nine cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) could hold between x and z.

Wait, let's see if I can constrain this further. We know that:
- x is to the left of y (supx(x) <= infx(y))
- z is to the left of y (supx(z) <= infx(y))
- x is above y (supy(y) <= infy(x))
- z is above y (supy(y) <= infy(z))

Let's see if there are any scenarios that can be eliminated.

Case 1: x NW z
This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible.

Case 2: x N z
This means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible.

Case 3: x NE z
This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This is possible.

Case 4: x W z
This means supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). This is possible.

Case 5: x B z
This means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). This is possible.

Case 6: x E z
This means supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). This is possible.

Case 7: x SW z
This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This is possible.

Case 8: x S z
This means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z). This is possible.

Case 9: x SE z
This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This is possible.

Actually, let me be even more careful. Let's think about this in terms of coordinates.

Assign coordinates to y: (y_x1, y_y1) for the bottom-left corner and (y_x2, y_y2) for the top-right corner.

From x NW y:
x_x2 <= y_x1
y_y2 <= x_y1

From y SE z:
z_x2 <= y_x1
y_y2 <= z_y1

Let's place y at the origin (0, 0) for the bottom-left corner and (1, 1) for the top-right corner. Then:

From x NW y:
x_x2 <= 0
1 <= x_y1

This means x is entirely to the left of the y-axis and entirely above the line y = 1.

From y SE z:
z_x2 <= 0
1 <= z_y1

This means z is entirely to the left of the y-axis and entirely above the line y = 1.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z can be any of the 9 cardinal directions, because the constraints don't completely determine the relative positions of x and z.

But wait, there's another way to think about this.

Since x is NW of y:
- x is entirely west of y (i.e., to the left)
- x is entirely north of y (i.e., above)

Since y is SE of z:
- y is entirely east of z (i.e., to the right)
- y is entirely south of z (i.e., below)

By transitivity, we can say:
- If y is entirely east of z, and x is entirely west of y, then x must be entirely west of y which is entirely west of z. So, x must be west of z.
- If y is entirely south of z, and x is entirely north of y, then x must be entirely north of y which is entirely south of z.

But, this doesn't tell us if x is northwest, north, or northeast of z, only that x is north of z. Similarly, we only know that x is west of z, but not whether it's northwest, west, or southwest.

Actually, I think I was confusing myself. Let's think in a different way.

I've given coordinates, so let's place our regions on a graph. Assume the y-axis is oriented so that higher values are "north".

Let's place y at the origin (0, 0) for the bottom-left corner and (1, 1) for the top-right corner.

From x NW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y), which means supx(x) <= 0. This means x is entirety to the west of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(x), which means 1 <= infy(x). This means x is entirely to the north of y.

From y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y), which means supx(z) <= 0. This means z is entirety to the west of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(z), which means 1 <= infy(z). This means z is entirely to the north of y.

Given these constraints, both x and z are entirely to the west and north of y. But the relative positions of x and z to each other can vary.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be:
- x NW z (if x is northwest of z)
- x N z (if x is north of z)
- x NE z (if x is northeast of z)
- x W z (if x is west of z)
- x B z (if x contains z or is equal to z)
- x E z (if x is east of z)
- x SW z (if x is southwest of z)
- x S z (if x is south of z)
- x SE z (if x is southeast of z)

In other words, without further constraints, any of the nine cardinal direction relations could hold between x and z.

Actually, I think there's a mistake in the above reasoning. Let me think about it differently.

Given that y is the reference point, let's define the position of y is (0, 0) at the bottom-left corner and (1, 1) at the top-right corner.

Now, if x is NW of y, this means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y), which implies supx(x) <= 0. This means x is entirely to the west of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(x), which implies 1 <= infy(x). This means x is entirely to the north of y.

If y is SE of z, this means:
- supx(z) <= infx(y), which implies supx(z) <= 0. This means z is entirely to the west of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(z), which implies 1 <= infy(z). This means z is entirely to the north of y.

Now, let's think about the relative positions of x and z.

From the constraints:
- Both x and z are entirely to the west of y.
- Both x and z are entirely to the north of y.

But, without further information, we can't determine the exact relation between x and z. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or overlap with z along the x-axis. Similarly, x could be above z, below z, or overlap with z along the y-axis.

So, the possible relations between x and z can be any of the nine cardinal directions: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.

Actually, I think my previous reasoning was slightly off. Let's correct it.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y.
- Region y is SE of region z.

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

Let's define a coordinate system such that the origin is at the bottom-left corner of a grid.

If x is NW of y, then:
- supx(x) <= infx(y). This means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(x). This means the topmost point of y is below the bottommost point of x.

If y is SE of z, then:
- supx(z) <= infx(y). This means the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of y.
- supy(y) <= infy(z). This means the topmost point of y is below the bottommost point of z.

Now, let's analyze the relative positions of x and z.

From the above, we can infer:
- Both x and z are to the left of y.
- Both x and z are above y.

Let's consider the x-coordinate first. We know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y)

This doesn't tell us anything about the relative positions of x and z along the x-axis. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or overlap with z.

Similarly, for the y-coordinate, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Again, this doesn't give us information about the relative positions of x and z along the y-axis. x could be above z, below z, or overlap with z.

Given these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE. Essentially, all possible cardinal directions are valid.

Hmm, but we've actually determined that x and z must both be to the west of y and both be to the north of y. Does this impose any constraints of the relationship between x and z?

First, for the west condition:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y)

This tells us both x and z are entirely to the west of y, but it doesn't tell us which one is more to the west, or if they overlap.

Similarly, for the north condition:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

This tells us both x and z are entirely to the north of y, but again, it doesn't determine their relative positions.

So, to reiterate, the possible relations between x and z can be any of the nine cardinal directions: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.

Actually, let me check a single case to make sure. Can x be SW of z? Let's check:

If x is SW of z, then:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

Now, let's see if this conflicts with our constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (z is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is to the north of y)

If x is SW of z, then x is to the south of z. This means supy(x) <= infy(z).

From our constraints, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is to the north of y)

If supy(x) <= infy(z), it would mean that supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). But then we'd have supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which is a contradiction. The bottom of x cannot be above the top of x.

So, it's not possible for x to be SW of z.

Let's think about each of the nine relations one by one:

1. x NW z: This is possible.
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   This doesn't contradict any of our constraints.

2. x N z: This is possible.
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (x and z overlap in the x-axis)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   This also doesn't contradict our constraints.

3. x NE z: This is possible.
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   This doesn't contradict our constraints.

4. x W z: This is possible.
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) (x and z overlap in the y-axis)

   This doesn't contradict our constraints.

5. x B z: This is possible.
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is contained within z in the x-axis)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is contained within z in the y-axis)

   This doesn't contradict our constraints.

6. x E z: This is possible.
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z) (x and z overlap in the y-axis)

   This doesn't contradict our constraints.

7. x SW z: This might be problematic. If x is SW of z, then:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

   From our constraints, we know:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is to the north of y)

   If x is to the south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), and both x and z are to the north of y, then y is considerably below both x and z. This doesn't contradict our constraints, so x SW z is possible.

8. x S z: This is possible.
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) (x and z overlap in the x-axis)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

   From our constraints, we know:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is to the north of y)

   If x is to the south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), then we have supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). This doesn't contradict our constraints, so x S z is possible.

9. x SE z: This is possible.
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

   Following the same logic as for x S z, this doesn't contradict our constraints. So, x SE z is possible.

Actually, wait. I don't think this analysis is correct. Let me redo it.

Let me try to handle this problem more carefully.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- Region y is SE of region z: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's analyze the possible relations between x and z. Instead of going through each possible relation one by one, which may introduce errors, let's deduce constraints on the relative positions of x and z and then see which relations are possible.

For the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)

This tells us that both x and z are to the west of y, but it doesn't tell us anything about the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis. x can be to the east of z, west of z, or overlapping with z along the x-axis.

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

This tells us that both x and z are to the north of y. Again, it doesn't give us information about the relative positions of x and z on the y-axis.

Let's check the east-west relationship between x and z. There are three possibilities:
a) x is to the west of z: supx(x) <= infx(z)
b) x is to the east of z: supx(z) <= infx(x)
c) x and z overlap along the x-axis: Neither (a) nor (b) holds.

Similarly, for the north-south relationship:
a) x is to the north of z: supy(z) <= infy(x)
b) x is to the south of z: supy(x) <= infy(z)
c) x and z overlap along the y-axis: Neither (a) nor (b) holds.

Now, let's try to check if any of these combinations result in a contradiction with our given constraints.

East-West Case a) with North-South Case a): x is to the west of z and to the north of z.
This means x is NW of z. This doesn't contradict our given constraints.

East-West Case a) with North-South Case b): x is to the west of z and to the south of z.
This means x is SW of z. Let's check if this contradicts our constraints.

From the constraints, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is to the north of y)

If x is to the south of z (supy(x) <= infy(z)), it doesn't contradict that both x and z are to the north of y. So, x SW z is possible.

East-West Case a) with North-South Case c): x is to the west of z and overlaps with z along the y-axis.
This means x is W of z. This doesn't contradict our constraints.

East-West Case b) with North-South Case a): x is to the east of z and to the north of z.
This means x is NE of z. This doesn't contradict our constraints.

East-West Case b) with North-South Case b): x is to the east of z and to the south of z.
This means x is SE of z. Following the logic similar to x SW z, this doesn't contradict our constraints.

East-West Case b) with North-South Case c): x is to the east of z and overlaps with z along the y-axis.
This means x is E of z. This doesn't contradict our constraints.

East-West Case c) with North-South Case a): x overlaps with z along the x-axis and is to the north of z.
This means x is N of z. This doesn't contradict our constraints.

East-West Case c) with North-South Case b): x overlaps with z along the x-axis and is to the south of z.
This means x is S of z. Following the logic similar to x SW z, this doesn't contradict our constraints.

East-West Case c) with North-South Case c): x overlaps with z along both the x-axis and the y-axis.
This means x and z have a bounding box relationship (B). This doesn't contradict our constraints.

So, from this analysis, all nine cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible between x and z based on the given constraints.

Let me double check by analyzing one of the cases.

If x is SW of z, then:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's set up a coordinate system. Suppose y is at (0, 0) at its bottom-left corner and at (1, 1) at its top-right corner. Given the constraints:

- supx(x) <= infx(y) => supx(x) <= 0
- supy(y) <= infy(x) => 1 <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) => supx(z) <= 0
- supy(y) <= infy(z) => 1 <= infy(z)

I think of it this way: x is entirely the west and north of y. z is entirely to the west and north of y. Both x and z are in the "northwest quadrant" from y's perspective. But within this quadrant, the relative position of x and z can vary.

Let's visualize a scenario where x is SW of z to see if it contradicts our constraints:

          z
        /
       /
      x
     /
    /
   y

In this diagram, x is SW of z, both x and z are NW of y, and y is SE of z. This doesn't contradict our constraints, which confirms that x SW z is a possible relation.

Similarly, we can arrive at examples for each of the other cardinal direction relations without contradicting our constraints.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B.

Actually, let me try one more time: if x is SW of z, this means
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

From our constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (from y SE z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SE z)

Given that supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), can we prove that supy(y) <= infy(z)? Well it will be true in this case, because supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). So x SW z is consistent with our constraints.

Let me also double check if x can be to the south of z. If x is to the south of z, then supy(x) <= infy(z). From our constraints, we know supy(y) <= infy(x). This means supy(y) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). Again, this is consistent with our constraints.

Let me check if there are any other constraints that might lead to inconsistencies or contradictions with any of the nine cardinal direction relations.

I've checked the combinations of north, south, east, and west positioning of x relative to z. I don't see any inconsistencies with the given constraints. Therefore, all nine cardinal direction relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible between x and z based on the given constraints.

Hmm, I've had several rounds of analysis. Let me just try to reason with some conrete coordinates to be sure. If y is at (0, 0) at the bottom-left and at (1, 1) at the top-right, then:

- x NW y means:
  - supx(x) <= 0 (x is to the west of y)
  - 1 <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

- y SE z means:
  - supx(z) <= 0 (z is to the west of y)
  - 1 <= infy(z) (z is to the north of y)

Now, let's consider each of the possible relations between x and z:

1. x NW z: This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Example: x is at (-3, 3) to (-2, 4) and z is at (-1, 1.5) to (0, 2).

2. x N z: This means infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Example: x is at (-1.5, 3) to (-0.5, 4) and z is at (-2, 1.5) to (0, 2).

3. x NE z: This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   Example: x is at (-0.5, 3) to (0, 4) and z is at (-2, 1.5) to (-1, 2).

4. x W z: This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Example: x is at (-3, 1.7) to (-2, 1.9) and z is at (-1, 1.5) to (0, 2).

5. x B z: This means infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Example: x is at (-1.8, 1.7) to (-1.5, 1.9) and z is at (-2, 1.5) to (-1, 2).

6. x E z: This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z).
   Example: x is at (-0.8, 1.7) to (-0.5, 1.9) and z is at (-2, 1.5) to (-1, 2).

7. x SW z: This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Example: x is at (-3, 1.2) to (-2, 1.4) and z is at (-1, 1.5) to (0, 2).

8. x S z: This means infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Example: x is at (-1.5, 1.2) to (-0.5, 1.4) and z is at (-2, 1.5) to (0, 2).

9. x SE z: This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   Example: x is at (-0.5, 1.2) to (0, 1.4) and z is at (-2, 1.5) to (-1, 2).

I can provide concrete examples for each of the nine cardinal direction relations. As such, all nine relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) are possible between x and z based on the given constraints.

So, the answer I've settled on is that any of the cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) is possible between x and z.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

From the definition of NW relation:
- If x NW y, then supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

From the definition of SE relation:
- If y SE z, then supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Looking at these constraints, we can see that both x and z are located to the west of y (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)), and both x and z are located to the north of y (since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).

However, these constraints don't determine the exact relation between x and z. The regions x and z could be oriented in any of the possible cardinal direction relationships relative to each other.

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
