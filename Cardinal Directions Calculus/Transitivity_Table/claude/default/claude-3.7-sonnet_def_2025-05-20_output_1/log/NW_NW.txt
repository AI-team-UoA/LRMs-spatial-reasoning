PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the situation step by step.

We know that:
- Region x is NW of region y, so x NW y
- Region y is NW of region z, so y NW z

According to the definitions:

x NW y means that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

y NW z means that:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z.

From x NW y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

By transitivity, we get:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means x is to the west of z.

From x NW y, we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

From y NW z, we have:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

By transitivity, we get:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

This means x is to the north of z.

So, x is both to the west of z and to the north of z. This means x NW z.

Actually, wait. Let me double-check this. There's something off in my reasoning.

From x NW y, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

For x to be to the west of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Thus, x is to the west of z.

For x to be to the north of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x). So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Thus, x is to the north of z.

So, x is both to the west of z and to the north of z, which means x NW z.

Let me try once more, as I think I was getting confused by the definitions.

x NW y means that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

y NW z means that:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

For x to be to the west of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can conclude supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, x is to the west of z.

For x to be to the north of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we can conclude supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x is to the north of z.

So, indeed, x NW z.

Actually, let me re-examine the definition of "x NW y":

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

So, x NW y means:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y): This means that x is entirely to the west of y.
2. supy(y) <= infy(x): This means that x is entirely to the north of y.

Now, let's use this definition:

- x NW y means: 
  - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is west of y)
  - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)

- y NW z means:
  - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is west of z)
  - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is north of z)

Now, for x and z:

For the x-coordinate, we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is west of z.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y)
Therefore, supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is north of z.

Thus, since x is both west of z and north of z, the relation between x and z is NW.

But, let me double-check again:

I think I need to be careful about the order of the inequalities:

a NW b if and only if:
1. supx(a) <= infx(b): a is to the west of b
2. supy(b) <= infy(a): a is to the north of b

So, x NW y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y): x is to the west of y
- supy(y) <= infy(x): x is to the north of y

And y NW z means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is to the west of z
- supy(z) <= infy(y): y is to the north of z

Now, let's derive the relation between x and z:

From the x-coordinate inequalities:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- infx(y) <= supx(y) (inherent property of regions)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)

Combining these, we get: supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

From the y-coordinate inequalities:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)
- infy(y) <= supy(y) (inherent property of regions)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)

Combining these, we get: supy(z) <= infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

Given that x is both to the west of z and to the north of z, the relation between x and z is NW.

So, the answer is NW.

Actually, I'm overthinking this and getting confused. Let me think about this differently:

When we say "x is NW of y," we mean that x is located in the northwest direction from y. Similarly, "y is NW of z" means y is located in the northwest direction from z. By visual intuition, if we move from z to y and then to x, we're going in the northwest direction twice. So intuitively, x is in the northwest direction from z, which means x NW z.

Let's go back to the definitions. For "a NW b", we have:
- a is west of b: supx(a) <= infx(b)
- a is north of b: supy(b) <= infy(a)

We are given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to determine the relationship between x and z, which could be one of B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE.

Let's check the conditions for each relation:

1. x B z? (x is in the bounding box of z)
   - This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - But we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= infx(z). Therefore, x cannot be in the bounding box of z.

2. x S z? (x is south of z)
   - This requires supy(x) <= infy(z), and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(z) <= infy(y), which implies supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is north of z, so x cannot be south of z.

3. x SW z? (x is southwest of z)
   - This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but supy(z) <= infy(x) (derived from the given conditions). This means x cannot be southwest of z.

4. x W z? (x is west of z)
   - This requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supx(x) <= infx(z), but supy(z) <= infy(x) (derived from the given conditions). This means x cannot be west of z.

5. x NW z? (x is northwest of z)
   - This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Both these conditions hold (as derived from the given conditions). So, x NW z is possible.

6. x N z? (x is north of z)
   - This requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z). This contradicts the condition that infx(z) <= infx(x). Thus, x cannot be north of z.

7. x NE z? (x is northeast of z)
   - This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(x), but supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z). This means supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies x is west of z, not east. So, x cannot be northeast of z.

8. x E z? (x is east of z)
   - This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Using the same logic as for NE, x cannot be east of z.

9. x SE z? (x is southeast of z)
   - This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Using the previous reasoning, x cannot be southeast of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I should reconsider the possible relations more carefully. Let's be more precise.

Let's denote the constraints we know:
- C1: supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x NW y)
- C2: supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x NW y)
- C3: supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y NW z)
- C4: supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z)

Let's step by step work through each of the possible relations between x and z.

For x NW z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (Derived from C1 and C3: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z))
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (Derived from C4 and C2: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x))
So, x NW z is a possible relation.

Actually, I was overcomplicating this. Let's get back to basics.

If x is NW of y, and y is NW of z, then x is NW of z.

Let's verify this:
- x NW y means x is to the northwest of y.
- y NW z means y is to the northwest of z.
- Intuitively, if y is to the northwest of z, and x is further to the northwest of y, then x is to the northwest of z.

Let's verify this rigorously:
- x NW y means:
  - supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is west of y)
  - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is north of y)
- y NW z means:
  - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is west of z)
  - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is north of z)

From this, we can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (using the given constraints and the property that infx(y) <= supx(y))
  which gives supx(x) <= infx(z), meaning x is west of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (using the given constraints and the property that infy(y) <= supy(y))
  which gives supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is north of z.

Since x is both west of z and north of z, the relation between x and z is NW.

So, the possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, this is getting over-complicated. Let me try a visual approach:

If we place the regions on a 2D plane, and if x is to the northwest of y, and y is to the northwest of z, then x is to the northwest of z. This is evident from the geometry of the situation.

But I want to be rigorous. Let's go through the conditions for x to have each possible relation with z.

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

We know from transitivity:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is north of z)

Now, considering each possible relation:

x B z (x is in the bounding box of z):
- Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x B z is not possible.

x S z (x is south of z):
- Requires: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
- But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is not possible.

x SW z (x is southwest of z):
- Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

x W z (x is west of z):
- Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x W z is not possible.

x NW z (x is northwest of z):
- Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)
- So, x NW z is possible.

x N z (x is north of z):
- Requires: supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
- But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x N z is not possible.

x NE z (x is northeast of z):
- Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)
- But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

x E z (x is east of z):
- Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x E z is not possible.

x SE z (x is southeast of z):
- Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x SE z is not possible.

After examining all possible relations, it's clear that based on the given conditions, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Wait, I should be more careful. I need to list the things we know and then derive everything. Let's be methodical.

Given:
1. x NW y: This means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
2. y NW z: This means supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Derivations:
a. supx(x) <= infx(y) (from 1)
b. supx(y) <= infx(z) (from 2)
c. infx(y) <= supx(y) (property of regions)
Combining a, b, and c: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.

d. supy(y) <= infy(x) (from 1)
e. supy(z) <= infy(y) (from 2)
f. infy(y) <= supy(y) (property of regions)
Combining d, e, and f: supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is to the north of z.

Now, let's check each of the possible relations:

x B z (x is in the bounding box of z):
- Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x B z is not possible.

x S z (x is south of z):
- Requires: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
- But we derived supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is not possible.

x SW z (x is southwest of z):
- Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- But we derived supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

x W z (x is west of z):
- Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we derived supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x W z is not possible.

x NW z (x is northwest of z):
- Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)
- So, x NW z is possible.

x N z (x is north of z):
- Requires: supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied), infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
- But we derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x N z is not possible.

x NE z (x is northeast of z):
- Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied)
- But we derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies infx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z). This contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

x E z (x is east of z):
- Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x E z is not possible.

x SE z (x is southeast of z):
- Requires: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- But we derived supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x SE z is not possible.

Given all these checks, the only possible relation between x and z is NW. That is, if x is NW of y and y is NW of z, then x is NW of z.

Wait, I'm not sure if this is a case where there's only one possible answer or if there might be multiple possible answers.

Let's reconsider the general constraints and check if they could be satisfied for multiple relations.

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's see if x and z could have other relationships:

1. Can x be at z (x B z)?
   For this to be true, we'd need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But we know supx(x) <= infx(z) (derived), which contradicts the condition for x B z. So, x B z is not possible.

2. Can x be south of z (x S z)?
   For this to be true, we'd need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   But we know supy(z) <= infy(x) (derived), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for x S z. So, x S z is not possible.

3. Can x be southwest of z (x SW z)?
   For this to be true, we'd need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied from our derivation)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   But we know supy(z) <= infy(x) (derived), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for x SW z. So, x SW z is not possible.

4. Can x be west of z (x W z)?
   For this to be true, we'd need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied from our derivation)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But we know supy(z) <= infy(x) (derived), which contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for x W z. So, x W z is not possible.

5. Can x be northwest of z (x NW z)?
   For this to be true, we'd need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied from our derivation)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
   Both conditions are satisfied, so x NW z is possible.

6. Can x be north of z (x N z)?
   For this to be true, we'd need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
   But we know supx(x) <= infx(z) (derived), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) for x N z. So, x N z is not possible.

7. Can x be northeast of z (x NE z)?
   For this to be true, we'd need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (satisfied from our derivation)
   But we know supx(x) <= infx(z) (derived), which implies infx(x) <= infx(z), and therefore infx(x) <= supx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for x NE z. So, x NE z is not possible.

8. Can x be east of z (x E z)?
   For this to be true, we'd need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But we know supx(x) <= infx(z) (derived), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for x E z. So, x E z is not possible.

9. Can x be southeast of z (x SE z)?
   For this to be true, we'd need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   But we know supx(x) <= infx(z) (derived), which contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) for x SE z. And we also know supy(z) <= infy(x) (derived), which contradicts the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) for x SE z. So, x SE z is not possible.

In conclusion, after checking all nine possible relations, the only possible relation between x and z is NW. So, if x is NW of y and y is NW of z, then x is definitely NW of z.

Actually, wait, I'm overcomplicating the problem. Let's think about this in a simpler way.

The relation "NW" is transitive. If x is NW of y and y is NW of z, then x is NW of z.

Transitivity of NW:
- x NW y means x is to the northwest of y.
- y NW z means y is to the northwest of z.
- If y is to the northwest of z, and x is further to the northwest of y, then x is to the northwest of z.

To confirm this algebraically:
- x NW y implies supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y NW z implies supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y).
- Since infx(y) <= supx(y) (basic property for regions), we have supx(x) <= infx(z) (transitivity).
- Similarly, infy(y) <= supy(y) gives us supy(z) <= infy(x) (transitivity).
- These two derived inequalities define the relation x NW z.

So yes, the answer is NW.

Actually, let me double-check my constraints to make sure I have the definition of NW correct and I'm not confusing myself:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

Yes, this is the definition as provided in the problem statement. So my reasoning above is correct.

Let's also verify by considering a concrete example. Imagine:
- x is a region with the bounding box (0,2) to (1,3).
- y is a region with the bounding box (2,0) to (3,1).
- z is a region with the bounding box (4,-2) to (5,-1).

We can see that:
- supx(x) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2 and supy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, so x NW y.
- supx(y) = 3 <= infx(z) = 4 and supy(z) = -1 <= infy(y) = 0, so y NW z.
- supx(x) = 1 <= infx(z) = 4 and supy(z) = -1 <= infy(x) = 2, so x NW z.

The example confirms that if x NW y and y NW z, then x NW z.

Therefore, the possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I think I'm being asked what the possible relations are, not what the relation is. Let me check if there are other possible relations.

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

These conditions exactly correspond to the relation x NW z.

Could there be other possible relations? Let's check.

x B z (x is in the bounding box of z):
- Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x B z is not possible.

x S z (x is south of z):
- Requires: infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- But we know supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x S z is not possible.

x SW z (x is southwest of z):
- Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

x W z (x is west of z):
- Requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied) and infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we know supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x W z is not possible.

I've checked all the other relations as above, and found contradictions for each. The only relationship without contradictions is x NW z.

So, in the context of this problem, if x is NW of y and y is NW of z, then the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Let me check once more: if x NW y and y NW z, then x [?] z.

The answer is: x NW z.

Actually, let me be extremely methodical and check every possible relation one by one:

1. x B z (x is in the bounding box of z):
   - Requires: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - But if supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - This contradicts the requirement that infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So x B z is not possible.

2. x S z (x is south of z):
   - Requires: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - But if supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - From supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we get infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, infy(z) ≤ infy(x). If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then supy(x) ≤ infy(x), which is a contradiction for a valid region.
   So x S z is not possible.

3. x SW z (x is southwest of z):
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - But from supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - So, infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x). If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then supy(x) ≤ infy(x), which is a contradiction.
   So x SW z is not possible.

4. x W z (x is west of z):
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - But from supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - This contradicts the requirement that infy(z) ≤ infy(x), since infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   So x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z (x is northwest of z):
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied)
   - Both conditions are met, so x NW z is possible.

6. x N z (x is north of z):
   - Requires: supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - But from supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - This contradicts the requirement that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   So x N z is not possible.

7. x NE z (x is northeast of z):
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied)
   - But from supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - This implies infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z).
   - So, infx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts the requirement that supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z (x is east of z):
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - Like the NE case, the requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is contradicted.
   So x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z (x is southeast of z):
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The requirement supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is contradicted as in the NE and E cases.
   So x SE z is not possible.

After examining all nine possible relations, the only consistent possibility is x NW z.

Let me double-check once more:

If x NW y, then:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

If y NW z, then:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

From these, I can derive:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (using the property infx(y) <= supx(y)), which gives supx(x) <= infx(z). This means x is to the west of z.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x) (using the property infy(y) <= supy(y)), which gives supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is to the north of z.

Since x is both to the west of z and to the north of z, the relation between x and z is definitely NW.

So, to answer the original question: If region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y (x NW y)
- Region y is NW of region z (y NW z)

From the definition of the NW relation:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, I can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which gives supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which gives supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These two derived inequalities (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) precisely define the relation x NW z.

Therefore, if region x is NW of region y and region y is NW of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.
