PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This question is about transitive reasoning with cardinal directions. Let's carefully analyze the constraints.

We're told:
- Region x is SE of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definition of SE:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So, we have:
- x SE y means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z.

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) < infx(x), which means supx(z) < infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) < infy(z), which means supy(x) < infy(z)

These two combined conditions (supx(z) < infx(x) and supy(x) < infy(z)) imply that x is in the SE direction from z.

Therefore, x SE z is one possible relation.

Let me verify this reasoning by thinking about the spatial configuration:

If y is to the southeast of z, and x is to the southeast of y, then x must be to the southeast of z. 

This seems to be the only possible relation given the constraints. The SE relation is transitive in this case.

Let me double-check by considering the definitions more carefully.

From x SE y:
- x is to the east of y (supx(y) <= infx(x))
- x is to the south of y (supy(x) <= infy(y))

From y SE z:
- y is to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(y))
- y is to the south of z (supy(y) <= infy(z))

Combining:
- x is to the east of z (by transitivity of the east relation: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x))
- x is to the south of z (by transitivity of the south relation: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z))

So x is to the southeast of z, confirming our earlier conclusion: x SE z.

Let's double-check that I haven't missed any possible relations. Given the strict inequalities derived from the transitive properties, and the definitions of the cardinal directions, SE is the only possible relation between x and z.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is SE.

Hmm, actually, let me be more careful here. I need to consider the possibility that x could satisfy multiple directional relations with respect to z, depending on the exact positions.

Let's reconsider. From our derivation, we know:
- supx(z) < infx(x) (which means x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) < infy(z) (which means x is to the south of z)

These constraints satisfy the definition of SE:
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

So x SE z is definitely a possible relation.

But could there be other relations? Let's analyze the definitions of the other cardinal directions and see if any of them are compatible with our derived constraints:

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we have)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (not guaranteed by our constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (not guaranteed by our constraints)

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we have)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (not guaranteed by our constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (not guaranteed by our constraints)

For x B z (bounding box), we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (not guaranteed by our constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (not guaranteed by our constraints)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (not guaranteed by our constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (not guaranteed by our constraints)

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (this contradicts our constraint supy(x) < infy(z))

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we have)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (this contradicts our constraint supy(x) < infy(z))

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (this contradicts our constraint supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (this contradicts our constraint supy(x) < infy(z))

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (this contradicts our constraint supx(z) < infx(x))

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (this contradicts our constraint supx(z) < infx(x))
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we have)

After analyzing all cardinal directions, it appears that SE is the only relation that is consistent with the derived constraints. 

However, I need to be careful about the transitive relation. Let me reconsider the problem from scratch.

Actually, wait, I realize I made an error. The transitive relation is not as straightforward as I assumed. Let me be more precise.

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)

So we can definitively say:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

These combined conditions are precisely the definition of SE. Thus, x SE z is a possible relation.

But I need to be careful here: these are inequalities, not strict inequalities. This means there can be edge cases.

For instance, x could be E of z if:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (which we established)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (possible, not ruled out by our constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (possible, not ruled out by our constraints)

Similarly, x could be S of z if:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we established)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (possible, not ruled out by our constraints)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (possible, not ruled out by our constraints)

So, both E and S are also potential relations between x and z.

But this seems to contradict the "only" SE relation I derived earlier, so let me think about this more systematically.

Actually, I think I've been misunderstanding the problem. When we say "region x is SE of region y," it means the entire region x is in the SE direction from region y, satisfying the conditions for SE. But it doesn't necessarily mean that x can't also partly be in other directions from y.

Hmm, but that's not quite right either. In cardinal direction relations as defined, a region can only be in one direction from another. So, if region x is SE of region y, then x satisfies the conditions for SE and none of the other cardinal directions.

Let's go back to the definitions and be more precise.

From the definition, x SE y means:
- x lies completely in the SE quarter plane from y's bounding box.
- Specifically, x is further east than the eastern edge of y's bounding box, and further south than the southern edge of y's bounding box.

Similarly, y SE z means:
- y lies completely in the SE quarter plane from z's bounding box.
- Specifically, y is further east than the eastern edge of z's bounding box, and further south than the southern edge of z's bounding box.

If we represent this on a grid, z would be in the northwest, y would be in the southeast of z, and x would be in the southeast of y. Given such a setup, x would indeed be in the SE of z. SE seems to be the only possible relation.

Actually, wait, I think I might have been overthinking this. Let's simplify and consider a concrete example.

Imagine z is at the origin (0, 0). Now, y is SE of z, so it could be at position (1, -1). And x is SE of y, so it could be at position (2, -2).

In this concrete setup, x is clearly SE of z.

But could x and z have other relations? Let's consider.

If y is at the position (1, -1), then the bounding box of y could extend from (1, -1) to (1+a, -1+b) for some positive a, b. Similarly, if x is SE of y, then x could start from a position (1+a+c, -1-d) for some positive c, d, and extend to (1+a+c+e, -1-d+f) for some positive e, f.

The bounding box of z could extend from (0, 0) to (g, h) for some positive g, h.

Now, let's check if x could be S of z:
- For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
  - infy(z) = 0, supy(x) = -1-d+f
  - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we need -1-d+f <= 0
  - This is possible if f <= 1+d
- We also need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
  - infx(z) = 0, infx(x) = 1+a+c
  - supx(z) = g, supx(x) = 1+a+c+e
  - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we need 0 <= 1+a+c, which is always true.
  - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we need 1+a+c+e <= g.
  - This is possible if g is large enough relative to 1+a+c+e.

So, x could be S of z if z's bounding box extends far enough to the east (large g) and if the vertical displacement of x isn't too much to the south.

Similarly, x could be E of z if the bounding box of z extends far enough to the south and if the horizontal displacement of x isn't too much to the east.

x could also be B (inside the bounding box) of z if the bounding box of z is large enough to contain x.

It seems like x SE z is just one of a few possibilities, and the actual relation depends on the specifics of the regions.

Actually, I've been assuming these regions can have arbitrary shapes, but the problem explicitly says regions in REG are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries. Let's be more precise about the constraints.

Let's approach this by thinking about the bounding boxes of the regions.

If y is SE of z, then the bounding box of y lies entirely in the SE quarter plane from the bounding box of z.

If x is SE of y, then the bounding box of x lies entirely in the SE quarter plane from the bounding box of y.

By transitivity, the bounding box of x must lie in the SE quarter plane from the bounding box of z.

So, x SE z is a possible relation.

But could there be others? let us think explicitly. Depending on the distances each region moves in the SE direction, and the dimensions of each region's bounding box, it might be possible for the bounding box of x to overlap with some other quarter planes from the bounding box of z.

For x to be E of z, it would need to lie entirely in the E half-plane from the bounding box of z. Given the mentioned constraints, this could be possible if the spatial displacement of x in the southern direction (compared to z) is minimal, and its bounding box extends upward to overlap with the E half-plane of z.

Similarly, for x to be S of z, it would need to lie entirely in the S half-plane from the bounding box of z. This could be possible if the spatial displacement of x in the eastern direction (compared to z) is minimal, and its bounding box extends to the west to overlap with the S half-plane of z.

But let's be very precise, and use the definitions.

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is entirely to the south of y)

From y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is entirely to the south of z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (transitivity)
  - So, supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z) (transitivity)
  - So, supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely to the south of z)

These combined conditions mean x is SE of z, which confirms our intuition.

I don't think we can have any other relations here:

If x was S of z, then we'd need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely to the south of z) - We have this.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z) - We don't know if this holds.
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left of the right boundary of z) - We don't know if this holds.

Given the constraints, it's possible but not guaranteed.

If x was E of z, then we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of z) - We have this.
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom boundary of x is above the bottom boundary of z) - We don't know if this holds.
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top boundary of x is below the top boundary of z) - We don't know if this holds.

Again, given the constraints, it's possible but not guaranteed.

So it seems like SE, S, and E are possible relations.

Actually, let me further consider if B could be possible:

For x to be B of z, we'd need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left of the right boundary of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom boundary of x is above the bottom boundary of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top boundary of x is below the top boundary of z)

Given the constraints, we know supx(z) <= infx(x) (from transitivity). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z) for x to be B of z. So, x cannot be B of z.

Let's continue checking other relations:

For x to be N of z, we'd need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z) (from transitivity). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be N of z. So, x cannot be N of z.

For x to be W of z, we'd need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know supx(z) <= infx(x) (from transitivity). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z) for x to be W of z. So, x cannot be W of z.

Similar contradictions can be found for NW, NE, and SW.

So, after checking all possible cardinal directions, it seems that the possible relations between region x and region z are SE, S, and E.

Wait, let me more carefully consider the case of S. For x to be S of z, we'd need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely to the south of z) - We have this from transitivity.
- infx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right of the left boundary of z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (the right boundary of x is to the left of the right boundary of z)

But we also know from transitivity: supx(z) <= infx(x) (the left boundary of x is to the right of the right boundary of z).

This means infx(x) is to the right of supx(z). But if supx(x) <= supx(z), then supx(x) is to the left of supx(z). This would mean infx(x) is to the right of supx(x), which is a contradiction because for a region, the left boundary is to the left of the right boundary.

So, x cannot be S of z.

Similarly, for x to be E of z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of z) - We have this from transitivity.
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (the bottom boundary of x is above the bottom boundary of z)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (the top boundary of x is below the top boundary of z)

But we also know from transitivity: supy(x) <= infy(z) (the top boundary of x is below the bottom boundary of z).

This means supy(x) is below infy(z). But if infy(x) >= infy(z), then infy(x) is above or at the same level as infy(z). This would mean supy(x) is below infy(x), which is a contradiction because for a region, the bottom boundary is below the top boundary.

So, x cannot be E of z.

It seems like the only possible relation is SE after all!

Actually, let me go back to the definitions. I believe I've been making an error in interpreting "below" and "above" in these constraints.

Let's restate the cardinal direction definitions in terms of coordinates. Assuming the origin is at the bottom-left:

a B b if and only if
  infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) and
  infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

a S b if and only if
  supy(a) <= infy(b) and
  infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

a SW b if and only if
  supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

a W b if and only if
  supx(a) <= infx(b) and
  infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

a NW b if and only if
  supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

a N b if and only if
  supy(b) <= infy(a) and
  infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

a NE b if and only if
  supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

a E b if and only if
  supx(b) <= infx(a) and
  infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

a SE b if and only if
  supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

OK, the definitions in the prompt above are the same.

Let's revisit our constraints starting from scratch:

From x SE y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z)

These combined conditions match the definition of SE, so x SE z is a possible relation.

Now, I will carefully go through each of the other cardinal directions to check if they could be possible given these constraints.

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know supx(z) <= infx(x) (from our derived constraints), which means infx(x) >= supx(z). But for a valid region z, infx(z) <= supx(z). So, infx(x) >= supx(z) >= infx(z), which means infx(x) >= infx(z). This satisfies the first condition for B.

The second condition for B requires supx(x) <= supx(z). But we don't have any constraint on supx(x) directly from our derived conditions, so we cannot confirm if this holds. It might, in specific setups.

Next condition, infy(z) <= infy(x). But we know supy(x) <= infy(z). For a valid region x, supy(x) >= infy(x). So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which means infy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for B. So, the third condition for B is violated.

Therefore, x cannot be B of z.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We know supy(x) <= infy(z) (from our derived constraints), so the first condition for S is satisfied.

Following the same logic as in the B relation, we can show that infx(x) >= infx(z), so the second condition for S is satisfied.

But for the third condition, supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints.

Wait, let me see if there's a contradiction. We know supx(z) <= infx(x) (from our derived constraints), which means infx(x) >= supx(z). But for a valid region x, infx(x) <= supx(x). So, supx(x) >= infx(x) >= supx(z), which means supx(x) >= supx(z). This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= supx(z) for S.

Therefore, x cannot be S of z.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

We know supx(z) <= infx(x) (from our derived constraints), so the first condition for E is satisfied.

For the second condition, infy(z) <= infy(x), we have a constraint that supy(x) <= infy(z). For a valid region x, infy(x) <= supy(x). So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which means infy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the condition infy(z) <= infy(x) for E.

Therefore, x cannot be E of z.

Using similar logic, I can check the other cardinal directions.

For x N z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) (since for a valid region x, infy(x) <= supy(x), so infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which means infy(x) <= infy(z) and can't have supy(z) <= infy(x) unless supy(z) <= infy(z), which isn't guaranteed for a valid region z).

For x W z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts our derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) (since for a valid region z, infx(z) <= supx(z), so infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x) and can't have supx(x) <= infx(z) unless supx(x) <= infx(x), which isn't guaranteed for a valid region x).

For x NW z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), both of which contradict our derived constraints.

For x NE z, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). While the first condition is satisfied by our derived constraints, the second one isn't.

For x SW z, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). While the second condition is satisfied by our derived constraints, the first one isn't.

It seems that, of all the cardinal directions, only SE is consistent with the constraints derived from the given conditions.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is only SE.

Actually, while I'm mostly convinced that SE is the only possible relation, I think I made an error in my reasoning about some of the cardinal relations. Let me reexamine them:

For x to be S of z:
- We need supy(x) <= infy(z). We have this from our derived constraints.
- We need infx(z) <= infx(x). From our derived constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x). Since infx(z) <= supx(z) for a valid region z, we can conclude infx(z) <= infx(x). So this condition is satisfied.
- We need supx(x) <= supx(z). From our derived constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x). For a valid region x, infx(x) <= supx(x). So we have supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x), which means supx(z) <= supx(x). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= supx(z). So x cannot be S of z.

For x to be E of z:
- We need supx(z) <= infx(x). We have this from our derived constraints.
- We need infy(z) <= infy(x). From our derived constraints, supy(x) <= infy(z). For a valid region x, infy(x) <= supy(x). So we have infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z), which means infy(x) <= infy(z). This contradicts the requirement infy(z) <= infy(x). So x cannot be E of z.

I believe my previous conclusion is correct: given the constraints, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.

So, the answer to the question "If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is SE.

Actually, let me try a slightly different angle, using a more spatial (geometric) way of thinking.

The cardinal direction regions divide the plane into 9 parts: B (Bounding box), N (North), NE (North-East), E (East), SE (South-East), S (South), SW (South-West), W (West), and NW (North-West).

When we say y is SE of z, it means y lies entirely in the SE region of z. Similarly, when we say x is SE of y, it means x lies entirely in the SE region of y.

Now, if we imagine a coordinate system centered on z, then y is in the SE quadrant of z. If we then re-center the coordinate system on y, then x is in the SE quadrant of y.

But from the perspective of z, where is x? x is further to the southeast of y, which is already to the southeast of z. This places x in the SE region of z.

I believe the SE relation is the only one possible in this scenario, and my earlier derivation using the constraints confirms this.

So the answer is: The possible relation between region x and region z is SE (South-East).

Hmmm, wait. I'm still not convinced SE is the only possible relation. I'm going to try a different perspective, by trying to construct a counterexample.

Suppose z is a region at the origin, with bounding box (0, 0) to (1, 1).

If y is SE of z, then it should be in the SE quadrant of z. Let's place y so that its bounding box is from (2, -2) to (3, -1).

Now, x should be SE of y. Let's place x so that its bounding box is from (4, -4) to (5, -3).

In this arrangement:
- z: Bounding box from (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y: Bounding box from (2, -2) to (3, -1)
- x: Bounding box from (4, -4) to (5, -3)

Let's check the conditions for y SE z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2. So, supx(z) < infx(y), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(y) = -1, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(y) < infy(z), satisfying the second condition.
So, y is SE of z.

Let's check the conditions for x SE y:
- supx(y) = 3, infx(x) = 4. So, supx(y) < infx(x), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(x) = -3, infy(y) = -2. So, supy(x) < infy(y), satisfying the second condition.
So, x is SE of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 4. So, supx(z) < infx(x).
- supy(x) = -3, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(x) < infy(z).
These conditions match the definition of SE, so x is SE of z.

Let's try another arrangement to see if we can get a different relation:
- z: Bounding box from (0, 0) to (5, 1)
- y: Bounding box from (6, -2) to (7, -1)
- x: Bounding box from (8, -3) to (9, -2)

In this setup, y is still SE of z, and x is still SE of y. The relation between x and z is still SE. It looks like, the position of x is always going to be in the SE direction from the position of z due to the transitive nature of the SE relation.

I'm convinced that SE is the only possible relation, but I'm being thorough for the sake of completeness.

Let's say we move x closer to the original position of z, horizontally:
- z: Bounding box from (0, 0) to (5, 1)
- y: Bounding box from (6, -2) to (7, -1)
- x: Bounding box from (2, -3) to (3, -2)

In this case, x is moving a bit to the west, but it's still in the SE direction from z. SupX(z) = 5, infx(x) = 2, which satisfies x being to the east of z.

Oh wait, there' a mistake in this last example. Let's recalculate:
- z: Bounding box from (0, 0) to (5, 1)
- y: Bounding box from (6, -2) to (7, -1)
- x: Bounding box from (2, -3) to (3, -2)

Now let's check if y is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 5, infx(y) = 6. So, supx(z) < infx(y), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(y) = -1, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(y) < infy(z), satisfying the second condition.
So, y is SE of z.

Let's check if x is SE of y:
- supx(y) = 7, infx(x) = 2. This doesn't satisfy the condition supx(y) <= infx(x) for SE.

So, this arrangement doesn't satisfy the given condition that x is SE of y.

Ok, so let's stick with the original configuration:
- z: Bounding box from (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y: Bounding box from (2, -2) to (3, -1)
- x: Bounding box from (4, -4) to (5, -3)

I feel convinced that SE is the only possible relation.

Actually, maybe we can also be E or S of z? Let's try one more configuration to see if x can be E of z:
- z: Bounding box from (0, -5) to (1, 1)
- y: Bounding box from (2, -2) to (3, -1)
- x: Bounding box from (4, -0.5) to (5, 0.5)

Let's check if y is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2. So, supx(z) < infx(y), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(y) = -1, infy(z) = -5. This doesn't satisfy the condition supy(y) <= infy(z) for SE.

So, this doesn't work.

Hmm, let's try a different configuration to see if x can be E of z:
- z: Bounding box from (0, -1) to (1, 1)
- y: Bounding box from (2, -2) to (3, -1)
- x: Bounding box from (4, -0.5) to (5, 0.5)

Let's check if y is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2. So, supx(z) < infx(y), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(y) = -1, infy(z) = -1. So, supy(y) <= infy(z), satisfying the second condition.
So, y is SE of z.

Let's check if x is SE of y:
- supx(y) = 3, infx(x) = 4. So, supx(y) < infx(x), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(x) = -0.5, infy(y) = -2. This doesn't satisfy the condition supy(x) <= infy(y) for SE.

So, this arrangement doesn't satisfy the given condition that x is SE of y.

Hmm, I'm having trouble constructing a valid configuration where x is anything but SE of z.

Ok, so based on the constraints and mathematical analysis, it is guaranteed that the configuration x SE z is a possible one.

I do not see any way where x can be in any other cardinal direction relation to z while maintaining the given constraints (x SE y and y SE z) and adhering to the definitions. Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z seems to be SE.

The answer to the question "If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is SE.

But let me now try to construct a different example:
- z: Bounding box from (0, 0) to (1, 1)
- y: Bounding box from (2, -2) to (3, -1)
- x: Bounding box from (4, -4) to (5, -3)

Let's compute if y is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2. So, supx(z) < infx(y), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(y) = -1, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(y) < infy(z), satisfying the second condition.
So, y is SE of z.

Let's check if x is SE of y:
- supx(y) = 3, infx(x) = 4. So, supx(y) < infx(x), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(x) = -3, infy(y) = -2. So, supy(x) < infy(y), satisfying the second condition.
So, x is SE of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 4. So, supx(z) < infx(x), which means x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) = -3, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(x) < infy(z), which means x is to the south of z.
- To check if x is SE of z: We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both are satisfied.
- To check if x is S of z: We need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We know supy(x) < infy(z) and infx(z) < infx(x), but supx(x) = 5 > 1 = supx(z). So, x is not S of z.
- To check if x is E of z: We need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supx(z) < infx(x), but infy(x) = -4 < 0 = infy(z), so the second condition is not satisfied. Also, supy(x) = -3 < 1 = supy(z), so the third condition is satisfied. But since the second condition is not satisfied, x is not E of z.

It seems that, in this specific example, the only relation is SE.

Let's try one more setup to see if x can be E of z:
- z: Bounding box from (0, -10) to (1, 1)
- y: Bounding box from (2, -6) to (3, -5)
- x: Bounding box from (4, -3) to (5, 0)

Let's compute if y is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2. So, supx(z) < infx(y), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(y) = -5, infy(z) = -10. This doesn't satisfy the condition supy(y) <= infy(z) for SE, but I meant that infy(z) = -10 and infy(y) = -6, so the condition supy(y) <= infy(z) translates to -5 <= -10, which is not true.

Actually, let me be very clear about what the notation supy and infy mean. According to the given definition:
- infy(a) is the greatest lower bound of the projection of a on the y-axis. This means it's the bottom-most y-coordinate of the region a.
- supy(a) is the least upper bound of the projection of a on the y-axis. This means it's the top-most y-coordinate of the region a.

So, for the region z with bounding box from (0, -10) to (1, 1), the infimum of the y-projection is -10 and the supremum of the y-projection is 1. So infy(z) = -10 and supy(z) = 1.

And for the region y with bounding box from (2, -6) to (3, -5), the infimum of the y-projection is -6 and the supremum of the y-projection is -5. So infy(y) = -6 and supy(y) = -5.

Double checking:
- z: Bounding box from (0, -10) to (1, 1) => infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = -10, supy(z) = 1
- y: Bounding box from (2, -6) to (3, -5) => infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = -6, supy(y) = -5
- x: Bounding box from (4, -3) to (5, 0) => infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = -3, supy(x) = 0

Let's compute if y is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2. So, supx(z) < infx(y), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(y) = -5, infy(z) = -10. But the condition for SE requires supy(y) <= infy(z), which is -5 <= -10. This is not true.

So y is not SE of z in this setup. It looks like I made a mistake. Let's restate the definition of SE to make sure I understand it correctly:

a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

This means a is to the southeast of b if a is entirely to the east of b and entirely to the south of b. Specifically, the rightmost point of b is to the left of the leftmost point of a, and the topmost point of a is below the bottom-most point of b. (I think I misinterpreted the second condition earlier).

So let's try again:
- z: Bounding box from (0, 0) to (1, 1) => infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1
- y: Bounding box from (2, -2) to (3, -1) => infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = -2, supy(y) = -1
- x: Bounding box from (4, -4) to (5, -3) => infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = -4, supy(x) = -3

Let's compute if y is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 2. So, supx(z) < infx(y), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(y) = -1, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(y) < infy(z), satisfying the second condition.
So, y is SE of z.

Let's check if x is SE of y:
- supx(y) = 3, infx(x) = 4. So, supx(y) < infx(x), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(x) = -3, infy(y) = -2. So, supy(x) < infy(y), satisfying the second condition.
So, x is SE of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 4. So, supx(z) < infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z.
- supy(x) = -3, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(x) < infy(z), which means x is entirely to the south of z.
These conditions match the definition of SE, so x is SE of z.

Let's try one more time with a slightly different setup:
- z: Bounding box from (0, 0) to (10, 1) => infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 10, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1
- y: Bounding box from (11, -2) to (12, -1) => infx(y) = 11, supx(y) = 12, infy(y) = -2, supy(y) = -1
- x: Bounding box from (13, -4) to (15, -3) => infx(x) = 13, supx(x) = 15, infy(x) = -4, supy(x) = -3

Let's compute if y is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 10, infx(y) = 11. So, supx(z) < infx(y), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(y) = -1, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(y) < infy(z), satisfying the second condition.
So, y is SE of z.

Let's check if x is SE of y:
- supx(y) = 12, infx(x) = 13. So, supx(y) < infx(x), satisfying the first condition.
- supy(x) = -3, infy(y) = -2. So, supy(x) < infy(y), satisfying the second condition.
So, x is SE of y.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 13. So, supx(z) < infx(x), which means x is entirely to the east of z.
- supy(x) = -3, infy(z) = 0. So, supy(x) < infy(z), which means x is entirely to the south of z.
These conditions match the definition of SE, so x is SE of z.

I think, based on the constraints and the definitions, SE is the only possible relation between region x and region z.

So, the answer to the question "If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the definition of the cardinal direction relations, I need to analyze what happens when we have "x SE y" and "y SE z".

For "x SE y", we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is entirely to the south of y)

For "y SE z", we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is entirely to the south of z)

By transitivity, we can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is entirely to the south of z)

These two conditions precisely match the definition of SE (South East).

I checked other possible relations (S, E, B, etc.), but each one requires conditions that would contradict our derived constraints.

The answer is: SE
