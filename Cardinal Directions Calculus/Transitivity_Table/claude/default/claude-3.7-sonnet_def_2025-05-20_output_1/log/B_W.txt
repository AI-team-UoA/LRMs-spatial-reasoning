PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step-by-step.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is W of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions:

1. x B y if and only if:
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
   
   This means x is inside the bounding box of y.

2. y W z if and only if:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   
   This means y is to the west of z.

Now, let's use these conditions to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y W z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's combine these to derive constraints on x relative to z.

First, for the x-coordinate:
- From x B y: supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means x is completely to the left of z, which is a characteristic of the W, NW, and SW relations.

Now, for the y-coordinate:
- From x B y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- Therefore, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Actually, let's be more careful here.

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (lower bound of x on x-axis is within y's bounds)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (upper bound of x on x-axis is within y's bounds)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (lower bound of x on y-axis is within y's bounds)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (upper bound of x on y-axis is within y's bounds)

From y W z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y can go as far south as z or more)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y can go as far north as z or less)

Now, let's combine these.

For the x-coordinate:
- From x B y: supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This implies that region x is completely to the west of region z. This is a characteristic of the W, NW, and SW relations.

For the y-coordinate:
- From x B y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's analyze the y-coordinate bounds of x relative to z:

For the lower bound:
- From x B y: infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y W z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- Therefore, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This doesn't give us a strict constraint on infy(x) relative to infy(z); it could be that infy(x) > infy(z) or infy(x) = infy(z).

For the upper bound:
- From x B y: supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- From y W z: supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- Therefore, supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Again, this doesn't give us a strict constraint; it could be that supy(x) < supy(z) or supy(x) = supy(z).

Now, let's consider all possible relations based on these constraints:

1. x W z if and only if:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which might or might not be true)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (which is true from our derivation)

   So, x W z is a possibility if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

2. x NW z if and only if:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which might or might not be true)

   So, x NW z is a possibility if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

3. x SW z if and only if:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which might or might not be true)

   So, x SW z is a possibility if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let's also check if the other cardinal directions are possible:

4. x B z if and only if:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), x cannot be B of z.

5. x N z if and only if:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which might or might not be true)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), x cannot be N of z.

6. x S z if and only if:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which might or might not be true)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), x cannot be S of z.

7. x E z if and only if:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), x cannot be E of z.

8. x NE z if and only if:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), x cannot be NE of z.

9. x SE z if and only if:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z))
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

   Since supx(x) ≤ infx(z), x cannot be SE of z.

Based on the constraints we've derived, the possible relations between x and z are:
- W (west)
- NW (north-west)
- SW (south-west)

Let's double-check this.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From the first two, we get:
supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which confirms that x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- From infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), we get infy(z) ≤ infy(x). This doesn't preclude x from being W of z.
- From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Again, this doesn't preclude x from being W of z.

Let's see if x can be NW of z. For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our constraints, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), but we don't have any direct constraint on supy(z) relative to infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), in which case x would be NW of z.

Let's see if x can be SW of z. For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

From our constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), but we don't have any direct constraint on supy(x) relative to infy(z). It's possible that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), in which case x would be SW of z.

Wait, let me draw this out to make it clearer.

For region y to be W of region z, y lies to the left of z, vertically within the bounds of z.
For region x to be B of region y, x is bounded by y, so x is inside of y.

If x is inside of y, and y is to the left of z, then x is also to the left of z. Since x is inside y, and y is vertically within the bounds of z, x can be vertically within the bounds of z, above z, or below z.

1. If x is to the left of z and vertically within the bounds of z, then x is W of z.
2. If x is to the left of z and above z, then x is NW of z.
3. If x is to the left of z and below z, then x is SW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Actually, with the given constraints, x need not be entirely "inside" y in the sense of being a subset of y; it's just that x is within the bounding box of y. So, my reasoning above still stands, but I want to clarify that x being "B of y" doesn't mean x is a subset of y, but rather that x is within the minimum bounding box of y.

Given the constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- W (west)
- NW (north-west)
- SW (south-west)

Actually, I want to be extra certain about this. Let's focus on the x-coordinate first.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (lower bound of x on x-axis is within or at the boundary of y's bounds)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (upper bound of x on x-axis is within or at the boundary of y's bounds)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Which confirms that x is entirely to the west of z.

Now, let's focus on the y-coordinate.

From x B y:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (lower bound of x on y-axis is within or at the boundary of y's bounds)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (upper bound of x on y-axis is within or at the boundary of y's bounds)

From y W z:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y can go as far south as z or more)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y can go as far north as z or less)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These constraints don't restrict x to a specific relation with z in the y-direction.

Let's enumerate the possibilities:

1. W relation (x W z):
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is satisfied)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which is satisfied from our derivation)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (which is satisfied from our derivation)

   So, W is a possible relation.

2. NW relation (x NW z):
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is satisfied)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (we need to check this)

   From our constraints, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), but we don't have a direct constraint on supy(z) relative to infy(x). For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Given the constraints, this is not necessarily true, but it's possible (e.g., if supy(z) is small enough relative to infy(x)).

3. SW relation (x SW z):
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is satisfied)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (we need to check this)

   From our constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), but we don't have a direct constraint on supy(x) relative to infy(z). For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Given the constraints, this is not necessarily true, but it's possible (e.g., if supy(x) is small enough relative to infy(z)).


Wait, I missed a detail.

For the NW relation, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is satisfied)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (we need to check this)

From our constraints, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), but we also know supy(y) ≤ supy(z). For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But since y is W of z and x is B of y, it's possible for infy(x) to be higher than supy(z), making x NW of z.

For the SW relation, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which is satisfied)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (we need to check this)

From our constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), but we also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y). For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But since y is W of z and x is B of y, it's possible for supy(x) to be lower than infy(z), making x SW of z.

Given these possibilities, the cardinal direction relations between x and z can be:
- W (west)
- NW (north-west)
- SW (south-west)

Let me think through this once more. we know x is B to y and y is W to z.

To be B to y, region x is inside the bounding box of region y. The bounding box of region y stretches from infx(y) to supx(y) on the x-axis and from infy(y) to supy(y) on the y-axis.

To be W to z, region y is to the west of region z. The rightmost point of y (supx(y)) is to the left of the leftmost point of z (infx(z)). Additionally, y is vertically within the bounds of z, meaning infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Given these conditions:

For region x to be B to region y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For region y to be W to region z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these:

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

This ensures that region x is to the west of region z.

For the y-coordinate:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These constraints allow for several relationships between x and z in the y-direction.

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

1. W relation (x W z):
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (satisfied)
   - supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (satisfied)

2. NW relation (x NW z):
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (not guaranteed by our constraints but can be true in specific configurations)

3. SW relation (x SW z):
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (not guaranteed by our constraints but can be true in specific configurations)

Wait, let me review the constraints for the NW and SW relations one more time.

For NW, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). From our constraints, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), but we don't have a direct constraint on supy(z) relative to infy(x). Since infy(x) can be anywhere from infy(y) to supy(y), and z's y-bounds can be from infy(z) to supy(z), it's possible for supy(z) to be less than infy(x), making NW a possible relation.

For SW, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). From our constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), but we don't have a direct constraint on supy(x) relative to infy(z). Since supy(x) can be anywhere from infy(y) to supy(y), and z's y-bounds can be from infy(z) to supy(z), it's possible for supy(x) to be less than infy(z), making SW a possible relation.

Given these considerations, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- W (west)
- NW (north-west)
- SW (south-west)

Are there any other possiblities? I don't think so, because we've shown that x is entirely to the west of z. Given the way cardinal directions are defined in the problem, this means x can only be W, NW, or SW of z.

Therefore, the final answer is: The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is W of region z

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints, I can determine:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  This means x is completely to the west of z

- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Based on these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

W, NW, SW
