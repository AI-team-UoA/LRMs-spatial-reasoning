PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step. We have:
- x is N of y
- y is W of z

And we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's use the definitions provided:

When x is N of y, we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-coordinate projection is within y's x-coordinate projection)

When y is W of z, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-coordinate projection is within z's y-coordinate projection)

Now, let's think about the possible relations between x and z:

For the y-coordinates:
- We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above y.
- We also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means y's y-projection is within z's y-projection.

From these, we can infer:
- Since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), it's possible that infy(x) ≤ supy(z) or supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- If infy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x and z could potentially overlap in terms of y-coordinates.
- If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x would be completely above z, which would suggest a N relation.

For the x-coordinates:
- We know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y), which means x's x-projection is within y's x-projection.
- We also know supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means y is completely to the left of z.

From these, we can infer:
- Since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely to the left of z.

Given the constraints on both x and y coordinates, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. NW: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (meaning x is completely above z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (meaning x is completely to the left of z). This is a definite possibility given our constraints.

2. W: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (meaning x's y-projection is within z's y-projection) and supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (meaning x is completely to the left of z). This is a possible relation if x's y-projection happens to be within z's y-projection.

But wait, let me double-check this. We had concluded that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. Given that, the possible relations between x and z, based on the y-coordinate, are:

- NW: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)
- W: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-projection is within z's y-projection)
- SW: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

But wait, we need to consider other information. We know that x is N of y, which means x is above y. And y is W of z, which means y's y-projection is within z's y-projection. Given that x is above y and y's y-projection is within z's y-projection, it's likely that x is above z or at least partially overlapping with z in terms of y-coordinates.

Let's think about this differently.

From x is N of y, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

From y is W of z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)

Combining these:
- We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
- If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is completely above z (suggesting a N relation).
- If infy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x and z might overlap in terms of y-coordinates or x might be completely below z.

Let's also consider the relations in terms of x-coordinates:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z).

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely to the left of z.

Now, let's figure out the possible relations between x and z based on both x and y coordinates:

1. If x is completely to the left of z (which we've established) and x is completely above z (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), then the relation is NW.

2. If x is completely to the left of z and x's y-projection is within z's y-projection (i.e., infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), then the relation is W.

3. If x is completely to the left of z and x is completely below z (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), then the relation is SW.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, or SW.

But there's a constraint that I think I missed: from x is N of y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x). And from y is W of z, we have supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This means supy(y) ≤ min(infy(x), supy(z)).

If infy(x) ≤ supy(z), we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z). This doesn't provide any clear constraint on the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z), so x could be above, below, or overlapping with z in terms of y-coordinates.

If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we have supy(y) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means x is completely above z, suggesting a NW relation.

Let's also consider the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z):
- From x is N of y, we don't have a direct relation between infy(x) and infy(y).
- From y is W of z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

So, we don't have a direct constraint on infy(x) versus infy(z). It's possible that infy(x) ≤ infy(z) or infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Similarly, for supy(x) versus supy(z), we don't have a direct constraint. It's possible that supy(x) ≤ supy(z) or supy(z) ≤ supy(x).

Let me go through different cases:

Case 1: x is completely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- Given that x is to the left of z, the relation would be NW.

Case 2: z is completely above x (supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
- Given that x is to the left of z, the relation would be SW.

Case 3: x and z overlap in terms of y-coordinates (infy(z) ≤ supy(x) and infy(x) ≤ supy(z))
- Given that x is to the left of z, the relation would be W.

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW, W, or SW, depending on their y-coordinate relationship.

But wait, I'm realizing that I might be missing another important constraint. We know that y is W of z, which means y's y-projection is within z's y-projection. And x is N of y, which means x is completely above y. So, in terms of y-coordinates, the layout would be:
- x is above
- y and z are below, with y's y-projection within z's y-projection.

Given this, it's unlikely that x is completely below z, which would contradict the idea that x is above y and y's y-projection is within z's y-projection. So, the SW relation might not be a valid possibility.

Actually, let me revisit this more precisely.

From x is N of y, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

From y is W of z, we know:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y).
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

This means:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

From this, we can infer:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

This suggests that both y and z are below x. But it doesn't provide a direct constraint on supy(z) versus infy(x). It's possible that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would mean x is completely above z. But it's also possible that infy(x) ≤ supy(z), which would mean x and z overlap in terms of y-coordinates.

Given the constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), it's unlikely that x is completely below z, which would suggest a SW relation. But it's still possible that infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which would suggest a W relation. And it's also possible that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would suggest a NW relation.

So, based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

But wait, I missed a possibility. It's also possible that infy(x) ≤ supy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z), which would mean x extends above z. Given that x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), this relation would be a mix of N and W, which in the context of the given cardinal direction relations would be NW.

Thinking one more time:

From x is N of y, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

From y is W of z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)

From these, we can infer:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). This means x is also completely to the left of z.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x). This means both points z and y have a y-coordinate that is below that of any point in x.

So, the relation between x and z:
- In terms of x-coordinates: x is completely to the left of z.
- In terms of y-coordinates: z's y-coordinate is below that of any point in x.

Given these constraints, the possible relation between x and z is NW.

But wait, the constraint "z's y-coordinate is below that of any point in x" might be too strong. What we know is:
- From y is W of z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y). This means z's minimum y-coordinate is less than or equal to y's minimum y-coordinate.
- From x is N of y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x). This means y's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate.

Combining these, we get infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x). This doesn't ensure that every point in z has a y-coordinate that is below that of any point in x. It only ensures that the minimum y-coordinate of z is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate.

So, the constraint should be:
- In terms of y-coordinates: z's minimum y-coordinate is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate.

Given this, the possible relations between x and z, given that x is to the left of z, are:
1. NW: If z's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).
2. W: If x's y-projection is within z's y-projection (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).
3. SW: If x's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to z's minimum y-coordinate (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

But given the constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), option 3 (SW) is not possible because it would contradict the constraint supy(y) ≤ infy(x).

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

Actually, I've been making an error in my reasoning. From infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), I said that z's minimum y-coordinate is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate. But that's not right. The correct statement is:
- z's minimum y-coordinate is less than or equal to y's minimum y-coordinate, which is less than or equal to y's maximum y-coordinate, which is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate. This means z's minimum y-coordinate is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate.

From here, we can't directly infer the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) or supy(x).

From supy(y) ≤ supy(z), we know:
- y's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to z's maximum y-coordinate.

From supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we know:
- y's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate.

Combining these, we get supy(y) ≤ min(supy(z), infy(x)). This doesn't provide a direct constraint on the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). They could be in either order. So, it's possible that:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would mean z is completely below x.
- infy(x) ≤ supy(z), which would mean z and x overlap in terms of y-coordinates.

Given that x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), the possible relations between x and z are:
1. NW: If z is completely below x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).
2. W: If z and x overlap in terms of y-coordinates (infy(x) ≤ supy(z)).

So, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

But wait, there's another possibility I missed. If infy(x) ≤ supy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z), then part of x is above z. But if x also extends below z (infy(x) < infy(z)), then x and z have a more complex relationship in terms of y-coordinates. Let's re-examine the constraints:

From x is N of y, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

From y is W of z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)

Additionally, since we're dealing with regions in REG, they are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries. So let's think about the possible layouts.

First, z mus be to the right of y, so where can x be? x is above y, and x's x-projection is within y's x-projection, which is to the left of z's x-projection.

So x must have all x coordinates less than or equal to y's maximum x, which in turn is less than z's minimum x. So all of x must be to the left of z: x is horizontally separated from z. So in terms of the horizontal, we have either x W z.

Now, let's see about the vertical relationship. We know:
- x is N of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y is W of z (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

So the vertical constraints we have are:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From the first two, we can infer infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x). This means x's minimum y-coordinate is greater than or equal to y's maximum y-coordinate, which is greater than or equal to y's minimum y-coordinate, which is greater than or equal to z's minimum y-coordinate. But this doesn't directly give us the relationship between x's y-coordinates and z's maximum y-coordinate. Specifically, we don't know if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) or infy(x) ≤ supy(z).

If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is completely above z, which would suggest a NW relation.

If infy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x and z overlap in terms of y-coordinates. Given that x is to the left of z, this would suggest a W relation.

Is it also possible that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would mean x is completely below z? Let's check if this is consistent with our constraints.

supy(x) ≤ infy(z) would imply infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which is a contradiction (infy(x) ≤ ... ≤ infy(x) would imply infy(x) = infy(z) = infy(y) = supy(y) = infy(x), which is not generally true for distinct regions). So, the SW relation is not possible.

Actually, the contradiction specifically arises from infy(x) ≤ ... ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which is only valid if supy(y) = infy(x). But we're talking about regions, not just points, so typically we have infy(x) < supy(x). The constraint supy(y) ≤ infy(x) means y is completely below x. If we had supy(x) ≤ infy(z), it would mean x is completely below z, which would contradict the constraint supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (since y's y-projection is within z's y-projection, and if x is completely below z, it would also be below y).

So, based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

Actually, I need to verify this, particularly the claim that W means "x and z overlap in terms of y-coordinates".

From the definitions provided:

a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

This means:
- a is completely to the left of b (supx(a) ≤ infx(b)).
- a's y-projection is within b's y-projection (infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)).

So, for x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established).
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which is consistent with our constraints).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (which we don't know for sure).

Let's verify the other possibility:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).

This means:
- a is completely to the left of b (supx(a) ≤ infx(b)).
- a is completely above b (supy(b) ≤ infy(a)).

So, for x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established).
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which is possible but not guaranteed).

So, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. NW: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above z).
2. W: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-projection is within z's y-projection).

Now, there's one more possibility: what if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x)? In this case, x's y-projection overlaps with z's y-projection, but x extends above z. This doesn't fit cleanly into either the NW or W relation as defined.

But actually, I misread the definition of the cardinal directions. Reading the definition again:

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where...

For "a W b", we need supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b). 

So in our case, for "x W z", we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z).
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's bottom is below or at the same height as x's bottom).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top is below or at the same height as z's top).

The second and third conditions ensure that x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection. This is the definition of the W cardinal direction relation.

For "x NW z", we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z).
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z's top is below or at the same height as x's bottom).

The second condition ensures that x is completely above z. This is the definition of the NW cardinal direction relation.

I'm not convinced yet that these definitions preclude a "mixed" relationship where infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x). But let me think about this again.

Actually no, let's go through them one by one:

For "a NW b", we need:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is completely to the left of b).
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is completely above b).

For "a W b", we need:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is completely to the left of b).
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a) (b's bottom is below or at the same height as a's bottom).
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b) (a's top is below or at the same height as b's top).

For "a SW b", we need:
- supx(a) ≤ infx(b) (a is completely to the left of b).
- supy(a) ≤ infy(b) (a is completely below b).

For "a N b", we need:
- supy(b) ≤ infy(a) (a is completely above b).
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (a's x-projection is within b's x-projection).

For "a B b", we need:
- infx(b) ≤ infx(a) (b's left is to the left of or at the same position as a's left).
- supx(a) ≤ supx(b) (a's right is to the left of or at the same position as b's right).
- infy(b) ≤ infy(a) (b's bottom is below or at the same height as a's bottom).
- supy(a) ≤ supy(b) (a's top is below or at the same height as b's top).

Ok so I think the point is that "W" is a very specific relation in which the y-projection of the first region is contained within the y-projection of the second region. And "NW" is a very specific relation in which the first region is completely above the second region.

What if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x)? This would mean:
- x extends above z.
- x overlaps with z in terms of y-coordinates.
- x is to the left of z (which we've established).

I need to check the definitions again.

a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b),

This does not match our case where infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x), for we would have supy(a) > supy(b).

Let's try N: 

a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

This doesn't match either, since we've established that x is completely to the left of z, but the N relation requires x's x-projection to be within z's x-projection.

Let's try NW:

a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).

This doesn't match either, since we have supy(z) > infy(x).

It seems like the case infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x) doesn't fit into any of the single-tile cardinal direction relations provided. This could be a case where we need a combined relation.

Let's check if it could be N:W or NW:W.

Wait, am I overthinking things? I know that x is to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)). And the possible vertical relationships are:
1. x is completely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), which corresponds to NW.
2. x's y-projection is within z's y-projection (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), which corresponds to W.
3. x's y-projection partially overlaps with z's y-projection (as in the case infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ supy(x)).

For case 3, since x is to the left of z, and the vertical relationship is that x overlaps with z but also extends above it, this would be a combination of the N direction (for the part of x that is above z) and the W direction (for the part of x that is at the same height as z). The cardinal direction relations that span across multiple tiles are denoted as R1: ... : Rk, where R1, ..., Rk are single-tile cardinal directions. So, for case 3, the relation would be N:W.

Actually, let me reread the problem statement more carefully. I think there's a constraint about cardinal direction relations spaning across tiles:
"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

So we can have multi-tile cardinal direction relations, but the regions corresponding to each tile must belong to REG. The regions in REG are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries. For case 3, we'd have a part of x in the N position of z and another part in the W position. If the union of these parts is a connected region, then N:W is a valid relation.

Actually, we may be overthinking this. The "cardinal direction relation" defined in the problem statement:
"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

Let's think about this differently. Let's define the regions that are in the NW, W, and N positions relative to z:
- The region in the NW position of z is the set of all points (x', y') such that x' < infx(z) and y' > supy(z).
- The region in the W position of z is the set of all points (x', y') such that x' < infx(z) and infy(z) <= y' <= supy(z).
- The region in the N position of z is the set of all points (x', y') such that infx(z) <= x' <= supx(z) and y' > supy(z).

For case 3, the region x intersects with both the NW and W regions. If the intersection of x with the NW region and the intersection of x with the W region are both non-empty and their union is a connected region, then the cardinal direction relation of x with respect to z would be NW:W.

But let's go back to the basic question: if the region x is N of the region y and the region y is W of the region z, what are the possible cardinal direction relations of x with respect to z?

From the given:
- x is N of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)).
- y is W of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

The constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). This ensures that x is completely to the left of z.
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This doesn't provide a direct constraint on the relationship between infy(x) or supy(x) with infy(z) or supy(z).

So, x is definitely to the left of z. In terms of vertical positioning, there are two main cases:
1. x is completely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), which corresponds to the NW cardinal direction.
2. x's y-projection overlaps with z's y-projection, and based on how they overlap, the relation could be W, NW:W, or potentially other combinations involving the W direction.

For case 2, I need to further analyze the specific overlapping conditions.

Let's see the W cardinal direction again:
a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (satisfied).
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

This would be the case where x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection. 

Let's re-examine the constraints from the given conditions to see if W is a possible relation.

From the given information, we don't have direct constraints on the values of infy(x), supy(x), or supy(z). But we do have the constraint supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

So, the constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) doesn't preclude the possibility of infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (which is one of the conditions for x W z). And the constraints don't preclude the possibility of supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (which is another condition for x W z).

So, x W z is a possible relation if the specific values of infy(x), supy(x), and supy(z) satisfy the constraints.

Is it possible that infy(x) < infy(z)? To answer this, I'll need to determine if infy(x) < infy(z) is consistent with the known constraints. From the given, we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x). 
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

These constraints don't provide a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that infy(x) < infy(z), infy(x) = infy(z), or infy(x) > infy(z). So infy(x) < infy(z) is a possibility.

Let's move on to the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z). From the given, we have:
- The constraint supy(y) ≤ supy(z) doesn't provide a direct comparison between supy(x) and supy(z). It's possible that supy(x) < supy(z), supy(x) = supy(z), or supy(x) > supy(z).

So, based on these constraints, various configurations of the y-projections of x and z are possible, leading to different cardinal direction relations.

Let's enumerate the possible configurations:

1. supy(z) ≤ infy(x). In this case, x is completely above z (NW relation).

2. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). In this case, x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection (W relation).

3. infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). In this case, x extends below z but is still capped by z. I need to determine which cardinal direction relation this corresponds to. Given that x is to the left of z, the region x would occupy both the SW and W positions. The relation would be SW:W.

4. infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) < supy(x). In this case, x is partially above z but also overlaps with z. The relation would be NW:W.

5. infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(z) < supy(x). In this case, x extends both below and above z. The relation would be SW:W:NW.

Actually, I think I've been making a mistake in interpreting the constraints. Let's use the definitions of the cardinal relations directly and see what relations are possible.

1. NW: Region x is NW of region z if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning x is completely to the left of z and completely above z.

2. W: Region x is W of region z if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), meaning x is completely to the left of z and x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection.

3. SW: Region x is SW of region z if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is completely to the left of z and completely below z.

4. N: Region x is N of region z if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), meaning x is completely above z and x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. (This is not valid for our case since we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ supx(x).)

5. B: Region x is B of region z if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), meaning x is completely contained within the bounding box of z. (This is not valid for our case since we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).)

6. S: Region x is S of region z if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), meaning x is completely below z and x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. (This is not valid for our case since we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).)

7. NE: Region x is NE of region z if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning x is completely to the right of z and completely above z. (This is not valid for our case since we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).)

8. E: Region x is E of region z if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), meaning x is completely to the right of z and x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection. (This is not valid for our case since we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).)

9. SE: Region x is SE of region z if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is completely to the right of z and completely below z. (This is not valid for our case since we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x).)

Given that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z), the only valid single-tile cardinal direction relations are NW, W, and SW.

Now, from what can be inferred from "the region x is N of the region y" and "the region y is W of the region z", we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above y).
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection).

Combining these, we get:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we can determine that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). This satisfies one of the conditions for x W z. But we don't have a constraint on the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z), so we can't determine if the second condition for W (supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) is satisfied.

Similarly, from infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we can determine that infy(z) is less than or equal to infy(x). This means that we cannot have supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (which is the condition for SW). So, SW is not a possible relation.

For NW, the condition is supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We know that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If supy(z) = supy(y), then supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is satisfied. But if supy(z) > supy(y), then we don't have a direct constraint to determine if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Given these constraints, the possible relations are NW (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) and W (if supy(x) ≤ supy(z)). And based on the given definitions, if neither of these single-tile relations is satisfied, then it would be a combined relation such as NW:W.

Wait, I just realized the definition of the "cardinal direction relation" is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where R1, ..., Rk are single-tile cardinal directions. But this doesn't mean the response to the problem necessarily needs to be a combined relation. We can also express the possible single-tile relations, and in this case they would be NW and W.

Based on the conditions given in the problem, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW and W.

Actually, as a sanity check, let me double-check that x N y and y W z can lead to both x NW z and x W z, by giving a concrete example:

First, let's establish a concrete example where x is N of y and y is W of z.
Let's define y as the rectangle with corners (0, 0) and (1, 1).
Let z be the rectangle with corners (3, -1) and (4, 2).
With these definitions, y is W of z because supx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 3 and infy(z) = -1 ≤ infy(y) = 0 and supy(y) = 1 ≤ supy(z) = 2.

For x to be N of y, we need supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(x) ≥ 1, and we also need infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y). Since infx(y) = 0 and supx(y) = 1, we need 0 ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ 1.

Here are two examples of regions x:
1. Let x be the rectangle with corners (0, 3) and (1, 4). In this case, supx(x) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 3 (x is to the left of z) and supy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = 3 (x is above z). So, x is NW of z.

2. Let x be the rectangle with corners (0.5, 1.5) and (0.7, 1.7). In this case, supx(x) = 0.7 ≤ infx(z) = 3 (x is to the left of z), infy(z) = -1 ≤ infy(x) = 1.5 (z's bottom is below x's bottom), and supy(x) = 1.7 ≤ supy(z) = 2 (x's top is below z's top). So, x is W of z.

So based on the given conditions, both NW and W are possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Finally, let's also consider multi-tile cardinal relations. If x spans both the NW and W positions relative to z, it would be a NW:W relation. And if x spans the NW, W, and SW positions, it would be a NW:W:SW relation.

But based on the constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we know that x can't be completely below z, which means the SW relation is not possible.

So, if we're considering all possible configurations, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, W, and NW:W.

Actually wait a minute. Re-reading the definition, a region cannot relate to another region by a multi-tile relation. Multi-tile just means that we have a more general region that could be split into parts, where each part is in a specific relation to another region. So if region a is in a NW:W relation to region b, it means there exist regions a1 and a2 such that a1 is NW of b, a2 is W of b, and a1 ∪ a2 is a.

So, to make this clear, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW and W.

Actually, I think I overthought this. From the definition of the directions NW and W, the only constraint we have from the problem is:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is completely to the left of z).

And the constraints don't provide a direct comparison for the y-coordinates. The two possible relations are:
1. NW: if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above z).
2. W: if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection).

Given the constraints from the problem, we can't rule out either of these. So, the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

The answer is: NW and W.

ANSWER:

The cardinal direction relations between regions x and z can be determined by analyzing the constraints we're given.

From "x is N of y":
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

From "y is W of z":
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is completely to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's y-projection is within z's y-projection)

Combining these constraints:
1. supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) - this means x is completely to the left of z
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) - this means x starts at or above where y ends, and z's bottom is below or at the same level as y's bottom

Given these constraints, x must be to the left of z, but their vertical relationship can vary. The possible relations are:

NW, W

NW occurs when x is completely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
W occurs when x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
