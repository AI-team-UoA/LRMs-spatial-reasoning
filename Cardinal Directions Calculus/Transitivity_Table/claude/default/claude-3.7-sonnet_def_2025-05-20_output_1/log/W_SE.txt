PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know that:
1. Region x is W of region y, meaning x W y
2. Region y is SE of region z, meaning y SE z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

From the definitions:
- x W y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now I need to determine what these two constraints together tell us about the relationship between x and z.

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is not below y's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is not above y's top)

From y SE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z on the x-axis)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z on the y-axis)

Combining these constraints:
- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), so both x and z are to the west of y, but we don't know their relative positions on the x-axis.
- We know infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means that supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x).

Since infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we can't directly determine the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and infy(z).

Let's think about the possible relations based on the constraints we have:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z on the x-axis.
2. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is to the east of z on the x-axis.
3. If they overlap on the x-axis, then neither of the above conditions hold.

Similarly, for the y-axis:
1. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is to the south of z on the y-axis.
2. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is to the north of z on the y-axis.
3. If they overlap on the y-axis, then neither of the above conditions hold.

Given that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z)

We can't determine a direct ordering between supx(x) and supx(z) or between infx(x) and infx(z) based on these constraints. Both x and z are to the west of y, but their relative positions on the x-axis are not constrained.

Let's consider the y-axis:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SE z)

From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we can infer that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is strictly below z on the y-axis.

So, based on our constraints, x is strictly south of z on the y-axis, but we don't have a direct constraint on their relative positions on the x-axis.

Now, let's enumerate the possible relations:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z on the x-axis. Combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), this would make x SW of z.
2. If they overlap on the x-axis (not constrained by our given relations), then x would be S of z.
3. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is to the east of z on the x-axis. Combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), this would make x SE of z.

I think the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

But wait, let me double-check this by analyzing the constraints more carefully. 

We know:
- x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's combine these constraints more systematically:

From x W y and y SE z, we derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- These don't directly constrain the relationship between x and z on the x-axis, as I previously noted.

From x W y, we know:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SE z, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This means x is strictly south of z on the y-axis.

On the x-axis, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y). 

If we assume an additional constraint, say supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then we would have x SW z. If we assume a different additional constraint, say there's overlap on the x-axis, then we'd have x S z. And if we assume yet another additional constraint, namely supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then we'd have x SE z.

Actually, I think the analysis here is a bit off. Let me think about this differently. 

We have:
- x W y: x is strictly to the west of y on the x-axis, and vertically, x is within the y-range or partially overlaps with y.
- y SE z: y is strictly to the southeast of z, which means y is strictly to the east of z on the x-axis and strictly to the south of z on the y-axis.

So, visually, we have:
- z is in the northwest quadrant relative to y.
- x is directly to the west of y.

Given these positions, x could be:
- Southwest of z (if x is below z and to the west of z).
- West of z (if x is at the same vertical level as z and to the west of z).
- Northwest of z (if x is above z and to the west of z).
- South of z (if x is directly below z).
- B (Bounding Box) of z (if x is contained within the bounding box of z).

Hmm, I think I need to be more rigorous. Let's revisit the definitions and constraints:

- x W y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Let's deduce what we can about the relationship between x and z:

For the x-axis relationship:
- x W y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

This doesn't give us a direct constraint between supx(x) and supx(z) or between infx(x) and infx(z). So, on the x-axis, x and z could be in any of these relations:
- x is entirely to the west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- x and z overlap on the x-axis: not (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) or supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- z is entirely to the west of x: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

For the y-axis relationship:
- x W y means infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SE z means supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y), and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This means x is entirely below z on the y-axis.

Given these constraints:
- On the x-axis, x and z can be in any of the three relations I listed.
- On the y-axis, x is entirely below z.

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z would be:
- x SW z: if x is entirely to the west of z on the x-axis and entirely below z on the y-axis.
- x S z: if x and z overlap on the x-axis and x is entirely below z on the y-axis.
- x SE z: if z is entirely to the west of x on the x-axis and x is entirely below z on the y-axis.

So, based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Hmm, actually, I think this first approach is correct. But there's a problem with my second approach. If z is entirely to the west of x, it would mean supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But we also know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), which would imply supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ infx(y). While this is consistent and possible, it doesn't necessarily hold. Let me revise it to be clearer.

For the x-axis:
- x W y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

These only constrain x and z to be to the west of y on the x-axis, but not their relative positions. 

For the y-axis:
- x W y means infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SE z means supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can derive supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below z on the y-axis.

Given these constraints, the possible relations are:
- x SW z: if x is to the west of z on the x-axis.
- x S z: if x and z overlap or align on the x-axis.
- x SE z: if x is to the east of z on the x-axis.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Actually, hold on. Let me double check again.

We know:
- x W y meaning supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SE z meaning supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

On the x-axis, these just tell us that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means both x and z are to the west of y, but we don't have a direct constraint on the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis.

On the y-axis, we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y), and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we derive supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is entirely below z on the y-axis.

Now, let's consider the possible relations on the x-axis:
1. x is to the west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
2. x and z overlap on the x-axis: not (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) or supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
3. x is to the east of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), x is south of z. Combining with the three possibilities on the x-axis, we get:
1. x SW z: if x is to the west of z.
2. x S z: if x and z overlap on the x-axis.
3. x SE z: if x is to the east of z.

But wait, we need to make sure each of these is consistent with our original constraints. I think the issue is that we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), but this doesn't actually constrain the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis. So, I think all three relations (SW, S, and SE) are possible.

Actually, I think it's clearer if we use a diagram to understand the situation. The original constraints are:
- x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For y SE z, it means y is in the south-east quadrant relative to z. 
For x W y, it means x is directly to the west of y.

Given these positions:
- z is in the north-west quadrant relative to y.
- x is directly to the west of y.

Now, imagine placing x, y, and z on a 2D plane according to these constraints:
- z is in the north-west quadrant relative to y.
- x is directly to the west of y.

Given these placements, what can we say about the relative position of x with respect to z?

First, for the y-axis:
- y is to the south of z (from y SE z).
- x's vertical span is within or partially overlapping with y's vertical span (from x W y).

From these, x could be entirely to the south of z, or it could have some vertical overlap with z.

For the x-axis:
- y is to the east of z (from y SE z).
- x is to the west of y (from x W y).

From these, x could be to the west of z, it could overlap with z on the x-axis, or it could even be to the east of z, as long as it's to the west of y.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z would be: SW, W, NW, S, B, N, SE, E, and NE.

Wait, no, I think I'm making an error, let me trace through it again more carefully. 

From the original constraints:
- x W y: x is directly to the west of y. The y-ranges of x and y may overlap, but x must be entirely to the west of y on the x-axis.
- y SE z: y is in the south-east quadrant of z. This means y is to the east of z on the x-axis and to the south of z on the y-axis.

Given these:
- y is to the south of z.
- x's vertical position is constrained by y, but not directly by z.

From x W y, we know:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is not below y's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is not above y's top)

From y SE z, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining, we get:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This implies x is entirely below z on the y-axis.

So, on the y-axis, x is south of z.

For the x-axis:
- x is to the west of y (from x W y).
- y is to the east of z (from y SE z).

These don't directly constrain the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis. x could be to the west of z, overlap with z, or even be to the east of z as long as it's to the west of y.

But let's be more thorough:
- From x W y, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
- From y SE z, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

These don't provide a direct constraint between x and z on the x-axis. We know that both x and z are to the west of infx(y), but this doesn't tell us their relative positions.

So, given that x is south of z on the y-axis and could be in any of the three positions (west, overlapping, east) relative to z on the x-axis, the possible cardinal direction relations are: SW, S, SE.

Wait, I made an error in understanding "x W y." It means that x is to the west of y, but it doesn't constrain the vertical relationship between x and y to be a specific overlap. Rather, it just enforces that infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y). This can include situations where x and y vertically overlap.

I think the correct answer is that x can be SW, S, or SE of z. Let's double-check:

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y on the x-axis)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is not below y's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is not above y's top)

From y SE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z on the x-axis)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z on the y-axis)

Combining these, we can infer:
- On the y-axis: From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means x is entirely to the south of z.
- On the x-axis: Both x and z are to the west of y, but their relative positions aren't directly constrained.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: SW, S, SE.

Let's conduct a thorough check before finalizing:

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the y-coordinate:
- From x W y, we have infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- From y SE z, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
- Combining, we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

This confirms that x is entirely to the south of z on the y-axis.

For the x-coordinate:
- From x W y, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
- From y SE z, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
- These two constraints don't directly relate x and z on the x-axis. All we know is that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

Given these, x could be:
- To the west of z, which would make the relation SW.
- Overlapping with z on the x-axis, which would make the relation S.
- To the east of z, which would make the relation SE.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Hmm, wait, let's revisit the definitions:

- x W y if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- y SE z if and only if supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

Let's analyze the vertical relationship:
- From x W y, we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- From y SE z, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
- Combining, we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

This confirms that x is entirely to the south of z on the y-axis. The possible relations based on this vertical relationship would be SW, S, and SE.

For the horizontal relationship, we've already established that the constraints don't directly restrict the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis. They could be in any of the three relative positions (x to the west of z, x and z overlapping, or x to the east of z).

So, I believe the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Let's do one more check by specifying the additional constraints required for each relation. Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), what additional constraints would be needed for each of the relations SW, S, and SE?
- SW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This isn't in conflict with our existing constraints, so SW is a possible relation.
- S: Not (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) or supx(z) ≤ infx(x)). This means x and z overlap or align on the x-axis. This isn't in conflict with our existing constraints, so S is a possible relation.
- SE: supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This isn't in conflict with our existing constraints either, so SE is a possible relation.

So, again, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Hmm, let me check one more time. For SE to hold, we would need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). Given that we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y), there is no contradiction if we were to also assume supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

In fact, let me draw out a scenario to ensure I'm on the right track. Consider a scenario where:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, infx(y) = 4.
- infy(z) = 7, supy(y) = 6, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 4.

This satisfies both x W y and y SE z. And in this scenario, x is SE of z. 

Similarly, I can draw out scenarios where x is S of z or SW of z, and they won't contradict our original constraints.

Based on all this, I believe the answer is: SW, S, and SE.

Let me double check this one final time.

We know:
- x W y: this means that supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- y SE z: this means that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

First, let's consider the y-axis:
- From x W y, we know that infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- From y SE z, we know that supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
- Combining, we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which implies that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This means that x is strictly to the south of z on the y-axis.

Next, let's consider the x-axis:
- From x W y, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
- From y SE z, we know that supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
- This doesn't give us a direct constraint between x and z on the x-axis. x could be to the west of z, overlap with z on the x-axis, or be to the east of z, as long as both x and z are to the west of y.

Given that x is strictly to the south of z on the y-axis, and could be in any of the three positions on the x-axis, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Now, let's check if each of these is consistent with our original constraints:

SW (x is south-west of z): This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) isn't in conflict with our original constraints, so SW is a possible relation.

S (x is directly south of z): This means there's some overlap on the x-axis and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Again, we've established the y-axis constraint, and the x-axis overlap doesn't conflict with our constraints. So, S is a possible relation.

SE (x is south-east of z): This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). We've established the y-axis constraint. For the x-axis, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y). This doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). So, SE is a possible relation as well.

Thus, my careful analysis leads me to conclude that the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Let me double check the definition of S, SW and SE one more time:

- a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b). This means a is completely to the left of and below b.
- a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b). This means a is directly below b, and the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b.
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b). This means a is completely to the right of and below b.

I realize there's an error in my understanding of the S relation. For a S b, it means a is directly below b, with its x-projection contained within the x-projection of b.

Given our constraints:
- x W y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

For x S z to hold, we would need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Our constraints don't ensure this, so S might not be a possible relation. Actually, let me double check this by constructing a possible scenario:

Consider:
- supx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 3, supx(x) = 2, infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2
- infy(z) = 7, supy(y) = 6, infy(x) = 5, supy(x) = 4.

This scenario satisfies both x W y and y SE z. And in this scenario, x is S of z, because supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

So, S is indeed a possible relation.

For SW and SE, we've already confirmed that they are consistent with our constraints.

Thus, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

I think I am perhaps confusing myself. Let me review the question clearly once more. We know:

- x W y if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- y SE z if and only if supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

The question is: given x W y and y SE z, what are the possible relations between x and z?

From x W y, we know that region x is to the west of region y. From y SE z, we know that region y is to the southeast of region z. We're asked to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's approach this in a different way. Given the cardinal directions, we can infer:
- y is to the east and south of z.
- x is to the west of y, and the vertical relationship between x and y depends on the specific constraints.

From the constraints:
- x W y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y). This means x is to the west of y, and vertically, it can overlap with y.
- y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). This means y is to the southeast of z.

I've already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from these constraints, which means x is strictly to the south of z on the y-axis.

On the x-axis, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). This doesn't directly constrain the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis, but it does tell us that both x and z are to the west of y.

Given that x is strictly to the south of z, the possible relations based on the x-axis would be:
- SW: If x is strictly to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
- S: If the x-projections of x and z overlap, with infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- SE: If x is strictly to the east of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).

All of these are consistent with our constraints, so the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Just to be sure, let me try to diagram these relations to confirm my understanding:

For x W y and y SE z:
- x is here: [ x ]
- y is here:    [ y ]
- z is here:          [ z ]

For x SW z:
- x is here: [ x ]
- z is here:    [ z ]
- y is here:          [ y ]

For x S z:
- z is here: [ z ]
- x is here: [ x ]
- y is here:    [ y ]

For x SE z:
- z is here: [ z ]
- x is here:    [ x ]
- y is here:       [ y ]

(The vertical placement in the diagram represents the vertical position in the 2D space.)

I can see that all three of these relations (SW, S, and SE) are consistent with the constraints x W y and y SE z.

So, to conclude, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

Actually, wait, I think I'm a bit sloppy in the above. Let me try to phrase my explanations more carefully.

We're given two regions, x and y, and we know x W y. This means that x is directly to the west of y. Region x can be vertically positioned in a way that:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is not below y's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is not above y's top)

We're also given that y SE z. This means:
- y is to the east of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(y)).
- y is to the south of z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).

From these, we can infer:
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SE z)

Combining, we get supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This confirms that x is entirely to the south of z on the y-axis.

For the x-axis, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y). This means x is to the west of y.
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y SE z). This means z is to the west of y too.

So, both x and z are to the west of y, but we don't have a direct constraint on the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis. This gives us the three possible relations: SW, S, and SE.

Actually, I realized I'm once confused a bit about the definition of the S relation. Let me double check the given definition:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

Given our constraints:
- x W y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
- y SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

For x S z to hold, we would need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

We've already established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The other two constraints, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), would ensure that the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z. But our original constraints don't guarantee this.

Let me simply consider each possible pair of relations without relying on intuition:

SW:
- x SW z means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from our constraints.
- For supx(x) ≤ infx(z), we have no direct constraint from our original conditions. But this additional constraint doesn't conflict with our existing constraints. So, SW is a possible relation.

W:
- x W z means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from our constraints. This contradicts the last part of the W relation, which requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Since x is strictly to the south of z, it can't be directly to the west of z. So, W is NOT a possible relation.

NW:
- x NW z means supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from our constraints. This contradicts the second part of the NW relation, which requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, NW is NOT a possible relation.

S:
- x S z means supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from our constraints.
- For infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), we have no direct constraint from our original conditions. But these additional constraints don't conflict with our existing constraints. So, S is a possible relation.

B:
- x B z means infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from our constraints. This contradicts the last part of the B relation, which requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Since x is strictly to the south of z, it can't be contained within the bounding box of z. So, B is NOT a possible relation.

N:
- x N z means supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from our constraints. This contradicts the first part of the N relation, which requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, N is NOT a possible relation.

SE:
- x SE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from our constraints.
- For supx(z) ≤ infx(x), we have no direct constraint from our original conditions. But this additional constraint doesn't conflict with our existing constraints. So, SE is a possible relation.

E:
- x E z means supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from our constraints. This contradicts the last part of the E relation, which requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Since x is strictly to the south of z, it can't be directly to the east of z. So, E is NOT a possible relation.

NE:
- x NE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from our constraints. This contradicts the second part of the NE relation, which requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, NE is NOT a possible relation.

Based on this exhaustive examination of each relation with respect to the given constraints, I find that the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, and SE.

This affirms my earlier conclusion. The answer is: SW, S, and SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the constraints, I'll determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- x W y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

First, for the y-axis relationship:
- From x W y: supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- From y SE z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Combining these: supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This confirms x is strictly south of z on the y-axis.

For the x-axis:
- From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y SE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

These constraints don't directly determine the relative positions of x and z on the x-axis. x could be:
- West of z (making x SW of z)
- Overlapping with z on the x-axis (making x S of z)
- East of z (making x SE of z)

All three positions are consistent with our original constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, S, SE
