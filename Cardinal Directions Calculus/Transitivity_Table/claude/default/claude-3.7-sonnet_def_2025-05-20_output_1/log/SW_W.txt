PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
1. Region x is SW of region y
2. Region y is W of region z

Let's use the definitions provided:
- If x is SW of y, then: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- If y is W of z, then: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

I want to determine what these two conditions tell us about the relationship between x and z. I need to determine which of the 9 cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) could possibly hold between x and z.

First, let's analyze what we know about the coordinate relationships:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (bottom of z is below or at the same level as bottom of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top of y is below or at the same level as top of z)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about x relative to z:

For the x-coordinate:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) by transitivity

This means x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)

Here, we don't get a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) because the inequalities go in opposite directions. So we can't determine if x is strictly south of z, north of z, or has some vertical overlap with z.

Let's analyze each possible cardinal direction relation between x and z:

1. B (Bounding box): This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x cannot be in the bounding box of z.

2. S (South): This requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x cannot be south of z.

3. SW (Southwest): This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z) from our deduction above. For supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we know:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)
   So we can't guarantee supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But SW is still possible in some configurations.

4. W (West): This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z). The other conditions depend on the specific regions, so W is possible.

5. NW (Northwest): This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z). The other condition depends on the specific regions, so NW is possible.

6. N (North): This requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x cannot be north of z.

7. NE (Northeast): This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x cannot be northeast of z.

8. E (East): This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x cannot be east of z.

9. SE (Southeast): This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So x cannot be southeast of z.

To summarize, given that x is SW of y and y is W of z, the possible relations between x and z are:
- SW (Southwest)
- W (West)
- NW (Northwest)

Wait, let me double-check this. I need to be careful about what we can infer.

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (bottom of z is below or at the same level as bottom of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top of y is below or at the same level as top of z)

For the x-coordinate, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y W z)
- Therefore, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) by transitivity

This means x is to the west of z. So x can only be SW, W, or NW of z.

Let's look at the y-coordinate more carefully:

For SW to be possible, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
We know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)

So infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). This doesn't guarantee supy(x) ≤ infy(z). 
It's possible that infy(z) < supy(x) ≤ infy(y), which would mean x and z have some vertical overlap.

For W to be possible, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
We know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y W z)

We don't have direct information about infy(x) or the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z). So W could be possible.

For NW to be possible, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
We don't have enough information to determine this directly. But given x SW y and y W z, it's possible for z to be positioned such that supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

So my conclusion remains that the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW. However, let me draw a diagram to make sure:

Scenario 1: x SW z
```
     z
    +--+
    |  |
+---+  |
| y |  |
| +---+
| |
| x
+-+
```

Scenario 2: x W z
```
       z
      +--+
      |  |
+---+ |  |
| y | |  |
| +-+-+  |
| | |    |
| x |    |
+-+ +----+
```

Scenario 3: x NW z
```
+-+
| x
| |
| +---+
| | y |
+-+   |   z
    +--+--+
    |     |
    |     |
    +-----+
```

Yes, all three scenarios (SW, W, NW) are possible given the constraints that x is SW of y and y is W of z.

Let me double-check this with the formal definitions:

1. SW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - We've shown supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - For supy(x) ≤ infy(z), it's possible if z is positioned high enough relative to x

2. W: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We've shown supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - For infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), this is possible if z has vertical overlap with x

3. NW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - We've shown supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - For supy(z) ≤ infy(x), it's possible if z is positioned low enough relative to x

Given the constraints, all three relations (SW, W, NW) are possible between x and z.

Wait, I need to reconsider the SW case. The Inequality
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)
means the bottom of z is at or below the bottom of y. This is in the opposite direction of what we need for x SW z, which requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let's examine this more carefully:
- From x SW y, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y W z, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These two inequalities don't directly give us supy(x) ≤ infy(z). In fact, they could be arranged as:
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

So we have:
infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

This doesn't tell us whether supy(x) is less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z). All three cases are possible:
- If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is SW of z
- If infy(z) < supy(x) and there's vertical overlap, then x is W of z
- If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is NW of z

So I confirm the possible relations between x and z are SW, W, and NW.

Let me draw more examples to be sure:

Case SW: x is SW of z
```
      z
     +--+
     |  |
     |  |
+----+  |
| y  |  |
|    |  |
+----+  |
     |  |
     +--+
+-+
| x
| |
+-+
```

Case W: x is W of z
```
      z
     +--+
     |  |
     |  |
+----+  |
| y  |  |
|    |  |
+----+  |
     |  |
     +--+
     +-+
     | x
     | |
     +-+
```

Case NW: x is NW of z
```
+-+
| x
| |
+-+
     z
     +--+
     |  |
     |  |
+----+  |
| y  |  |
|    |  |
+----+  |
     |  |
     +--+
```

All three cases are possible, confirming that x can be SW, W, or NW of z.

So the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, W, NW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is W of region z

Let me analyze what we can infer about the relationship between x and z:

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is south of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (vertical constraints)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (vertical constraints)

By transitivity, we can conclude:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x must be west of z)

For the vertical relationship, we can't make a definitive conclusion because:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z)

These constraints allow x to be either south of z, partially vertically overlapping with z, or north of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
SW, W, NW
