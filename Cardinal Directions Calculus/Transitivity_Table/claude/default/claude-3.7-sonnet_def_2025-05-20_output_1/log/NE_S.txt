PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

We have:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is S of region z

We want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall the definitions of the relations:

- x NE y iff supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y S z iff supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, let's combine these relations to see what we can infer about x and z.

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends further west than y or starts at the same point)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends further east than y or ends at the same point)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about x and z:

1. For the east-west relationship (x-axis):
   - From x NE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - From y S z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
   
   If we combine these, we get: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   
   This tells us that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), but we don't know for sure if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) or supx(z) > infx(x).
   
   If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is strictly to the east of z.
   If supx(z) > infx(x), then x and z overlap in the east-west direction to some extent.

2. For the north-south relationship (y-axis):
   - From x NE y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
   - From y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   
   Comparing these: supy(y) ≤ min(infy(x), infy(z))
   
   This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). We know x is north of y and z is north of y, but we don't know the relative vertical positions of x and z.

From the above analysis, the possible relations between x and z can be:

1. x NE z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
2. x E z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
3. x SE z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
4. x N z: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
5. x B z: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
6. x NW z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
7. x W z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
8. x SW z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
9. x S z: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

But, I'm not entirely sure if all of these are possible given the constraints. Let me think about this more carefully.

Actually, let's draw this and see.

1. Region x is NE of region y:
   - This means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - And supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. Region y is S of region z:
   - This means supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
   - And infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z potentially extends west of y)
   - And supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z potentially extends east of y)

So, y is directly south of z, and x is to the northeast of y.

Let's consider the possible placements of x relative to z:

- If x is completely north of z (i.e., supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), and if x is completely to the east of z (i.e., supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), then x is NE of z.

- If x is completely north of z, and if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction (i.e., infx(z) ≤ infx(x) < supx(z) or infx(z) < supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then x is N of z.

- If x is completely north of z, and if x is completely to the west of z (i.e., supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), then x is NW of z.

- If x overlaps with z in the north-south direction (i.e., infy(z) ≤ infy(x) < supy(z) or infy(z) < supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), and if x is completely to the east of z, then x is E of z.

- If x overlaps with z in the north-south direction, and if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction, then x is B with respect to z. But this would mean x is partially inside the bounding box of z, which doesn't seem to be possible given our constraints.

- If x overlaps with z in the north-south direction, and if x is completely to the west of z, then x is W of z.

- If x is completely south of z (i.e., supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), and if x is completely to the east of z, then x is SE of z.

- If x is completely south of z, and if x overlaps with z in the east-west direction, then x is S of z.

- If x is completely south of z, and if x is completely to the west of z, then x is SW of z.

Hmm, actually this doesn't make sense. If x is NE of y, and y is S of z, then x can't be south of z. Let me think more carefully.

Actually, I think I made a mistake in the above analysis. Let's think again:

1. Region x is NE of region y:
   - This means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - And supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2. Region y is S of region z:
   - This means supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
   - And infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z potentially extends west of y)
   - And supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z potentially extends east of y)

From these, we can infer:
- x is to the east of y, and y could be directly below z or offset to the east or west.
- y is to the south of z, and x is to the northeast of y.

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relative positions of x and z?

For the east-west relationship:
- x is to the east of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x))
- z might extend westward of y (infx(z) ≤ infx(y))
- z might extend eastward of y (supx(y) ≤ supx(z))

We can't determine a definite east-west relationship between x and z without more information. x could be to the east, west, or might overlap with z in the east-west direction.

For the north-south relationship:
- x is to the north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y is to the south of z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

From these, we can't determine a definite north-south relationship between x and z. x could be to the north, south, or might overlap with z in the north-south direction.

Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z can be:

1. x NE z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
2. x E z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
3. x SE z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
4. x N z: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
5. x B z: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
6. x NW z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
7. x W z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
8. x SW z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
9. x S z: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

But now let me think more carefully about each of these options to see if they're all genuinely possible given the constraints.

I've been hasty. Let's approach this more systematically.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

1. NE Relation (x NE z): For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). 
   - From x NE y, we have supx(y) ≤ infx(x).
   - From y S z, we have supx(y) ≤ supx(z), but this doesn't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - From x NE y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   - From y S z, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but this doesn't directly relate supy(z) and infy(x).
   - So, x NE z is possible but not guaranteed.

2. E Relation (x E z): For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - As discussed, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is possible but not guaranteed.
   - From the given constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible.
   - Similarly, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is possible.
   - So, x E z is possible but not guaranteed.

3. SE Relation (x SE z): For this, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is possible as discussed.
   - From y S z, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
   - From x NE y, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   - This implies that infy(x) and infy(z) are both greater than supy(y), but we don't know their relative order. However, given that x is to the northeast of y, and y is directly south of z, it would be unusual for x to be to the southeast of z. But again, based on the constraints, it's not impossible.
   - So, x SE z is possible but seems unlikely given the context.

I'm not convinced by my logic so far. Let me rethink this problem from a different angle.

Given:
- x NE y: x is to the northeast of y.
- y S z: y is directly south of z.

Let's think of these in terms of the positions on a 2D plane.

If y is directly south of z, then y and z share the same east-west positioning, but y is to the south of z.

If x is to the northeast of y, then x is to the east and north of y.

So, if we combine these:
- x is to the east and north of y.
- y is directly below z.

This suggests that x is to the east and north of y, and y is directly south of z. 

So, x is to the east of z (because it's to the east of y, and y is directly below z) and could be north, level with, or south of z.

The possible relations would be: NE, E, or SE.

But wait, I have to be more precise in my analysis because the cardinal directions we're discussing are not just about points on a plane but regions.

Let me rethink this.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From y S z, we know that y and z share the same east-west positioning (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)), but y is to the south of z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z)).

From x NE y, we know that x is to the east of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x)) and x is to the north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)).

If z and y share the same east-west positioning, and x is to the east of y, then x is also to the east of z.

But for the north-south relationship, we don't have a direct constraint between infy(x) and infy(z). We only know that both infy(x) and infy(z) are greater than supy(y).

I need to be careful. Let's think about the potential positions of x relative to z, given these constraints.

Let's simplify the constraints:
- x is to the east of y and to the north of y.
- y is directly below z, meaning they share the same east-west positioning.

Given these, x has to be to the east of z. Now, for the north-south relationship, there are three possibilities:
- x is to the north of z (NE relation).
- x and z share some north-south positioning (E relation).
- x is to the south of z (SE relation).

Actually, there's one more case I didn't consider, which is that x could partially overlap with the bounding box of z, which would give a B (bounding box) relation.

This still doesn't account for the NW, N, W, SW, and S relations, though. Let me try again to systematically evaluate each one.

Let's directly evaluate each cardinal direction possibility:

1. N: For x N z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - From x NE y, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which is incompatible with supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y S z).
   - So, x N z is not possible.

2. NE: For x NE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   - From y S z, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
   - From x NE y, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(x).
   - We can't directly determine if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) from these, so NE is a possibility, especially if supx(y) < supx(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Also, from y S z, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
   - From x NE y, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   - Again, we can't directly determine if supy(z) ≤ infy(x) from these, so the north-south relationship isn't definitive.
   - But, in this context, NE is a possibility.

3. E: For x E z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - As discussed for NE, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is possible if supx(y) < supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Without further constraints, infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) are also possible.
   - So, x E z is a possibility.

4. SE: For x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - As discussed for NE, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is possible.
   - From y S z, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
   - From x NE y, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   - We don't have a direct constraint between supy(x) and infy(z), so without further information, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is possible.
   - So, x SE z is a possibility.

5. S: For x S z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - As discussed for N, the constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is incompatible with what we know from x NE y and y S z.
   - So, x S z is not possible.

6. SW, W, NW: For any of these, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - From x NE y, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(x) > supx(y).
   - From y S z, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y), so infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) < infx(x).
   - This implies infx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   - So, SW, W, and NW are not possible.

7. B: For x B z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - As discussed for S, the constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is incompatible with what we know.
   - So, x B z is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Let's re-verify:

For NE, E, and SE, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- We know supx(y) ≤ infx(x) from x NE y.
- We know supx(y) ≤ supx(z) from y S z.

From these, we can't directly conclude supx(z) ≤ infx(x). I think this is the source of my ambiguity.

But wait, we know more:
- From y S z, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y), so z starts to the west of (or at the same point as) y.
- From y S z, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so z extends further east than (or to the same point as) y.
- From x NE y, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so x starts to the east of (or at the same point where) y ends.

Actually, for x to be related to z by one of NE, E, or SE, we would need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). 

We do know that supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y S z) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x NE y). 

This means that supx(y) ≤ min(supx(z), infx(x)), but we don't know if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) or if infx(x) ≤ supx(z). It could be either case, which is why the relation between x and z isn't definitive.

If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is strictly to the east of z, and the relation would be one of NE, E, or SE, depending on the north-south positioning.

If infx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x and z overlap in the east-west direction, and the relation would depend on the specific overlap and the north-south positioning.

But wait, let's work through this more carefully.

We have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x NE y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y S z)

If supx(y) < supx(z), then we can't determine if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) or not.
If supx(y) = supx(z), then supx(z) = supx(y) ≤ infx(x), so x is strictly to the east of z.

So, the possibilities depend on the relationship between supx(y) and supx(z).

Let's take a different approach: constructing specific examples for each possible relation and checking if they satisfy our constraints. This might help clarify which relations are actually possible in the context of our constraints.

I think I made an error earlier when evaluating the possible directions. Just to be clear, let me restate the constraints and then re-examine the possible relations:

Given:
- x NE y means:
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

- y S z means:
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
  - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends westward of or begins at the same point as y)
  - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends eastward of or ends at the same point as y)

Now, let's evaluate each of the 9 potential relations between x and z.

1. x N z:
   - Requires: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - From constraints: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   - We don't have a direct constraint between supy(z) and infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible.
   - From constraints: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - This implies infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is compatible with N.
   - But, we don't have constraints that guarantee supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - So, x N z is possible if supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which is a new constraint not given.

2. x NE z:
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From constraints, we can't guarantee supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so we need that as an extra condition.
   - As discussed for N, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) is possible.
   - So, x NE z is possible if supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is a new constraint not given.

3. x E z:
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - As discussed for NE, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is a new constraint not given.
   - We don't have direct constraints for infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - So, x E z is possible if supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which are new constraints not given.

4. x SE z:
   - Requires: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - As discussed for NE, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) is a new constraint not given.
   - From constraints: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but we don't have a constraint between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - So, x SE z is possible if supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which are new constraints not given.

5. x S z:
   - Requires: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - As discussed for SE, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z) as a new constraint.
   - As discussed for N, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is compatible with our constraints.
   - We still need supx(x) ≤ supx(z) as a new constraint.
   - So, x S z is possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which are new constraints not given.

6. x SW z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - From constraints: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which implies infx(z) < infx(x).
   - This contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z), as it would imply supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which is a contradiction (supx(x) < infx(x)).
   - So, x SW z is not possible.

7. x W z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - As discussed for SW, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is not compatible with our constraints.
   - So, x W z is not possible.

8. x NW z:
   - Requires: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - As discussed for SW, supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is not compatible with our constraints.
   - So, x NW z is not possible.

9. x B z:
   - Requires: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - As discussed for N, infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is compatible with our constraints.
   - We need supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) as new constraints.
   - So, x B z is possible if supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which are new constraints not given.

Based on this re-evaluation, the possible relations between x and z, with additional constraints, are: N, NE, E, SE, S, and B. The relations SW, W, and NW are not possible given the existing constraints.

Actually, let's approach the problem by constructing concrete scenarios.

Scenario 1: Consider a scenario where:
- z is at coordinates (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- y is at coordinates (0, -2) to (2, -1) (below z)
- x is at coordinates (3, -0.5) to (4, 0.5) (to the northeast of y)

In this scenario:
- y is S of z: y is directly south of z.
- x is NE of y: x is to the northeast of y.
- x is E of z.

Scenario 2: Consider a scenario where:
- z is at coordinates (0, 0) to (2, 2).
- y is at coordinates (0, -2) to (2, -1) (below z)
- x is at coordinates (3, 3) to (4, 4) (to the northeast of y and also above z)

In this scenario:
- y is S of z: y is directly south of z.
- x is NE of y: x is to the northeast of y.
- x is NE of z.

Scenario 3: Consider a scenario where:
- z is at coordinates (0, 0) to (4, 2).
- y is at coordinates (0, -2) to (2, -1) (below z)
- x is at coordinates (3, -3) to (4, -2) (to the northeast of y but below z)

In this scenario:
- y is S of z: y is directly south of z.
- x is NE of y: x is to the northeast of y.
- x is SE of z.

Scenario 4: Consider a scenario where:
- z is at coordinates (0, 0) to (4, 2).
- y is at coordinates (0, -2) to (2, -1) (below z)
- x is at coordinates (1, 1.5) to (3, 3) (to the northeast of y and partially inside z)

In this scenario:
- y is S of z: y is directly south of z.
- x is NE of y: x is to the northeast of y.
- x is B with respect to z.

Scenario 5: Consider a scenario where:
- z is at coordinates (0, 0) to (4, 2).
- y is at coordinates (0, -2) to (2, -1) (below z)
- x is at coordinates (1, 3) to (3, 4) (to the northeast of y and above z but not east of z)

In this scenario:
- y is S of z: y is directly south of z.
- x is NE of y: x is to the northeast of y.
- x is N of z.

Scenario 6: Consider a scenario where:
- z is at coordinates (0, 1) to (5, 3).
- y is at coordinates (1, -1) to (3, 0) (below z)
- x is at coordinates (4, -3) to (6, -2) (to the northeast of y but below z)

In this scenario:
- y is S of z: y is directly south of z.
- x is NE of y: x is to the northeast of y.
- x is S of z.

Based on these scenarios, it seems all of N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

To summarize:
- When x is NE of y and y is S of z, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.
- The relations NW, W, and SW are not possible given these constraints.

Hmm, actually, I'm still not convinced. Let me approach this problem analytically to be sure.

Given:
- x NE y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let's first check if the relation SW, W, and NW between x and z are genuinely not possible. For any of these, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

From the constraints, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x NE y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y S z)

Combining these:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- So, infx(z) < infx(x), which means the left edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x.

For SW, W, or NW to be possible, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). 
But we just established infx(z) < infx(x), which means infx(z) is to the left of the left edge of x.

Given that regions are connected, supx(x) > infx(x) (that is, the right edge of x is to the right of the left edge of x). So, supx(x) > infx(x) > infx(z), which is incompatible with supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

So yes, SW, W, and NW are genuinely not possible given our constraints.

Now, let's examine the north-south relationship between x and z.

From our constraints, we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NE y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y S z)

This means that both x and z are to the north of y (or rather, y is to the south of both x and z).

But this doesn't tell us the relative positioning of x and z in the north-south direction.
- x could be to the north of z (N, NE).
- x could be at the same northern level as z (E).
- x could be to the south of z (SE, S).
- x could be partially within z in the north-south direction (B).

Not let's look at the east-west relationship.

From our constraints, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x NE y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y S z)

This means that x is to the east of y, and z and y share the same east-west extent in some way.

But without further constraints, we can't determine the exact east-west relationship between x and z.
- x could be to the east of z (E, NE, SE).
- x could be partially overlapping with z in the east-west direction (N, S, B).

So, the possible relations between x and z are indeed: N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

To double-check, let's analyze a bit further.

For relations NW, W, SW, as we already established, the constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) is not compatible with our given constraints. So these are definitely not possible.

Let's see if we can eliminate any of the relations N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

For B, we need both infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). 
- From the constraints, infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x).
- So, infx(z) < infx(x), which is compatible with B.
- Without further constraints, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is possible.

For N, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- As we've established, infx(z) < infx(x), which is compatible with N.
- Without further constraints, supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) are both possible.

For NE, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- Without further constraints, both supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) are possible.

For E, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- Without further constraints, all of these are possible.

For SE, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- Without further constraints, both of these are possible.

For S, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- As established, infx(z) < infx(x), which is compatible with S.
- Without further constraints, both supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) are possible.

So, all of N, NE, E, SE, S, and B are indeed possible relations between x and z given the constraints.

To summarize, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

This means that, given that x is to the northeast of y and y is to the south of z, x can be:
- Directly north of z (N).
- To the northeast of z (NE).
- Directly east of z (E).
- To the southeast of z (SE).
- Directly south of z (S).
- Overlapping with the bounding box of z (B).

I'm not fully convinced that relation S is possible, since we know that both x and z are to the north of y. Let me try to construct a concrete example for the S relation to check:

Scenario for S relation:
- z is at coordinates (0, 2) to (4, 4).
- y is at coordinates (1, 0) to (3, 1) (below z).
- x is at coordinates (2, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.9) (to the northeast of y but below z).

Checking the constraints:
- y S z: The top of y (y=1) is below the bottom of z (y=2).
  - supy(y) = 1 ≤ infy(z) = 2 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(y) = 1 ✓
  - supx(y) = 3 ≤ supx(z) = 4 ✓
- x NE y: The right edge of y (x=3) is to the left of the left edge of x (x=2), and the top of y (y=1) is below the bottom of x (y=1.5).
  - Wait, this doesn't satisfy supx(y) ≤ infx(x). In fact, infx(x) = 2 < supx(y) = 3.

It seems I made an error in my example. Let me correct it.

Scenario for S relation (corrected):
- z is at coordinates (0, 2) to (4, 4).
- y is at coordinates (1, 0) to (2, 1) (below z).
- x is at coordinates (3, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.9) (to the northeast of y but below z).

Checking the constraints:
- y S z: The top of y (y=1) is below the bottom of z (y=2).
  - supy(y) = 1 ≤ infy(z) = 2 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(y) = 1 ✓
  - supx(y) = 2 ≤ supx(z) = 4 ✓
- x NE y: The right edge of y (x=2) is to the left of the left edge of x (x=3), and the top of y (y=1) is below the bottom of x (y=1.5).
  - supx(y) = 2 ≤ infx(x) = 3 ✓
  - supy(y) = 1 ≤ infy(x) = 1.5 ✓
- x S z: The top of x (y=1.9) is below the bottom of z (y=2).
  - supy(x) = 1.9 ≤ infy(z) = 2 ✓
  - infx(z) = 0 ≤ infx(x) = 3 ✓
  - supx(x) = 3.5 ≤ supx(z) = 4 ✓

So, the S relation is indeed possible.

So, to finalize, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N, NE, E, SE, S, and B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is S of region z

First, let's analyze what these relationships tell us:

From x NE y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends westward of or begins at the same point as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends eastward of or ends at the same point as y)

When I consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

For the east-west relationship:
- From the constraints, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- This means x must be at least partially to the east of z
- The relations NW, W, and SW are impossible

For the north-south relationship:
- Both x and z are north of y, but their relative positions to each other are unconstrained
- x could be north of z, at the same level, or south of z

The possible relations between x and z are:
N, NE, E, SE, S, B
