PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is SW of y and y is S of z.

Let's use the definitions provided to analyze this step by step.

First, we know:
- x is SW of y, which means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is S of z, which means: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z:

1. First, let's consider the x-coordinate comparison:
   - From x SW y, we have: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
   - From y S z, we have: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

   So, we can say: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supx(x) and infx(z). They could be in either order.

2. Now, let's consider the y-coordinate comparison:
   - From x SW y, we have: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - From y S z, we have: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

   Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   So, we can conclude: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Now, based on the cardinal direction definitions and the constraints we've derived, x could have the following possible relations with z:

1. SW: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but the x-coordinate comparison can go either way.

2. S: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   Again, we've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but the x-coordinate comparisons can vary.

3. SE: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   We know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but the x-coordinate comparison can be in either order.

Let's revisit this carefully and be systematic:

From x SW y and y S z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Looking at y-coordinates:
From the constraints, we have:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
This implies: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

So, region x is definitely south of region z in terms of y-coordinates.

Now, let's look at x-coordinates:
- x SW y implies supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- y S z implies infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, there are three possibilities for x and z in terms of x-coordinates:

1. supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This means x is to the west of z.
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z): This means x is bounded by z in terms of x-coordinates.
3. supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This means x is to the east of z.

Combining with the y-coordinate comparison (x is south of z), we get:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is SW of z.
2. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is S of z.
3. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z): x is SE of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, or SE.

Let me double-check by drawing a spatial representation:

Let's focus just on the bounding boxes of the regions to simplify:

For x SW y:
```
    +---+
    | y |
    +---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

For y S z:
```
+---+
| z |
+---+
    +---+
    | y |
    +---+
```

Combining them:
```
+-------+
|   z   |
+-------+
    +---+
    | y |
    +---+
+---+
| x |
+---+
```

From this, I can see that x could indeed be SW, S, or SE of z, depending on the exact positioning of x relative to z.

Let me try one more way, just to make sure I haven't overlooked anything.

We're told that:
- x is SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let's think of the bounding boxes of these regions. The conditions give us constraints on the positions of these bounding boxes. Given these constraints, what are the possible relative positions of the bounding boxes of x and z?

From the y-coordinate constraints, we know that x is south of z:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the x-coordinates, we have:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Given these constraints, the possible relative positions of the bounding boxes are:

1. x is to the west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
2. z's x-bounds contain x's x-bounds: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
3. x is to the east of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

Combining with the y-coordinate constraints, we have:
1. x SW z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
2. x S z: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
3. x SE z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, or SE.

Wait, let me double-check if the constraints on x and y, combined with the constraints on y and z, can give us any more information about the relation between x and z.

Given:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Let's analyze the x-coordinates:
- x is to the west of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- y's x-bounds are within z's x-bounds: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From this, the west-most bound of y (infx(y)) is to the east of the east-most bound of x (supx(x)). Also, the west-most bound of z (infx(z)) is to the west of the west-most bound of y (infx(y)). But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between infx(z) and supx(x). They could be in either order.

Same logic for the east-most bounds. The east-most bound of y (supx(y)) is to the west of the east-most bound of z (supx(z)). But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supx(z) and infx(x). They could be in either order.

So, from the x-coordinates, the possible relations are:
- x is west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- z's x-bounds contain x's x-bounds: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- x is east of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

For the y-coordinates:
- x is to the south of y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is to the south of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Combining, we get:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

So x is definitely to the south of z.

Let's confirm using the cardinal direction definitions once more.

1. For x to be SW of z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we need to check if supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   Given our constraints, it's possible for supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y), which doesn't give us a direct comparison between supx(x) and infx(z). But it's possible for supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so x can be SW of z.

2. For x to be S of z:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). From our constraints, it's possible for infx(z) to be less than or equal to infx(x) and for supx(x) to be less than or equal to supx(z). So, x can be S of z.

3. For x to be SE of z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z). From our constraints, it's possible for supx(z) to be less than or equal to infx(x). So, x can be SE of z.

Let's summarize: Given that region x is SW of region y and region y is S of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- x SW z
- x S z
- x SE z

Are there any other possible relations? Let's check the remaining cardinal directions:

4. For x to be W of z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x cannot be W of z.

5. For x to be NW of z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   We've established that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (since supy(z) ≥ infy(z)). So, x cannot be NW of z.

6. For x to be N of z:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   Similarly, this contradicts the established constraint. So, x cannot be N of z.

7. For x to be NE of z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   Again, this contradicts the established constraint. So, x cannot be NE of z.

8. For x to be E of z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   This contradicts the established constraint. So, x cannot be E of z.

9. For x to be B of z (bounded by z):
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   This contradicts the established constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

So, the only possible relations between region x and region z are SW, S, and SE.

Let's double-check our reasoning once more. We have:

Given:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y S z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

For the y-coordinate constraints:
From x SW y and y S z, we have:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
Which gives us:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This clearly indicates that x is to the south of z on the y-axis.

For the x-coordinate constraints:
From x SW y:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y)

From y S z:
infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Now, just from these constraints, we can't directly compare supx(x) and infx(z) or infx(x) and supx(z). They can be in any order depending on the specific arrangement of the regions. So, in terms of the x-axis, x can be:
1. To the west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
2. Bounded by z in terms of x-coordinates: infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
3. To the east of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

Combining with the y-coordinate constraint, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. SW: If x is to the west of z.
2. S: If x is bounded by z in terms of x-coordinates.
3. SE: If x is to the east of z.

Given the constraints, no other cardinal direction relation is possible between x and z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, SE.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

SW, S, SE
