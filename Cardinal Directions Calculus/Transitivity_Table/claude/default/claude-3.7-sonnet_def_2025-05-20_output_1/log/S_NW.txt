PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think step by step through this problem.

We are given that:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's use the definitions provided:
- x S y means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, I need to determine what possible relations could hold between x and z. Let me analyze this by considering the constraints on the coordinates.

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or aligned with y's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or aligned with y's right boundary)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

Now let's try to establish relationships between x and z.

For the x-coordinate:
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Combining these:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

This means that x is completely to the left of z (on the x-axis).

For the y-coordinate:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z. We know that both x and z are below y, but we don't know their relative positions to each other.

Since we know that x is completely to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), and x and z could have any vertical relationship to each other, the possible directional relations between x and z could be:
- W (if they overlap vertically)
- NW (if x is above z)
- SW (if x is below z)

Let me verify each of these possibilities:

W relation:
For x W z to be true, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (vertical overlap)

This is possible if the y-coordinates of x and z overlap.

NW relation:
For x NW z to be true, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

This is possible if x is sufficiently above z.

SW relation:
For x SW z to be true, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

This is possible if x is sufficiently below z.

Actually, let me double-check this. The more I think about it, the more I realize we need to be careful about the constraints.

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y NW z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

But this doesn't tell us the direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x). So x and z could be vertically positioned in various ways.

Actually, let me re-examine the original constraints again:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or aligned with y's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or aligned with y's right boundary)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- This implies: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

But this doesn't give us a direct relation between the y-coordinates of x and z. We know that both x and z are below y, but we don't know their relative positions to each other.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be:
- W (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) - Vertically overlapping
- NW (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) - x is above z
- SW (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) - x is below z

Wait, let me reconsider this problem once more.

Given:
- x S y: x is south of y.
- y NW z: y is northwest of z.

Let's use spatial reasoning to understand the possible positions of x relative to z.

If y is northwest of z, then z is southeast of y.

Given that x is south of y, and z is southeast of y, we can infer that x is west or southwest or northwest of z.

Actually, let me reason through this step-by-step one more time, considering the exact constraints.

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or aligned with y's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or aligned with y's right boundary)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

For the x-coordinate:
- By transitivity: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- This implies: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

For the y-coordinate:
- We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

But we can't directly infer the relation between supy(x) and infy(z), or between supy(z) and infy(x). So, we have the following cases:

1. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is above z, which would make x NW of z.
2. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is below z, which would make x SW of z.
3. If they overlap vertically, then x is W of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, W, and SW.

Actually, I just realized that I missed something. It's possible for x's x-coordinates to be completely outside of z's x-coordinates on the left side, but it's also possible for x and z to have some overlap in their x-coordinates.

From the given constraints:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x S y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y NW z)

This does indeed imply that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but it doesn't restrict infx(x) in relation to infx(z). So, x is definitely to the left of z on the x-axis.

For the y-coordinate, as I've mentioned, we don't have a direct relationship between x and z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are still: NW, W, and SW.

Actually, let's carefully trace through the constraints again, one more time, just to make absolutely sure.

For x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (the top of x is below or at the bottom of y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is within the x-boundaries of y)

For y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (the right of y is to the left of or at the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (the top of z is below or at the bottom of y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (both x and z are below y on the y-axis)

But we still don't have a direct restriction between the y-coordinates of x and z.

So, based on the X-axis restriction, x and z don't horizontally overlap: the eastmost point of x, supx(x), is to the west of the westmost point of z, infx(z).

However, vertically, they could be in one of three configurations:
1. Vertically overlapping (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) or infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) or infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), which would make x W of z.
2. x above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), which would make x NW of z.
3. x below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), which would make x SW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

Let's double-check with a spatial diagram:

If we place y in the center and z to the southeast of y, then x is to the south of y. This means x could be southwest, south, or southeast of y. But since z is southeast of y, x has to be west, northwest, or southwest of z. The possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Let's test NE: For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But from x S y and y NW z, we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x can't be NE of z.

Ugh, wait, I think there's some confusion in my reasoning. Let's start over and be more careful.

Given:
- x S y: x is south of y.
- y NW z: y is northwest of z.

Let's use the definitions provided:
- x S y means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

For the x-coordinate:
- From x S y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

Combining these: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
Therefore: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

I was right before: x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis.

For the y-coordinate:
- From x S y: supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These conditions tell us that both x and z are below y on the y-axis, but there's no direct relation between the y-coordinates of x and z. They could overlap vertically, or one could be above the other.

Given that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z on the x-axis), and considering all the possible vertical relationships between x and z, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- W (if they overlap vertically)
- NW (if x is above z)
- SW (if x is below z)

Let me double-check these:

1. W relation:
   - We need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we know is true)
   - And: infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (vertical overlap)
   This is possible if the y-coordinates of x and z overlap.

2. NW relation:
   - We need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we know is true)
   - And: supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)
   This is possible if x is sufficiently above z.

3. SW relation:
   - We need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we know is true)
   - And: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
   This is possible if x is sufficiently below z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

In summary, given:
- x S y (x is south of y)
- y NW z (y is northwest of z)

The possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

No, wait, there's a logical issue again...

If y NW z, then NW of z is a region (or a direction) from z towards the northwest. The region y is located within this region. So, y is indeed northwest of z.

Let me think of a concrete example: Imagine a map with cardinal directions. If New York is south of Boston and Boston is northwest of Philadelphia, what's the relation between New York and Philadelphia?

Given that New York is south of Boston, and Boston is northwest of Philadelphia, it's not clear whether New York is west, northwest, or southwest of Philadelphia without additional information.

So I do believe my earlier reasoning is correct. The possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, or SW.

Actually let me be very careful. I'd like to draw out a concrete example. 

First, let's fix the positions of y and z. Since y is NW of z, let's say y is at (0, 0) and z is at (2, -2). This satisfies supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Now, since x is S of y, the x-coordinates of x should be within the x-coordinates of y, and the y-coordinates of x should be below y. So, x could be at:
1. (0, -1): This would make x W of z.
2. (0, -3): This would make x SW of z.
3. (0, -2.5): Again, this would make x SW of z.

But I also need to consider other positions of z. Since y is NW of z, z could also be at (2, -1) or (3, -2) or any other point that is southeast of y.

Let me try to construct more examples:
- If y is at (0, 0) and z is at (2, -1), then x could be at (0, -1), making x W of z.
- If y is at (0, 0) and z is at (2, -1), then x could be at (0, -2), making x SW of z.
- If y is at (0, 0) and z is at (3, -0.5), then x could be at (0, -1), making x SW of z.
- If y is at (0, 0) and z is at (2, -2), then x could be at (0, -1), making x NW of z.

OK, i'm convinced now. The possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

Actually I think I need to work harder to find an NW example since I got confused. I think I need to carefully work out the constraints. 

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the x-projection of x is contained within or at the edges of the x-projection of y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x)

Let's check if these conditions can be satisfied simultaneously.

From x S y and y NW z, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (which satisfies the first condition for x NW z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But it's not clear whether supy(z) ≤ infy(x) based on the given constraints, because infy(x) and supy(z) are not directly related. However, if supy(z) is sufficiently smaller than infy(y), and supy(x) is close to infy(y), then it's possible for supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Take a concrete example:
Let y's y-projection be [0, 1], x's y-projection be [-0.1, -0.1], and z's y-projection be [-1, -0.2].
Then, supy(x) = -0.1, infy(y) = 0, supy(z) = -0.2, infy(x) = -0.1.
With these values, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so x can indeed be NW of z.

Actually, let me visualize this even more clearly:

Imagine y as a small region at the very top, with x directly below it. Now, imagine z as a region to the right of y, but not as high up as y (since z is southeast of y). If z is positioned right and also significantly down, then x could be above z, making x NW of z.

Alright, I think NW is indeed a possible relation between x and z.

Just to be really sure, let me come up with a counterexample for one of the invalid relations. For example, let's check if x can be E of z.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (vertical overlap)

But from x S y and y NW z, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- This implies infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the first condition for x E z.

So, x cannot be E of z. Similarly, x cannot be NE, SE, S, or B of z, as they all require x to have at least partial overlap with or be to the right of z on the x-axis.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

I believe the given answer is correct now.

Actually I think I need to be even more careful here. I'm trying to be, but I keep making small errors and having to correct myself.

Let me list the constraints very explicitly:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

For the x-coordinate relation between x and z:
- From the constraints: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- This simplifies to: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- Which means x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis.

For the y-coordinate relation between x and z:
- From the constraints: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- There's no direct relation between y-coordinates of x and z based on these constraints.

Given that x is completely to the left of z on the x-axis, and there's no fixed relation on the y-axis, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- W: If x and z overlap vertically (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) or infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) or infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(x))
- NW: If x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- SW: If x is below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z))

Let's check if each of these is possible:

W relation:
For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(z) or infy(z) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) or infy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(x) (vertical overlap)

Given the constraints, there's nothing that restricts the y-coordinates of x and z to prevent vertical overlap. So, x can be W of z.

NW relation:
For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)

Given the constraints, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y). But there's no direct relation between supy(z) and infy(x). It's possible for supy(z) to be less than infy(x), so x can be NW of z.

SW relation:
For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which we've established)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

Given the constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y). But there's no direct relation between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible for supy(x) to be less than infy(z), so x can be SW of z.

OK, I've gone through this in painstaking detail now, and double-checked everything. I'm now confident that the possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

(Actually, let me do a final sanity check with example coordinates, just to be sure. Let's say y is at (0, 0) and has a width of 2 and a height of 2. So, y spans from (-1, -1) to (1, 1).

Given that x is S of y, x could be at (0, -2) with a width and height of 1, spanning from (-0.5, -2.5) to (0.5, -1.5).
Given that y is NW of z, z could be at (2, -2) with a width and height of 1, spanning from (1.5, -2.5) to (2.5, -1.5).

With these coordinates, x and z are at the same vertical level, but x is completely to the left of z. So, x is W of z.

But I can tweak the coordinates:
If x is at (0, -1.5) and z is at (2, -3), then x is NW of z.
If x is at (0, -3) and z is at (2, -1.5), then x is SW of z.

This confirms the conclusion: The possible relations between x and z are: W, NW, and SW.

Actually, there's a small detail I missed. Let's check if x can be N of z.

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (horizontal overlap)

We have already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means that supx(x) is strictly less than infx(z), not just less than or equal. This implies that x and z do not overlap horizontally. Hence, x cannot be N of z.

Similarly, x cannot be S of z, as S also requires horizontal overlap.

So, the possible relations between x and z are still: W, NW, and SW.

Now I realize that the definition of B is that one region is contained within the bounding box of another. Let me check if x can be B of z.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-projection is contained within or at the edges of z's x-projection)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within or at the edges of z's y-projection)

But we've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies that supx(x) < supx(z) but also that infx(x) < infx(z). This contradicts the first condition for x B z, which requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x).

So, x cannot be B of z.

To be absolutely certain, let me check all possible relations:

B: As I've just shown, x cannot be B of z.
S: Requires horizontal overlap, which doesn't exist (as we've established supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
SW: Possible, as I've shown.
W: Possible, as I've shown.
NW: Possible, as I've shown.
N: Requires horizontal overlap, which doesn't exist.
NE: Requires x to be to the right of z, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
E: Requires x to be to the right of z, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
SE: Requires x to be to the right of z, which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

So, the final answer is: The possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

So, to restate, the possible relations between x and z are:
W, SW, NW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

Let me analyze the constraints:

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

For the x-coordinate relation between x and z:
- By transitivity: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- This means x is completely to the left of z

For the y-coordinate relation:
- We know that both x and z are below y
- But we don't have a direct constraint between the y-coordinates of x and z

Given that x is completely to the left of z, and considering all possible vertical relationships between them, the possible relations are:

W, NW, SW
