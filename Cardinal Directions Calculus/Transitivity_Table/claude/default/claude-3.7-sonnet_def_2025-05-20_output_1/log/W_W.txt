PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

In this problem, we need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z.

Let's first recall the definition of the W relation:
- x W y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

So we know:
1. x W y means: 
   - supx(x) <= infx(y)
   - infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y)

2. y W z means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, I need to determine what these constraints tell us about the possible relation between x and z.

First, for the x-coordinates:
- From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we can deduce:
  supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
  Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z)

This satisfies the first constraint for a W relation. But we should check if other relations are also possible.

Now, let's look at the y-coordinates:
- We know infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
- From this, we can deduce: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- We also know supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
- From this, we can deduce: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

So, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(z), which is consistent with all relations to the west of z: W, NW, SW
- infy(z) <= infy(x), which is consistent with relations to the north or at the same latitude: N, NE, NW, W, E, B
- supy(x) <= supy(z), which is consistent with relations to the south or at the same latitude: S, SE, SW, W, E, B

Now, let's determine which relations satisfy all three conditions:
- W relation requires: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- NW relation requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- SW relation requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's recheck:
1. W is consistent with: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
2. NW requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know the relation between supy(z) and infy(x).
3. SW requires: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We know supy(x) <= supy(z), but we don't know the relation between supy(x) and infy(z).

Actually, I realize I didn't check all conditions fully. Let me double-check by considering each possible relation between x and z and determine if it's consistent with the given constraints.

Constraints between x and z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Now, let's check each direction relation:

1. N: 
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   This is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z).

2. NE:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   This is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z).

3. E:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   This is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z).

4. SE:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   This is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z).

5. S:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   This is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z).

6. SW:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but we don't know if supy(x) <= infy(z).

7. W:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   This is consistent with our constraints.

8. NW:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We know supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), but we don't know if supy(z) <= infy(x).

9. B:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The first condition is inconsistent with supx(x) <= infx(z).

Wait, I'm making an error in my reasoning. Let me reapproach. The fact that supx(x) <= infx(z) doesn't necessarily mean supx(x) < supx(z). Let me revisit the possible relations.

Actually, let's realize that the constraints we derived for the relation between x and z are exactly the constraints for the W relation. So, the relation between x and z must be W.

Wait, but I think that's not right either. Let me re-analyze this.

Given:
- x W y means: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we can deduce for the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (derived from supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z))
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (derived from the given constraints)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (derived from the given constraints)

These are the necessary conditions for the relation W. So, one possible relation between x and z is W.

But I need to see if other relations are also possible. For example, could x be NW of z? For this, we'd need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) is possible given our constraints. 

Let me go back to the definition of the cardinal directions:

- N: 
  - supy(z) <= infy(x)
  - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

- NE:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

- E:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x)
  - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

- SE:
  - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

- S:
  - supy(x) <= infy(z)
  - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

- SW:
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

- W:
  - supx(x) <= infx(z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

- NW:
  - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

- B:
  - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
  - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Looking at each relation between x and z, I need to determine which ones are consistent with the derived constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's check one by one.

1. N: 
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) since if supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(x) cannot be <= supx(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) simultaneously.

2. NE:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) since if supx(x) <= infx(z), then supx(z) cannot be <= infx(x).

3. E:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) for the same reason as above.

4. SE:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) for the same reason as above.

5. S:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) for the same reason as for N.

6. SW:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   The first condition aligns with our derived constraint. For the second condition, while we know supy(x) <= supy(z), we don't know the relation between supy(x) and infy(z). So, SW is a possibility if supy(x) <= infy(z) holds.

7. W:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   This aligns with all our derived constraints. So, W is certainly a possibility.

8. NW:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   The first condition aligns with our derived constraint. For the second condition, while we know infy(z) <= infy(x), we don't know the relation between supy(z) and infy(x). So, NW is a possibility if supy(z) <= infy(x) holds.

9. B:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   This contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) since if supx(x) <= infx(z), then infx(z) cannot be <= infx(x).

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Actually, wait. Let me triple check this. 

We know:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

And we're checking which of the following relations are compatible with these constraints:

W: 
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
These align exactly with our derived constraints. So, W is a possibility.

NW:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
We can't determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) from our given constraints. It's possible that supy(z) > infy(x) or that supy(z) <= infy(x). So, NW is a possibility if supy(z) <= infy(x) holds.

SW:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
We can't determine if supy(x) <= infy(z) from our given constraints. It's possible that supy(x) > infy(z) or that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, SW is a possibility if supy(x) <= infy(z) holds.

All of the other direction relations are not possible because they contradict at least one of the constraints we derived.

So, the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Actually, wait. Let me carefully reconsider SW again.

For SW:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is satisfied)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (given from our derived constraints)

We need to determine if supy(x) <= infy(z) is consistent with our constraints.

Typically, for a region z, infy(z) is the minimum y-coordinate of the region, while supy(z) is the maximum y-coordinate. So, infy(z) <= supy(z) always holds.

Given that supy(x) <= supy(z), it's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z) (which would make the relation SW) or that infy(z) < supy(x) <= supy(z) (which would make the relation W). Both are possible scenarios, so SW remains a possibility.

Now, let's consider NW:

For NW:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)

We know:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (this is satisfied)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (given from our derived constraints)

We need to determine if supy(z) <= infy(x) is consistent with our constraints.

Given that infy(z) <= infy(x), it's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x) (which would make the relation NW) or that infy(x) < supy(z) (which would make the relation W). Both are possible scenarios, so NW remains a possibility.

In conclusion, based on the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Actually wait, I've been thinking about this more. Let me draw up a clearer picture in my mind.

Given:
- x W y means: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From the above, using the transitive property, we can deduce the following constraints for the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (this follows from supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z))
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (this follows from infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (this follows from supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z))

Let's check which of the cardinal directions these constraints permit.

W: 
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (both satisfied)
So, W is a possibility.

NW:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (not determined by our constraints; could be true or false)
For the relation to be NW, we would need `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. Given that we only know `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`, it's possible that `supy(z) <= infy(x)` or that `supy(z) > infy(x)`. If `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, then x is NW of z; otherwise, it's not.

SW:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (satisfied)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (not determined by our constraints; could be true or false)
For the relation to be SW, we would need `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Given that we only know `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`, it's possible that `supy(x) <= infy(z)` or that `supy(x) > infy(z)`. If `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, then x is SW of z; otherwise, it's not.

All other cardinal directions are not possible because they contradict at least one of the constraints we derived.

So, the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Wait, let me check my reasoning once more.

GIVEN: x W y and y W z. This means:
- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

DEDUCED:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) [from supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) (always true) and supx(y) <= infx(z)]
- infy(z) <= infy(x) [from infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x)]
- supy(x) <= supy(z) [from supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)]

CHECKING EACH CARDINAL DIRECTION:

1. B (bounding box):
   For x B z, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)]
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) [satisfied]
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) [satisfied]
   Since one of the conditions is contradicted, x B z is not possible.

2. S (South):
   For x S z, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) [could be true or false given our constraints; remains a possibility]
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)]
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Since one of the conditions is contradicted, x S z is not possible.

3. SW (South West):
   For x SW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) [satisfied]
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) [could be true or false given our constraints; remains a possibility]
   Since the first condition is satisfied and the second could be true, x SW z is a possible relation.

4. W (West):
   For x W z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) [satisfied]
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) [satisfied]
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) [satisfied]
   All conditions are satisfied, so x W z is possible.

5. NW (North West):
   For x NW z, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) [satisfied]
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) [could be true or false given our constraints; remains a possibility]
   Since the first condition is satisfied and the second could be true, x NW z is a possible relation.

6. N (North):
   For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) [could be true or false given our constraints; remains a possibility]
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)]
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Since one of the conditions is contradicted, x N z is not possible.

7. NE (North East):
   For x NE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)]
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) [could be true or false given our constraints]
   Since one of the conditions is contradicted, x NE z is not possible.

8. E (East):
   For x E z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)]
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) [satisfied]
   - supy(x) <= supy(z) [satisfied]
   Since one of the conditions is contradicted, x E z is not possible.

9. SE (South East):
   For x SE z, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) [contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z)]
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) [could be true or false given our constraints]
   Since one of the conditions is contradicted, x SE z is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Actually, let's make sure our deduction is correct:

GIVEN: x W y and y W z. This means:
- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y W z: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

DEDUCING supx(x) <= infx(z):
From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we can say:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) (always true for consistent regions) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
=> supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)
=> supx(x) <= infx(z)

DEDUCING infy(z) <= infy(x):
From infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), we have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
=> infy(z) <= infy(x)

DEDUCING supy(x) <= supy(z):
From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we have:
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
=> supy(x) <= supy(z)

OK, our deductions seem correct. Now, when we check the cardinal directions again, we get the following possibilities: W, NW, and SW.

Actually, I'm noticing something. The condition for W is exactly what we deduced: `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. So, x W z is certainly a possibility based on the given constraints.

For NW, we need: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. The first condition is satisfied by our deduction. For the second condition, we can only say that `infy(z) <= infy(x)` from our deduction, which doesn't tell us the relation between `supy(z)` and `infy(x)`. But, it is possible that `supy(z) <= infy(x)` while still satisfying `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. So, NW remains a possibility.

For SW, we need: `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. Again, the first condition is satisfied by our deduction. For the second condition, we can only say that `supy(x) <= supy(z)` and `infy(z) <= infy(x)` from our deduction. While these don't directly tell us the relation between `supy(x)` and `infy(z)`, it is still possible that `supy(x) <= infy(z)` while satisfying the deduced constraints. So, SW is also a possibility.

Let's double check that each combination of constraints in an answer is consistent with the constraints we deduced.

For W, the constraints match our deductions, so W is consistent.

For NW, we have `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. We derived `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. Are these consistent? Let's check:

* If `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, then `supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x)`.
* Since for any region a, `supy(a) >= infy(a)` (the supremum of y is greater than or equal to the infimum of y), we have `supy(x) >= infy(x)`.
* But the above two indicate `supy(x) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) >= infy(x)`, which means `supy(x) = infy(x)`. This is a degenerate case where the y-coordinate of region x is constant.
* In such a scenario, we'd also have `supy(z) = infy(x)` (from the above).
* But this doesn't appear to be a general solution and is a very specific scenario.

So, NW might not be a general possibility for all cases, but it's a valid relation in a degenerate scenario.

Let's check SW similarly:

For SW, we have `supx(x) <= infx(z)` and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. We derived `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. Are these consistent? Let's check:

* If `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, then `supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x)`.
* Since for any region a, `supy(a) >= infy(a)`, we have `supy(x) >= infy(x)`.
* but the above two indicate `supy(x) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) >= infy(x)`, which means `supy(x) = infy(x)`. Again, this is a degenerate case where the y-coordinate of region x is constant.

So, SW might not be a general possibility for all cases, but it's a valid relation in a degenerate scenario.

It seems I'm having difficulty with these specific conditions. Let's simplify by directly checking if each relation is consistent with the derived constraints.

Given the constraints:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)`
* `infy(z) <= infy(x)`
* `supy(x) <= supy(z)`

Let's check each relation:

For W, it's `supx(x) <= infx(z)`, `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`, which is exactly our derived constraints, so it's consistent.

For NW, it's `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (satisfied by our derived constraint) and `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. The latter adds a constraint that isn't present in our derived constraints, but doesn't contradict any of them. It just narrows down the range of possible region configurations. So, NW is a possible relation.

For SW, it's `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (satisfied by our derived constraint) and `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. The latter adds a constraint that isn't present in our derived constraints, but doesn't contradict any of them. It just narrows down the range of possible region configurations. So, SW is a possible relation.

OK, now I'm confident that W, NW, and SW are all potential relations between x and z, given the constraints we derived from x W y and y W z.

Actually, wait. There's a very simple counterexample for NW I'm overlooking. Let's say x and z are both unit squares with their bottom left coordinates at (0, 0) and (2, 0) respectively. In this case, infy(x) = infy(z) = 0, supy(x) = supy(z) = 1, supx(x) = 1, and infx(z) = 2. So, x W z, but it's not NW of z (because supy(z) is 1, and infy(x) is 0, so supy(z) > infy(x)).

Similarly for SW, let's say x and z are both unit squares with their bottom left coordinates at (0, 1) and (2, 0) respectively. In this case, infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 2, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1, supx(x) = 1, and infx(z) = 2. So, x W z, but it's not SW of z (because supy(x) is 2, and infy(z) is 0, so supy(x) > infy(z)).

So, I'm not convinced that NW and SW are guaranteed to be possible. I need to clear up the difference between a region being NW vs W, and the difference between a region being SW vs W.

For W, we have the conditions:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)`
* `infy(z) <= infy(x)`
* `supy(x) <= supy(z)`

For NW, we have the conditions:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)`
* `supy(z) <= infy(x)`

For a region to be NW instead of W, the condition `supy(z) <= infy(x)` must be stronger than the combined conditions `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. This is the case if, for instance, `infy(x) < supy(z)`, which doesn't contradict `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.

Actually, wait. The cardinal direction relations define where one region is with respect to another, not how they relate in terms of the bounding box. For two distinct regions, it's possible that one is strictly northwest of the other, or strictly west, or anywhere in between. The constraints only tell us the relative positioning based on the defined cardinal direction relation, which includes the bounding box constraints.

Given the constraints:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (x lies completely to the west of z)
* `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (the bottom of x is above or at the same level as the bottom of z)
* `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z)

These constraints define a range of possible positions for x relative to z. One possibility is W, where x is directly west of z without being particularly north or south of it. Another possibility is NW, where x is west and north of z. And another is SW, where x is west and south of z.

That seems right, based on my direct counterexample above for W, we can have the west relation without NW or SW, like in the case where x and z are both unit squares with their bottom left coordinates at (0, 0) and (2, 0) respectively.

Let me concretely see if we can have the NW relation while still obeying `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`. Let's say x is a unit square with its bottom left coordinate at (0, 1), and z is a unit square with its bottom left coordinate at (2, 0). In this case, infy(x) = 1, supy(x) = 2, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1, supx(x) = 1, and infx(z) = 2. So, `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (0 <= 1) and `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (2 <= 1) is false. So we can't have NW while obeying the W constraints.

Actually, wait, I think I've been failing to compare the original relation definitions carefully. Let me redefine the W relation and break it into its component conditions:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)`
* `infy(z) <= infy(x)`
* `supy(x) <= supy(z)`

For NW, we have:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)`
* `supy(z) <= infy(x)`

For NW the condition is `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, which means the y-coordinate of the top of z is less than or equal to the y-coordinate of the bottom of x, and for W the condition is `infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`, which means the bottom of x is above or at the same level as the bottom of z, and the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z.

Since for any region, the top is always above or at the same level as the bottom, the condition `supy(z) <= infy(x)` is a stronger constraint compared to (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`), because it enforces that the entirety of x is above the entirety of z (in terms of y-coordinates). On the other hand the W condition allows for x's bottom to still be above z's bottom, and top to be below z's top at the same time.

So, it doesn't seem like NW is always a possible relation given the three conditions we derived from original x W y and y W z.

Similarly, for SW, the condition is:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)`
* `supy(x) <= infy(z)`

The condition `supy(x) <= infy(z)` means the top of x is below or at the same level as the bottom of z, which, similar to the NW case, is a stronger constraint compared to (`infy(z) <= infy(x)` and `supy(x) <= supy(z)`). For SW to be valid, the entirety of x should be below the entirety of z (in terms of y-coordinates).

As a counterexample, let's say x is a unit square with its bottom left coordinate at (0, 0), and z is a unit square with its bottom left coordinate at (2, 0). In this case, infy(x) = infy(z) = 0, and supy(x) = supy(z) = 1. For SW, we would need `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, which is 1 <= 0, which is false. So, x is not SW of z in this case, even though it's W of z.

Actually, let me directly the x W y and y W z to see if we can derive NW and SW. And only then try to find specific examples.

Let's start by trying to find x NW z:

For x NW z, we need:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (satisfied by our derived constraint)
* `supy(z) <= infy(x)`

From x W y, we have:
* `infy(y) <= infy(x)`

From y W z, we have:
* `supy(y) <= supy(z)`

There's no direct relationship between `supy(z)` and `infy(x)` that we can derive from these, so it's indeed possible that `supy(z) <= infy(x)`. But it's also possible that `supy(z) > infy(x)`.

There's no direction relation that guarantees x NW z, given just x W y and y W z. i.e., NW is neither guaranteed nor ruled out.

Let's check now about SW:

For x SW z, we need:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (satisfied by our derived constraint)
* `supy(x) <= infy(z)`

From x W y, we have:
* `supy(x) <= supy(y)`

From y W z, we have:
* `infy(z) <= infy(y)`

Again, there's no direct relationship between `supy(x)` and `infy(z)` that we can derive from these, so it's indeed possible that `supy(x) <= infy(z)`. But it's also possible that `supy(x) > infy(z)`.

There's no direction relation that guarantees x SW z, given just x W y and y W z. i.e., SW is neither guaranteed nor ruled out.

Let's refocus. We're given that x W y and y W z. We want to know which directed relation(s) could hold between x and z.

A clearer way to this might be to think about what happens if we enforce either NW or SW.

When we enforce x NW z, we are adding the cosntraint supy(z) <= inf(x). Since z W y, we know that infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). Therefore, supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x). Combining this with the constraint from x W y, we get infy(y) <= infy(x). Combining all of these together, we get infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x), which means the entirety of y is below the entirety of x in terms of y-coordinates. But this contradicts the constraint infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) from x W y, as those constraints require y to be above x in the y-dimension. Thus, NW is not an option.

Actually no, I'm making an error. The constraint from x W y is infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). But the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x) implies that supy(y) <= supy(y), not the other way around. So the NW relation might indeed be possible.

No, I'm confusing myself. Maybe I should draw a picture?

Let's say we have three regions on a cartesian plane, and x W y and y W z. Here are some coordinates that satisfy the constraints.

x bottom-left: (0, 0.25)
x top-right: (1, 0.75)

y bottom-left: (2, 0)
y top-right: (3, 1)

z bottom-left: (4, 0.5)
z top-right: (5, 0.75)

Is x W z?
supx(x) = 1 <= infx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 0.5 <= infy(x) = 0.25 is false. But for W we need infy(z) <= infy(x), which isn't true here. So no, x is not W of z.

Wait, I'm making a mistake. If infy(z) = 0.5 and infy(x) = 0.25, then infy(z) > infy(x), which means x is not W of z.

Let's use more careful examples.

x bottom-left: (0, 0)
x top-right: (1, 1)

y bottom-left: (2, 0)
y top-right: (3, 1)

z bottom-left: (4, 0)
z top-right: (5, 1)

All three regions are unit squares. We can see that `supx(x) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2` and `supx(y) = 3 <= infx(z) = 4`. Also, `infy(y) = 0 <= infy(x) = 0` and `infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 0`. Additionally, `supy(x) = 1 <= supy(y) = 1` and `supy(y) = 1 <= supy(z) = 1`. So, x W y and y W z.

Now, the derived constraints for the relation between x and z would be:
* `supx(x) = 1 <= infx(z) = 4`
* `infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 0`
* `supy(x) = 1 <= supy(z) = 1`

These match the conditions for W, so x W z. Is x also NW or SW of z?

For NW, we would need:
* `supx(x) = 1 <= infx(z) = 4` (satisfied)
* `supy(z) = 1 <= infy(x) = 0` (not satisfied)

For SW, we would need:
* `supx(x) = 1 <= infx(z) = 4` (satisfied)
* `supy(x) = 1 <= infy(z) = 0` (not satisfied)

So, in this example, x W z, but x is neither NW nor SW of z.

Let's try another!

x bottom-left: (0, 1)
x top-right: (1, 2)

y bottom-left: (2, 0.5)
y top-right: (3, 2.5)

z bottom-left: (4, 0)
z top-right: (5, 0.5)

Check if x W y:
* `supx(x) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2` (satisfied)
* `infy(y) = 0.5 <= infy(x) = 1` (satisfied)
* `supy(x) = 2 <= supy(y) = 2.5` (satisfied)
So, x W y.

Check if y W z:
* `supx(y) = 3 <= infx(z) = 4` (satisfied)
* `infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 0.5` (satisfied)
* `supy(y) = 2.5 <= supy(z) = 0.5` (not satisfied)

Wait, that's unexpected! But maybe we can tweak the example. Specifically, I want a design that has the bottom of z below the bottom of y, to satisfy infy(z) <= infy(y).

x bottom-left: (0, 1)
x top-right: (1, 2)

y bottom-left: (2, 0)
y top-right: (3, 3)

z bottom-left: (4, 0)
z top-right: (5, 1)

Check if x W y:
* `supx(x) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2` (satisfied)
* `infy(y) = 0 <= infy(x) = 1` (not satisfied)

Hmm, not working out. Let's try another.

x bottom-left: (0, 0)
x top-right: (1, 1)

y bottom-left: (2, 0)
y top-right: (3, 1)

z bottom-left: (4, 0)
z top-right: (5, 0.5)

Check if x W y:
* `supx(x) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2` (satisfied)
* `infy(y) = 0 <= infy(x) = 0` (satisfied)
* `supy(x) = 1 <= supy(y) = 1` (satisfied)

Check if y W z:
* `supx(y) = 3 <= infx(z) = 4` (satisfied)
* `infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 0` (satisfied)
* `supy(y) = 1 <= supy(z) = 0.5` (not satisfied)

Ah, I'm having trouble finding an example, as there seems to be a contradiction. Let's back up. In the relation W, the constraint `supy(x) <= supy(y)` requires the top of x to be at or below the top of y. Similarly, the constraint `supy(y) <= supy(z)` requires the top of y to be at or below the top of z. Together, they'd imply `supy(x) <= supy(z)`, which is what we derived earlier.

Let me try an example for W w and NW:

x bottom-left: (0, 0.5)
x top-right: (1, 1)

y bottom-left: (2, 0)
y top-right: (3, 1.5)

z bottom-left: (4, 0)
z top-right: (5, 0.5)

Check if x W y:
* `supx(x) = 1 <= infx(y) = 2` (satisfied)
* `infy(y) = 0 <= infy(x) = 0.5` (satisfied)
* `supy(x) = 1 <= supy(y) = 1.5` (satisfied)
So, x W y.

Check if y W z:
* `supx(y) = 3 <= infx(z) = 4` (satisfied)
* `infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 0` (satisfied)
* `supy(y) = 1.5 <= supy(z) = 0.5` (not satisfied)
Ah, this doesn't work out either. Maybe I should back to theory.

Let me use the constraints from the problem directly:

For x W y:
* `supx(x) <= infx(y)`
* `infy(y) <= infy(x)`
* `supy(x) <= supy(y)`

For y W z:
* `supx(y) <= infx(z)`
* `infy(z) <= infy(y)`
* `supy(y) <= supy(z)`

From these, we can deduce:
* `supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)`, so `supx(x) <= infx(z)`.
* `infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)`, so `infy(z) <= infy(x)`.
* `supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)`, so `supy(x) <= supy(z)`.

These constraints exactly match the W relation. So, if x W y and y W z, then x W z, for sure. But for relations like NW or SW, we would need additional information.

For x NW z, we would need:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (satisfied by our deduction)
* `supy(z) <= infy(x)`

For the second constraint, we know `infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)`, but we don't have a direct relation between `supy(z)` and `infy(x)`. However, the constraints don't rule out the possibility of `supy(z) <= infy(x)`, so NW remains a possibility.

For x SW z, we would need:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (satisfied by our deduction)
* `supy(x) <= infy(z)`

For the second constraint, we know `supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)`, but we don't have a direct relation between `supy(x)` and `infy(z)`. However, the constraints don't rule out the possibility of `supy(x) <= infy(z)`, so SW remains a possibility.

For other relations (like N, NE, E, SE, S, or B), they all have constraints that directly contradict the derived constraints from x W y and y W z, so they're not possible.

In conclusion, given that x W y and y W z, the possible relations between x and z are W, NW, and SW.

Actually, it seems like I'm overthinking this. If the logical deductions we made:

* `supx(x) <= infx(z)`
* `infy(z) <= infy(x)`
* `supy(x) <= supy(z)`

exactly match the constraints for the W (West) relation, then W is a possible relation between x and z. Actually, even further, it's a guaranteed relation, becase our deductions mean that ALL of those constraints have to be satisfied, and that's when we have W.

Consider the constraints for NW. Remember that the condition for NW is
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (which is already one of our deducations)
* `supy(z) <= infy(x)`.

Our deductions also include:
* `infy(z) <= infy(x)`
* `supy(x) <= supy(z)`

If we just to these deductions, than `infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)` implies 'the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z, and the top of x is at or below the top of z'. This means that, z could be the same size as x, or even taller than x, in the y-dimension. This would mean `supy(z) > infy(x)`, which contradicts the NW constraint.

So, NW is not a guaranteed relation. It's possible, though, if we add an additional constraint: specifically, regions x and z might be positioned in such a way that `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (i.e., the top of z is below the bottom of x, making x strictly north of z).

A similar argument applies to SW. It's possible if we add the constraint `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (i.e., the top of x is below the bottom of z, making x strictly south of z). But this is not guaranteed by the given x W y and y W z.

In conclusion, it can be only W, NW, or SW.

Actually, wait, let's double check NW. I claim that NW is possible if the regions satisfy certain constraints on top of the deductions we can make.

The deductions are:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (1)
* `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (2)
* `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (3)

NW requires:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (A)
* `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (B)

Constraint A is already covered by our deduction (1). Constraint B appears to contradict deduction (2) and (3) as follows:

From (2) and the natural property of regions that infy(a) <= supy(a), we have:
infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x)

From (3), we have:
supy(x) <= supy(z)

Combining, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

This establishes a chain: infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z), which means infy(z) <= supy(z). This is a natural property of regions (the bottom is always below or at the top), so it doesn't add any new information.

But for NW, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). Looking at our chain, we have infy(x) in the middle, and both infy(z) and supy(z) on the left and right respectively: infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(z).

For NW to be consistent, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts infy(x) <= supy(z) from our chain. So, NW is not a possible relation given our derived constraints.

Let's check SW similarly.

SW requires:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (A)
* `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (B)

Constraint A is already covered by our deduction (1). Constraint B appears to contradict deduction (2) and (3) as follows:

From (2), we have:
infy(z) <= infy(x)

From (3) and the natural property of regions that infy(a) <= supy(a), we have:
infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

Combining, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)

For SW to be consistent, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). But from our chain, we have infy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts. So, SW is not a possible relation given our derived constraints.

Based on this analysis, if x W y and y W z, then the only possible relation between x and z is W.

Actally wait, I'm overthinking this. Our deductions have proven that Relation(x, z) is W. Does this absolutely prevent Relation(x, z) from being NW or SW? Well, we know that if x W z, that means:
1. `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (x is to the left of z on the x-axis)
2. `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (x's bottom edge is above z's bottom edge)
3. `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (x's top edge is below z's top edge)

For a relation to be BOTH W and NW, we'd need the above 3 conditions AND `supy(z) <= infy(x)` (NW condition: x is above z on the y-axis). But conditions 2 and 3 imply that `infy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z)`, which means `infy(z) <= supy(z)` (which is trivial, as we noted) and `infy(x) <= supy(z)`. This contradicts the NW condition. So, NW is not a possibility.

Similarly, for a relation to be BOTH W and SW, we'd need the above 3 conditions AND `supy(x) <= infy(z)` (SW condition: x is below z on the y-axis). But condition 2 implies that `infy(z) <= infy(x)`, and the natural property of regions that `infy(x) <= supy(x)` means `infy(z) <= supy(x)`. This contradicts the SW condition. So, SW is not a possibility.

In conclusion, if x W y and y W z, then the only possible relation between x and z is W.

Actually, I'm still doubtful. Let's use my definitions of the relations again. NW says that supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). 

The first condition means that x is to the left of z. The second condition, supy(z) <= infy(x), means the top of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x, in other words, x is strictly above z. So NW means x is to the left and strictly above z.

Our deductions from x W y and y W z are:
* `supx(x) <= infx(z)` (consistent with NW)
* `infy(z) <= infy(x)` (means the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of x)
* `supy(x) <= supy(z)` (means the top of x is below or at the same level as the top of z)

The second and third deductions combined mean that, in terms of the y-coordinate, z completely contains or is equal to x, or z is taller than x and positioned such that z's bottom is below x's bottom and z's top is above x's top. This is inconsistent with x being strictly above z. So, NW is not a possible relation.

Similar analysis would show that SW, which means x is to the left and strictly below z, is also not a possible relation.

An important point to note: the relations NW, W, and SW are mutually exclusive. A region can't be both NW and W, or both W and SW, of another region. They represent distinctly different relative positions. Given our deductions, the relation between x and z must be W because the constraints for W have all been proven by our deduction.

To be absolutely certain, I may need to find a specific counterexample. One situation where x W y, y W z, and x NW z, if such an example exists. But given the constraints we have, and the above analysis, I should seriously doubt the existence of such a counterexample.

At any rate, I believe we have reached the end. My conclusion is W alone since the other two options are inconsistent with the W deductions.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, knowing that region x is W of region y and region y is W of region z.

Let me work through the implications:

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints, I can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), therefore supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), therefore supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

These three deduced constraints exactly match the definition of the W relation. 

Therefore, the answer is: W
