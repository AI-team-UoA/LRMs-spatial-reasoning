PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step by step.

We know:
- x is NW of y, which means that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- y is W of z, which means that supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze what we can infer from the given constraints:

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:

For x to be N of z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For x to be NW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

For x to be W of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

For x to be SW of z:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

For x to be S of z:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For x to be SE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

For x to be E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

For x to be NE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

For x to be B (bounding box) of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's check which of these relations are possible given our constraints:

From x NW y and y W z, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This constraints the possible relations to NW, W, or SW.

- For the y-coordinate, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) from x NW y. And from y W z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Wait, this doesn't give us a clear constraint on the y-relationship between x and z just yet. Let's try a different approach.

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Combining these:
- From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the west of z, so the possible relations are NW, W, or SW.

- For the y-coordinate, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y). We also know supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y W z). 

This means supy(y) ≤ min(infy(x), supy(z)). So, either infy(x) ≤ supy(z) or supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is to the north of z, and the possible relation would be NW.

If infy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is not strictly north of z. However, we still need to determine how x relates to z in the y-direction.

We also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y W z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y).

Combining these, we get infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x). This gives us infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

So, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z extends at least as far south as x)

But we still don't have a constraint on the relationship between supy(x) and supy(z), so we can't fully determine the y-relationship.

Let's revisit our known constraints and see if we missed anything:
- x is NW of y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- y is W of z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Actually, the original W definition says:
a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b),

So for y W z, we should have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Similarly, for x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

From these two, we can deduce:
- x is to the west of y, and y is to the west of z, so x is to the west of z.
- z extends at least as far south as y, and y extends at least as far south as some threshold (doesn't tell us about x's southern extent).
- z extends at least as far north as y, and x extends at least as far north as y. This doesn't tell us the direct relationship between x and z in the northern direction.

But we know supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is strictly to the west of z. 

Alright, let's be more careful with these conditions and try to reason more systematically:

From x NW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x's eastern-most point is to the west of y's western-most point)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's northern-most point is to the south of x's southern-most point)

From y W z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y's eastern-most point is to the west of z's western-most point)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's southern-most point is to the south of y's southern-most point)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's northern-most point is to the south of z's northern-most point)

Combining supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
This means x's eastern-most point is to the west of z's western-most point, so x is strictly to the west of z.

Now, for the y-coordinate relationship:
- We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's northern-most point is to the south of x's southern-most point).
- We also know supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's northern-most point is to the south of z's northern-most point).

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z). We're missing a constraint.

Let's think about this geometrically. If x is NW of y, and y is W of z, then x could be:
1. NW of z: This is possible if x is strictly north of z. For this to be true, the northern-most point of z should be to the south of the southern-most point of x. But from our constraints, we only know that y's northern-most point is to the south of x's southern-most point (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and that z's northern-most point is to the north of y's northern-most point (supy(y) ≤ supy(z)). These don't give us a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). So, x being NW of z is possible but not guaranteed.

2. W of z: This is possible if x has a part that's aligned with z in the y-direction. For this to be true, x's southern-most point should be at or below z's northern-most point (infy(x) ≤ supy(z)), and x's northern-most point should be at or above z's southern-most point (infy(z) ≤ supy(x)). We've established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), so the x-constraint for W relation is satisfied. As for the y constraints, we don't have direct relationships to check, but it's geometrically possible for x to be W of z.

3. SW of z: This is possible if x is strictly south of z. For this to be true, the southern-most point of z should be to the north of the northern-most point of x (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)). We don't have constraints to directly check this, but it's a possibility.

So, based on the constraints we've derived, and considering what's geometrically possible, the potential relations between x and z are: NW, W, or SW. However, to be more conclusive, let's draw some pictures or provide examples to confirm these.

Actually, to derive the exact relationship between x and z based on the given conditions, I think I'll try with a two-step approach:

1. First, I'll establish that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which we've already done and means that x is strictly to the west of z.

2. Next, I need to understand the relative positions of x and z in the y-coordinate. Let's analyze possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: x is NW of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)).
For this to be true, z's northern-most point should be to the south of x's southern-most point. 

Given:
- x is NW of y, which means supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- y is W of z, which means supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combining these, we get supy(y) ≤ min(infy(x), supy(z)). However, this doesn't tell us the direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z). 

Scenario 2: x is W of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)).
For this to be true, z's southern-most point should be at or below x's southern-most point, and x's northern-most point should be at or below z's northern-most point.

Given:
- x is NW of y, which means supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- y is W of z, which means infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

Combining these, we can't derive a direct constraint for infy(z) ≤ infy(x) or supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x being W of z is geometrically possible, but not mandated by the given conditions.

Scenario 3: x is SW of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).
For this to be true, x's northern-most point should be to the south of z's southern-most point.

Given:
- x is NW of y, which doesn't give us a constraint on supy(x).
- y is W of z, which means infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

We can't derive a direct constraint for supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from these.

It seems like I've only been able to conclusively establish that x is to the west of z, but the exact relation in the y-coordinate is not uniquely determined from the given constraints. Geometrically, all three possibilities (NW, W, SW) could occur.

Let me try a slightly different approach with some concrete examples:

Example 1: Let's place z as a rectangular region centered at (3,0), y as a rectangular region centered at (1,0), and x as a rectangular region centered at (-1,2).
- x is NW of y because x is to the west and north of y.
- y is W of z because y is to the west of z and they are aligned in the y-direction.
- In this case, x is NW of z.

Example 2: Let's place z as a rectangular region centered at (3,0), y as a rectangular region centered at (1,0), and x as a rectangular region centered at (-1,0).
- x is NW of y because x is to the west and north of y (slightly above).
- y is W of z because y is to the west of z and they are aligned in the y-direction.
- In this case, x is W of z.

Example 3: Let's place z as a rectangular region centered at (3,2), y as a rectangular region centered at (1,0), and x as a rectangular region centered at (-1,-2).
- x is NW of y because x is to the west and north of y (relative to each other).
- y is W of z because y is to the west of z and they are aligned in the y-direction.
- In this case, x is SW of z.

Wait, there's a confusion. When I say "x is NW of y because x is to the west and north of y," it's not accurate. x being NW of y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x). Expressing it in plain English, it means x is strictly to the west of y and strictly to the north of y.

Let me revise:

Example 1:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,0) to (4,2).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,0) to (1,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,2) to (-1,3).

With these coordinates:
- x is NW of y because the easternmost point of x (-1) is to the west of the westernmost point of y (0), and the southernmost point of x (2) is to the north of the northernmost point of y (1).
- y is W of z because the easternmost point of y (1) is to the west of the westernmost point of z (2), the southernmost point of y (0) is at or below the southernmost point of z (0), and the northernmost point of y (1) is at or below the northernmost point of z (2).
- In this case, x is NW of z because the easternmost point of x (-1) is to the west of the westernmost point of z (2), and the southernmost point of x (2) is to the north of the northernmost point of z (2).

Example 2:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,0) to (4,2).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,0) to (1,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,1) to (-1,2).

With these coordinates:
- x is NW of y because the easternmost point of x (-1) is to the west of the westernmost point of y (0), and the southernmost point of x (1) is to the north of the northernmost point of y (1).
- y is W of z because the easternmost point of y (1) is to the west of the westernmost point of z (2), the southernmost point of y (0) is at or below the southernmost point of z (0), and the northernmost point of y (1) is at or below the northernmost point of z (2).
- In this case, x is W of z because the easternmost point of x (-1) is to the west of the westernmost point of z (2), the southernmost point of x (1) is at or above the southernmost point of z (0), and the northernmost point of x (2) is at or below the northernmost point of z (2).

Example 3:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,2) to (4,4).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,0) to (1,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,0) to (-1,1).

With these coordinates:
- x is NW of y because the easternmost point of x (-1) is to the west of the westernmost point of y (0), and the southernmost point of x (0) is to the north of the northernmost point of y (1). Wait, no. This doesn't satisfy the NW condition. The southernmost point of x (0) is not to the north of the northernmost point of y (1). Let's adjust.

Example 3 (Adjusted):
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,1) to (4,3).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,0) to (1,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,-2) to (-1,-1).

With these coordinates:
- x is NW of y? No, actually, this doesn't satisfy the NW condition.

Let me restart, making sure the examples are consistent with the given directions.

Example 1:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,0) to (4,2).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,0) to (1,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,2) to (-1,3).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 1 ≤ infy(x) = 2 ✓. So, x is NW of y.
- For y W z, we check: supx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 2 ✓, infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 1 ≤ supy(z) = 2 ✓. So, y is W of z.
- For x and z, we have: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(z) = 2 ✓, and supy(z) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = 2 (they touch, but they're not fully aligned in the y-direction). Since they just touch and don't overlap, this doesn't fully satisfy the W condition. The relation is actually NW.

Actually, let me rethink. In the definition:
a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a),

If supy(b) = infy(a), that still satisfies the "≤" condition. Let me correct my previous analysis.

Example 1:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,0) to (4,2).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,0) to (1,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,2) to (-1,3).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 1 ≤ infy(x) = 2 ✓. So, x is NW of y.
- For y W z, we check: supx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 2 ✓, infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 1 ≤ supy(z) = 2 ✓. So, y is W of z.
- For x and z, we have: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(z) = 2 ✓, and supy(z) = 2 = infy(x) = 2. This satisfies the NW condition: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, x is NW of z.

Example 2:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,0) to (4,3).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,0) to (1,2).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,1) to (-1,4).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = 1 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the NW condition.

Let me revise:

Example 2:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,0) to (4,3).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,0) to (1,2).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,3) to (-1,4).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = 3 ✓. So, x is NW of y.
- For y W z, we check: supx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 2 ✓, infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 3 ✓. So, y is W of z.
- For x and z, we have: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(z) = 2 ✓, and supy(z) = 3 = infy(x) = 3. This satisfies the NW condition. So, x is NW of z.

Example 3:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,3) to (4,5).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,1) to (1,3).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,0) to (-1,2).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 3 ≤ infy(x) = 0 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the NW condition.

Let me revise:

Example 3:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,3) to (4,5).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,1) to (1,3).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,4) to (-1,6).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 3 ≤ infy(x) = 4 ✓. So, x is NW of y.
- For y W z, we check: supx(y) = 1 ≤ infx(z) = 2 ✓, infy(z) = 3 ≤ infy(y) = 1 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the W condition.

Let me try one more time to get a clear example for SW:

Example 3:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (2,3) to (4,5).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (0,0) to (1,2).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-2,-2) to (-1,1).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = -1 ≤ infx(y) = 0 ✓, and supy(y) = 2 ≤ infy(x) = -2 ✗. This doesn't satisfy the NW condition. The region x isn't to the north of y; it's to the south.

Let's take a step back and rationalize. This is getting very involved.

From the definitions:
- x NW y means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x). Essentially, x is strictly to the west and strictly to the north of y.
- y W z means supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). Essentially, y is strictly to the west of z and vertically aligned with it.

Now, the question asks for the possible relations between x and z. 

We can deduce:
- x is strictly to the west of y, and y is strictly to the west of z. Therefore, x is strictly to the west of z.
- x is strictly to the north of y, and y is vertically aligned with z. This means the southern-most point of x is to the north of the northern-most point of y, and z can have its northern-most point anywhere (including points that are north of y).

Based on the westerly relationship and considering the latitudinal relationship, x could be:
1. NW of z: This would be the case if x is strictly to the north of z.
2. W of z: This would be the case if x has a part that's vertically aligned with z.
3. SW of z: This would be the case if x is strictly to the south of z.

All three relations (NW, W, SW) are geometrically possible given the constraints. Let me try to provide a single example for each of these three cases to confirm:

Example for x NW z:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (3,0) to (4,1).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (1,0) to (2,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-1,2) to (0,3).

With these coordinates:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(x) = 2.
- y is W of z: supx(y) = 2 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0 = infy(y), and supy(y) = 1 = supy(z).
- x is NW of z: supx(x) = 0 < infx(z) = 3 and supy(z) = 1 < infy(x) = 2.

Example for x W z:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (3,1) to (4,3).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (1,1) to (2,2).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-1,1) to (0,3).

With these coordinates:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 2 < infy(x) = 1. Wait, this doesn't satisfy NW. Hmm, let's rework this.

Example for x W z (revised):
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (3,1) to (4,3).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (1,1) to (2,2).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-1,3) to (0,4).

With these coordinates:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 2 < infy(x) = 3.
- y is W of z: supx(y) = 2 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1 = infy(y), and supy(y) = 2 < supy(z) = 3.
- Is x W of z? supx(x) = 0 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1 < infy(x) = 3, but supy(x) = 4 > supy(z) = 3. So, this doesn't satisfy the W condition.

Trying again:

Example for x W z:
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (3,1) to (4,4).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (1,1) to (2,2).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-1,2) to (0,3).

With these coordinates:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 2 = infy(x) = 2. Actually, this isn't right. Let's adjust.

Example for x W z (revised again):
- Let z be a rectangular region with coordinates (3,1) to (4,4).
- Let y be a rectangular region with coordinates (1,1) to (2,2).
- Let x be a rectangular region with coordinates (-1,3) to (0,4).

With these coordinates:
- x is NW of y: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 2 < infy(x) = 3.
- y is W of z: supx(y) = 2 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1 = infy(y), and supy(y) = 2 < supy(z) = 4.
- Is x W of z? supx(x) = 0 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 1 < infy(x) = 3, and supy(x) = 4 = supy(z) = 4. This satisfies the W condition.

Hmm, but actually when I think about it, what's confusing me is whether "W" means "strictly west" or "west and possibly aligned in the y-direction". My definition says:
a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

Which means a is strictly to the west of b and they have some overlap in the y-direction: the lowest point of a is below or at the same level as the lowest point of b, and the highest point of a is below or at the same level as the highest point of b.

Before going on, I want to double check these definitions for NW, W, etc., to ensure I'm reasoning correctly.

Given a region a, the greatest lower bound of the projection of a on the x-axis (similarly in y-axis) is denoted by infx(a) (similarly infy(a)). The least upper bound or the supremum of the projection of a on the x-axis (similarly in y-axis) is denoted by supx(a) (similarly supy(a)). 

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b),
a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b),
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a),
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b),
a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a),
a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b),
a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Alright, so by the definition I quoted:
a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

This means a is to the west of b (the easternmost point of a is to the west of the westernmost point of b) and a is to the north of b (the northernmost point of b is to the south of the southernmost point of a).

Also, by the definition I quoted:
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means a is to the west of b (the easternmost point of a is to the west of the westernmost point of b), and they have some vertical overlap: the lowest point of a is above or at the same level as the lowest point of b, and the highest point of a is below or at the same level as the highest point of b.

Given that x is NW of y, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

And given that y is W of z, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's lowest point is below or at the same level as y's lowest point)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's highest point is below or at the same level as z's highest point)

Now, let's derive the relation between x and z:

From the first bullet points of each relation, we can deduce:
supx(x) <= infx(y) < supx(y) <= infx(z)
Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate relation:
- We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
- We also know infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's lowest point is below or at the same level as y's lowest point)
- And supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's highest point is below or at the same level as z's highest point)

From these, we can infer:
infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
Therefore, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
Which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).

But we can't infer a relation between supy(x) and supy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x) from the given conditions. So, x could be NW, W, or SW of z, depending on the specific y-coordinate values.

Let me provide separate examples for each possibility to clarify.

Example for x NW z:
- Let z be a rectangular region from (3,0) to (4,1).
- Let y be a rectangular region from (1,0) to (2,0.5).
- Let x be a rectangular region from (-1,1) to (0,2).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 0.5 < infy(x) = 1. So, x is NW of y.
- For y W z, we check: supx(y) = 2 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0 = infy(y), and supy(y) = 0.5 < supy(z) = 1. So, y is W of z.
- For x NW z, we check: supx(x) = 0 < infx(z) = 3 and supy(z) = 1 = infy(x) = 1. This satisfies the NW condition.

Example for x W z:
- Let z be a rectangular region from (3,0) to (4,2).
- Let y be a rectangular region from (1,0) to (2,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region from (-1,0.5) to (0,1.5).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(x) = 0.5. But this doesn't satisfy the NW condition.

Let me rework the example for x W z:

- Let z be a rectangular region from (3,0) to (4,2).
- Let y be a rectangular region from (1,0) to (2,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region from (-1,1.5) to (0,2.5).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(x) = 1.5. So, x is NW of y.
- For y W z, we check: supx(y) = 2 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0 = infy(y), and supy(y) = 1 < supy(z) = 2. So, y is W of z.
- For x W z, we check: supx(x) = 0 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0 < infy(x) = 1.5, and supy(x) = 2.5 > supy(z) = 2. This doesn't satisfy the W condition.

Let me try again for x W z:

- Let z be a rectangular region from (3,0) to (4,2).
- Let y be a rectangular region from (1,0) to (2,1).
- Let x be a rectangular region from (-1,1.5) to (0,1.8).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 1 < infy(x) = 1.5. So, x is NW of y.
- For y W z, we check: supx(y) = 2 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0 = infy(y), and supy(y) = 1 < supy(z) = 2. So, y is W of z.
- For x W z, we check: supx(x) = 0 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 0 < infy(x) = 1.5, and supy(x) = 1.8 < supy(z) = 2. This satisfies the W condition.

Example for x SW z:
- Let z be a rectangular region from (3,2) to (4,3).
- Let y be a rectangular region from (1,1) to (2,2).
- Let x be a rectangular region from (-1,0) to (0,1).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 2 > infy(x) = 0. This doesn't satisfy the NW condition.

Let me revised for x SW z:

- Let z be a rectangular region from (3,3) to (4,4).
- Let y be a rectangular region from (1,1) to (2,2).
- Let x be a rectangular region from (-1,2.5) to (0,3.5).

With these coordinates:
- For x NW y, we check: supx(x) = 0 < infx(y) = 1 and supy(y) = 2 < infy(x) = 2.5. So, x is NW of y.
- For y W z, we check: supx(y) = 2 < infx(z) = 3, infy(z) = 3 > infy(y) = 1. This doesn't satisfy the W condition.

This is challenging. Let me try one more approach.

Let's understand the positions of x, y, and z geometrically:
- x is to the west of y and to the north of y.
- y is to the west of z and has some vertical alignment with z.

I'm trying to determine the relation between x and z.

From the above, I know that x is to the west of z. But the vertical relation between x and z can be one of three cases: x is to the north of z (NW), x has some vertical alignment with z (W), or x is to the south of z (SW).

Earlier, I was able to provide an example for the x NW z and x W z cases, but I've faced challenges with the x SW z case. Let's try to understand logically if the SW relation is genuinely possible:

For x to be SW of z, x must be to the south of z, meaning supy(x) <= infy(z).

Given the constraints:
- x is NW of y, which means supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y is W of z, which means infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these:
supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y),
Therefore, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).

But for x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
Combining with the above, we'd get: supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x),
Which means supy(x) <= infy(x).

But for a rectangle, supy(x) > infy(x) (the highest point is always higher than the lowest point). So, this leads to a contradiction, and it seems that the SW relation is not geometrically possible.

This means that, based on the given conditions, x can only be either NW or W of z. Let's double-check this reasoning.

Actually, I just realized I've made an error. When working with the notation of min bounding boxes (MBBs), the constraint supy(x) <= infy(x) doesn't mean the rectangle is "collapsed" in the y-direction. It simply means the upper bound of the y-projection of x is below the lower bound of the y-projection of x, which is a constraint that can't be satisfied for a single region (unless it's a point). But that doesn't invalidate my reasoning. It still suggests that x can't be SW of z given the conditions.

Let's restate the constraints:
- x is NW of y, which means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y is W of z, which means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Let's derive the constraint on the relation between x and z:
supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(z),
Therefore, supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

For the y-coordinate:
supy(y) <= infy(x),
infy(z) <= infy(y),
Therefore, infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x),
Which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).

But, for x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). If we combine this with the constraint we derived, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(x),
Which leads to supy(x) <= infy(x).

But, for a non-empty region, supy(x) > infy(x). This contradiction means that x cannot be SW of z given the constraints.

Therefore, based on the given conditions, if x is NW of y and y is W of z, then x can be either NW or W of z.

Actually, let me be very precise so that I can be sure of my answer. 

For the x-axis relation:
- x is to the west of y, and y is to the west of z. Therefore, x is to the west of z.

For the y-axis relation:
- x is to the north of y, and y has some vertical alignment with z. This doesn't immediately tell us the vertical relation between x and z. We need to reason more.

Given that x is NW of y, we have supy(y) <= infy(x). And given that y is W of z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

If we combine these, we get:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
So, infy(z) <= infy(x).

This tells us that the bottommost point of z is below or at the same level as the bottommost point of x. But it doesn't tell us about the relation between the topmost points of x and z, which could be in any of the following relations:
1. supy(x) < infy(z): This would mean x is strictly below z, making x SW of z.
2. infy(z) <= supy(x) <= supy(z): This would mean x has some vertical alignment with z, making x W of z.
3. supy(z) < supy(x): This would still allow for some vertical alignment between x and z, making x W of z, as long as infy(z) <= supy(x).

Actually, the relation supy(x) < infy(z) (for x SW z) contradicts our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) < infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) < infy(x), which isn't possible for a proper (non-empty) rectangle. So, the SW relation is not feasible.

Now, checking the NW relation:
For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): We've already established this.
- supy(z) <= infy(x): Given infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So, from this, we can't guarantee supy(z) <= infy(x). It's possible, but not guaranteed.

For the W relation:
For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z): We've already established this.
- infy(z) <= infy(x): We've already established this.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): This isn't necessarily derived from our constraints, but it's geometrically possible.

So, based on the constraints, x can be either NW or W of z.

Actually, sorry, let me be even more careful.

From x NW y, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y W z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

From the first constraints, we can deduce supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the west of z.

Now, for the relation in the y-axis:
From supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we can't directly deduce the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

Given infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x).

Similarly, from supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we know supy(y) <= min(infy(x), supy(z)). But this doesn't definitively tell us the relation between infy(x) and supy(z). It's possible that infy(x) < supy(z) or supy(z) < infy(x).

If supy(z) < infy(x), then x would be NW of z. This is geometrically possible.

If infy(x) < supy(z), then the relation depends on the position of supy(x) relative to supy(z) and infy(z). If supy(x) <= supy(z), then x would be W of z. This is geometrically possible.

But, for x to be SW of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). However, we've derived infy(z) <= infy(x). If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x), then supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction.

Wait, I realized I may have made an error in my reasoning. Let me re-approach the problem.

From x NW y, we know that x is to the north of y. This doesn't mean the "bottommost" point of x is to the north of y. It means the "topmost" point of y is to the south of the "bottommost" point of x. In other words, supy(y) <= infy(x).

Similarly, for y W z, y has some vertical alignment with z, which means the "bottommost" point of z is at or below the "bottommost" point of y, and the "topmost" point of y is at or below the "topmost" point of z. Expressed in terms of our notation, infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Given these, we're trying to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we can deduce:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
So, infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the "bottommost" point of z is at or below the "bottommost" point of x.

For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). From the constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(x), but we can't directly infer the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x would be NW of z. This is geometrically possible but not guaranteed from our constraints.

For x to be W of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've already established) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The latter isn't constrained, so it's geometrically possible for supy(x) <= supy(z).

For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But given infy(z) <= infy(x), this would require supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction. So, x can't be SW of z.

So  the possible relations between x and z are NW and W.

Thinking about it more, let me reconsider the constraint I've been interpreting. I have:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
So, infy(z) <= infy(x).

This means the "bottommost" point of z is at or below the "bottommost" point of x. Given this, and the constraints we have, what are the possible relations between x and z?

For x to be NW of z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x). From our constraints, we can't directly determine the relation between supy(z) and infy(x). It's geometrically possible for supy(z) <= infy(x), which would make x NW of z.

For x to be W of z, we'd need infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've established) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, from our constraints, we can't directly determine the relation between supy(x) and supy(z). It's geometrically possible for supy(x) <= supy(z), which would make x W of z.

For x to be SW of z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z). But this, combined with infy(z) <= infy(x), would give supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction. So, x can't be SW of z.

Actually, I want to draw the scenarios to reason more intuitively:

Scenario 1: x is NW of z
```
    x
    |
    |
    +------ z
    y
```

Here:
- x is NW of y because it's to the west and north of y.
- y is W of z because it's to the west of z and has some vertical alignment.
- x is NW of z because it's to the west and north of z.

Scenario 2: x is W of z
```
         x
         |
    +----|--- z
    y    |
```

Here:
- x is NW of y because it's to the west and north of y.
- y is W of z because it's to the west of z and has some vertical alignment.
- x is W of z because it's to the west of z and has some vertical alignment.

We can see geometrically that both NW and W relations are possible for x and z, but not SW.

To justify even more, let's say x, y and z are single points. If x is to the NW of y, then x is on the NW quadrant from y: it is both north and west of y. If y is to the W, then y is directly to the west of z: same latitude, but westward longitude. So y is on the same horizontal level as z, but to the W of it. 

Now, if x is NW of y, and y is directly to the W of z, where is x relative to z? Clearly, x is both to the west of z, and to the north of y. Since y is on the same level as z, x must be to the north of z. So x is to the north and to the west of z, which is the NW direction.

So for that simple case, the only possible relation is NW.

But now, let's imagine x, y, and z as rectangles. If x is NW of y, it means x's region is entirely to the northwest of y: the lowest point of x is above the highest point of y, and the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of y. If y is to the W of z, then y is strictly to the left of z, and there's some vertical alignment: the lowest point of y is above or at the same level as the lowest point of z, and the highest point of y is below or at the same level as the highest point of z.

Given these, the relation between x and z would be:
- x is strictly to the west of z (because x is to the west of y, and y is to the west of z).
- The lowest point of x is above the highest point of y, and y has some vertical alignment with z. This means x can be either to the north of z (making it NW of z) or have some vertical alignment with z (making it W of z).

Given the constraints, x can be either NW or W of z. I've shown that the SW relation is not possible.

I think the answer is: x can be either NW or W of z.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what the possible cardinal direction relations could be between region x and region z, given that:
- x is NW of y
- y is W of z

Let me analyze these constraints systematically:

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is strictly west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly north of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is strictly west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Combining these constraints:

For the x-direction:
- From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- This means x is strictly west of z

For the y-direction:
- From supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), we get infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Therefore, infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- But we cannot determine a definite relationship between supy(x) and supy(z)

Given these constraints:

1. For x to be NW of z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (established) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The latter is possible but not guaranteed.

2. For x to be W of z: We need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (established), infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (established), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The latter is possible.

3. For x to be SW of z: We would need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But we've established infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(x). This is impossible for a non-empty region.

The possible relations are: NW, W
