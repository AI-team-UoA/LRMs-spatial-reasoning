PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's break down the information given:
1. Region x is E of region y, which means x E y.
2. Region y is W of region z, which means y W z.

Now I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Given that x E y, using the definition in the context:
x E y if and only if supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)

This means:
- x is to the right of y (east of y)
- There's some overlap in the y-coordinates (north-south dimension) between x and y

Given that y W z, using the definition:
y W z if and only if supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means:
- y is to the left of z (west of z)
- There's some overlap in the y-coordinates (north-south dimension) between y and z

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the information, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z)

However, this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). Similarly, we have constraints on the y-coordinates, but they don't give us a unique cardinal direction relation between x and z.

Let's consider some cases:

1. If infx(x) > infx(z) and supx(x) > supx(z), x would be to the right of z. This would give us an E relation.

2. If infx(x) > infx(z) and infy(x) > infy(z) and supx(x) > supx(z) and supy(x) > supy(z), x would be to the northeast of z. This would give us an NE relation.

3. If infx(x) > infx(z) and infy(x) < infy(z) and supx(x) > supx(z) and supy(x) < supy(z), x would be to the southeast of z. This would give us an SE relation.

4. The regions could also overlap in various ways, which would give us B (bounding box) or other complex relations.

Let me try to visualize it in a more intuitive way. I'll consider the 2D coordinate system and place the regions based on the conditions.

Given:
- x E y: x is to the right of y, with some overlap in the y-dimension.
- y W z: y is to the left of z, with some overlap in the y-dimension.

This means:
y is to the left of z, and x is to the right of y.

But the exact relationship between x and z depends on the extent of the overlap in the y-dimension and the relative positions of x and z in the x-dimension.

Actually, let's think about it in terms of the minimum bounding boxes of the regions.

From x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): The rightmost extent of y is to the left of the leftmost extent of x.
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y): There's some overlap in the y-dimension.

From y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): The rightmost extent of y is to the left of the leftmost extent of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): There's some overlap in the y-dimension.

Combining these, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z): The rightmost extent of y is to the left of both the leftmost extents of x and z.
- Some constraints on the y-dimension overlaps.

But we don't have direct information about the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or supx(x) and supx(z).

Hmm, let's approach this differently. I'll consider different possible configurations and check if they satisfy the given conditions.

For x to be E of z (i.e., x E z), we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given that supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z) and supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y), it's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), but it's not guaranteed. Additionally, the y-dimension constraints are not directly comparable, so x E z is a possibility, but not guaranteed.

Similarly, for x to be NE of z (i.e., x NE z), we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

Again, the first condition is possible but not guaranteed. The second condition depends on the specific positions of the regions, but it's not directly inferable from the given conditions.

Ok, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let's simplify and think about the physical layout.

We have: x is to the east of y, and y is to the west of z.

If I think of it as positions on a map: y is to the west of z, and x is to the east of y.

z
  \
   y
     \
      x

But the exact positioning depends on the y-coordinates (north-south positioning) as well.

Actually, since we're working with regions in a 2D plane, let's think about the minimum bounding boxes. Given the cardinal directions, we can represent the relative positions of these bounding boxes.

From the definitions, we know:
- x E y means x is to the right of y, with some overlap in the y-dimension.
- y W z means y is to the left of z, with some overlap in the y-dimension.

So, the x-coordinates follow this pattern: y is to the left of both x and z. But the relative positioning of x and z in the x-dimension is not specified.

Now, for the y-coordinates:
- x E y requires infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y), meaning the bottom of y is below or at the bottom of x, and the top of x is below or at the top of y.
- y W z requires infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), meaning the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of y, and the top of y is below or at the top of z.

These constraints on the y-coordinates don't directly tell us the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z can be determined by checking which combinations satisfy the conditions.

Let's go through the possible relations:

1. x N z (North):
   For this, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   Given the constraints, it's possible that the bottom of x is above the top of z, but not guaranteed. The x-coordinate constraints are also possible but not guaranteed.

2. x NE z (North East):
   For this, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   The first condition is possible but not guaranteed. The second condition is also possible but not guaranteed.

3. x E z (East):
   For this, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The first condition is possible but not guaranteed. The y-coordinate constraints are also possible but not guaranteed.

4. x SE z (South East):
   For this, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   The first condition is possible but not guaranteed. The second condition is also possible but not guaranteed.

5. x S z (South):
   For this, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   The first condition is possible but not guaranteed. The x-coordinate constraints are also possible but not guaranteed.

6. x SW z (South West):
   For this, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   Given that we know x is to the east of y and y is to the west of z, it's implausible for x to be to the west of z.

7. x W z (West):
   For this, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   Given that we know x is to the east of y and y is to the west of z, it's implausible for x to be to the west of z.

8. x NW z (North West):
   For this, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   Given that we know x is to the east of y and y is to the west of z, it's implausible for x to be to the west of z.

9. x B z (Bounding Box):
   For this, we need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The x-coordinate constraints are possible but not guaranteed. The y-coordinate constraints are also possible but not guaranteed.

Given these assessments, the possible relations between x and z are:
- N (North)
- NE (North East)
- E (East)
- SE (South East)
- S (South)
- B (Bounding Box)

Actually, let me try to clarify the relationships by reasoning about the physical layout of the regions.

Given the cardinal direction definitions, I know:
- x E y means x is to the right of y, with some overlap in the y-dimension.
- y W z means y is to the left of z, with some overlap in the y-dimension.

This means we have a scenario like:
z
  \
   y
     \
      x

But the exact positioning of z with respect to x in the y-dimension depends on the specific values of infy(z), supy(z), infy(x), and supy(x).

Wait a minute. Let's think about transivity. If we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (from x E y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y W z)

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or supx(x) and supx(z). So the relation between x and z could be various.

But let's think about the constraints again:
- x E y means supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y W z means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From these, we know:
- x is to the right of y, with some overlap in the y-dimension.
- y is to the left of z, with some overlap in the y-dimension.

But there's no guarantee about the relative positions of x and z in either dimension.

Let's look at a specific example. Let's say we have these bounding boxes:
- y: [0, 1] x [0, 2]
- x: [2, 3] x [1, 1.5]
- z: [3, 4] x [0, 3]

In this case, x E y and y W z, but the relation between x and z is B (Bounding Box) because x is inside z.

Now let's change the bounding box of z to [3, 4] x [3, 4]. In this case, the relation between x and z is NW (North West) because x is to the north-west of z.

Hmm, wait a minute. That doesn't seem right. Given that z is to the east of y and x is also to the east of y, it's not clear how x can be to the west of z.

Let's try to formalize it. The x-coordinates (east-west dimension) have an ordering: y, then possibly x and z (in some order). The y-coordinates (north-south dimension) can have various orderings.

Actually, let's try to approach it more systematically. Given:
- x E y, which means supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y W z, which means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

I know:
- The rightmost extent of y is to the left of the leftmost extent of x.
- The rightmost extent of y is to the left of the leftmost extent of z.
- The bottom of y is below or at the bottom of x, and the top of x is below or at the top of y.
- The bottom of z is below or at the bottom of y, and the top of y is below or at the top of z.

With these constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Let's try to establish the orderings of the x-coordinates (east-west dimension):
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(y) <= infx(z)

From this, we can say: supx(y) <= min(infx(x), infx(z)), but there's no direct ordering between infx(x) and infx(z) or between supx(x) and supx(z).

For the y-coordinates (north-south dimension):
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

From this, we can say: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which gives us infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, let's check the conditions for each relation between x and z:

1. x N z (North):
   Conditions: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   We know supy(x) <= supy(z), but we don't have a direct comparison between supy(z) and infy(x). Also, we don't have direct comparisons for the x-coordinates.

2. x NE z (North East):
   Conditions: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We don't have direct comparisons for these conditions.

3. x E z (East):
   Conditions: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but we don't have a direct comparison between supx(z) and infx(x).

4. x SE z (South East):
   Conditions: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We know supy(x) <= supy(z), but we don't have a direct comparison between supy(x) and infy(z). Also, we don't have a direct comparison between supx(z) and infx(x).

5. x S z (South):
   Conditions: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   We know supy(x) <= supy(z), but we don't have a direct comparison between supy(x) and infy(z). Also, we don't have direct comparisons for the x-coordinates.

6. x SW z (South West):
   Conditions: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We know supy(x) <= supy(z), but we don't have a direct comparison between supy(x) and infy(z). Also, we don't have a direct comparison between supx(x) and infx(z).

7. x W z (West):
   Conditions: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but we don't have a direct comparison between supx(x) and infx(z).

8. x NW z (North West):
   Conditions: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We know supy(x) <= supy(z), which is the opposite of what we need for the second condition, so this relation is not possible.

9. x B z (Bounding Box):
   Conditions: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but we don't have direct comparisons for the x-coordinates.

Based on the derived orderings of the y-coordinates: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), and the lack of direct orderings for the x-coordinates, it seems like the possible relations between x and z are:
- E (East)
- W (West)
- B (Bounding Box)

But this doesn't seem right. Let's re-examine.

Actually, I'm making a mistake. The condition for x NW z is: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We know infy(z) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x) is unlikely (it would mean z is entirely below x in the y-dimension). But we don't have a direct comparison between supx(x) and infx(z).

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's go back to the basics:
- x E y means x is completely to the right of y, and their projections on the y-axis have a non-empty intersection.
- y W z means y is completely to the left of z, and their projections on the y-axis have a non-empty intersection.

Given these, x, y, and z are arranged in a way that y is to the left of both x and z, and there's some overlap in the y-projections of y with both x and z. But the relative positions of x and z in both dimensions can vary.

I feel like I'm going around in circles a bit here. Let's take a step back and think about what happens when region y is both W of z and E of x. Does that constrain the possible relations between x and z? Actually let's reverse the problem. I think that might make it clearer.

So we want to know what we can deduce about the possible relations between x and z given that:
- x E y (x is to the east of y)
- y W z (y is to the west of z)

Actually, in cardinal directions, the reference region is the second one. So x E y means y is the reference and x is to the east of y. Similarly, y W z means z is the reference and y is to the west of z.

So, the E relation means: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
And the W relation means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Given these constraints, the direct relations we can deduce between x and z are:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This tells us that the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of x, and the top of x is below or at the top of z, i.e., z extends below and above x in the y-dimension.

However, for the x-dimension, we know:
supx(y) <= infx(x)
supx(y) <= infx(z)

This only tells us that y is to the left of both x and z, but doesn't give us a direct relation between x and z in the x-dimension.

Let's check the specific conditions for each relation:

x B z (Bounding Box): 
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
The y-coordinate conditions are satisfied, and the x-coordinate conditions could be satisfied depending on the specific values. So, B is a possibility.

x N z (North): 
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
We know supy(x) <= supy(z), but this is the opposite of what's needed for the first condition. So, N is not possible.

x NE z (North East): 
supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
We know supy(x) <= supy(z), which is the opposite of what's needed for the second condition. So, NE is not possible.

x E z (East): 
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
The y-coordinate conditions are satisfied, but the x-coordinate condition depends on the specific values. So, E is a possibility.

x SE z (South East): 
supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(x), which is the opposite of what's needed for the second condition. So, SE is not possible.

x S z (South): 
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(x), which is the opposite of what's needed for the first condition. So, S is not possible.

x SW z (South West): 
supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(x), which is the opposite of what's needed for the second condition. So, SW is not possible.

x W z (West): 
supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
The y-coordinate conditions are satisfied, but the x-coordinate condition depends on the specific values. So, W is a possibility.

x NW z (North West): 
supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
We know supy(x) <= supy(z), which is the opposite of what's needed for the second condition. So, NW is not possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are B, E, and W.

Wait, I think I'm forgetting that we should be considering multi-tile relations as well. But actually in the context the cardinal direction relations defined are the traditional 9 relations. So I'm good.

But let me double check the specific conditions. My concern is that I'm overlooking something or making a mistake.

The single-tile cardinal direction relation B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, and SE are defined as follows:

- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b): a is inside the bounding box of b.

- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b): a is to the south of b, and its x-projection is within the x-projection of b.

- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b): a is to the southwest of b.

- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b): a is to the west of b, and its y-projection is within the y-projection of b.

- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a): a is to the northwest of b.

- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b): a is to the north of b, and its x-projection is within the x-projection of b.

- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a): a is to the northeast of b.

- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b): a is to the east of b, and its y-projection is within the y-projection of b.

- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b): a is to the southeast of b.

Given these definitions:

x E y means: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
y W z means: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

But wait, I'll check the context again. I think I always interchange the reference. Let me make sure we use the same convention. Actually I'm using the convention as defined in the context.

OK, now let's derive the possible relations between x and z.

x B z (Bounding Box): 
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
The y-coordinate conditions are satisfied, but the x-coordinate conditions depend on the specific values. So, B is a possibility.

x N z (North): 
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't guarantee supy(z) <= infy(x). For that, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), which isn't implied. So, N is a possibility, but not guaranteed.

Actually, wait a sec. Let's think about what it means. For x to be north of z, the top of z must be below the bottom of x. But we know the bottom of z is below the bottom of x and the top of x is below the top of z. This means the bottom of z is below the bottom of x, and the top of z is above the top of x. This arrangement doesn't allow for the top of z to be below the bottom of x, which is needed for x to be north of z. So, N is not a possibility.

x NE z (North East): 
supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) (since supy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(x) <= supy(x), which would mean infy(x) <= supy(z), not supy(z) <= infy(x)). So, NE is not a possibility.

x E z (East): 
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
The y-coordinate conditions are satisfied, but the x-coordinate condition depends on the specific values. So, E is a possibility.

x SE z (South East): 
supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (since infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x), which would mean infy(z) <= supy(x), not supy(x) <= infy(z)). So, SE is not a possibility.

x S z (South): 
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (since infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x), which would mean infy(z) <= supy(x), not supy(x) <= infy(z)). So, S is not a possibility.

x SW z (South West): 
supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). Additionally, we also know supx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(y) <= infx(z), but this doesn't directly tell us about the relation between supx(x) and infx(z). So, the first condition could be satisfied, but the second condition is not. Thus, SW is not a possibility.

x W z (West): 
supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
The y-coordinate conditions are satisfied, but the x-coordinate condition depends on the specific values. So, W is a possibility.

x NW z (North West): 
supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
We know supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, NW is not a possibility.

No, I think I'm getting confused. Actually, the constraint "infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)" is wrong. I'm concatenating y-constraints from x E y and y W z. Let's break it down:

x E y gives us: supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
y W z gives us: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From the first set, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
From the second set, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Combining these, we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z).

Now, can x be north of z? For x to be north of z (x N z), we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But we've established that supy(x) <= supy(z), meaning the top of x is below or at the top of z. This contradicts the requirement for x to be north of z, which would need the bottom of x to be above the top of z. So, x cannot be north of z.

Actually, based on the reasoning above, I think I'm right.

Let's go through all relations again and check if they are possible:

x B z (Bounding Box): 
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-coordinate conditions are satisfied. The x-coordinate conditions depend on the specific values. So, B is a possibility.

x N z (North): 
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
We've established that supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be north of z. So, N is not a possibility.

x NE z (North East): 
supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
We've established that supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be northeast of z. So, NE is not a possibility.

x E z (East): 
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-coordinate conditions are satisfied. The x-coordinate condition depends on the specific values. So, E is a possibility.

x SE z (South East): 
supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
We've established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x) (since x is a region), which gives infy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be southeast of z. So, SE is not a possibility.

x S z (South): 
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
We've established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x) (since x is a region), which gives infy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be south of z. So, S is not a possibility.

x SW z (South West): 
supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
We've established that infy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) <= supy(x) (since x is a region), which gives infy(z) <= supy(x). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z) for x to be southwest of z. So, SW is not a possibility.

x W z (West): 
supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
We know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so the y-coordinate conditions are satisfied. The x-coordinate condition depends on the specific values. So, W is a possibility.

x NW z (North West): 
supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
We've established that supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) for x to be northwest of z. So, NW is not a possibility.

Actually, I'm realizing that I was making a mistake. I think i have the right constraints, and I'm looking at the E, N, NE etc. definitions correctly. Let me continue my analysis:

OK, let me break this down:
1. x E y means x is to the east of y, with their y-projections having a non-empty intersection. That is x is completely to the right of y. But since they are only related in the east-west dimension, x could be aligned with y in the north-south dimension.
2. y W z means y is to the west of z, with their y-projections having a non-empty intersection. That is y is completely to the left of z. But since they are only related in the east-west dimension, y could be aligned with z in the north-south dimension.

Let's think about specific x-coordinates (east-west dimension) values:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)

There's no direct relationship established between the x-coordinates of x and z. So depending on specific values, x could be to the right, left, or aligned with z in the east-west dimension.

Now for the y-coordinates (north-south dimension):
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (y-projection of x is within the y-projection of y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y-projection of y is within the y-projection of z)

Combining these:
infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of y, which is below or at the bottom of x)
supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (the top of x is below or at the top of y, which is below or at the top of z)

This means the y-projection of x is within the y-projection of z, so there's a vertical alignment between x and z.

Given these constraints, let's go through the relations again:

1. x B z (Bounding Box): 
   infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The y-coordinate conditions are satisfied. The x-coordinate conditions depend on the specific values. So, B is a possibility.

2. x N z (North): 
   supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   We've established that supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) (since x is a region with infy(x) <= supy(x)). So, N is not a possibility.

3. x NE z (North East): 
   supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   The supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint. So, NE is not a possibility.

4. x E z (East): 
   supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The y-coordinate conditions are satisfied. The x-coordinate condition depends on the specific values. So, E is a possibility.

5. x SE z (South East): 
   supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   The supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x) (since x is a region with infy(x) <= supy(x)). So, SE is not a possibility.

6. x S z (South): 
   supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   The supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our derived constraint. So, S is not a possibility.

7. x SW z (South West): 
   supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   The supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our derived constraint. So, SW is not a possibility.

8. x W z (West): 
   supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The y-coordinate conditions are satisfied. The x-coordinate condition depends on the specific values. So, W is a possibility.

9. x NW z (North West): 
   supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   The supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint. So, NW is not a possibility.

So, the possible relations between x and z are B (Bounding Box), E (East), and W (West).

Actually, let me just double check one more time to be confident in the answer.

Given constraints from x E y and y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(x), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

I derived:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, the conditions for each relation between x and z are:

1. B (Bounding Box): 
   infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   The y-coordinate conditions match our derived constraints, so B is possible if the x-coordinate conditions are met.

2. N (North): 
   supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint supy(x) <= supy(z), as it would require the bottom of x to be above the top of z, which isn't the case. So, N is not possible.

3. NE (North East): 
   supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint. So, NE is not possible.

4. E (East): 
   supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   All y-coordinate conditions match our derived constraints, so E is possible if the x-coordinate condition is met.

5. SE (South East): 
   supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) would require the top of x to be below the bottom of z, which contradicts our derived constraint infy(z) <= infy(x). So, SE is not possible.

6. S (South): 
   supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our derived constraint. So, S is not possible.

7. SW (South West): 
   supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)
   The condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts our derived constraint. So, SW is not possible.

8. W (West): 
   supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
   All y-coordinate conditions match our derived constraints, so W is possible if the x-coordinate condition is met.

9. NW (North West): 
   supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(z) <= infy(x)
   The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) contradicts our derived constraint. So, NW is not possible.

Based on this analysis, the possible relations between x and z are B, E, and W.

Actually, hang on. Given that we have regions in the plane, and cardinal directions are defined, I think there's another way to see this.

When we say x is E of region y, and y is W of region z, we can reason about the possible arrangements.

We know x and z are both aligned with y in the north-south dimension (vertically). So x and z are constrained in the north-south dimension to have some overlap (due to the overlap with y). But in the east-west dimension (horizontally), there's no constraint. 

So x could be to the east of z (E), to the west of z (W), or inside the bounding box of z (B), depending on the specifics of the scenario. 

To visualize:
1. x E z: 
```
   z x
```

2. x W z: 
```
   x z
```

3. x B z: 
```
   z
   |
   x
```

This is consistent with our more detailed analysis, and the possible relations are B, E, and W.

Actually wait, B z means x is inside the bounding box of z, and from the definitions, the x- and y-coordinate conditions for this are:
infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

So for the relation B to hold, we need both the x and y projections of x to be within the respective projections of z. We've established that the y-projection of x is within the y-projection of z, but the x-projection depends on the specific scenario.

1. x E z: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
2. x W z: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
3. x B z: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)

To be honest, I don't think E and W can both be possible simultaneously for the same scenario, because they require opposite constraints on the x-coordinates. But if I refer to the "possible relations" as all the possible relations that could hold in some scenario, then I've established that any of B, E, or W could hold in certain configurations of x, y, and z.

Therefore, the possible relations (across all possible x and z) are B, E, and W.

But to be extra sure, I'm going to construct an example for E, W, and B to confirm. Let's consider the coordinates [minX, maxX] x [minY, maxY] for the bounding boxes of the regions:

For x W z:
- y: [1, 2] x [1, 4]
- x: [3, 4] x [2, 3]
- z: [5, 6] x [0, 5]

Checking constraints:
- x E y: supx(y) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3, infy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 4. 
- y W z: supx(y) = 2 <= infx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5.
- x W z: supx(x) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 5.

So, x W z is indeed a possible relation.

For x E z:
- y: [3, 4] x [1, 4]
- x: [5, 6] x [2, 3]
- z: [1, 2] x [0, 5]

Checking constraints:
- x E y: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 5, infy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 4.
- y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 1. This doesn't hold! The constraint for y W z requires supx(y) <= infx(z), but 4 is not less than or equal to 1.

Actually I'm getting confused with the reference regions. The W relation is not supx(y) <= infx(z). The correct condition for y W z is: supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z). But in this case z is the reference region, so the condtion is really: supx(y) <= infx(z).

Let me try this again. 

For x E z:
- y: [3, 4] x [1, 4]
- z: [5, 6] x [0, 5]
- x: [7, 8] x [2, 3]

Checking constraints:
- x E y: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 7, infy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 4.
- y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5.
- x E z: supx(z) = 6 <= infx(x) = 7, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 5.

So, x E z is also a possible relation.

For x B z:
- y: [3, 4] x [1, 4]
- z: [1, 6] x [0, 5]
- x: [4, 5] x [2, 3]

Checking constraints:
- x E y: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 4. This doesn't hold! The constraint requires supx(y) to be strictly less than infx(x).

Let me reconsider the coordinates for x to ensure it's to the east of y.

For x B z:
- y: [3, 4] x [1, 4]
- z: [1, 6] x [0, 5]
- x: [5, 6] x [2, 3]

Checking constraints:
- x E y: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 5, infy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 4.
- y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 1. This doesn't hold! (Ignoring for now).

Let me reconsider the coordinates for z to ensure y is to the west of z.

For x B z:
- y: [3, 4] x [1, 4]
- z: [6, 8] x [0, 5]
- x: [7, 7.5] x [2, 3]

Checking constraints:
- x E y: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(x) = 7, infy(y) = 1 <= infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3 <= supy(y) = 4.
- y W z: supx(y) = 4 <= infx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 4 <= supy(z) = 5.
- x B z: infx(z) = 6 <= infx(x) = 7, supx(x) = 7.5 <= supx(z) = 8, infy(z) = 0 <= infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3 <= supy(z) = 5.

So, x B z is also a possible relation.

Thus after checking all three, the possible relations indeed are B, E, and W.

Let me do one final check. z B x means z is inside the bounds of x. But in our scenario, we established infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which means the bottom of z is below or at the bottom of x, and the top of z is above or at the top of x. For z to be inside the bounds of x, we would need infy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= supy(x), which is the opposite of what we derived. So, z B x is not possible.

Similarly, for z E x and z W x, I've already shown with the examples that x E z, x B z, and x W z are all possible. Given our constraints, z E x and z W x can also be deduced to be possible in specific scenarios.

Actually, I'm not going to check too many more cases to use up thinking space. I strongly belief that the answer is: B, E, and W.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is W of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

From the definitions:
- x E y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y W z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

By combining these constraints, I can derive:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means the y-projection of x is contained within the y-projection of z.

For the x-coordinates, we know y is to the left of both x and z, but we don't have a direct constraint between x and z.

Analyzing all possible relations:
- B: Possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- E: Possible if supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- W: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- N, NE, NW: Not possible (requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x), contradicting our constraint)
- S, SE, SW: Not possible (requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), contradicting our constraint)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: B, E, W
