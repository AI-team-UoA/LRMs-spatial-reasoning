PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step using the definitions from the problem statement.

First, let's understand what we know:
1. Region x is S of region y.
2. Region y is W of region z.

Let's recall the definitions:
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

Applying these:
1. x S y means: 
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or aligned with y's left edge)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or aligned with y's right edge)

2. y W z means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) (y's bottom edge is below or aligned with z's bottom edge)
   - supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top edge is below or aligned with z's top edge)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

From (1), we know supy(x) <= infy(y), which means that x is below y.
From (2), we know infy(z) <= infy(y), which means that z's bottom edge is below or aligned with y's bottom edge.

This doesn't give us a definitive relationship between infy(x) and infy(z) or supy(x) and supy(z). We can't be sure if x is below z, above z, or partially overlapping with z in the vertical direction.

From (1), we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
From (2), we know supx(y) <= infx(z), which means y is to the left of z.

Combining these, we get supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

So, x is to the left of z. But the vertical relationship is not completely determined.

Now, let's consider all the possible relationships given that x is to the left of z:
- If x is below z, then x is SW of z.
- If x is aligned with z vertically, then x is W of z.
- If x is above z, then x is NW of z.

However, we need to check if any of these are actually ruled out by the given constraints.

From (1), we know supy(x) <= infy(y), which means x is below y.
From (2), we know infy(z) <= infy(y), which means z's bottom edge is below or aligned with y's bottom edge.

This means that infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(x) <= infy(y).

OK, so this gives us a chain of inequalities: supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).

But this still doesn't give us a definitive relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). If infy(z) < infy(y), then it's possible that supy(x) < infy(z) (meaning x is below z) OR infy(z) <= supy(x) (meaning x and z overlap vertically).

To recap, based on the given constraints, we've determined that x is to the left of z. Additionally:
- If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is SW of z.
- If infy(z) <= supy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), and infy(z) <= infy(x), then x is W of z.
- If supy(z) < supy(x), then x is partially to the left and partially overlapping with z vertically.

Actually, I need to check if NW is possible. For x to be NW of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z).

We've already established that supx(x) <= infx(z).

For supy(z) <= infy(x):
From (1), we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
From (2), we know supy(y) <= supy(z).

If x's bottom edge is above z's top edge, we'd have supy(z) <= infy(x). But from (1), we have supy(x) <= infy(y). For both to be true, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y). But then, supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y), which implies supy(z) < infy(y). This contradicts the constraint from (2) that supy(y) <= supy(z), which, combined with the fact that infy(y) < supy(y) (since y is a region), gives us infy(y) < supy(z).

So, it's not possible for x to be NW of z.

Let's re-evaluate the possible relations between x and z.

1. x SW z: This means supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). We've already established that supx(x) <= infx(z). For supy(x) <= infy(z), given the constraints, it's a valid possibility.

2. x W z: This means infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z), and supx(x) <= infx(z). We've already established that supx(x) <= infx(z). The vertical constraints are also valid possibilities within our given constraints.

3. x S z: This means supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We've established supx(x) <= infx(z), which implies supx(x) <= supx(z). But for x to be strictly S of z, we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x). However, given supx(x) <= infx(z), for infx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(x), which is a contradiction for a region (since for any region a, infx(a) < supx(a)). So, x cannot be S of z.

I think I made a mistake. Let me reconsider the constraints more carefully.

x S y means:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

y W z means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

I need to first determine the location of x relative to both y and z. I can use the constraints to infer where x is located.

First, I'll establish the x-coordinates:
- From "x S y", I know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). So, x's x-range is within y's x-range or at most extends to y's boundaries.
- From "y W z", I know supx(y) <= infx(z). So, y is completely to the left of z.
Combining these, I can say that x's x-range doesn't overlap with z's x-range, and x is to the left of z. Specifically, supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z).

Now, I'll establish the y-coordinates:
- From "x S y", I know supy(x) <= infy(y). So, x is below y.
- From "y W z", I know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This suggests that z's y-range extends both below and above y's y-range.

In conclusion, I know that x is to the left of z, but I don't have a clear constraint on the vertical relationship between x and z.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
1. SW: If x is below z. This is true if supy(x) <= infy(z).
2. W: If x is vertically aligned with z. This is true if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). Given the constraints, this is a possibility.
3. NW: If x is above z. This is true if supy(z) <= infy(x).

But I'd like to double check if NW is truly possible. From "x S y", I know that supy(x) <= infy(y). From "y W z", I know that infy(z) <= infy(y).

Hmm, actually I think "supy(z) <= infy(x)" is not possible due to the given constraints.

I know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

If "supy(z) <= infy(x)" was true, then I'd have supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y). This implies supy(z) < infy(y). But I also know that supy(y) <= supy(z), which means infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z). These are contradictons; I can't have both infy(y) < supy(z) and supy(z) < infy(y).

To check SW, I need to verify if supy(x) <= infy(z) is a possible scenario given the constraints. From the constraints, I know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This doesn't immediately tell us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). Both supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) < supy(x) are possible.

For W, I need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) can both be satisfied given the constraints. From the constraints, I know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This means that supy(x) and infy(z) are both <= infy(y), but their relationship to each other is not specified. I also know supy(y) <= supy(z), but this doesn't relate to supy(x) or infy(x). So, W is also a possible relation.

So, based on the given constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are SW and W. Specifically, if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is SW of z. Otherwise, if infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= supy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is W of z.

Actually, there's a third possibility. If x and z are positioned in such a way that x is to the left of z and there's a vertical overlap, but x doesn't satisfy the criteria for W (i.e., it's not fully within the vertical range of z), then the relation would be a combo, such as SW:W. But the question is asking for the basic cardinal directions, so I'll stick with SW and W.

Actually actually, I need to be more careful. I've been assuming a simplistic model where "a SW b" means that the entirety of a is to the southwest of b. However, as per the definitions provided, the criteria for single-tile cardinal directions are:

a SW b means supx(a) <= infx(b) AND supy(a) <= infy(b).

This means that a is entirely to the left and entirely below b. However, the regions can be complex shapes, and a can have parts of it that are to the southwest, parts to the west, etc., as long as the entire region a is in the union of these directions. But I think the directions SW, W, etc. are meant to be exclusive (i.e., can't have part of a in SW and part in W). So, let me be clear on the exact definitions.

Actually, I need to go back to the problem statement. In the statement, the cardinal direction relation is defined as a set of single-tile relations, where each region a_i is in the corresponding basic direction R_i, and the region a (which is the union of all a_i) is also required to be in REG. If each a_i is the part of the region a that falls into the corresponding direction, then the cardinal direction is multi-basic relations.

Given this, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z, given that x is S of y and y is W of z.

We determined that x is to the left of z (supx(x) <= infx(z)). The vertical relationship is not fully constrained. This means x could be SW, W, or NW of z, or some combination of these.

Actually, let's double check if NW is possible:

For NW, I need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z).

I know that supy(x) <= infy(y) from "x S y" and supy(y) <= supy(z) from "y W z". Since x is a region, infy(x) < supy(x). 

The constraints give us: infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z). So, infy(x) < supy(z), which contradicts the requirement for NW. 

OK so NW itself is not a possibility.

For W, I need infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z), and supx(x) <= infx(z).

I know that supy(x) <= infy(y) from "x S y", which means x is below y. From "y W z", I know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means that z's vertical range contains y's vertical range.

Since x is below y and z extends below y, it's possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y) < supy(y) <= supy(z). So, W is a possible relation.

For SW, I need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z).

I know that supy(x) <= infy(y) from "x S y" and infy(z) <= infy(y) from "y W z". This doesn't give a clear constraint on the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

If we have infy(z) = infy(y), then supy(x) <= infy(z) and x would be SW of z. But if infy(z) < infy(y), there's no constraint that guarantees supy(x) <= infy(z). So, SW is a possible relation only under certain conditions.

For S, I need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

I know that supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z). This contradicts the requirement infx(z) <= infx(x) for S. So, S is not a possible relation. I should also check if SE is possible.

For SE, I need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x).

Since I've determined that supx(x) <= infx(z), I know that infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(z) < supx(z). This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for SE. So, SE is not a possible relation.

Similarly, for E, NE, N, and B, I can check if they're possible given the constraints. But they would all include the constraint that x is to the right of or aligned with z, which contradicts our finding that x is to the left of z. So, none of these are possible.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are W and SW, depending on the exact locations of the regions.

Actually, let me double-check all the possible relations to be sure:

From the constraints, I determined:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends below y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends above y)

For B, I need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But I've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, B is not possible.

For S, I need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But I've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, S is not possible.

For SW, I need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). I've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), but the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) is not fully constrained. It's possible for supy(x) <= infy(z), thus making SW a possible relation.

For W, I need infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z), and supx(x) <= infx(z). I've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), and it's possible for infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). So, W is a possible relation.

For NW, I need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z). I've established that supx(x) <= infx(z). But from the constraints, I know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means supy(x) <= supy(z), which, combined with the fact that infy(x) < supy(x) (since x is a region), gives us infy(x) < supy(z). This contradicts the requirement for NW. So, NW is not possible.

For N, I need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But, as shown above, infy(x) < supy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z) contradict the requirements for N. So, N is not possible.

For NE, I need supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x). As shown above, infy(x) < supy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z) contradict the requirements for NE. So, NE is not possible.

For E, I need infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z), and supx(z) <= infx(x). But I've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), which, combined with the fact that infx(z) < supx(z) (since z is a region), gives us supx(x) < supx(z). And since infx(x) < supx(x) (since x is a region), we have infx(x) < supx(z). This contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) for E. So, E is not possible.

For SE, I need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(z) <= infx(x). But, as shown for E, infx(x) < supx(z), which contradicts the requirement for SE. So, SE is not possible.

Actually, I'm not sure the constraints guarantee that supy(x) <= supy(z). From the constraints, I know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So we do have supy(x) <= supy(z). This is used when I was confirming W is a possibility. Let me double check the relation "x is W of z"

For W, I need infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z), and supx(x) <= infx(z).

I know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z extends below y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends above y)
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

For W, I need infy(z) <= infy(x). But from the constraints, I have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y). This doesn't guarantee infy(z) <= infy(x). In fact, it's possible for infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(x) < infy(z) (which would mean W is not a possible relation).

Similarly, for SW, I need supy(x) <= infy(z). From the constraints, I have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). If infy(z) < infy(y), there's no guarantee that supy(x) <= infy(z). But if infy(z) = infy(y), then I'd have supy(x) <= infy(z), making SW a possible relation.

Also, for W, while I've confirmed that supy(x) <= supy(z), the criteria for W also requires infy(z) <= infy(x). But from the constraints, I have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y). These don't directly give me a constraint on infy(x) relative to infy(z).

So there seems to be three cases

1. infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z). This is consistent with the original relation. In this case, x would be simultaneously W of z and SW of z, which doesn't quite align with the definitions of the single-tile cardinal directions. But the multi-tile relation would be W:SW.

2. infy(z) <= infy(x) AND infy(z) < supy(x). In this case, the relation is W.

3. infy(x) < infy(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z). In this case, the relation is SW.

Now, actually, case 1 is not possible, because it has both supy(x) <= infy(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x). But since x is a region, we'd have infy(x) < supy(x), and combining with infy(z) <= infy(x), we'd get infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x). This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).

So I'm left with cases 2 and 3.

2. infy(z) <= infy(x) AND infy(z) < supy(x). In this case, the relation is W.
3. infy(x) < infy(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z). In this case, the relation is SW.

Let's evaluate if both these cases are possible:

Case 2: I need to check if infy(z) <= infy(x) AND infy(z) < supy(x) can be satisfied given the constraints. From the constraints, I have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y). If infy(z) = infy(y), then I'd have infy(z) = infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y) = infy(z), contradicting infy(z) < supy(x). So for case 2, I need infy(z) < infy(y).

Now the question is, can I satisfy infy(z) <= infy(x) with the given constraints? From "x S y", I know supy(x) <= infy(y), but there's no direct constraint on infy(x) relative to infy(y). 

Let's see. As we've repeatedly established, regions x, y, and z are all in REG, which means they are non-empty. A region a in REG has a non-empty interior. This means infx(a) < supx(a) and infy(a) < supy(a). 

So, for x, we have infy(x) < supy(x).

For the three regions, we have known the following constraints:
- infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)

For case 2, we need infy(z) <= infy(x), which would give us infy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y). But this doesn't contradict any of our constraints. So, case 2 is possible.

Case 3: I need to check if infy(x) < infy(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z) can be satisfied. From the constraints, I have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y).

For infy(x) < infy(z), combined with infy(z) <= infy(y), I'd have infy(x) < infy(z) <= infy(y). This is consistent with our known constraint infy(x) < supy(x) <= infy(y).

For supy(x) <= infy(z), combined with infy(z) <= infy(y), I'd have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= infy(y). This is consistent with our known constraint supy(x) <= infy(y).

So, case 3 is also possible.

In the context of the original question, we were asked about the possible relations between x and z. My analysis has led me to the conclusion that both W and SW are possible, depending on the exact positions of the regions under the given constraints.

Let me review once more:

Given the original constraints along with the meaning and requirements of single-tile cardinal relations, I find that:

1. SW (southwest): For x to be SW of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). I've established that supx(x) <= infx(z) and shown that supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible under the given constraints. So, SW is a possible relation.

2. W (west): For x to be W of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z), and supx(x) <= infx(z). I've established that supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= supy(z) and shown that infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible under the given constraints. So, W is a possible relation.

None of the other single-tile cardinal relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, NW, B) are possible given the constraints.

Let me double check for any other possibilities:

For region x to have a multi-tile relation with z, there would be parts of x in different direction tiles relative to z. Let's check the possibilities:

1. Can x be partially in SW and partially in W? For that, a part of x would need to be in SW, i.e., have y-coordinates all below infy(z), and another part would need to be in W, i.e., have y-coordinates such that infy(z) <= y <= supy(z). Given the constraints, especially that supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), this is possible if infy(z) < infy(y) and part of x is above infy(z) and part is below. So, SW:W is a possible multi-tile relation.

2. Can x be partially in W and partially in NW? For that, a part of x would need to be in W, and another part would need to be in NW, i.e., have y-coordinates all above supy(z). But I've established that supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means all of x is below supy(z). So, W:NW is not a possible multi-tile relation.

3. Can x be partially in SW and partially in S? For that, a part of x would need to be in SW, and another part would need to be in S, i.e., have x-coordinates such that infx(z) <= x <= supx(z). But I've established that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means all of x is to the left of infx(z). So, SW:S is not a possible multi-tile relation.

4. Similarly, other combined relations (like SW:NW, S:SE, etc.) can be ruled out based on the established constraints.

OK, using the above constraints:
* SW is possible.
* W is possibe.
* SW:W is also possible, where part of x is SW z and part of x is W z.

But actually I realized something: from "x S y" we have that supy(x) <= infy(y), which means that x must be strictly below y. But from "y W z", we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means that z can vertically overlap with y, and possibly extend both above and below it. But we're not guaranteed that infy(z) < infy(y) or that supy(y) < supy(z). It's possible that infy(z) = infy(y) and/or supy(y) = supy(z). If infy(z) = infy(y), then combined with supy(x) <= infy(y), we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is SW of z. If infy(z) < infy(y), then supy(x) <= infy(y) doesn't necessarily imply supy(x) <= infy(z), allowing for the possibility of x to be W of z (or partly in SW and partly in W, resulting in the multibasic relation SW:W). So I'm sticking with my original conclusion.

However, I'd like to check that SW:W is a meaningful basic relation.

From the problem statement, a cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where:
i) 1 <= k <= 9
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}
iii) Ri != Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i != j
iv) There are regions a1, ..., ak in REG, where a1 in R1(b), ..., ak in Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak in REG for any reference region b in REG.

SW:W is a cardinal direction relation where a part of x is in SW(z) and another part is in W(z), assuming both parts and their union are in REG.

So, I really do have three possibilities: SW, W, and SW:W.

Let me verify again if the four criteria for a cardinal direction relation are satisfied for SW:W:

i) k = 2, which is between 1 and 9. Satisfied.
ii) "SW" and "W" are both in the set {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}. Satisfied.
iii) "SW" != "W". Satisfied.
iv) There could be regions a1 and a2 in REG, where a1 in SW(b) and a2 in W(b), and a1 union a2 in REG. This is a valid scenario for some regions. Satisfied.

So, SW:W is a valid cardinal direction relation.

Actually, let me reconsider this whole problem, keeping in mind the precise definition of a cardinal direction relation. From the problem statement, we are asked about the "possible relations between region x and region z."

Given the setup (x S y, y W z), I need to determine which of the cardinal direction relations (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) or combinations thereof are possible for the relation from x to z.

First, let's understand the constraints more clearly:

For x S y:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or aligned with y's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or aligned with y's right edge)

For y W z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom edge is below or aligned with y's bottom edge)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top edge is below or aligned with z's top edge)

Combining these:
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (x is below y and z extends below or aligned with y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (z extends above or aligned with y)

I've established that x is definitely to the left of z and can be below z (SW) or have some vertical overlap with z (W), depending on the specific positions. It's also possible for a part of x to be in SW and a part to be in W, given the constraints.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are SW, W, and SW:W.

Hmm, on second thought, let's look at the definitions of SW:W relation more carefully.

From the problem statement:
"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where ... there are regions a1, ..., ak in REG, where a1 in R1(b), ..., ak in Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak in REG for any reference region b in REG."

This suggests that for a relation R1:...:Rk, the object region can be partitioned into k sub-regions, each of which is in one of the k basic relations with respect to the reference region.

This means that for a region x, under certain conditions, it can have a relation SW:W with respect to region z, where part of x is SW of z and part of x is W of z.

So the possible relations betwen region x and region z are SW, W, and SW:W. SW is possible if supy(x) <= infy(z), which can happen if infy(z) = infy(y) or if supy(x) is sufficiently below infy(y) such that supy(x) <= infy(z) < infy(y). W is possible if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), which can happen if infy(z) < infy(y) and x is positioned just below y. And SW:W is possible if part of x extends into the SW direction of z and part extends into the W direction.

Ah, but there's something else to consider. We've been asked to provide the possible relations between x and z, given that x is S of y and y is W of z. This means we're considering all possible positions of x, y, and z that satisfy these two relations. And, for each such positioning, we are determining the relation between x and z.

Depending on the specific positioning, one of SW, W, or SW:W will be the relation between x and z. So, the answer to the question should be all three.

So the final answer for the relation between region x and region z:
- SW
- W
- SW:W

Actually, I'd like to double-check the question. I don't immediately see the prompt that tells me to look for multi-part cardinal direction relations. Let's be sure that's actually a valid answer.

Ah, I need to clarify my understanding of the problem. The question is: "If region x is S of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

I interpreted this as asking for all possible cardinal direction relations (including multi-tile relations) that could exist between x and z under the given constraints.

Upon reflection, I see that the cardinal direction relation can also be a multi-tile relation, which was also confirmed from the problem statement. But the question only asks for the possible relations, not specifically single-tile or multi-tile. So, I included all the possible relations, both single-tile (SW and W) and multi-tile (SW:W).

But upon third thought the question specifies: "The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B."

This makes it clear to look at just the basic directions, not combinations. So would that make the answer "SW, W"?

Hmm, on the one hand, the question says:

"The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B."

This does suggest that I should consider these 9 basic cardinal direction relations.

But, in the problem statement, it's also written:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk, where..."

And it goes on to define what a cardinal direction relation is, which includes multi-tile relations.

However, given the nature of the question and especially the statement about the possible answer, I believe the intent is to find the basic cardinal directions (or a subset of them) that are possible relations between x and z.

So, to answer the question:

Considering only the basic cardinal direction relations N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B, the possible relations between region x and region z are SW and W.

But now I'm second-guessing myself. The question specifies cardinal direction relations, and the definition provided in the problem statement can include multi-tile relations. However, the possible answers are explicitly given as the 9 basic directions, suggesting that the relation should be chosen from these 9 and not combinations.

I'll stick with my conclusion:
The possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is S of y and y is W of z, are SW and W.

OK, so my final answer is:
The possible relations between region x and region z are SW and W. "The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B," and I find that the answer is W, SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is W of region z

Let me analyze what these conditions tell us:

For x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is aligned with or to the right of y's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is aligned with or to the left of y's right boundary)

For y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's bottom boundary extends below or is aligned with y's bottom boundary)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z's top boundary extends above or is aligned with y's top boundary)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is definitely to the left of z
- The vertical relationship between x and z depends on specific positions

The possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are:

SW, W
