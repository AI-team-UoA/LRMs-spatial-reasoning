PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this problem step by step:

1) We're told that region x is NW of region y. This means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2) We're told that region y is N of region z. This means:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is contained in z's x-projection)

Now, let's determine what relation(s) x could have with z.

First, let's consider the north-south relationship:
- We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)
- We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)
- By transitivity, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- This means supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

Now, let's consider the east-west relationship:
- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- For y and z, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

What can we say about the east-west relationship between x and z? We know that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x being NW of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y being N of z)

From these, I cannot directly determine if x is to the west, east, or overlapping with z in the east-west direction.

Let's analyze the possible cases:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z.
2. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection.
3. If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x is to the east of z.
4. Other partial overlaps are also possible.

But wait, we know that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x being NW of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y being N of z)

From these, I can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)

But I cannot determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from this.

Let's think about this in terms of the possible positions of x, y, and z:

Given that x is NW of y and y is N of z, we can visualize z at the bottom, y above it (to the north), and x to the northwest of y. The x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z, which means y cannot be to the east or west of z; it's directly above it.

Now, x is to the northwest of y, meaning it's to the north and west of y. Since y is to the north of z, x is also to the north of z. And since x is to the west of y, and y's x-projection is within z's x-projection, x can be:

- Completely to the west of z (if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), making the relation NW.
- Partially overlapping with z in the east-west direction, with some part of x to the west of z and some part aligned with z, making the relation N or NW.

Hmm...I think I need to be more precise with my analysis.

Actually, let's step back. I know that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x being NW of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y being N of z)

From these, I can determine:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

So, supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for sure.

But I can't say for certain if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) or if infx(z) ≤ supx(x).

Let's consider the different cases:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Combined with the north relationship, x would be NW of z.

2. If infx(z) ≤ supx(x), we need to further analyze (remember, we already established supx(x) ≤ supx(z)):
   - If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. Combined with the north relationship, x would be N of z.
   - If infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) and infx(x) ≤ infx(z), then there's a partial overlap, with x extending to the west of z. Combined with the north relationship, x could be N or NW of z.

Hmm, when I think about it, I'm not sure I can establish that infx(x) ≤ infx(z) or infx(z) ≤ infx(x) from the given information. Let's go step by step again, and consider every possible case.

Actually, for simplicity, let's draw the setup to visualize:

```
    x (NW of y)
     \
      \
       y (N of z)
       |
       |
       z
```

In this setup, we know:
- x is to the north and west of y.
- y is directly north of z.

Now, to determine the relationship between x and z, I need to consider their relative positions:

1. North-South: As shown above, x is to the north of y, which is to the north of z. So, x is definitely to the north of z.

2. East-West: The x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z. And x is to the west of y. But the exact position of x relative to z in the east-west direction can vary.

Let's consider some scenarios:

a. If x is so far to the west that it's completely to the west of z, then x would be NW of z.
b. If x's x-projection overlaps with z's x-projection, but x is still to the north of z, then x would be N of z.
c. If x is to the east of z and to the north, then x would be NE of z.

Can scenario c be possible given the constraints? 
- x is NW of y
- y is N of z

For x to be NE of z, we would need supx(z) ≤ infx(x). 

But we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x being NW of y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y being N of z)

Combining these, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

So, supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means x cannot be to the east of z. Thus, scenario c (x is NE of z) is not possible.

Now, for scenario a and b, I need to check if both are indeed possible.

For scenario a (x is NW of z), we would need supx(x) ≤ infx(z).

The constraints tell us:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x being NW of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y being N of z)

I can't derive a direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from these constraints. So, scenario a can be possible, and it's also possible for supx(x) to be greater than infx(z), which means scenario b is also possible.

Given the constraints, it seems both N and NW are possible relations between x and z.

Let's check my logic one more time:

1. If x is NW of y and y is N of z, then as we show above, x is to the north of z. So, the possible relations between x and z are N, NE, and NW.

2. We've eliminated NE as a possibility.

3. For N and NW, we need to determine if x can be fully to the west of z (NW) or if x's x-projection overlaps with z's x-projection (N).

But wait, I think I need to be even more precise. 

Let's re-examine the constraints and possible scenarios more systematically:

Given:
- x is NW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- y is N of z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Now, let's find the constraints on the relationship between x and z:

North-South direction:
- From the given constraints, supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

East-West direction:
- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y).
- This gives us supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y).

But we don't have direct constraints on the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

There are three possibilities:

1. supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This would mean x is to the west of z. Combined with the north constraint, x would be NW of z.

2. infx(z) ≤ supx(x) and infx(x) ≤ supx(z): This would mean x and z have overlapping x-projections. Combined with the north constraint, x would be N of z.

3. supx(z) ≤ infx(x): This would mean x is to the east of z. Combined with the north constraint, x would be NE of z.

Now, is case 3 (x is NE of z) possible given the constraints?

From the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x being NW of y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y being N of z)

So, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

This gives us supx(x) ≤ supx(z). For x to be NE of z, we would need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is inconsistent with supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, case 3 is not possible.

Now, are cases 1 and 2 possible?

For case 1 (x is NW of z), we would need supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
For case 2 (x is N of z), we would need infx(z) ≤ supx(x) and infx(x) ≤ supx(z).

From the constraints, we couldn't establish a direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). So, both scenarios are possible.

To check case 2, we also need to ensure infx(x) ≤ supx(z). We don't have direct constraints on this, but it's reasonable to assume this can be satisfied.

Actually, wait, there's something I'm missing here. Let me try to check the scenarios one more time.

Since I know the northern constraint (x is north of z) is satisfied, I need to check the other cardinal directions:

- x is NW of z: This requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- x is N of z: This requires infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- x is NE of z: This requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

We've already established that the constraints satisfy supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) from the given constraints. However, we also know infx(z) ≤ infx(y). As a result, we can't be sure if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) or if infx(z) ≤ supx(x). So, it's possible for x to be NW of z, but it's not guaranteed.

For x to be N of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). From the constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (as derived earlier). However, we can't determine the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x) from the given constraints. So, it's possible for x to be N of z, but again, it's not guaranteed.

For x to be NE of z, we've already shown that it's inconsistent with the given constraints.

Let me re-examine one more time...

Alright, I'm going to make another attempt, drawing from the definitions.

Given:
- x is NW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- y is N of z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(y), and the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z (infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)).

Now, let's check the possible positions of x relative to z:

First, in the north-south direction, we can derive supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x). So, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is to the north of z.

Now, in the east-west direction:

1. If x is to the west of z, then supx(x) ≤ infx(z). From the constraints, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). So, it's possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), but we can't know for sure.

2. If x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection, then infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we can't determine the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x) from the given constraints.

3. If x is to the east of z, then supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But from above, we know supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This is a contradiction with supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be to the east of z.

4. If x's x-projection partially overlaps with z's x-projection in a way that x is to the west of z, then infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

So, from the above, we see that x cannot be to the east of z. It can either be to the west of z or have its x-projection (partially or fully) contained within z's x-projection.

Given that x is to the north of z, and considering the east-west constraints, x can be:

- NW of z (if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).
- N of z (if infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)).
- W of z (if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and there's a vertical overlap). But this would mean x is not to the north of z, which contradicts our earlier finding. So, x cannot be just W of z.

Ok, let's try to refine the possible cases a bit more accurately. I've established that x must be to the north of z. In the east-west direction, there are two subcases to consider:

1. x is fully to the west of z. This would make the relation NW.
2. x's x-projection is ether partially or fully contained within z's x-projection, while still being to the north of z. This would make the relation N.

Are there any other cases? Let's see:

A relation like NW:N:NE would mean that x spans multiple directions of z. But I'm looking for a singular direction, not a composite direction.

Oh I see, I think our issue is that we're forgetting that the X and Y regions are not just points, but have area. So it's certainly possible for region X to have a part of it to the Northwest of Z while another part is to the North of Z, especially if X is a large and irregular region.

What's the proper way of answering the question? Since I'm asked for the "possible relations between region x and region z", I believe I need to consider all possible ways the region x could be related to region z, based on the given constraints. Certainly the basic constraints on their arrangement dictates that x is at least North of z.

Let's go through the definitions of each of the 9 possible cardinal direction relations:

1. B (bounding box): a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
   - For x B z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which gives us supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - This means infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - However, for supy(x) <= supy(z), we would need a constraint that z is north of x, which contradicts the derived constraint that x is north of z. So, x B z is not possible.

2. S (south): a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
   - For x S z, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've already established supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is north of z, not south. So, x S z is not possible.

3. SW (south-west): a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
   - For x SW z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've already established supy(z) <= infy(x), which is the opposite of supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

4. W (west): a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
   - For x W z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've already established supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) < supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x W z is not possible.

5. NW (north-west): a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
   - For x NW z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've established supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), we need to check if this is consistent with the given constraints. Given that x is NW of y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y). And given that y is N of z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y). From these, we can't establish a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z). So, it's possible for supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x NW z is possible.

6. N (north): a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
   - For x N z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've established supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For the other two conditions, we need to check if they're consistent with the given constraints. We derived earlier that supx(x) <= supx(z). For infx(z) <= infx(x), we don't have a direct constraint from the given info, but it's possible. So, x N z is possible.

7. NE (north-east): a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
   - For x NE z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - We've established supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), we have a contradiction with the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x NE z is not possible.

8. E (east): a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
   - For x E z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We know infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies infy(z) <= infy(x).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), we have a contradiction with the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - We've already established supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) < supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - So, x E z is not possible.

9. SE (south-east): a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
   - For x SE z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - We've already established supy(z) <= infy(x), which is the opposite of supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - So, x SE z is not possible.

From the analysis, the possible relations between x and z are N and NW.

I'm going to double-check the possibility of N one more time to make sure, since I derived the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z), but I need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) is also possible.

From the given constraints:
- x is NW of y: This means supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).
- y is N of z: This means supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

For x N z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

We've already established supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) from the constraints.

For infx(z) <= infx(x), we know infx(z) <= infx(y) from the constraints, but we don't have direct information on the relationship between infx(y) and infx(x). But as I think about it, the constraint infx(z) <= infx(x) is not incompatible with x being NW of y and y being N of z. So, it's possible for x to have a relation N with z.

Similarly, for x NW z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established supy(z) <= infy(x). For supx(x) <= infx(z), even though we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can't establish a direct relation between supx(x) and infx(z). But again, this doesn't mean the constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) is incompatible with the given constraints. So, it's also possible for x to have a relation NW with z.

So, from the analysis, the possible relations between x and z are N and NW.

I'm going to check one more time by constructing diagrams for each of the possible scenarios to confirm my logic is sound.

I think is region N and NW are both possible.

Let me try one more approach. Given:

1) Region x is NW of region y. This means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

2) Region y is N of region z. This means:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is contained in z's x-projection)

From the two sets of constraints, we can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x) → supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (the left edge of z is to the left of or aligned with the left edge of y)

I want to determine the possible relations between x and z. 

Given that x is to the north of z, the possible relations are: NW, N, and NE.

For NW, I need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The second condition is already satisfied. 

For the first condition, I know:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). 

But I can't directly compare supx(x) and infx(z) from these constraints alone. So, it's possible that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which would make x NW of z) or that infx(z) ≤ supx(x) (in which case, x isn't fully to the west of z).

For N, I need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The third condition is already satisfied.

Given the constraints we've derived, I know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (the right edge of y is to the left of or aligned with the right edge of z)

From these, I can derive: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) → supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, the second condition for N is satisfied.

For the first condition of N, infx(z) ≤ infx(x), I can't directly determine this from the given constraints. It's possible that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which would support x N z) or that infx(x) ≤ infx(z) (which would make the N relation not valid).

For NE, I need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The second condition is satisfied.

For the first condition, I've already established: supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Given two regions, if one region is to the east of another, the left edge of the eastern region must be to the right of the right edge of the western region. For x to be to the east of z, I need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x). But that's inconsistent with the constraint supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x can't be NE of z.

Therefore, from the given constraints, the possible relations between x and z are N and NW.

Actually, I just realized there is a third (and even a fourth) possibility: it's also possible that x isn't strictly to the north, northwest, or northeast of z. If x's x-projection overlaps with z's x-projection but isn't contained within it or doesn't fully contain it, then x would have a relation that's a combination. For instance, if part of x is to the north of z and part is to the northwest, the relation would be N:NW (from the definition of a multi-tile cardinal direction).

Wait, let's be precise here. The problem is asking for the possible relations between region x and region z. It's not asking for a composite relation, but the set of all possible singular relations. Given the constraints:

- x is to the north of z
- x can be to the west of z, partially overlap with z, or have its x-projection within z's x-projection
- x cannot be to the east of z

The possible relations are N and NW.

Let me simplify and be really clear: what are all the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations that region x can have with region z, given the constraints?

1. N: If x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection, then x is to the north of z.
2. NW: If x is to the west of z, then x is to the northwest of z.

Those are the only two possibilities. The constraints don't allow x to be NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, or B in relation to z.

So, the answer is: N and NW.

Actually, I think I'm missing some cases. Let me go back to the definitions of the cardinal direction relations and check.

1. B (bounding box): a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

   For x B z, we would need:
   
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From the constraints, we already know:
   
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (derived earlier)

   The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) is inconsistent with supy(x) <= supy(z) since we'd have supy(x) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which is a contradiction. So, x B z is not possible.

2. S (south): a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

   For x S z, we would need:
   
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   From the constraints, we already know:
   
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z) (derived earlier)

   The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) is inconsistent with supy(x) <= infy(z) since we'd have supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which is a contradiction. So, x S z is not possible.

3. SW (south-west): a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

   For x SW z, we would need:
   
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   From the constraints, we know:
   
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   This is inconsistent with supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

4. W (west): a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

   For x W z, we would need:
   
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From the constraints, we know:
   
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

   The condition supy(z) <= infy(x) is inconsistent with supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x W z is not possible.

5. NW (north-west): a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

   For x NW z, we would need:
   
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   We've already established supy(z) <= infy(x). For supx(x) <= infx(z), we can't directly determine this from the given constraints, but it's possible. So, x NW z is a possible relation.

6. N (north): a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).

   For x N z, we would need:
   
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We've already established supy(z) <= infy(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). For infx(z) <= infx(x), we can't directly determine this from the given constraints, but it's possible. So, x N z is a possible relation.

7. NE (north-east): a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

   For x NE z, we would need:
   
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   We've already established supy(z) <= infy(x). For supx(z) <= infx(x), this is inconsistent with the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) as shown earlier. So, x NE z is not possible.

8. E (east): a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

   For x E z, we would need:
   
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x) is inconsistent with the constraints. So, x E z is not possible.

9. SE (south-east): a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

   For x SE z, we would need:
   
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   Both conditions are inconsistent with the constraints. So, x SE z is not possible.

From the analysis, the possible relations between x and z are N and NW.

Actually, there's one more relation we haven't explicitly checked: W:NW, which would be a composite relation. But the question is asking for "possible relations", which I'm interpreting as the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations. And from the above, the possible single-tile relations are N and NW.

Actually, one more careful readthrough of the problem tells me that we're looking for "direction relation", and the definition of a "cardinal direction relation" is an expression R1: ... : Rk, which means it can be a composite:

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: 
i) 1 <= k <= 9, 
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, 
iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j,

So we do need to consider composite directions. But actually I think my existing analysis wasn't missing anything, aside from the case where the relation is both N and NW at the same time. I already established that the possible single-tile relations are N and NW, and there's no way for x to be in any of the other cardinal directions relative to z. So the composite relation N:NW is a possibility.

But wait, I'm forgetting that these regions are not just points but have areal extent. For a region to have a composite relation, you'd need it to span multiple directions, not be in multiple directions. So I think for N:NW to be a valid relation, we would need a portion of x to be to the N of z while a separate portion of x to be NW of z. Is that possible given the constraints?

Given:
- x is NW of y
- y is N of z

Visualizing this: 
- z at the bottom
- y directly above z
- x to the northwest of y

Visualizing this differently:
- y's bounding box is exclusively within the northern sector of z
- x's bounding box is exclusively within the north-western sector of y

Could x be N of z? For this to happen, x's bounding box would need to intersect with the northern sector of z. Since y is exclusively in the northern sector of z, and x is NW of y, it's possible for x to overlap with the northern sector of z, making the N relation valid.

Could x be NW of z? For this to happen, x's bounding box would need to intersect with the north-western sector of z. Given that x is NW of y, it's possible for x to overlap with the north-western sector of z, making the NW relation valid.

Could x be both N and NW of z? For a composite relation N:NW, part of x needs to be N of z while another part needs to be NW of z. Given the constraints, this is possible. For instance, if x's bounding box largely overlaps with the northern sector of z but also extends into the north-western sector.

Actually, let me be more specific. Here's how these scenarios are possible, using concrete examples for the bounds of these regions:

Let the bounds of z be: infx(z)=0, supx(z)=10, infy(z)=0, supy(z)=5.

Scenario 1 (N relation): 
If y's bounds are infx(y)=3, supx(y)=7, infy(y)=6, supy(y)=8 (making y N of z), 
and x's bounds are infx(x)=2, supx(x)=6, infy(x)=9, supy(x)=11 (making x NW of y),
then we get infx(z)=0, infx(x)=2, and supx(x)=6 < supx(z)=10. This makes x N of z.

Scenario 2 (NW relation): 
If y's bounds are infx(y)=3, supx(y)=7, infy(y)=6, supy(y)=8 (making y N of z), 
and x's bounds are infx(x)=-1, supx(x)=-0.1, infy(x)=9, supy(x)=11 (making x NW of y),
then we get supx(x)=-0.1 < infx(z)=0, making x NW of z.

Scenario 3 (N:NW relation):
If y's bounds are infx(y)=3, supx(y)=7, infy(y)=6, supy(y)=8 (making y N of z),
and x's bounds are infx(x)=-1, supx(x)=2, infy(x)=9, supy(x)=11 (making x NW of y),
then we have part of x in the N sector of z and part in the NW sector.

So all three relations N, NW, and N:NW are possible. However, the problem is asking for a single-tile cardinal direction relation between region x and region z, where x doesn't split across multiple directional sectors of z. In that case, the possible relations are N and NW.

Actually, I've revisited the definition in the problem statement. It clearly states:

"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied:..."

This means a cardinal direction relation can consist of multiple single-tile directions, like N:NW. And it's asking for "possible relations between region x and region z", which means all possible ways x can be related to z in terms of cardinal directions.

Given the detailed analysis above, the possible cardinal directions between x and z are:
1. N
2. NW
3. N:NW

Actually, as I reconsider, I think the key question is: what is meant by "which could be the possible relations"? Is it asking for all possible single-tile relations (in which case, N and NW are the answers) or all possible cardinal direction relations (in which case, N, NW, and N:NW are the answers).

I believe the second interpretation is more aligned with the problem statement. When asked for "possible relations", and given the context of "cardinal direction relations" as defined in the problem statement, it's asking for all possible ways region x can be related to region z.

OK I think this is getting too circular. Let's be sure we're on the right track. The answer to the question "what are the possible relations between region x and region z" is:
1. N
2. NW
3. N:NW

But actually, looking back at the actual problem statement one more time, it says "If region x is NW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

The word "which" here suggests it's asking for specific cardinal direction relations out of the 9 possible single-tile ones (or their combinations). So, the answer is N, NW, or N:NW.

Actually, the prompt says: "The possible answer can be one or many of these: N, NE, SE, S, E, NW, W, SW, B."

So it's asking for single-tile directions, and the answer is N and NW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

First, let's analyze what we know from these relations:

1) x is NW of y means:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

2) y is N of z means:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is north of z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- This confirms x is to the north of z

For the east-west relationship:
- From x NW of y, I know: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y N of z, I know: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- This means supx(x) ≤ supx(z), but the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) is not fixed

The possible relations are:

N: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x would be directly north of z.

NW: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x would be to the northwest of z.

The answer is: N, NW
