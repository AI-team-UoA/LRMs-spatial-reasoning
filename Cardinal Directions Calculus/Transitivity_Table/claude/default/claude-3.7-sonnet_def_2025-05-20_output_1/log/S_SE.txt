PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze what we know:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let's first understand what "x is S of y" and "y is SE of z" mean, according to the definitions:

For "x is S of y":
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally within the projection of y)

For "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's think about what these constraints tell us about the relationship between x and z.

From "x is S of y", we know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

From "y is SE of z", we know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's combine these constraints:

For the vertical relationship:
- We know supy(x) <= infy(y) (from "x is S of y")
- We know supy(y) <= infy(z) (from "y is SE of z")

Combining these: supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
So we have: supy(x) <= infy(z)

This means x is below z, which satisfies the vertical constraint for the relations S, SE, and SW.

For the horizontal relationship:
- We know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from "x is S of y")
- We know supx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y is SE of z")

Combining these: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So we have: supx(z) <= infx(x)

This means x is to the right of z, which satisfies the horizontal constraint for the relations SE, E, and NE.

Since x must be both below z and to the right of z, the only relation that satisfies both constraints is SE.

But wait, let me double-check this. Let me think about the physical layout more carefully.

We know:
- Region x is S of region y: This means x is directly below y.
- Region y is SE of region z: This means y is to the southeast of z (below and to the right).

If x is below y, and y is below and to the right of z, then x is below and to the right of z (assuming transitivity of these relations). This would make x SE of z.

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's think about this differently, using a coordinate system.

Imagine z is at position (0, 0).
If y is SE of z, then y could be at position (1, -1).
If x is S of y, then x could be at position (1, -2).

In this case, x would be SE of z.

But let's consider another scenario:
z is at (0, 0)
y is SE of z, so y could be at (2, -1)
x is S of y, so x could be at (1, -2)

In this case, x is still below z but not necessarily to the right of z. It depends on the exact positions and sizes of the regions.

Let me revisit the constraints:

For "x is S of y":
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-range is within y's x-range)

For "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z), so x is below z.
- supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x) => supx(z) <= infx(x), so x is to the right of z.

So, x is below and to the right of z, which means x is SE of z.

Actually, I should be even more careful because the "within y's x-range" for "x is S of y" means that x can extend to the left or right of y, as long as it's below y. Let me re-analyze.

For "x is S of y":
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

For "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From the vertical constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z), so x is below z.

From the horizontal constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from "x is S of y")

Combining these: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), so x is to the right of z.

So, x is below and to the right of z, which means x could be SE of z.

Wait, I need to be more careful about the horizontal constraint for "x is S of y". The correct definition is:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

When I look at these horizontal constraints, I see two separate inequalities: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).

Let's combine these with the constraint from "y is SE of z", which is supx(z) <= infx(y).

We get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

This means: supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z. This is consistent with x being SE of z or S of z.

Actually, let's be careful about this. The constraint infx(y) <= infx(x) means the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of y. This doesn't guarantee that the leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of z (which would be required for x to be strictly to the right of z).

Let's reconsider the constraints:

For "x is S of y":
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

For "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

The vertical constraint is clear: x is below z.

For the horizontal constraint, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of y)

Combining these, we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x). This means the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x, which means x is to the right of z.

So, x is below and to the right of z, which means x is SE of z.

Wait, let me slow down and think more carefully.

Let's denote the positions and dimensions:
- z at position (zx, zy) with dimensions (zwidth, zheight)
- y at position (yx, yy) with dimensions (ywidth, yheight)
- x at position (xx, xy) with dimensions (xwidth, xheight)

From the constraints:
- y is SE of z: This means yx > zx + zwidth and yy + yheight < zy.
- x is S of y: This means xx >= yx, xx + xwidth <= yx + ywidth, and xy + xheight < yy.

Given these, can we deduce the relation between x and z?

We know:
- yx > zx + zwidth (y is to the right of z)
- xx >= yx (the leftmost point of x is to the right of the leftmost point of y)

Combining these, we get: xx >= yx > zx + zwidth. This means x is to the right of z.

We also know:
- yy + yheight < zy (y is below z)
- xy + xheight < yy (x is below y)

Combining these, we get: xy + xheight < yy < zy - yheight < zy. This means x is below z.

So, x is below and to the right of z, which means x is SE of z.

But wait, I think I made a mistake. The constraint "infx(y) <= infx(x)" that I've been using doesn't align with the definition of "x is S of y". Let me double-check the definitions:

For "x is S of y":
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

No I'm correct. Since "x is S of y", we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), which means the x-range of x is within the x-range of y. Let's combine this with the information about y and z:

From "y is SE of z", we know supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

Given infx(y) <= infx(x) (from "x is S of y") and supx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y is SE of z"), we can say supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x is to the right of z.

Given supy(x) <= infy(y) (from "x is S of y") and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from "y is SE of z"), we can say supy(x) <= infy(z). This means x is below z.

So, x is below and to the right of z, which means x is SE of z.

Wait, I want to double check if x is SE of z is the only possible relation or if there could be others. Let's do a more visual analysis:

Imagine a coordinate system where positive y is up:

```
   z
    \
     \
      y
      |
      x
```

Here, y is SE of z (below and to the right), and x is S of y (directly below). In this setup, x is SE of z.

But now, consider a situation where y is slightly more to the right:

```
z
    \
     \
     y
     |
     x
```

Again, y is SE of z, and x is S of y. In this case, x is also SE of z.

Or a case where y is almost directly below z:

```
       z
       |
       y
       |
       x
```

Here, y is still technically SE of z (assuming it's slightly to the right), and x is S of y. In this case, x might be S of z or SE of z, depending on how much to the right y is from z.

I think, given the constraints, x can be either S of z or SE of z.

Let me re-check the definitions. For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

We've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), so the first condition is met. For the second condition, we need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From "y is SE of z", we know supx(z) <= infx(y).
From "x is S of y", we know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).

Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). This means x is to the right of z, which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) required for x to be S of z.

So, x cannot be S of z. It must be SE of z.

Let me actually try to visualize this.

x is S of y:
x is below y. x's x-range is within y's x range.
```
  [y]
  [x]
```

y is SE of z:
y is below and to the right of z. Actually, to be precise, y is entirely to the right of z and entirely below z.
```
[z]
    [y]
```

Now, let's combine these two scenarios:
```
[z]
    [y]
    [x]
```

In this diagram, x is below and to the right of z, which means x is SE of z.

Given the strict definitions:
- For "x is S of y": x is below y and x's x-range is within y's x-range.
- For "y is SE of z": y is below and to the right of z.

When combined, x must be SE of z.

Hmm, wait. I notice that the constraint supx(x) <= supx(z) that I was trying to check earlier, doesn't align with the visualization. This constraint would mean the right edge of x is to the left of the right edge of z, which doesn't seem right given the diagram.

Let me revisit the definitions and constraints:

For "x is S of y":
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

For "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

So, y's x-projection is completely to the right of z's x-projection. And x's x-projection is within y's x-projection. This means x's x-projection could be anywhere within y's x-projection, but still to the right of z's x-projection.

Combining these, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

This means x is to the right of z, satisfying the horizontal constraint for SE.

We also have:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z)

This means x is below z, satisfying the vertical constraint for S or SE.

So, x could be SE of z.

Wait, let's also check if x could be S of z. For that, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

We already established that supy(x) <= infy(z), so the first condition is met. For the second condition, we need to check if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From "y is SE of z", we know supx(z) <= infx(y). This means z's x-projection is to the left of y's x-projection. Given that x's x-projection is within y's x-projection (from "x is S of y"), x's x-projection is to the right of z's x-projection. This contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) required for x to be S of z.

So, x cannot be S of z. It must be SE of z.

OK let me carefully check all the cardinal direction options.  I believe the only possible relation is "SE".  Let me go through all 9 directions (B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) one by one:

1. B (bounding box): For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But from "y is SE of z", we know supx(z) <= infx(y). And from "x is S of y", we know infx(y) <= infx(x). Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be B of z.

2. S (South): For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). As I've already analyzed, the conditions supx(z) <= infx(y) (from "y is SE of z") and infx(y) <= infx(x) (from "x is S of y") lead to supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be S of z.

3. SW (South West): For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). From "y is SE of z", we know supx(z) <= infx(y). And from "x is S of y", we know infx(y) <= infx(x). Combining these, we get supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

4. W (West): For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

5. NW (North West): For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). From "y is SE of z", we know supy(y) <= infy(z). And from "x is S of y", we know supy(x) <= infy(y). Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be NW of z.

6. N (North): For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we've established that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

7. NE (North East): For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). While supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied, the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) (from our earlier analysis) contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be NE of z.

8. E (East): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). We know supx(z) <= infx(x), but the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) (from our earlier analysis) means that x is below z, which contradicts the conditions infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) required for x to be E of z. So, x cannot be E of z.

9. SE (South East): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). From our earlier analysis, both these conditions are satisfied. So, x can be SE of z.

After checking all possible cardinal directions, I believe the only possible relation between x and z is "SE". Let me quickly verify this by drawing a diagram to confirm:

```
   [z]
       [y]
       [x]
```

In this diagram, y is SE of z (to the right and below), and x is S of y (directly below). It's clear that x is also SE of z (to the right and below).

But wait, didn't I overly simplify with "x is S of y" meaning that it's directly below y?

From the definition I gave:
For "x is S of y": 
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

So, x is below y but it's also the case that x's x-projection is within y's x-projection, and not that x is strictly directly below y.

Let me visualize this with a more precise diagram:

```
     [z]
         [y]
         [x]
```

Here, the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of y, and x is below y, so x is S of y. Additionally, the x-projection of y is to the right of the x-projection of z, and y is below z, so y is SE of z.

From this diagram, it's clear that x is SE of z (below and to the right).

Let me double-check if there are any other possible relations:

1. For x to be SW of z, x would need to be to the left of z. But given that y is to the right of z (from "y is SE of z") and x's x-projection is within y's x-projection (from "x is S of y"), x must also be to the right of z. So, x cannot be SW of z.

2. For x to be S of z, x's x-projection would need to be within z's x-projection. But given that y's x-projection is to the right of z's x-projection (from "y is SE of z") and x's x-projection is within y's x-projection (from "x is S of y"), x's x-projection must be to the right of z's x-projection, not within it. So, x cannot be S of z.

3. The remaining cardinal directions (B, W, NW, N, NE, E) have already been ruled out based on the constraints.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is "SE".

Actually, let's very double-check that with a slightly different diagram.

```
   [z]
        [y]
      [x]
```

Here, y is still SE of z (to the right and below). But now, x's x-projection is shifted slightly left compared to y's, though still within y's x-projection. This is allowed by the definition of "x is S of y". In this case, x is still to the right of z (so it's not S of z), and it's below z, so it's SE of z.

Let me visualize one more example. What if the x-range of x is at the very left edge of the x-range of y?

```
   [z]
        [y]
     [x]
```

Here, the leftmost point of x is the same as the leftmost point of y (infx(y) = infx(x)), and x's rightmost point is to the left of y's rightmost point (supx(x) < supx(y)). This still satisfies "x is S of y". Meanwhile, y is SE of z, with its leftmost point to the right of z's rightmost point (supx(z) <= infx(y)).

In this setup, the leftmost point of x is to the right of z's rightmost point (infx(x) = infx(y) > supx(z)). And x is below z. So, x is SE of z.

It seems that given the constraints "x is S of y" and "y is SE of z", the only possible relation between x and z is "SE".

Hmm, but actaully this is the example that doesn't provide a contradiction to x being S of z. Let me carefully check to be sure.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-projection is within z's x-projection)

From our known constraints:
- "x is S of y": supy(x) <= infy(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- "y is SE of z": supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x) => supx(z) <= infx(x)

For x to be S of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But the derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts both these requirements because it implies that z's rightmost point is to the left of x's leftmost point, meaning that the x-projections of x and z don't overlap at all, let alone one being within the other. Hmm wait, I said it contradicts BOTH, but this is actually a contradition of infx(z) <= infx(x).

So, x cannot be S of z.

OK so the only possible relation is SE, but let me triple check that I haven't missed anything.

When region x is S of region y and region y is SE of region z, let's see what constraints we've derived:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z): This means x is below z.
2. supx(z) <= infx(x): This means x is to the right of z.

Given these two constraints, let's check all the cardinal directions:

1. B (bounding box): This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and other conditions. But since supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is strictly to the left of x, the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) implied by B is contradicted. So, x cannot be B of z.

2. S (South): This requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and other conditions. But as just explained for B, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts this. So, x cannot be S of z.

3. SW (South West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z). But from the derived constraint supx(z) <= infx(x), we know that x is to the right of z, which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

4. W (West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and other conditions. But as just explained for SW, the condition supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts this. So, x cannot be W of z.

5. NW (North West): This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But the derived constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) means x is below z, which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be NW of z.

6. N (North): This requires supy(z) <= infy(x) and other conditions. But as just explained for NW, the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts this. So, x cannot be N of z.

7. NE (North East): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition is satisfied, but the second one is contradicted by supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be NE of z.

8. E (East): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition is satisfied, but the condition supy(x) <= infy(z) means x is below z, which contradicts both infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be E of z.

9. SE (South East): This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Both these conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints. So, x can be SE of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is "SE".

Actually, I think that S is not the only possible relation. Let me explore this more deliberately.

We have the constraints:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z): This means x is below z.
2. supx(z) <= infx(x): This means x is to the right of z.

Now, if we visualize this, x is below and to the right of z. This aligns with the definition of SE.

Actually, wait.  Actually, might there be more than just the SE relation?

Let's analyze what "x is S of y" and "y is SE of z" mean:
- "x is S of y": x is below y, and x's x-projection is within y's x-projection.
- "y is SE of z": y is below and to the right of z.

Now, let's try to visually understand the possible positions of x relative to z.

```
   [z]
        [y]
        [x]
```

Here, x is directly below y, and y is below and to the right of z. In this case, x is clearly SE of z.

But what if x is positioned such that its x-projection is not aligned with y's x-projection?

```
   [z]
        [y]

In this case, x's x-projection is still within y's x-projection (as required by "x is S of y"), but it's shifted slightly to the left. x is still below and to the right of z, so it's still SE of z.

Can we position x in such a way that it's not SE of z? Let's try:

x cannot be to the left of z because, given "y is SE of z", y is to the right of z, and given "x is S of y", x's x-projection is within y's x-projection, which means x is also to the right of z.

x cannot be above z because, given "y is SE of z", y is below z, and given "x is S of y", x is below y, which means x is also below z.

x cannot be to the right of y because, given "x is S of y", x's x-projection is within y's x-projection.

x cannot be above y because, given "x is S of y", x is below y.

So, the constraints "x is S of y" and "y is SE of z" determine the position of x relative to z to be SE. This is the only possible relation.

Let's double-check with a concrete example using coordinates. Imagine a scenario where:
- z is at position (0, 0) with dimensions (1, 1).
- y is at position (2, -2) with dimensions (1, 1).
- x is at position (2, -4) with dimensions (1, 1).

In this case, y is SE of z (it's to the right and below), and x is S of y (it's directly below). It's clear that x is SE of z.

Now, let's shift x slightly:
- x is at position (1.5, -4) with dimensions (1, 1).

x is still S of y (it's below y and its x-projection is within y's x-projection), but its position has changed relative to z. Is it still SE of z?

The rightmost point of z is at (1, 0), and the leftmost point of x is at (1.5, -4). Since 1 < 1.5, x is still to the right of z. And x is clearly below z. So, x is still SE of z.

Let's shift x even more:
- x is at position (1.1, -4) with dimensions (1, 1).

Now, the leftmost point of x is at (1.1, -4), which is still to the right of z's rightmost point at (1, 0). So, x is still to the right of z. And x is still below z. So, x is still SE of z.

It seems that the constraints "x is S of y" and "y is SE of z" ensure that x can only be SE of z. The reason is that, given "y is SE of z", y is to the right of z, and given "x is S of y", x's leftmost point is to the right of y's leftmost point (which is already to the right of z's rightmost point). This ensures that x is always to the right of z. Coupled with the fact that x is below y (which is below z), x must be SE of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is "SE".

Let's step back and summarize for this problem:

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

We need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

After careful analysis, we've determined that the only possible relation is:
- Region x is SE of region z

This is because the constraints of "x is S of y" and "y is SE of z" position x in such a way that it can only be below and to the right of z, which is the definition of SE.

I'm going to check one more time. For "x is S of y":
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-projection is within y's x-projection)

For "y is SE of z":
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= infx(x) => supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z) => supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

Given these two derived constraints, x is below and to the right of z, which means x is SE of z.

So, the answer is: SE.
Actually, let me double check if it is ONLY SE.

Given the constraints:
1. supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)
2. supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)

These constraints align with the definition of SE: "a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)."

Let's check if x can be related to z in any other way. 

For x to be S of z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which would place x's x-projection within z's x-projection. But the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) places x strictly to the right of z, contradicting the requirement for S.

For x to be SW of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z), which would place x strictly to the left of z. But the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) places x strictly to the right of z, contradicting the requirement for SW.

For x to be W of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z), which would place x strictly to the left of z. But the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) places x strictly to the right of z, contradicting the requirement for W.

For x to be NW of z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which would place x strictly to the left and above z. But the constraints supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) place x strictly to the right and below z, contradicting the requirements for NW.

For x to be N of z, we would need supy(z) <= infy(x), which would place x strictly above z. But the constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) places x strictly below z, contradicting the requirement for N.

For x to be NE of z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), which would place x strictly to the right and above z. The constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied, but supy(x) <= infy(z) places x strictly below z, contradicting the requirement for NE.

For x to be E of z, we would need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), which would place x strictly to the right and at the same vertical level as z. The constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied, but supy(x) <= infy(z) places x strictly below z, contradicting the requirements for E.

For x to be B of z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z), which would place x within the bounding box of z. But the constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) places x strictly to the right of z, contradicting the requirements for B.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is SE.

The final answer is: SE.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the constraints given by the two relations and determine what they tell us about the possible positions of region x relative to region z.

First, let's understand what we know:
* "x is S of y" means:
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal extent is within y's horizontal extent)

* "y is SE of z" means:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, I can derive constraints for the relationship between x and z:

Vertical relationship:
- From "x is S of y": supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- From "y is SE of z": supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Combining these: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- Therefore: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

Horizontal relationship:
- From "y is SE of z": supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- From "x is S of y": infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- Combining these: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- Therefore: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z)

Since x must be both below z and to the right of z, the only possible relation is SE.
