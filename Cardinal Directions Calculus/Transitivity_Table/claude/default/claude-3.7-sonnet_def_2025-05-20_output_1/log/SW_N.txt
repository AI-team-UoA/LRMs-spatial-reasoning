PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is N of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step-by-step using the definitions of cardinal directions.

We're given that:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

We need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let's recall what it means for a region to be SW of another region:
x SW y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y)

And what it means for a region to be N of another region:
y N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's analyze the constraints for x SW y:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)    // x is to the left of y
2. supy(x) <= infy(y)    // x is below y

And for y N z:
3. supy(z) <= infy(y)    // y is above z
4. infx(z) <= infx(y)    // z extends at least as far left as y
5. supx(y) <= supx(z)    // z extends at least as far right as y

Let's see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z:

From constraints 1 and 4, we have:
supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y)

This means supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), but we can't directly compare supx(x) and infx(z). So x could be to the left of z, or they could overlap horizontally.

From constraints 2 and 3, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

This means both x and z are below y, but we can't directly determine the vertical relationship between x and z. x could be above z, below z, or they could overlap vertically.

Given these constraints, let's analyze the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. SW (South West): If x is to the left of z and below z, then x SW z. Given the constraints, this is possible.

2. W (West): If x is to the left of z and vertically overlaps with z, then x W z. Given the constraints, this is possible.

3. NW (North West): If x is to the left of z and above z, then x NW z. Given the constraints, this is possible.

4. S (South): If x horizontally overlaps with z and is below z, then x S z. Given the constraints, this is possible.

5. B (Bounding box): If x is contained within the bounding box of z, then x B z. Given the constraints, this is possible.

6. N (North): If x horizontally overlaps with z and is above z, then x N z. Given the constraints, this is possible.

7. SE (South East): If x is to the right of z and below z, then x SE z. Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), it seems that x is to the left of or at most overlaps with z horizontally, so x SE z seems unlikely.

8. E (East): If x is to the right of z and vertically overlaps with z, then x E z. Again, given the horizontal constraints, this seems unlikely.

9. NE (North East): If x is to the right of z and above z, then x NE z. Again, given the horizontal constraints, this seems unlikely.

Let's double-check by creating a diagram:

For x SW y:
- x is to the left of y.
- x is below y.

For y N z:
- y is above z.
- z extends at least as far left as y.
- z extends at least as far right as y.

Given these constraints, where could x be in relation to z?

If z extends as far left as y, and x is to the left of y, then x could be to the left of z, or they could overlap horizontally. If z extends further left than y, then x is definitely to the left of z. If z exactly aligns with y on the left side, then x is also to the left of z.

Vertically, y is above z, and x is below y. Depending on how far below y x is, and how far below y z is, x could be above, below, or at the same level as z.

I think I need to refine my analysis.

Alright, let's make this more systematic:

For x SW y:
We have supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y).

For y N z:
We have supy(z) <= infy(y), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z).

So, the possible relationship between x and z on the x-axis:
- From the first constraint, we know supx(x) <= infx(y).
- From the second constraint, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
- We can't directly compare supx(x) and infx(z) from these.

The possible relationships on the x-axis are:
1. x is entirely to the left of z, i.e., supx(x) < infx(z).
2. x overlaps with z on the x-axis, i.e., infx(z) <= supx(x).

Note that from the second constraint, we also have supx(y) <= supx(z). But this doesn't give us more information about the relationship between x and z on the x-axis.

On the y-axis:
- From the first constraint, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
- From the second constraint, we know supy(z) <= infy(y).
- We can't directly compare supy(x) and supy(z) from these.

The possible relationships on the y-axis are:
1. x is entirely below z, i.e., supy(x) < infy(z).
2. x is entirely above z, i.e., supy(z) < infy(x).
3. x overlaps with z on the y-axis.

Given these possibilities, let's enumerate the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

1. If x is entirely to the left of z and entirely below z, then x SW z.
2. If x is entirely to the left of z and overlaps with z on the y-axis, then x W z.
3. If x is entirely to the left of z and entirely above z, then x NW z.
4. If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is entirely below z, then x S z.
5. If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and also overlaps with z on the y-axis, then they could have any of several relations, including B.
6. If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is entirely above z, then x N z.

But based on the constraints, we can't have x entirely to the right of z, so the relations SE, E, and NE are not possible.

This becomes clearer when we consider the definitions:
- For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). But from our constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which means supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(z) < infx(y), which contradicts the constraint supx(y) <= supx(z) (since y can't be to the right of z). So, x SE z is not possible.
- Similarly, for x E z and x NE z, we would need x to be to the right of z, which contradicts our derived constraint that x is either to the left of z or overlaps with z on the x-axis.

Actually, I need to be even more careful. Let's reconsider the constraints one by one.

For x SW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)    // x is to the left of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y)    // x is below y

For y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)    // y is above z
- infx(z) <= infx(y)    // z extends at least as far left as y
- supx(y) <= supx(z)    // z extends at least as far right as y

Let's focus on the x-axis first. Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far left as y), we can't directly compare supx(x) and infx(z). But we know that if supx(x) < infx(z), then x is entirely to the left of z. If infx(z) <= supx(x), then x overlaps with z on the x-axis.

On the y-axis, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y) and supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z). Again, we can't directly compare supy(x) and supy(z). So, x could be below z, above z, or they could overlap vertically.

Given these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

- x SW z: If x is entirely to the left of z and entirely below z.
- x W z: If x is entirely to the left of z and overlaps with z on the y-axis.
- x NW z: If x is entirely to the left of z and entirely above z.
- x S z: If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is entirely below z.
- x B z (or other relations): If x overlaps with z on both the x-axis and the y-axis.
- x N z: If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is entirely above z.

The relations SE, E, and NE require x to be to the right of z. Given our constraints, if x is to the left of y and z extends at least as far left as y, then x cannot be to the right of z. Thus, these relations are not possible.

We still have several possibilities, but I'm not sure if all of them are valid. Let's see if we can narrow them down.

Actually, let's approach this differently. I'll use a graphical representation to check the possible relative positions of x, y, and z.

Given the constraints:
- x SW y: x is to the left of and below y.
- y N z: y is above z, and z extends at least as far left and right as y.

Let's denote the corners of the bounding boxes:
- x: (left_x, bottom_x), (right_x, top_x)
- y: (left_y, bottom_y), (right_y, top_y)
- z: (left_z, bottom_z), (right_z, top_z)

From x SW y, we have:
- right_x <= left_y (x is to the left of y)
- top_x <= bottom_y (x is below y)

From y N z, we have:
- top_z <= bottom_y (y is above z)
- left_z <= left_y (z extends at least as far left as y)
- right_y <= right_z (z extends at least as far right as y)

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, we need to compare their bounding boxes.

On the x-axis:
- We know right_x <= left_y and left_z <= left_y. This means right_x <= left_y and left_z <= left_y.
  - If right_x < left_z, then x is entirely to the left of z (giving us SW, W, NW).
  - If left_z <= right_x, then x and z overlap on the x-axis (giving us S, B, N).

On the y-axis:
- We know top_x <= bottom_y and top_z <= bottom_y. This means top_x <= bottom_y and top_z <= bottom_y. But we can't directly compare top_x and top_z or bottom_x and bottom_z.
  - If top_x < bottom_z, then x is entirely below z (giving us SW, S, SE).
  - If top_z <= bottom_x, then x is entirely above z (giving us NW, N, NE).
  - If neither of the above, then x and z overlap on the y-axis (giving us W, B, E).

Combining these, the possible relations are:
- x SW z: If x is entirely to the left of z and entirely below z.
- x W z: If x is entirely to the left of z and overlaps with z on the y-axis.
- x NW z: If x is entirely to the left of z and entirely above z.
- x S z: If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is entirely below z.
- x B z: If x overlaps with z on both the x-axis and the y-axis.
- x N z: If x overlaps with z on the x-axis and is entirely above z.

Now, let's see if any of these can be ruled out based on the constraints.

For x SW y and y N z, we have top_x <= bottom_y and top_z <= bottom_y. This doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between top_x and top_z. So, both x NW z and x N z are still possible.

On the other hand, if we assume that x is entirely below z (for x SW z or x S z), then we need top_x < bottom_z. From the constraints, we know top_x <= bottom_y and top_z <= bottom_y, but we can't derive a relationship between top_x and bottom_z. So, these relations are also possible.

Let's think if there's any reasonable situation (given the constraints) where x could be in the bounding box of z (i.e., x B z).

For x B z, we need left_z <= left_x, right_x <= right_z, bottom_z <= bottom_x, and top_x <= top_z. From the constraints, we know right_x <= left_y and left_z <= left_y. This means right_x <= left_y and left_z <= left_y. If right_x <= left_y and left_z <= left_y, then we can't guarantee left_z <= left_x. In fact, it's possible that left_x < left_z, which would mean x is not in the bounding box of z. So, x B z is not guaranteed by the constraints.

But for the sake of thoroughness, let's consider cases where it could be true:
- If left_z <= left_x and right_x <= right_z, then x is within the horizontal extent of z.
- If bottom_z <= bottom_x and top_x <= top_z, then x is within the vertical extent of z.

If both of these are true, then x B z.

Given the constraints, I believe the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, B, N. But I'm still uncertain about S, B, and N because they require x to overlap with z on the x-axis.

Actually, wait, if we know that right_x <= left_y (from x SW y) and left_z <= left_y (from y N z), we can't determine the relationship between right_x and left_z directly. So, both right_x < left_z and left_z <= right_x are possible, which means x could be entirely to the left of z or overlap with z on the x-axis.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, NW, S, and N.

But wait, I previously reached a different conclusion when examining the possibility of x B z. Let me recheck this.

For x B z, we need left_z <= left_x, right_x <= right_z, bottom_z <= bottom_x, and top_x <= top_z.

From x SW y, we derive:
- right_x <= left_y
- top_x <= bottom_y

From y N z, we derive:
- top_z <= bottom_y
- left_z <= left_y
- right_y <= right_z

It's definitely possible that left_z <= left_x (e.g., if left_z is far to the left and left_x is closer to left_y). It's also possible that right_x <= right_z (e.g., if right_x is much less than left_y and right_z is much greater than right_y). But we can't guarantee bottom_z <= bottom_x or top_x <= top_z from the constraints.

We do know top_x <= bottom_y (from x SW y) and top_z <= bottom_y (from y N z), but these don't relate top_x and top_z directly. Similarly, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), but these don't relate supy(x) and supy(z). I'm focusing on the vertical relations because that's where it's unclear if x B z is possible.

Actually, let me think step by step once more.

I now know that the possible horizontal relationships between x and z are:
1. x is entirely to the left of z (giving us SW, W, NW).
2. x overlaps with z on the x-axis (giving us S, B, N).

I know that the possible vertical relationships between x and z are:
1. x is entirely below z (giving us SW, S, SE).
2. x is entirely above z (giving us NW, N, NE).
3. x overlaps with z on the y-axis (giving us W, B, E).

Given the constraints, SE, E, and NE are not possible because they require x to be to the right of z, which contradicts the constraints. Now, let's check which of the remaining six relations are possible.

Recall what region x, y, and z look like given the constraints:

1. x SW y : x is to the left of y (doesn't touch) and below y (doesn't touch).
2. y N z : y is on top of z (doesn't touch on the y-axis), and z can extend past y on both the left and right sides.

A. SW: This is possible if x is below z and to the left of z.
B. W: This is possible if x vertically overlaps with z and is to the left of z.
C. NW: This is possible if x is above z and to the left of z.
D. S: This is possible if x horizontally overlaps with z and is below z.
E. B: This is possible if x is inside the bounding box of z.
F. N: This is possible if x horizontally overlaps with z and is above z.

For E (x B z), we need:
- left_z <= left_x (z extends at least as far left as x).
- right_x <= right_z (z extends at least as far right as x).
- bottom_z <= bottom_x (z extends at least as far down as x).
- top_x <= top_z (z extends at least as far up as x).

From constraints:
- right_x <= left_y
- top_x <= bottom_y
- top_z <= bottom_y
- left_z <= left_y
- right_y <= right_z

If I align z and y such that z doesn't extend much to the left, then I know left_z <= left_y, and I know right_x <= left_y. Given these, I can place z and x such that right_x < left_z, which would mean x is not in the bounding box of z. But if I align z such that it extends far to the left, so left_z << left_y, then it's possible for left_z < left_x.

OK so B is possible.

Let me double-check my understanding of B again. For a B b, which means a is contained within b's bounding box, we need:
1. infx(b) <= infx(a) (b extends at least as far left as a).
2. supx(a) <= supx(b) (b extends at least as far right as a).
3. infy(b) <= infy(a) (b extends at least as far down as a).
4. supy(a) <= supy(b) (b extends at least as far up as a).

So, for x B z, we would need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x) (z extends at least as far left as x).
2. supx(x) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as x).
3. infy(z) <= infy(x) (z extends at least as far down as x).
4. supy(x) <= supy(z) (z extends at least as far up as x).

From the constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y).
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is below y).
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z).
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z extends at least as far left as y).
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y).

So, for the x-axis, because z can extend much further left than y, it's possible for infx(z) <= infx(x), satisfying the first condition for x B z. Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), we have supx(x) <= supx(z), satisfying the second condition.

For the y-axis, we know supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y), so supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y). But we can't directly relate supy(x) and supy(z) from this. Similarly, we don't have direct relationships for infy(z) and infy(x).

Wait, I think I was confused by my notation: the bound is the numerical bound, not the bounding box.

Actually, in the problem statement it says that infx(a) is the greatest lower bound of the projection of a on the x-axis, while supx(a) is the supremum of the projection of a on the x-axis. Similarly, infy(a) is the greatest lower bound of the projection of a on the y-axis, while supy(a) is the supremum of the projection of a on the y-axis. So I think my notation is correct.

Let me just focus on B and see whether it's possible. The constraints from the problem are:

For x SW y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)    // x is to the left of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y)    // x is below y

For y N z:
- supy(z) <= infy(y)    // y is above z
- infx(z) <= infx(y)    // z extends at least as far left as y
- supx(y) <= supx(z)    // z extends at least as far right as y

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)    // z extends at least as far left as x
- supx(x) <= supx(z)    // z extends at least as far right as x
- infy(z) <= infy(x)    // z extends at least as far down as x
- supy(x) <= supy(z)    // z extends at least as far up as x

From the constraints, we know:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

If infx(z) <= infx(x), then that satisfies the first condition for x B z. This can be true if z extends much further left than y and x. Given that supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y), we have supx(x) <= supx(z), satisfying the second condition.

But we don't have direct relations between infy(z) and infy(x), or between supy(x) and supy(z). So we can't be sure that x B z is possible.

OK let me try to construct another example:

Let's consider a specific scenario:
- x: a small circle with center at (0, 0) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-1, -1), (1, 1).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 5) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 4), (6, 6).
- z: a very large circle with center at (5, 0) and radius 6. Its boundary box is (-1, -6), (11, 6).

With these:
- infx(x) = -1, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = -1, supy(x) = 1.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 4, supy(y) = 6.
- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 11, infy(z) = -6, supy(z) = 6.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 1, infy(y) = 4. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 6, infy(y) = 4. But this means supy(z) > infy(y), which violates the condition for y N z.

Let me correct this. 

Let's consider a specific scenario:
- x: a small circle with center at (0, 0) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-1, -1), (1, 1).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 10) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 9), (6, 11).
- z: a very large circle with center at (5, 5) and radius 6. Its boundary box is (-1, -1), (11, 11).

With these:
- infx(x) = -1, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = -1, supy(x) = 1.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 9, supy(y) = 11.
- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 11, infy(z) = -1, supy(z) = 11.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 1, infy(y) = 9. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 11, infy(y) = 9. But this means supy(z) > infy(y), which violates the condition for y N z.

Ah, I need to be more careful. The condition is supy(z) <= infy(y), which means z is below y. 

Let's adjust again:
- x: a small circle with center at (0, 0) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-1, -1), (1, 1).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 10) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 9), (6, 11).
- z: a very large circle with center at (5, 5) and radius 2. Its boundary box is (3, 3), (7, 7).

With these:
- infx(x) = -1, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = -1, supy(x) = 1.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 9, supy(y) = 11.
- infx(z) = 3, supx(z) = 7, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 7.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 1, infy(y) = 9. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 7, infy(y) = 9. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = 3, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y) is NOT satisfied. ✗

Shoot, let me adjust the coordinates again.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (0, 0) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-1, -1), (1, 1).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 10) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 9), (6, 11).
- z: a large circle with center at (1, 5) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-4, 0), (6, 10).

With these:
- infx(x) = -1, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = -1, supy(x) = 1.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 9, supy(y) = 11.
- infx(z) = -4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 1, infy(y) = 9. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 10, infy(y) = 9. So, supy(z) <= infy(y) is NOT satisfied. ✗

Argh, let me fix this.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (0, 0) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-1, -1), (1, 1).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 12) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 11), (6, 13).
- z: a large circle with center at (1, 5) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-4, 0), (6, 10).

With these:
- infx(x) = -1, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = -1, supy(x) = 1.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 11, supy(y) = 13.
- infx(z) = -4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 1, infy(y) = 11. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 10, infy(y) = 11. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = -4, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 6. So, supx(y) <= supx(z). ✓
So, y N z is satisfied.

Now, let's check if x B z:
- infx(z) = -4, infx(x) = -1. So, infx(z) <= infx(x). ✓
- supx(x) = 1, supx(z) = 6. So, supx(x) <= supx(z). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(x) = -1. So, infy(z) > infy(x), which means x B z is NOT satisfied. ✗

This counterexample confirms that x B z is not always satisfied given the constraints.

Let me construct a new diagram and check different relations.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (0, 5) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-1, 4), (1, 6).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 12) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 11), (6, 13).
- z: a large circle with center at (1, 5) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-4, 0), (6, 10).

With these:
- infx(x) = -1, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 11, supy(y) = 13.
- infx(z) = -4, supx(z) = 6, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 1, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 6, infy(y) = 11. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 10, infy(y) = 11. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = -4, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 6. So, supx(y) <= supx(z). ✓
So, y N z is satisfied.

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = 1, infx(z) = -4. Since 1 > -4, x doesn't satisfy the SW, W, or NW relation with z (which would require x to be to the left of z).
- infy(x) = 4, supy(z) = 10. Since 4 < 10, x doesn't satisfy the NW, N, or NE relation with z (which would require x to be above z).
- supy(x) = 6, infy(z) = 0. Since 6 > 0, x doesn't satisfy the SW, S, or SE relation with z (which would require x to be below z).

Given the checks above, the relation between x and z appears to be that they overlap.

Wait, but I need to check if x B z:
- infx(z) = -4, infx(x) = -1. So, infx(z) <= infx(x). ✓
- supx(x) = 1, supx(z) = 6. So, supx(x) <= supx(z). ✓
- infy(z) = 0, infy(x) = 4. So, infy(z) <= infy(x) is NOT satisfied. ✗

So x B z is not satisfied. Let me try another relation.

Hmm, it seems like the boundary box of x is (-1, 4), (1, 6), and the boundary box of z is (-4, 0), (6, 10). So, x extends into z horizontally (since the x-coordinate of x is between the x-coordinates of z), but not fully contained in z vertically (since the y-coordinate of x is not fully contained in the y-coordinate of z). This doesn't directly fit any of the single-tile cardinal directions, so I believe a multi-tile cardinal direction would be required.

OK so x W z: If x is entirely to the left of z and overlaps with z on the y-axis, is not possible for this counterexample, because x is not entirely to the left of z. Let me try a different counterexample.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (-6, 5) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-7, 4), (-5, 6).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 12) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 11), (6, 13).
- z: a large circle with center at (1, 5) and radius 3. Its boundary box is (-2, 2), (4, 8).

With these:
- infx(x) = -7, supx(x) = -5, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 11, supy(y) = 13.
- infx(z) = -2, supx(z) = 4, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 8.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 6, infy(y) = 11. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 8, infy(y) = 11. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = -2, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 4. So, supx(y) <= supx(z) is NOT satisfied. ✗

Argh, let's try again.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (-6, 5) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-7, 4), (-5, 6).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 12) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 11), (6, 13).
- z: a large circle with center at (1, 5) and radius 7. Its boundary box is (-6, -2), (8, 12).

With these:
- infx(x) = -7, supx(x) = -5, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 11, supy(y) = 13.
- infx(z) = -6, supx(z) = 8, infy(z) = -2, supy(z) = 12.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 6, infy(y) = 11. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 12, infy(y) = 11. So, supy(z) <= infy(y) is NOT satisfied. ✗

OK, let me try one more time.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (-6, 5) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-7, 4), (-5, 6).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (8, 5) and radius 7. Its boundary box is (1, -2), (15, 12).

With these:
- infx(x) = -7, supx(x) = -5, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 6.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 15, infy(z) = -2, supy(z) = 12.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 6, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 12, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = 1, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 15. So, supx(y) <= supx(z). ✓
So, y N z is satisfied.

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(z) = 1. Since -5 < 1, x is entirely to the left of z. ✓
- infy(x) = 4, supy(z) = 12. Since 4 < 12, x is neither entirely above z nor entirely below z. x and z overlap in the y-axis. ✓

This means the relation between x and z is W (West).

Let me try a different diagram to check if x NW z is possible.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (-6, 10) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-7, 9), (-5, 11).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (8, 5) and radius 4. Its boundary box is (4, 1), (12, 9).

With these:
- infx(x) = -7, supx(x) = -5, infy(x) = 9, supy(x) = 11.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = 4, supx(z) = 12, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 9.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 11, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 9, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = 4, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 12. So, supx(y) <= supx(z). ✓
So, y N z is satisfied.

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(z) = 4. Since -5 < 4, x is entirely to the left of z. ✓
- infy(z) = 1, supy(x) = 11. Since 1 < 11, x is not entirely above z. ✗

So x NW z is not satisfied in this diagram. Let's try again.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (-6, 12) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-7, 11), (-5, 13).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (8, 5) and radius 3. Its boundary box is (5, 2), (11, 8).

With these:
- infx(x) = -7, supx(x) = -5, infy(x) = 11, supy(x) = 13.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = 5, supx(z) = 11, infy(z) = 2, supy(z) = 8.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 13, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 8, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = 5, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y) is NOT satisfied. ✗

Argh, let me try again.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (-6, 12) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-7, 11), (-5, 13).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (0, 5) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-5, 0), (5, 10).

With these:
- infx(x) = -7, supx(x) = -5, infy(x) = 11, supy(x) = 13.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = -5, supx(z) = 5, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 13, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 10, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 5. So, supx(y) <= supx(z) is NOT satisfied. ✗

OK this is silly: I need that z extends at least as far right as y, which is not the case in my current counterexample. Let's try again.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (-6, 12) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-7, 11), (-5, 13).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (4, 5) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-1, 0), (9, 10).

With these:
- infx(x) = -7, supx(x) = -5, infy(x) = 11, supy(x) = 13.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 10.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 13, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 10, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = -1, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 9. So, supx(y) <= supx(z). ✓
So, y N z is satisfied.

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(z) = -1. Since -5 < -1, x is entirely to the left of z. ✓
- supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 11. Since 10 < 11, x is entirely above z. ✓

This means the relation between x and z is NW (North West).

Let's try to check if x SW z is possible.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (-6, 2) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-7, 1), (-5, 3).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (4, 8) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-1, 3), (9, 13).

With these:

- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 13.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 3, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 13, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = -1, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 9. So, supx(y) <= supx(z). ✓
So, y N z is satisfied.

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(z) = -1. Since -5 < -1, x is entirely to the left of z. ✓
- supy(x) = 3, infy(z) = 3. Since 3 = 3, x is not entirely below z. ✗

OK let's adjust to make it entirely below:

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (-6, 1) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (-7, 0), (-5, 2).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (4, 8) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-1, 3), (9, 13).

With these:
- infx(x) = -7, supx(x) = -5, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 2.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 13.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 2, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 13, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = -1, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 9. So, supx(y) <= supx(z). ✓
So, y N z is satisfied.

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = -5, infx(z) = -1. Since -5 < -1, x is entirely to the left of z. ✓
- supy(x) = 2, infy(z) = 3. Since 2 < 3, x is entirely below z. ✓

This means the relation between x and z is SW (South West).

Let's check if x N z is possible.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (4, 18) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (3, 17), (5, 19).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (4, 8) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-1, 3), (9, 13).

With these:
- infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 17, supy(x) = 19.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 13.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 5, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y) is NOT satisfied. ✗

OK, let's adjust.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (3, 18) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (2, 17), (4, 19).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (4, 8) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-1, 3), (9, 13).

With these:
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 17, supy(x) = 19.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 13.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 4, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 19, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y) is NOT satisfied. ✗

Ah yikes, I see the problem: SW means "south west", i.e., to the left and below. If x is SW of y, then x is to the left and below y, not above y. Let me fix this.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (3, 12) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (2, 11), (4, 13).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (4, 8) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-1, 3), (9, 13).

With these:
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 11, supy(x) = 13.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 13.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 4, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 13, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 13, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = -1, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 9. So, supx(y) <= supx(z). ✓
So, y N z is satisfied.

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = 4, infx(z) = -1. Since 4 > -1, x doesn't satisfy the criteria for SW, W, or NW (being entirely to the left of z).
- infx(x) = 2, supx(z) = 9. Since 2 < 9, x doesn't satisfy the criteria for SE, E, or NE (being entirely to the right of z).
- supy(x) = 13, infy(z) = 3. Since 13 > 3, x doesn't satisfy the criteria for SW, S, or SE (being entirely below z).
- infy(x) = 11, supy(z) = 13. Since 11 < 13, x doesn't satisfy the criteria for NW, N, or NE (being entirely above z).

It seems x overlaps with z in both the x-axis and the y-axis, so the relation between x and z could be a multi-tile relation. But I see now: both x and z extend to y-coordinate 13, so the relation is neither N nor S (because they don't strictly above/below each other). However, it's not B because x is not contained inside of z's bounding box.

Let me try one more example:

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (3, 14) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (2, 13), (4, 15).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (4, 8) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-1, 3), (9, 13).

With these:
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 13, supy(x) = 15.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 13.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 4, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 15, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y) is NOT satisfied. ✗

ARGH, the requirement for SW is supy(x) <= infy(y), which means the top of x is below the bottom of y. Let's try again.

Let's try:
- x: a small circle with center at (3, 13) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (2, 12), (4, 14).
- y: a small circle with center at (5, 15) and radius 1. Its boundary box is (4, 14), (6, 16).
- z: a large circle with center at (4, 8) and radius 5. Its boundary box is (-1, 3), (9, 13).

With these:
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 12, supy(x) = 14.
- infx(y) = 4, supx(y) = 6, infy(y) = 14, supy(y) = 16.
- infx(z) = -1, supx(z) = 9, infy(z) = 3, supy(z) = 13.

Let's check if x SW y:
- supx(x) = 4, infx(y) = 4. So, supx(x) <= infx(y). ✓
- supy(x) = 14, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(x) <= infy(y). ✓
So, x SW y is satisfied.

Let's check if y N z:
- supy(z) = 13, infy(y) = 14. So, supy(z) <= infy(y). ✓
- infx(z) = -1, infx(y) = 4. So, infx(z) <= infx(y). ✓
- supx(y) = 6, supx(z) = 9. So, supx(y) <= supx(z). ✓
So, y N z is satisfied.

Let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(x) = 4, infx(z) = -1. Since 4 > -1, x is not entirely to the left of z. ✗
- infx(x) = 2, supx(z) = 9. Since 2 < 9, x is not entirely to the right of z. ✗
- supy(x) = 14, infy(z) = 3. Since 14
