PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is W of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know: 
- x is SE of y
- y is W of z

Let's recall what these relations mean:

x is SE of y means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

y is W of z means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (y and z overlap in the y-coordinate)

Now we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From "x is SE of y", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

From "y is W of z", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
  This doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z)

- supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
  This means supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
  So we have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)

We need to determine the possible relative positions of x and z. Let's analyze the constraints:

1. On the x-axis:
   - We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z)
   - This means both x and z are to the east of y
   - But we don't know whether x is to the east of z, z is to the east of x, or they overlap in the x-direction

2. On the y-axis:
   - We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - This means x is to the south of y and z has some portion at the same latitude as y or north of y
   - But we don't know the exact relationship between x and z in the y-direction

Based on these constraints, x could be in several possible positions relative to z:

a) If infx(x) >= supx(z), then x is to the east of z.
b) If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the west of z.
c) Otherwise, x and z overlap in the x-direction.

And:

d) If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the south of z.
e) If infy(x) >= supy(z), then x is to the north of z.
f) Otherwise, x and z overlap in the y-direction.

Combining these, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be:

SW: If x is to the west of z and south of z.
S: If x and z overlap in the x-direction and x is to the south of z.
SE: If x is to the east of z and south of z.
W: If x is to the west of z and x and z overlap in the y-direction.
B: If x and z overlap in both x and y directions.
E: If x is to the east of z and x and z overlap in the y-direction.
NW: If x is to the west of z and north of z.
N: If x and z overlap in the x-direction and x is to the north of z.
NE: If x is to the east of z and north of z.

Actually, hold on. Let me rethink this. 

We know:
- x is SE of y: This means x is to the east and south of y.
- y is W of z: This means y is to the west of z, and they have some overlap in the y-direction.

Let's establish a reference frame where y is at the origin (0, 0). Then:
- x is in the southeast quadrant relative to y, so x is somewhere in the region where x > 0 and y < 0.
- z is to the east of y, so z is somewhere in the region where x > 0, and z has some overlap with y in the y-direction, so z's y-coordinate range overlaps with 0.

Now, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Given that x is to the south of y and z has some overlap with y in the y-direction, x is likely to be to the south of z as well, or at least have some southern component.

Given that both x and z are to the east of y, they could be in various configurations along the x-axis: x could be further east than z, z could be further east than x, or they could have some overlap.

Actually, I'm getting confused in this approach. Let me start again with a more systematic approach.

Let's use the definitions provided:
- x is SE of y means supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
- y is W of z means supx(y) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).

We want to determine the possible relations between x and z, which depend on the relative positions of their bounding boxes in the x and y directions.

Let's analyze the x-direction:
- From "x is SE of y", we have supx(y) <= infx(x).
- From "y is W of z", we have supx(y) <= infx(z).
- Combining these, we can't directly infer a relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). 
- Therefore, in the x-direction, x and z could be in any configuration: x could be to the east of z, to the west of z, or they could overlap.

Now, let's analyze the y-direction:
- From "x is SE of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y).
- From "y is W of z", we have infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
- Combining these, we get supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
- This doesn't directly give us a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Actually, let me draw a picture to think about this more clearly. 

Let's put y at the origin, and draw the regions around it:

```
    |
NW  |  N  |  NE
----|-----|----
    |     |
 W  |  y  |  E
    |     |
----|-----|----
SW  |  S  |  SE
    |     
```

Now, x is in the SE quadrant of y, which means it's somewhere here:

```
    |
    |     |
----|-----|----
    |     |
    |  y  |
    |     |
----|-----|----
    |     |  x
    |     
```

And z is to the W of y, with some overlap in the y-direction. So z is somewhere like this:

```
    |
    |     |
----|-----|----
    |     |
  z |  y  |
    |     |
----|-----|----
    |     |  x
    |     
```

Now, what are the possible relations between x and z? 

Looking at the diagram, x is to the southeast of y, and z is to the west of y with some overlap in the y-direction. So x could be:
- SE of z (if x is to the east of z and south of z)
- S of z (if x overlaps with z in the x-direction and is to the south of z)
- E of z (if x is to the east of z and overlaps with z in the y-direction)
- B would be possible if x and z overlap in both directions.

In fact, x could also be:
- SW of z (if x is to the west of z and south of z)
- W of z (if x is to the west of z and overlaps with z in the y-direction)
- NW of z (if x is to the west of z and north of z)
- N of z (if x overlaps with z in the x-direction and is to the north of z)
- NE of z (if x is to the east of z and north of z)

So, it seems like all nine cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z.

Actually, I realized something. I need to be careful with the way I drew the picture. Let me try again.

Given "x is SE of y", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y.
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y.

Given "y is W of z", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): y and z have some overlap in the y-direction.

Let me draw a picture again, more carefully this time. If y is at the origin, then:

```
    |
    |     |
----|-----|----
    |     |
    |  y  |   z
    |     |
----|-----|----
    |     |  x
    |     
```

From the diagram, it seems clear that x could be SE, S, or E of z.

Hold on, I don't think this diagram is accurate. Let me be more precise.

Given "x is SE of y", x is in the following region:

```
   y
    +--------+
    |        |
    |        |
    +--------+
             \
              \
               x
```

Given "y is W of z", y and z are positioned like this:

```
      z
      +--------+
      |        |
   y  |        |
+-----|-----+  |
|     |     |  |
|     |     |  |
+-----|-----+  |
      |        |
      +--------+
```

Combining these, we get:

```
      z
      +--------+
      |        |
   y  |        |
+-----|-----+  |
|     |     |  |
|     |     |  |
+-----|-----+  |
      |        |
      +--------+
             \
              \
               x
```

From this diagram, it seems like x could be S, SE, or E of z.

But I want to be even more careful. Let's consider the constraints more directly.

From "x is SE of y", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x.
- supy(x) <= infy(y): The topmost point of x is below the bottommost point of y.

From "y is W of z", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): The y-coordinate ranges of y and z overlap.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

First, in the x-direction:
- We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
- This means both x and z are to the right of y.
- But we don't have a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z) or supx(x) and supx(z).
- So, x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or they could overlap in the x-direction.

Next, in the y-direction:
- We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
- This means x is below y, and z overlaps with y in the y-direction.
- For x to be below z, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(z).
- But we can't directly derive this from the given constraints.
- So, x could be below z, above z, or they could overlap in the y-direction.

So the realtionships that we can have are:

- SW (if x is to the west of z and below z)
- S (if x and z overlap in the x-direction and x is below z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z and below z)
- W (if x is to the west of z and x and z overlap in the y-direction)
- B (if x and z overlap in both the x and y directions)
- E (if x is to the east of z and x and z overlap in the y-direction)
- NW (if x is to the west of z and above z)
- N (if x and z overlap in the x-direction and x is above z)
- NE (if x is to the east of z and above z)

Hold on, let's reconsider the diagram. We're given that:
- x is SE of y: This places x in the southeast quadrant relative to y.
- y is W of z: This places y to the west of z, with some overlap in the y-direction.

Let's draw this more carefully:

```
        z
     +------+
     |      |
     |      |
y    |      |
+------+    |
|      |    |
|      |    |
+------+    |
     |      |
     +------+
        
        x
     +------+
     |      |
     |      |
     |      |
     +------+
```

Wait, I don't think this is correct because x is supposed to be SE of y. Let me redraw:

```
        z
     +------+
     |      |
y    |      |
+------+    |
|      |    |
|      |    |
+------+    |
     |      |
     +------+
            
           x
        +------+
        |      |
        |      |
        |      |
        +------+
```

Actually, we don't know the exact positions, only the constraints. Let me start with y and then place x and z according to the constraints:

y is somewhere:
```
y
+------+
|      |
|      |
|      |
+------+
```

x is SE of y, so it's somewhere here:
```
y
+------+
|      |
|      |
|      |
+------+
        \
         \
          x
       +------+
       |      |
       |      |
       |      |
       +------+
```

z is such that y is W of z, so z is somewhere here:
```
              z
           +------+
           |      |
y          |      |
+------+   |      |
|      |   |      |
|      |   |      |
|      |   |      |
+------+   |      |
           +------+
        \
         \
          x
       +------+
       |      |
       |      |
       |      |
       +------+
```

But the diagram is misleading because it suggests specific positions, which we don't have. We only have constraints on the relative positions.

Let's re-approach this. We know "x is SE of y", which means x is to the southeast of y. And we know "y is W of z", which means y is to the west of z, with some overlap in the y-direction.

Now, let's think about the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If x is very far to the south and not too far east, it could be southwest of z (SW).
2. If x is very far to the south and somewhat to the east, it could be south of z (S).
3. If x is very far to the south and very far to the east, it could be southeast of z (SE).
4. If x is somewhat to the south and not too far east, it could be west of z (W).
5. If x is somewhat to the south and somewhat to the east, it could be within the bounding box of z (B).
6. If x is somewhat to the south and very far to the east, it could be east of z (E).
7. If x is not very far to the south (or even to the north) and not too far east, it could be northwest of z (NW).
8. If x is not very far to the south (or even to the north) and somewhat to the east, it could be north of z (N).
9. If x is not very far to the south (or even to the north) and very far to the east, it could be northeast of z (NE).

Actually hold on, let's use logic here. Recall that "x is SE of y" means:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

And "y is W of z" means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is to the west of z
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): y and z have some overlap in the y-direction

Now, let's think about the constraints on x and z.

From "supx(y) <= infx(x)" and "supx(y) <= infx(z)", we know both x and z are to the east of y. But we don't have a direct relationship between x and z in the x-direction.

From "supy(x) <= infy(y)" and "infy(z) <= infy(y)", we know x is to the south of y's lower bound and z's lower bound is below or equal to y's lower bound. This means x is to the south of y, and z can extend below y. But again, we don't have a direct relationship between x and z in the y-direction.

So, in the x-direction, x could be to the east of z, to the west of z, or they could overlap.

In the y-direction, x could be to the south of z, or they could overlap, or (and this is a key insight) x could even be to the north of z if z extends far enough below y.

Given these possibilities, all nine cardinal direction relations between x and z seem possible.

Actually I think I reasoned wrong. Let me think more carefully. We have:

From "x is SE of y":
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

From "y is W of z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is to the west of z
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): y and z have some overlap in the y-direction

From the second point, we have "supy(x) <= infy(y)" which means x is below the lower bound of y. From the fourth point, we have "infy(z) <= infy(y)" which means the lower bound of z is below or equal to the lower bound of y.

This means supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).

But we can't derive a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from these.

If infy(z) is strictly less than infy(y), then we can have supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) < infy(y). This doesn't tell us whether supy(x) is less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z).

So, in the y-direction, x could be to the south of z (if supy(x) <= infy(z)), or they could overlap (if supy(x) > infy(z) and infy(x) < supy(z)), or x could even be to the north of z (if infy(x) >= supy(z)).

Similarly, in the x-direction, all arrangements are possible.

This means all nine cardinal direction relations between x and z are possible.

However, that's wrong. I'm not taking into account that the regions are in REG, which means they are homeomorphic to closed disks. Specifically, they are connected.

Let me reconsider. Given that the regions are in REG, they are closed, connected, and have connected boundaries.

From "x is SE of y", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

From "y is W of z", we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is to the west of z
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): y and z have some overlap in the y-direction

Given that regions are connected, the constraints "supx(y) <= infx(x)" and "supy(x) <= infy(y)" mean that x is strictly to the southeast of y, with no overlap in either the x or y direction.

Similarly, "supx(y) <= infx(z)" means y is strictly to the west of z, with no overlap in the x-direction. But "infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)" allows for overlap in the y-direction.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between x and z.

Actually wait I don't think it changes anything. The region restrictions don't change the relative positions.

Actually no, let me reconsider. I think I've been overthinking this problem. Let's go back to the constraints:

From "x is SE of y":
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y

From "y is W of z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is to the west of z
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): y and z have some overlap in the y-direction

From these, we can derive:
- From "supx(y) <= infx(x)" and "supx(y) <= infx(z)", we know both x and z are to the east of y. But we don't know the relationship between x and z in the x-direction.
- From "supy(x) <= infy(y)" and "infy(z) <= infy(y)", we know x is to the south of y's lower bound and z's lower bound is below or equal to y's lower bound. But we don't know the relationship between x and z in the y-direction. However, I need to be careful here: a common mistake is to infer that if both x and z have a bounded y relationship with y, they have a bounded relationship with each other, but this isn't necessarily true.

Given the flexibility in the x and y directions, all nine cardinal direction relations between x and z are possible.

Actually, let's be more specific. Can z be strictly below x in the y-direction (i.e., supy(z) <= infy(x))?

We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

This doesn't tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x) directly.

Let's assume supy(z) <= infy(x) and see if it's consistent with our constraints:
- supy(x) <= infy(y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

This would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y), implying supy(z) <= infy(y), which is not necessarily consistent with infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

Actually, no, that's wrong. infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) don't tell us the relationship between supy(z) and infy(y). So our assumption isn't inconsistent.

Actually let's think more systematically. We're considering the possibility of x being N of z (amongst other directions). Let's see if that's consistent with our constraints.

For x to be N of z, we need:
- infy(x) >= supy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) (x overlaps with z in the x-direction)

Is this consistent with our constraints?

We know:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) (from "x is SE of y")
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from "y is W of z")

For infy(x) >= supy(z), we'd need:
- infy(x) >= supy(z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from "y is W of z")

This would mean supy(y) <= supy(z) <= infy(x).

But we also know supy(x) <= infy(y).

So, we'd have: supy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x).

This doesn't seem consistent unless x and y are far apart in the y-direction. But I know that's not necessarily true based on our constraints, and it's not accurate.

OK, wait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try a different approach. Let's use a coordinate system and place y at the origin (0, 0) with a bounding box of [(-1, -1), (1, 1)] for simplicity.

Given "x is SE of y", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x): The x-coordinate of x is greater than 1.
- supy(x) <= infy(y): The y-coordinate of x is less than -1.

Given "y is W of z", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): The x-coordinate of z is greater than 1.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): The y-coordinate of z can range, but it must overlap with y in the y-direction. So, infy(z) <= -1 and supy(z) >= 1.

Now, let's consider the relationships between x and z.

Given the constraints, x is somewhere to the southeast of y, with x-coordinate greater than 1 and y-coordinate less than -1.

z is somewhere to the east of y, with x-coordinate greater than 1 and a y-coordinate range that overlaps with y.

Based on these, x can be in the following relationships with z in the x-direction:
- x can be to the east of z (if its x-coordinate is far enough to the east).
- x can be to the west of z (if z's x-coordinate is far enough to the east).
- x and z can overlap in the x-direction.

And in the y-direction:
- x can be to the south of z (if its y-coordinate is negative enough).
- x and z can overlap in the y-direction (if z extends far enough to the south).

But can x be to the north of z? For this to be true, we'd need infy(x) >= supy(z). We know supy(x) <= infy(y) (which is -1 in our example). And we know supy(z) >= supy(y) (which is 1 in our example). So, for x to be to the north of z, we'd need infy(x) >= 1. But we also know supy(x) <= -1. This would mean infy(x) >= 1 and supy(x) <= -1, which is a contradiction (since infy(x) <= supy(x)).

So, x cannot be to the north of z. This eliminates the possibilities of x being NW, N, or NE of z.

What about x being W, B, or E of z? For this to be true, x and z would need to overlap in the y-direction. We've established that x is below the y-coordinate of -1, and z overlaps with y in the y-direction, extending from at least -1 to at least 1. So, if z extends far enough to the south, there could be an overlap in the y-direction. This means x can be W, B, or E of z, depending on the x-direction relationship.

Finally, what about x being SW, S, or SE of z? These are certainly possible if x is below the lowest point of z in the y-direction.

Summarizing: x can be SW, S, SE, W, B, or E of z.

Wait, I realized I might have been too restrictive in my interpretation. Let me re-analyze:

We have constraints "infy(z) <= infy(y)" and "supy(y) <= supy(z)". This means the lower bound of z can be at or below the lower bound of y, and the upper bound of z can be at or above the upper bound of y. But it doesn't guarantee that z overlaps with y in the y-direction. For example, z could have a bounding box of [(-2, -2), (2, 2)], which satisfies our constraints but doesn't overlap with y.

Actually wait, the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) is precisely the condition for ensuring some overlap in the y-direction between y and z. That's the definition of overlapping y-coordinate ranges: the lower bound of one should be less than or equal to the upper bound of the other, and vice versa.

So in our simplified coordinate system, if y has a bounding box of [(-1, -1), (1, 1)], the constraints "infy(z) <= infy(y)" and "supy(y) <= supy(z)" mean infy(z) <= -1 and supy(z) >= 1.

back to the relationship between x and z in the y-direction:

- We know supy(x) <= infy(y), so supy(x) <= -1.
- We know infy(z) <= infy(y), so infy(z) <= -1.

If supy(x) <= infy(z), then x is to the south of z. But if supy(x) > infy(z), then there could be an overlap in the y-direction.

But wait, can we have x to the north of z? For this to be true, we'd need infy(x) >= supy(z). We know supy(x) <= -1, and given that regions are connected, we have infy(x) <= supy(x). So, infy(x) <= -1. We also know supy(z) >= 1 from our constraints. So, for x to be to the north of z, we'd need infy(x) >= supy(z) >= 1, which contradicts infy(x) <= -1.

So, x cannot be to the north of z, which rules out NW, N, and NE.

What about x being E of z? This would mean x is to the east of z and overlaps with z in the y-direction. Given the constraints, this is possible if z extends far enough to the south to overlap with x in the y-direction.

Similarly, x can be W of z or B (bounding box) of z if there's an overlap in the y-direction.

And, as we've already established, x can be SW, S, or SE of z if it's below the lowest point of z in the y-direction.

So, the possible relationships are: SW, S, SE, W, B, and E.

OK, hang on. I need to be more rigorous about the calculation. Let's go back to our constraints:

From "x is SE of y":
- supx(y) <= infx(x): The region x is to the east of y.
- supy(x) <= infy(y): The region x is to the south of y.

From "y is W of z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z): The region y is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): The regions y and z have some overlap in the y-direction.

First, let's determine if x can be to the north of z. For this to be true, we'd need infy(x) >= supy(z). 

We know supy(x) <= infy(y) from our constraints. And, since regions are from REG (homeomorphic to closed disks), they are connected, which means infy(x) <= supy(x). So, we have infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y).

We also know supy(y) <= supy(z) from our constraints.

For x to be to the north of z, we'd need infy(x) >= supy(z). But we've established infy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). Combining, we get infy(x) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). This doesn't allow us to determine a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself again. Let's simplify. We want to check if x can be to the north of z.

For x to be to the north of z, we need infy(x) >= supy(z).

We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(x) <= supy(x) (since regions are connected), we get infy(x) <= infy(y).

From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we get... well, we can't directly determine supy(z) in relation to infy(y).

OK wait, I need to figure out if x can be north of z, by computing if there is any way that supy(z) <= infy(x).

We know supy(x) <= infy(y), so infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(y). This means:
infy(x) <= infy(y)

We also know supy(y) <= supy(z), but we don't have a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(y) or infy(x).

Given the constraint infy(z) <= infy(y), z starts at or below the bottom of y. But it is possible for z to be entirely below y (if infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(y)). In this case, x could be to the north of z if infy(x) >= supy(z).

So it seems like x can be potentially north of z. So that N, NE, NW are possible. Let's check the others.

For x to be to the south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).

We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y). From this, we have:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)

But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, x can potentially be to the south of z. This means S, SE, and SW are possible.

For x to be to the east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x).

We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). But we don't have a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). So, x can potentially be to the east of z. This means E, NE, and SE are possible.

For x to be to the west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z).

We know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). But we don't have a direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). So, x can potentially be to the west of z. This means W, NW, and SW are possible.

And if x overlaps with z in both the x and y directions, then x can be B (bounding box) of z.

Oh hang on, let's think very carefully.

For x to be to the north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). Let's check if this is possible given our constraints.

We know supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).

From supy(x) <= infy(y), we have x is to the south of y with no overlap in the y-direction.

From infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we have z overlaps with y in the y-direction.

Let me draw a diagram to help visualize the situation. Let's place y at the origin with a bounding box of [(-1, -1), (1, 1)] for simplicity.

Given "x is SE of y", we have:
- x is to the east of y, so its x-coordinate is greater than 1.
- x is to the south of y, so its y-coordinate is less than -1.

Given "y is W of z", we have:
- z is to the east of y, so its x-coordinate is greater than 1.
- z overlaps with y in the y-direction, so it at least extends from -1 to 1 in the y-direction, but I am careful not to assume it overlaps fully with y. So -1 <= infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(z) >= supy(y).

For x to be to the north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But we know infy(x) <= supy(x) from the connectivity of regions, and supy(x) <= -1 from our constraints. So, infy(x) <= -1.

We also know supy(z) >= 1 from our constraints.

So, we have supy(z) >= 1 and infy(x) <= -1. This means supy(z) > infy(x), which contradicts the condition for x to be to the north of z.

Therefore, x cannot be to the north of z.

OK hold on, I think I'm careful to not mistake infy(z) <= infy(y) with saying z must overlap with y. "y is W of z" gives us that:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z): the y-coordinate range of z extends both below the lower bound of y and above the upper bound of y.

Let infy(y) = -1 and supy(y) = 1. Then from the second constraint, we get infy(z) <= -1 and supy(z) >= 1. This means z ranges from at most -1 to at least 1 in the y-direction.

For x to be to the north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But we've established infy(x) <= supy(x) <= -1 and supy(z) >= 1. So, we have supy(z) >= 1 and infy(x) <= -1, which means supy(z) > infy(x). This contradicts the condition for x to be to the north of z.

OK, let's think more carefully. I think I'm confusing myself here.

For two regions to overlap in the y-direction, we need the lower bound of one to be below the upper bound of the other, and vice versa. More specifically we need:
1. infy(region1) <= supy(region2)
2. infy(region2) <= supy(region1)

So region1 and region2 overlap in the y direction if and only if infy(region1) <= supy(region2) and infy(region2) <= supy(region1).

For "y is W of z", we are told "infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)". Does this mean y and z overlap in the y-direction?

For y and z to overlap in the y-direction, we need:
1. infy(y) <= supy(z)
2. infy(z) <= supy(y)

We're given infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z). From infy(z) <= infy(y), we know z starts below or at the same level as y. From supy(y) <= supy(z), we know z extends above or to the same level as y.

But we haven't proved that infy(y) <= supy(z) or that infy(z) <= supy(y). So I'm not to assume that y and z overlap in y-direction.

Ah OK, now I'm super confused, because it says in the problem statement "y is W of z" means: ... and they overlap in the y-coordinate. I'm looking at the definition of "y is W of z":

"a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)"

So from "y is W of z", we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y): the lower bound of z is below or at the same level as the lower bound of y.
- supy(y) <= supy(z): the upper bound of z is above or at the same level as the upper bound of y.

The third condition supy(y) <= supy(z) doesn't guarantee that infy(y) <= supy(z), which is necessary for y and z to overlap in the y-direction. Similarly, the second condition infy(z) <= infy(y) doesn't guarantee that infy(z) <= supy(y), which is also necessary for overlap.

OK, let's think more clearly. The problem statement says "a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)". From infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b), does this mean a and b overlap in the y-direction?

Let's compute:
- infy(b) <= infy(a)
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

These don't directly imply that infy(a) <= supy(b) or infy(b) <= supy(a), which are needed for y-direction overlap.

But think about the connectedness property of regions in REG. If a and b are connected regions, then infy(a) <= supy(a) and infy(b) <= supy(b). Using these, and the given constraints, we get:
- infy(b) <= infy(a) <= supy(a)
- infy(b) <= supy(b)

This means infy(b) <= supy(a), which is one of the conditions for y-direction overlap. But we still can't directly deduce that infy(a) <= supy(b).

Actually, wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The "W" relation doesn't require a and b to overlap in the y-direction. It's just that a is to the west of b, and there's a specific relationship between their y-bounds.

So, when we say "y is W of z", it means:
- y is to the west of z (no overlap in the x-direction).
- The lower bound of z is at or below the lower bound of y.
- The upper bound of z is at or above the upper bound of y.

This is what the "W" relation means. It doesn't necessarily mean y and z overlap in the y-direction, although they might.

OK let's look at the problem statement more carefully. It says:

```
a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
```

This is precisely the definition of "a is west of b" in the Cardinal Direction Relations. It means a is to the west of b, and there's a specific relationship between their y-bounds.

Given this, let's revisit our constraints:

From "x is SE of y":
- supx(y) <= infx(x): x is to the east of y.
- supy(x) <= infy(y): x is to the south of y.

From "y is W of z":
- supx(y) <= infx(z): y is to the west of z.
- infy(z) <= infy(y): the lower bound of z is at or below the lower bound of y.
- supy(y) <= supy(z): the upper bound of z is at or above the upper bound of y.

Given these constraints, let's determine the possible relationships between x and z.

In the x-direction, both x and z are to the east of y. But we don't know their relative positions. So, x could be to the east of z, to the west of z, or they could overlap in the x-direction.

In the y-direction, x is to the south of y. z's y-bounds are related to y's y-bounds as described above. But again, we don't know the direct relationship between x and z.

Let us actually put some values to make things clearer.

Using a coordinate system:

I'm going to refer again to our diagram where y is at the origin with a bounding box of [(-1, -1), (1, 1)].

Given "x is SE of y", we have:
- x is to the east of y, so infx(x) > 1.
- x is to the south of y, so supy(x) < -1.

Given "y is W of z", we have:
- z is to the east of y, so infx(z) > 1.
- z's lower bound is at or below y's lower bound, so infy(z) <= -1.
- z's upper bound is at or above y's upper bound, so supy(z) >= 1.

There is a lot of flexibility with z. All we know is that infx(z) > 1. supy(z) >= 1 (at least as high as y) infy(z) <= -1 (at least as low as y).

If supy(z) < infy(x), then x is to the north of z. But we've established supy(x) < -1, which, given that regions are connected, means infy(x) < -1 (so infy(x) is certainly less than 1). In fact, I know the full region x is below -1 in the y-coordinate. And we know supy(z) >= 1, which means supy(z) > infy(x). This contradicts the condition for x to be to the north of z.

Therefore, x cannot be to the north of z. This rules out NW, N, and NE as possible relations.

For x to be to the south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(x) < -1 and infy(z) <= -1. This means x can be to the south of z if infy(z) = -1, but it's also possible for infy(z) to be much less than -1, in which case x might not be strictly to the south of z.

For x to be to the east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). Given that both x and z are to the east of y, this is possible depending on their exact positions.

The other combinations are also possible.

Alright, let's once more try a systematic approach.

First, let's consider the x-direction:
- We know both x and z are to the east of y because supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z).
- But we don't know the direct relationship between x and z in the x-direction. So, x could be to the east of z, to the west of z, or they could overlap in the x-direction.

The first step is fine.

Next, let's consider the y-direction:
- We know x is to the south of y because supy(x) <= infy(y).
- For z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means z's y-range extends both below y's lower bound and above y's upper bound.
- For x to be to the north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). Using bounding box coordinates, this would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) < supy(x) < -1. But we've established supy(z) >= 1, which contradicts this. So, x cannot be to the north of z.
- For x to be to the south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). We know supy(x) < -1 and infy(z) <= -1. So, it's possible for x to be to the south of z, but it depends on the exact value of infy(z).
- For x and z to overlap in the y-direction, we need infy(x) <= supy(z) and infy(z) <= supy(x). We know infy(x) < -1 and supy(z) >= 1, so infy(x) <= supy(z) is satisfied. It's also possible for infy(z) <= supy(x) depending on the exact value of infy(z).

Given these possibilities in the x and y directions, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- SW (if x is to the west of z and south of z)
- S (if x overlaps with z in the x-direction and is to the south of z)
- SE (if x is to the east of z and south of z)
- W (if x is to the west of z and overlaps with z in the y-direction)
- B (if x overlaps with z in both the x and y directions)
- E (if x is to the east of z and overlaps with z in the y-direction)

NW, N, and NE are ruled out because we can show x cannot be to the north of z.

OK, I think the answer in this case is SW, S, SE, W, B, E.

Actually, hang on. I think I may have be mistaken. I need to make sure I'm computing the "north" relation correctly. For x to be to the north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). My reasoning was:

1. Given "x is SE of y", we have supy(x) <= infy(y). Using our bounding box notation, this means supy(x) <= -1. If let's say y is at the origin with a [(-1, -1), (1, 1)] bounding box. In other words. Region x has all of its y values less than or equal to -1.
2. Given "y is W of z", we have supy(y) <= supy(z). Using our bounding box notation, this means 1 <= supy(z).
3. For x to be to the north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But from points 1 and 2, we have supy(x) <= -1 and 1 <= supy(z), which implies supy(z) > supy(x). Given that regions are connected, we have infy(x) <= supy(x). So, infy(x) <= supy(x) <= -1, which means infy(x) <= -1. Since 1 <= supy(z), we have supy(z) > infy(x), which means x cannot be to the north of z.

I think the issue with my reasoning is this: For x to be to the north of z, I computed that we need supy(z) <= infy(x). But I should compute it as "z is to the south of x", which is: supy(z) <= infy(x). I think I did it correctly.

In summary, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: SW, S, SE, W, B, E. Actually that's consistent with my initial conclusion: x can be SW, S, SE, W, B, or E of z. Let me double check that NW, N, NE are ruled out:

Let's confirm that x cannot be N of z. For this, we need:
- x and z to overlap in the x-direction (infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(z) or infx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(x))
- x to be to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x))

We've already established that the second condition can't be met because supy(z) > infy(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

Similarly, for x to be NE of z, we need:
- x to be to the east of z (supx(z) <= infx(x))
- x to be to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x))

Again, the second condition can't be met, so x cannot be NE of z.

And for x to be NW of z, we need:
- x to be to the west of z (supx(x) <= infx(z))
- x to be to the north of z (supy(z) <= infy(x))

The second condition is still the issue, so x cannot be NW of z.

Great, I can confirm that:

1. NW, N, and NE are ruled out as possible relations between x and z.
2. x can be SW, S, SE, W, B, or E of z.

This is the final answer.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z, given that x is SE of y and y is W of z.

Let me analyze the constraints:

1) x is SE of y means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x): x is to the east of y
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y): x is to the south of y

2) y is W of z means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z): y is to the west of z
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z): y and z have a specific relationship in the y-direction

Now, I'll determine what this tells us about the possible relationship between x and z:

In the x-direction:
- Both x and z are to the east of y, but we don't know their relative positions.
- x could be east of z, west of z, or they could overlap in the x-direction.

In the y-direction:
- x is strictly south of y
- z's y-range extends both below y's lower bound and above y's upper bound
- For x to be north of z, we would need supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- However, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- This means supy(z) > infy(x), so x cannot be to the north of z

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
SW, S, SE, W, B, E
