PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

This is a question about composition of cardinal direction relations. I need to determine what the possible relations between region x and region z are, given that:
- Region x is N (North) of region y
- Region y is NW (North West) of region z

Let me think about this step by step. First, let's understand what these relations mean:

1. x N y means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is horizontally within the bounds of y)

2. y NW z means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(y) (y is above z)

Now, let's try to determine the possible relations between x and z. 

First, let's think about vertical relations:
- x is North of y (x is above y)
- y is North West of z (y is above z)
- Therefore, x is definitely above z (supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x))

Next, let's think about horizontal relations:
- x is North of y (x is horizontally within the bounds of y)
- y is North West of z (y is to the left of z)

This is where it gets a bit more complex. Since x is horizontally within the bounds of y, and y is to the left of z, there are a few possibilities for the horizontal relationship between x and z:

1. If x is significantly within the horizontal bounds of y and far from the right edge of y, then x could be completely to the left of z (supx(x) <= supx(y) <= infx(z)), making x NW of z.

2. If x extends to the right edge of y, it might overlap horizontally with z, which would make x N of z.

3. If x extends beyond the right edge of y into the area above z, then x could be NE of z.

So the possible relations between x and z could be:
- N (if x is directly above z)
- NW (if x is above and to the left of z)
- NE (if x is above and to the right of z)

Let me double check this by carefully drawing out the constraints:

For x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Given these, what can we say about the relation between x and z?

Vertical relation: From supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x), we can conclude supy(z) <= infy(x), meaning x is above z.

Horizontal relation: 
- We know supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- We also know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

Let's consider the different possibilities:

1. If supx(x) < infx(z), then x is to the left of z. Combined with x being above z, this would make x NW of z.

2. If infx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(x) >= infx(z), then x partially overlaps horizontally with z but extends to the left of z. Combined with x being above z, this would make x NW and N of z, which we would usually denote as a multi-tile relation.

3. If infx(x) >= infx(z) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is horizontally within the bounds of z. Combined with x being above z, this would make x N of z.

4. If infx(x) <= supx(z) and supx(x) >= supx(z), then x partially overlaps horizontally with z but extends to the right of z. Combined with x being above z, this would make x N and NE of z, another multi-tile relation.

5. If infx(x) > supx(z), then x is to the right of z. Combined with x being above z, this would make x NE of z.

Wait, I need to be more careful about these constraints.

Let me first recap what we know. In the xy-plane:
1. Region y is to the northwest of region z. This means y is both to the left of z and above z.
2. Region x is to the north of region y. This means x is above y and horizontally within the span of y.

Let's denote the minimum bounding box of region y as [y_left, y_right] × [y_bottom, y_top], and similarly for regions x and z.

Given:
- x N y: 
  - y_top ≤ x_bottom (x is above y)
  - y_left ≤ x_left and x_right ≤ y_right (x is horizontally within y)

- y NW z: 
  - y_right ≤ z_left (y is to the left of z)
  - z_top ≤ y_bottom (y is above z)

Now, for x and z:
1. Vertical relation: From z_top ≤ y_bottom and y_top ≤ x_bottom, we get z_top ≤ x_bottom. This confirms that x is above z.

2. Horizontal relation: 
   - We know y_right ≤ z_left (y is to the left of z)
   - We also know y_left ≤ x_left and x_right ≤ y_right

From x_right ≤ y_right and y_right ≤ z_left, we can deduce x_right ≤ z_left, which means x is to the left of z.

So, combining both, we can say that region x is both above and to the left of region z, which makes x NW of z.

Wait, I think I made an error in my reasoning. Let me re-examine the constraints:

- x N y:
  - y_top ≤ x_bottom (x is above y)
  - y_left ≤ x_left and x_right ≤ y_right (x is horizontally within the span of y)
  - actually, in terms of the notation in the problem, supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

- y NW z:
  - y_right ≤ z_left (y is to the left of z)
  - z_top ≤ y_bottom (y is above z)
  - in the problem's notation, supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

For the horizontal relation between x and z:
- We know supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- We also know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

For the vertical relation between x and z:
- We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- We also know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x)

From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we can deduce supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is below x, or equivalently, x is above z.

So, combining both, we can say that region x is both above and to the left of region z, which makes x NW of z. 

While it is tempting to say there might be other relations based on the exact placement, given the strict definitions of cardinal directions in the context provided, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I think I made a mistake. Let's be more careful. 

Given:
- x N y means:
  - y is below x: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  - x is within the horizontal span of y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

- y NW z means:
  - y is to the left of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  - y is above z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

I need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

From the vertical relations, it's clear that:
- y is below x: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is above z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- Therefore, x is above z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

For the horizontal relations:
- y is to the left of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- x is within the horizontal span of y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

Given these constraints, the horizontal position of x relative to z could be:
1. x is to the left of z: supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
2. x overlaps horizontally with z: there's no direct contradiction in the constraints. If infx(x) < supx(y) and supx(y) > infx(z), then infx(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than infx(z), and supx(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than supx(z).

So, based on the constraints, x could be:
- NW of z (if x is to the left of z and above z)
- N of z (if x is directly above z, which can happen if their horizontal spans overlap)
- NE of z (if x is to the right of z and above z, though this requires a careful arrangement of the regions)

Let me reconsider this. I think I misunderstood something. Let's be precise:

From the definition of N:
- x N y if and only if supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From the definition of NW:
- y NW z if and only if supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's think about the constraints on x and z:
1. Vertical: From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we have supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means z is below x (or x is above z).

2. Horizontal: We know supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means y is to the left of z. We also know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y). From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

So, combining the vertical and horizontal constraints, x is above and to the left of z, which means x is NW of z.

Actually, I'm overlooking something in my reasoning. Let me be more explicit about the possible arrangements.

Given:
- x N y (x is north of y)
- y NW z (y is northwest of z)

For x N y, we have:
- Vertically: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- Horizontally: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y)

For y NW z, we have:
- Vertically: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- Horizontally: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)

From these, we can determine the following about the relation between x and z:
- Vertically: Since supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we know supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means x is above z.
- Horizontally: We know supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y). From these, we can deduce supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is NW (x is northwest of z).

I'm doubting my conclusion because I haven't fully considered all the possible configurations. Let me approach this differently.

Given the cardinal direction definitions, let's consider regions in the xy-plane divided into 9 tiles by the reference region's bounding box.

For x N y, x is in the "North" tile of y.
For y NW z, y is in the "Northwest" tile of z.

Let's denote the minimum bounding box of a region a as [infx(a), supx(a)] × [infy(a), supy(a)].

Given:
- x N y: 
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y)

- y NW z: 
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

For the relationship between x and z:
- Vertically: From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we can deduce supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means x is above z.
- Horizontally: From supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y), we can deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z.

Given these constraints, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NW (Northwest). x is both above and to the left of z.

Let's try to confirm this with a specific example. Suppose:
- Region y: [0, 10] × [0, 10]
- Region z: [20, 30] × [-10, 0]
- Region x: [2, 8] × [15, 25]

With these regions:
- x is north of y: 10 ≤ 15 (y_top ≤ x_bottom), 0 ≤ 2 (y_left ≤ x_left), and 8 ≤ 10 (x_right ≤ y_right).
- y is northwest of z: 10 ≤ 20 (y_right ≤ z_left) and -10 ≤ 0 (z_top ≤ y_bottom).
- x is northwest of z: 8 ≤ 20 (x_right ≤ z_left) and -10 ≤ 15 (z_top ≤ x_bottom).

This confirms that if x is north of y, and y is northwest of z, then x is northwest of z.

Let me think again more carefully. 

Given:
- x N y: 
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y)

- y NW z: 
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

Looking at the vertical relation between x and z:
From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we can deduce supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means x is above z.

Looking at the horizontal relation between x and z:
From supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is at most as far right as y), we can deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z.

Given these constraints, x is both above and to the left of z, which is the definition of x being NW of z. So, the possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I realized an issue with my reasoning. 

When I said "x is horizontally within y," I meant that the horizontal projection of x is contained within the horizontal projection of y. This is indeed what the N relation implies: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).

This means that the leftmost point of x is to the right of (or at the same position as) the leftmost point of y, and the rightmost point of x is to the left of (or at the same position as) the rightmost point of y. In other words, the horizontal span of x is contained within the horizontal span of y.

Given that y is NW of z, and thus to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), and given that x is horizontally contained within y (supx(x) ≤ supx(y)), we can deduce that x is also to the left of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)).

Combining this with the fact that x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), we can conclude that x is NW of z.

So, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, let's ensure I've considered the full problem space. I need to think about all possible arrangements given the constraints, to see if there are any other possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Given:
- x N y: 
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y)

- y NW z: 
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

Looking at the vertical relation, it's clear that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z. This is necessary for the cardinal relations N, NW, and NE.

Looking at the horizontal relation, I deduced that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This is necessary for the cardinal relation NW.

So, given the constraints, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NW.

Actually no, there's a subtle issue I'm missing. Let's consider another arrangement:

Suppose:
- Region y: [0, 20] × [0, 10]
- Region z: [30, 50] × [-10, 0]
- Region x: [15, 25] × [15, 25]

With these regions:
- x is north of y: 10 ≤ 15 (y_top ≤ x_bottom), 0 ≤ 15 (y_left ≤ x_left), and 25 ≥ 20 (x_right ≥ y_right).

Wait, this example doesn't satisfy the constraints of the North relation. For x N y, we need supx(x) ≤ supx(y), which means the rightmost point of x is to the left of (or at the same position as) the rightmost point of y. But in my example, the rightmost point of x (25) is to the right of the rightmost point of y (20), so this doesn't work.

Let me adjust the example:
- Region y: [0, 20] × [0, 10]
- Region z: [30, 50] × [-10, 0]
- Region x: [5, 15] × [15, 25]

With these regions:
- x is north of y: 10 ≤ 15 (y_top ≤ x_bottom), 0 ≤ 5 (y_left ≤ x_left), and 15 ≤ 20 (x_right ≤ y_right).
- y is northwest of z: 20 ≤ 30 (y_right ≤ z_left) and -10 ≤ 0 (z_top ≤ y_bottom).
- And for x and z: 15 ≤ 30 (x_right ≤ z_left) and -10 ≤ 15 (z_top ≤ x_bottom), which means x is NW of z.

I still believe the only possible relation is NW. However, I want to double check yet again.

The cardinal direction relation between two regions is determined by the position of the primary region with respect to the reference region's minimum bounding box, which is the box formed by the straight lines x=infx(reference), x=supx(reference), y=infy(reference), and y=supy(reference).

Given:
- x N y (x is North of y)
- y NW z (y is Northwest of z)

For the vertical relation between x and z:
- From x N y, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- From y NW z, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
- Transitively, we can conclude supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z.

For the horizontal relation between x and z:
- From x N y, we know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- From y NW z, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
- Combining these, we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Given that x is both above and to the left of z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, looking back at this, I don't think I was clear enough in my previous reasoning about when we say "x is horizontally within y". 

If x is spatially related to y by the relation North (denoted as x N y), then:
1. x is above y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
2. x is horizontally aligned with y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

The horizontal alignment means that the horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of y. In other words, the leftmost point of x is to the right of (or at the same position as) the leftmost point of y, and the rightmost point of x is to the left of (or at the same position as) the rightmost point of y.

Given:
- x N y and
- y NW z

Let's again reason carefully about the constraints:

From x N y:
- x is above y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- The horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of y: infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From y NW z:
- y is to the left of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- y is above z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

For the vertical relation between x and z:
From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we can deduce supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means x is above z.

For the horizontal relation between x and z:
From supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (the horizontal extent of x is contained within the horizontal extent of y), we can deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This means x is to the left of z.

Given that x is both above and to the left of z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NW.

I'm very confident that this reasoning is correct, and the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, and I've been fixating on one solution, but I should approach it more comprehensively. 

Given:
- x N y: 
  - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y)

- y NW z: 
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

Looking at the vertical relation:
From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we know supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means x is above z. This is necessary for the cardinal relations N, NW, and NE.

Looking at the horizontal relation:
From y NW z, we know y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)). From x N y, we know x is horizontally contained within y (supx(x) ≤ supx(y)). From these, we can deduce supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. This is the constraint for the relation W or any relation that includes West (SW, W, NW).

Given that x is both above z and to the left of z, the only possible cardinal direction relation is NW.

So, to answer the question directly: The possible relation between region x and region z, given that x is N of y and y is NW of z, is solely NW.

Actually I still have concerns as to whether the constraints force x to be to the left of z. Let me think of a concrete example where x might not be to the left of z, yet the conditions that x N y and y NW z are satisfied.

Let's see if I can construct a specific arrangement:
- y: [0, 20] × [0, 10]
- z: [30, 50] × [-10, 0]

So far, y is NW of z: supx(y) = 20 ≤ infx(z) = 30, and supy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 0.

Now, let's see if I can position x in a way that it's north of y but not to the left of z. For x to be north of y, it needs to be above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x)) and horizontally within y (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)). For x to not be to the left of z, we need infx(x) >= infx(z).

- x: [30, 40] × [15, 25]

But wait, this doesn't work because for x to be north of y, we need supx(x) ≤ supx(y), which means the rightmost point of x should be at most 20, but I set it to 40. Let me adjust:

- x: [15, 20] × [15, 25]

Now, x is north of y: 10 ≤ 15 (y_top ≤ x_bottom), 0 ≤ 15 (y_left ≤ x_left), and 20 ≤ 20 (x_right ≤ y_right).
And y is northwest of z: 20 ≤ 30 (y_right ≤ z_left) and 0 ≤ 0 (z_top ≤ y_bottom).

But the relation between x and z:
- x_right = 20, z_left = 30, so x_right ≤ z_left, which means x is to the left of z.
- z_top = -10, x_bottom = 15, so z_top ≤ x_bottom, which means x is above z.

So, even in this tried example, x is NW of z.

Let's double check why. From the constraints on x N y and the constraints on y NW z, specifically, if x is horizontally contained within y (supx(x) ≤ supx(y)), and y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z)), then transitively, supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z. There's no way around this transitivity in the horizontal dimension. 

Adding  to this the constraint in the vertical dimension, namely that x is above z (derivable from x being above y, and y being above z), we are left with the only possible relation between x and z being NW.

Actually, let's approach this in yet another manner. If x is not NW of z, then x must be in a relation that's one of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, or B with respect to z. Let's see if any of these can be satisfied while also maintaining x N y and y NW z. We already know x is above z (given the vertical constraints from x N y and y NW z). This rules out the relations E, SE, S, SW, or B. So, x could potentially be in a relation that's one of N, NE, or W with respect to z. Let's check each.

For x N z: 
- x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). This is satisfied.
- x is horizontally within z (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)). But from x N y, we know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y), and from y NW z, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z). Combining these, we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts the condition for x N z. So, x cannot be N of z.

For x NE z: 
- x is above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). This is satisfied.
- x is to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)). But from x N y, we know infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and from y NW z, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z). If we combine these, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), but it's unclear how infx(x) relates to infx(z). So we can't definitively say whether x can be NE of z. The constraints we have don't prohibit x from being to the right of z in this scenario.

Actually, I made a mistake. From x N y, we know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y), and from y NW z, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z). Combining these, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). The constraint supx(x) ≤ infx(z) means x is to the left of z, which is the defining criterion for NW, W, or SW. Since we've already established that x is above z, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

For x W z: 
- x is horizontally aligned with z (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)). But from x N y, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x), and from y NW z, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y). Combining these, we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z. This contradicts the condition for x W z. So, x cannot be W of z.

In conclusion, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I just realized that the cardinal directions in the definition provided involve strict inequalities. Let me re-read the definition...

Actually, upon re-reading the definitions, it seems there's a mix of inclusive and exclusive inequalities. But in the end, the reasoning applies: given x N y and y NW z, the only possible relation between x and z is NW.

Actually, I think the definitions have non-strict inequalities, not strict ones as I mistakenly said. Let me re-examine just to be sure:

a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).

a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).

I see, so N means a is directly above b and horizontally contained within the width of b. NW means a is both to the left of and above b. Given:

- x N y (x is north of y)
- y NW z (y is northwest of z)

I want to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

For the vertical relation between x and z:
- From x N y, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
- From y NW z, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y).
- Transitively, we can conclude supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z.

For the horizontal relation between x and z:
- From x N y, we know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y).
- From y NW z, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z).
- Combining these, we get supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

Given that x is both above and to the left of z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between x and z is NW.

In conclusion, the possible relation between region x and region z, given that x is N of y and y is NW of z, is solely NW.

Wait, I think I still have a mistake in a separate part of the problem. Let me recheck the definitions once more. 

Actually, on reviewing the problem yet again, I see that the relation between x and z must be one of the 9 cardinal direction relations: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE. Each of these has a specific definition in terms of the minimum bounding box of the reference region. Given that:

1. x is above z (due to transitivity from x being above y and y being above z),
2. x is to the left of z (due to transitivity from x being horizontally within y and y being to the left of z),

The only relation compatible with these constraints is NW (x is northwest of z).

So, the answer to the question "If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?" is NW.

Ok, I think I've figured out the issue: the problem is that the cardinal directions are multi-tile relations, so I was concerned that the conditions may not entirely lock down the relationship. But given the strict constraints on North (both being above and within the horizontal span) and Northwest (both being above and to the left), the relation between x and z is unambiguously Northwest.

So, to succinctly answer the question: If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

Actually let's just double-check whether there can be multiple relations, by re-checking the definition:

"""

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

"""

So this is saying that a region being in relation R1:...:Rk with another region means there are regions a1...ak, with a1 corresponding to R1, etc., and their union being the original region. However, it's not clear to me if the question is asking about the relationship between x and z as a multi-tile relation or as a single-tile relation.

Let's assume the question is about the relationship as a single-tile relation. Then, as we've conclusively established, the only possible relation is NW.

If the question is about multi-tile relations, then given that 
1. x is above z (due to transitivity from x being above y and y being above z),
2. x is to the left of z (due to transitivity from x being horizontally within y and y being to the left of z),
the only possible combination is still NW.

In conclusion, the possible relation between region x and region z, given that x is N of y and y is NW of z, is solely NW.

Actually, I think the confusion or the over-complication is my fault. The problem statement says a cardinal direction relation can be an expression R1: ... : Rk, but looking back at the definitions, the relations B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE are all 'single-tile' cardinal direction relations. A region a is in a single-tile relation with reference region b if certain constraints on their bounding boxes are met. For a multi-tile relation, a region a is broken down into subregions, each of which is in a single-tile relation with the reference region b. This means a multi-tile relation is represented as a combination of single-tile relations.

Given the constraints we've determined, namely that x is above z and to the left of z, the only possible single-tile relation between x and z is NW. If we were to consider multi-tile relations, then we'd need to know more about the shape of region x to determine if it can span multiple tiles with respect to z.

However, the conclusion remains: given the constraints from x N y and y NW z, the spatial relationship between x and z is such that x is northwest of z, making the relation NW.

I just double-checked that we can also come to this conclusion by thinking about the 9-intersection approach. The 9-intersection approach divides the 2D plane into 9 tiles with respect to a reference region: the reference region itself, and the 8 directions around it. Given our constraints, region x must lie entirely within the NW (northwest) tile with respect to region z. Hence, the relation between x and z is NW.

So, to answer the question one last time: If region x is N of region y and region y is NW of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x N y (x is North of y)
- y NW z (y is Northwest of z)

Let's analyze the constraints:

For x N y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally within y)

For y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)

From these, I can determine:

1. Vertical relation between x and z:
   From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   This means x is above z.

2. Horizontal relation between x and z:
   From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   This means x is to the left of z.

Since x is both above and to the left of z, the only possible cardinal direction relation is NW.

The answer is: NW
