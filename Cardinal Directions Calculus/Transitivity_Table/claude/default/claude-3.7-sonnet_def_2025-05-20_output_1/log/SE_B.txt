PROMPT: If region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I'll think through this step by step using the definitions of cardinal direction relations.

Given:
- region x is SE of region y
- region y is B of region z

Let's analyze what each of these means:

1. x SE y means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

2. y B z means:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) [z's left bound is to the left of or equal to y's left bound]
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) [y's right bound is to the left of or equal to z's right bound]
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) [z's bottom bound is below or equal to y's bottom bound]
   - supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's top bound is below or equal to z's top bound]

This means that y is contained within z's bounding box.

Now, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z. 

From x SE y, I know that x is to the southeast of y, which means x is to the right of and below y.
From y B z, I know that y is contained within z's bounding box.

Let's consider the possibilities:

If y is at the extreme southeast corner of z, then x could potentially be:
- SE of z (if x is completely outside z's bounding box)
- E of z (if x aligns with z's vertical extent but is to the right of z)
- S of z (if x aligns with z's horizontal extent but is below z)
- SE:S of z (if x spans both SE and S regions of z)
- SE:E of z (if x spans both SE and E regions of z)
- SE:S:E of z (if x spans SE, S, and E regions of z)

If y is not at the extreme southeast corner of z but somewhere else inside z, then x could potentially be:
- SE of z
- E of z
- S of z
- B of z (if z is large enough that x falls within its bounding box)
- Any combination of these that forms a valid cardinal direction relation

Let's analyze this more carefully.

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [z's left bound is to the left of or equal to y's left bound]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [y's right bound is to the left of or equal to z's right bound]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [z's bottom bound is below or equal to y's bottom bound]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's top bound is below or equal to z's top bound]

Let's combine these to determine the constraints on x relative to z:

For the x-coordinate:
- From x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y B z: supx(y) <= supx(z)
- Therefore: supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z))
- This doesn't directly give us a constraint on x relative to z.

However, it's possible that supx(z) < infx(x), which would mean x is to the east of z (E or SE or NE).
It's also possible that infx(x) <= supx(z), which would mean x could potentially overlap with z in the x-direction.

For the y-coordinate:
- From x SE y: supy(x) <= infy(y)
- From y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y)
- Therefore: supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
- This doesn't directly give us a constraint on x relative to z.

However, it's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), which would mean x is to the south of z (S or SW or SE).
It's also possible that infy(z) < supy(x), which would mean x could potentially overlap with z in the y-direction.

Given these possibilities, the cardinal direction of x relative to z could be:
- SE (if x is to the southeast of z)
- E (if x is to the east of z and overlaps with z in the y-direction)
- S (if x is to the south of z and overlaps with z in the x-direction)
- B (if x overlaps with z in both the x and y directions)

But I realize the above analysis is not precise. Let me try again more carefully.

Given:
- x SE y: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y)
- y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's break down the possible relative positions of x and z for each direction:

Southeast (SE): For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
- From x SE y, we have supx(y) <= infx(x), but we don't know if supx(z) <= infx(x).
- From x SE y, we have supy(x) <= infy(y), and from y B z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y). This means supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), but we don't know if supy(x) <= infy(z).

So, SE is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

East (E): For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- From the analysis above, supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible but not guaranteed.
- We don't have direct constraints on infy(x) and supy(z) relative to each other, so it's possible that infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

So, E is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

South (S): For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
- From the analysis above, supy(x) <= infy(z) is possible but not guaranteed.
- We don't have direct constraints on infx(x) and supx(x) relative to infx(z) and supx(z), so it's possible that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, S is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

Bounding Box (B): For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
- We don't have direct constraints that guarantee these conditions, but they are possible.

So, B is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

Actually, I'm getting a bit confused with the approach I'm taking. Let me try a different approach by drawing out a simple example. I'll represent the regions as bounding boxes for simplicity:

Let's say z is the outer box, y is inside z (since y B z), and x is to the southeast of y (x SE y).

Here's a visualization where z is denoted by '-', y by '+', and x by '*':

```
--------------
|            |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++      |
|            |
|            |
--------------
             *****
             *****
```

In this case, x is SE of z.

Let's try another configuration:

```
--------------
|            |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++      |
|            |
--------------
     *****
     *****
```

In this case, x is S of z.

Another configuration:

```
--------------
|            |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++      |
--------------
|  *****     |
|  *****     |
--------------
```

In this case, x is S of z (assuming z includes the bottom part).

One more:

```
--------------
|            |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++     *|
|            *|
|            *|
--------------
```

In this case, x is E of z.

And one last one:

```
--------------
|            |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++      |
|  ++++  **** |
|        **** |
|            |
--------------
```

In this case, x is B of z (assuming x is entirely within z).

Based on these simple examples, it seems like x could be SE, S, E, or B relative to z, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Let me double-check if there's a way to determine more relations by combining different bounds.

Actually, let me back up and organize my approach. I'll start with x SE y and y B z, and I'll see what constraints these relations impose on the bounds of x and z.

From x SE y, we have:
1. supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
2. supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

From y B z, we have:
3. infx(z) <= infx(y) [z's left bound is to the left of or equal to y's left bound]
4. supx(y) <= supx(z) [y's right bound is to the left of or equal to z's right bound]
5. infy(z) <= infy(y) [z's bottom bound is below or equal to y's bottom bound]
6. supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's top bound is below or equal to z's top bound]

Now, I want to derive constraints on the bounds of x relative to z.

From 1 and 4, we get:
supx(y) <= min(infx(x), supx(z))
This doesn't give us a direct constraint, but it means that infx(x) could be greater than or equal to supx(z) (meaning x is to the east of z) or it could be less than supx(z) (meaning x overlaps with z in the x-direction).

From 2 and 5, we get:
supy(x) <= infy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
Again, this doesn't give us a direct constraint, but it means that supy(x) could be less than or equal to infy(z) (meaning x is to the south of z) or it could be greater than infy(z) (meaning x overlaps with z in the y-direction).

Let's consider the different possible cardinal directions of x relative to z:

1. x SE z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), we know from 1 that supx(y) <= infx(x), and from 4 that supx(y) <= supx(z). This means SE z is possible, but not guaranteed.
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), we know from 2 that supy(x) <= infy(y), and from 5 that infy(z) <= infy(y). This doesn't guarantee supy(x) <= infy(z). But if infy(z) = infy(y), then SE is possible.

2. x S z: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), we know from 3 that infx(z) <= infx(y), and from 1 that supx(y) <= infx(x). If infx(y) is considerably less than supx(y), then it's possible to have infx(z) <= infx(x). But if infx(y) is close to supx(y), then it's also possible to have infx(x) < infx(z), which would rule out S.
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints, so it's possible.
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), as analyzed earlier, it's possible but not guaranteed.

3. x E z: This requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For supx(z) <= infx(x), as analyzed earlier, it's possible but not guaranteed.
   - For infy(z) <= infy(x), we know from 5 that infy(z) <= infy(y), and from 2 that supy(x) <= infy(y). But this doesn't give us a direct constraint on infy(x) and infy(z).
   - For supy(x) <= supy(z), we know from 2 that supy(x) <= infy(y), and from 6 that supy(y) <= supy(z). Again, this doesn't give us a direct constraint.

4. x B z: This requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), as analyzed earlier, it's possible but not guaranteed.
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints, so it's possible.
   - For infy(z) <= infy(x), as analyzed earlier, we don't have direct constraints.
   - For supy(x) <= supy(z), as analyzed earlier, we don't have direct constraints, but it's possible.

5. x SW z: This requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), we know from 3 that infx(z) <= infx(y), and from 1 that supx(y) <= infx(x). This means supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which doesn't give us a direct constraint on supx(x) and infx(z). But in a common spatial configuration, we might have supx(x) > infx(z), which would rule out SW.
   - For supy(x) <= infy(z), as analyzed earlier, it's possible but not guaranteed.

I think some of the relations I'm ruling out aren't strictly impossible, but more that the definitions of the cardinal relations might not allow for them in common spatial configurations. Let me check the SW and other directions more carefully.

Actually, I'm getting a bit lost in the details. Let me approach this differently. 

Let's say region z is fixed. Then, region y can be anywhere inside z (since y B z). Given that y is inside z, region x is to the southeast of y (x SE y). Depending on where y is inside z, x could be in different positions relative to z.

Let's consider some examples:

1. If y is at the northwest corner of z, then x (which is southeast of y) could be entirely inside z. In this case, x B z.
2. If y is at the northeast corner of z, then x (which is southeast of y) would be to the southeast of z. In this case, x SE z.
3. If y is at the southwest corner of z, then x (which is southeast of y) would be to the south of z. In this case, x S z.
4. If y is at the southeast corner of z, then x (which is southeast of y) would be to the southeast of z. In this case, x SE z.
5. If y is at the center of z, then x (which is southeast of y) could be to the east of z, to the south of z, or to the southeast of z, depending on how far southeast x is from y. So, x E z, x S z, or x SE z are possible.

In addition to these, if y is close to the eastern boundary of z, then x (which is southeast of y) would be to the east of z. In this case, x E z.

And if y is close to the southern boundary of z, then x (which is southeast of y) would be to the south of z. In this case, x S z.

So, based on this analysis, x could be SE, S, E, or B relative to z, depending on the exact positions of the regions. Let me check if we can determine additional possible relations.

Actually, I'm not considering the definitions carefully enough. Let me revisit them.

For region a to be SE of region b, we need:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) [a is to the east of b]
- supy(a) <= infy(b) [a is to the south of b]

For region a to be S of region b, we need:
- supy(a) <= infy(b) [a is to the south of b]
- infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) [a's x-extent is contained within b's x-extent]

For region a to be E of region b, we need:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) [a is to the east of b]
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) [a's y-extent is contained within b's y-extent]

For region a to be B of region b, we need:
- infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) [a's x-extent is contained within b's x-extent]
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) [a's y-extent is contained within b's y-extent]

For region a to be SW of region b, we need:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) [a is to the west of b]
- supy(a) <= infy(b) [a is to the south of b]

For region a to be W of region b, we need:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) [a is to the west of b]
- infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b) [a's y-extent is contained within b's y-extent]

For region a to be NW of region b, we need:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) [a is to the west of b]
- supy(b) <= infy(a) [a is to the north of b]

For region a to be N of region b, we need:
- supy(b) <= infy(a) [a is to the north of b]
- infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b) [a's x-extent is contained within b's x-extent]

For region a to be NE of region b, we need:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) [a is to the east of b]
- supy(b) <= infy(a) [a is to the north of b]

Now, I'll carefully analyze each case:

1. x SE z: For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - From y B z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - It's possible that supx(z) = supx(y), in which case supx(z) <= infx(x). But it's also possible that supx(y) < supx(z), in which case we can't determine if supx(z) <= infx(x).
   - From x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
   - From y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y).
   - It's possible that infy(z) = infy(y), in which case supy(x) <= infy(z). But it's also possible that infy(z) < infy(y), in which case we can't determine if supy(x) <= infy(z).
   
   So, x SE z is possible, but not guaranteed.

2. x S z: For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - The analysis for supy(x) <= infy(z) is the same as for SE.
   - From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
   - It's possible that infx(z) = infx(y), in which case we'd need to compare infx(z) with infx(x). But with the given constraints, we can't determine if infx(z) <= infx(x).
   - We also can't determine if supx(x) <= supx(z) with the given constraints.
   
   So, x S z is possible, but not guaranteed.

3. x E z: For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - The analysis for supx(z) <= infx(x) is the same as for SE.
   - From x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
   - From y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z).
   - It's possible that infy(z) = infy(y), in which case supy(x) <= infy(y) = infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x). But if infy(z) < infy(y), then it's possible to have infy(z) <= infy(x) < infy(y).
   - It's also possible to have supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   So, x E z is possible, but not guaranteed.

4. x B z: For this, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y).
   - From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).
   - The analysis for infx(z) <= infx(x) is the same as for S.
   - We can't determine if supx(x) <= supx(z) with the given constraints.
   - The analysis for infy(z) <= infy(x) is the same as for E.
   - It's possible to have supy(x) <= supy(z).
   
   So, x B z is possible, but not guaranteed.

5. x SW z: For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y).
   - It's possible that infx(z) = infx(y), in which case supx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) = infx(y), which doesn't give us a constraint on supx(x) and infx(z). But, intuitively, if x is to the east of y and y is inside z, it's unlikely that x is to the west of z.
   - The analysis for supy(x) <= infy(z) is the same as for SE.
   
   So, while SW is not directly ruled out by the constraints, it seems unlikely in a common spatial configuration.

6. x W z: For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - The analysis for supx(x) <= infx(z) is the same as for SW.
   - The analysis for infy(z) <= infy(x) is the same as for E.
   - The analysis for supy(x) <= supy(z) is the same as for B.
   
   So, like SW, W is not directly ruled out, but seems unlikely in a common spatial configuration.

7. x NW z: For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - The analysis for supx(x) <= infx(z) is the same as for SW.
   - From x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
   - From y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z).
   - It's possible that supy(y) = supy(z), in which case supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) = supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x). But if supy(y) < supy(z), it's still likely that supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) < supy(z), which also contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x).
   
   So, NW seems unlikely or impossible in a common spatial configuration.

8. x N z: For this, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - The analysis for supy(z) <= infy(x) is the same as for NW.
   - The analyses for infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are the same as for S.
   
   So, like NW, N seems unlikely or impossible in a common spatial configuration.

9. x NE z: For this, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - The analysis for supx(z) <= infx(x) is the same as for SE.
   - The analysis for supy(z) <= infy(x) is the same as for NW.
   
   So, like NW and N, NE seems unlikely or impossible in a common spatial configuration.

Based on this detailed analysis, the most likely relations are:
- x SE z
- x S z
- x E z
- x B z

I'm hesitant about ruling out any relation completely based on the given constraints because there can be very specific configurations where other relations might be possible. However, given that regions are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, the relations SW, W, NW, N, and NE seem implausible when x is southeast of y and y is inside z. Let me try to construct a counter-example to see if any of these implausible relations can actually occur.

Ok, I believe we can pretty safely say the possible relations are SE, S, E, and B. Let's confirm this with some simple examples.

1. If y is inside z and y touches the northeast corner of z, and x is a small region to the southeast of y, then x would be SE of z.
2. If y is inside z and y touches the eastern boundary of z (but not the northeast or southeast corners), and x is a small region to the southeast of y, then x would be E of z.
3. If y is inside z and y touches the southeast corner of z, and x is a small region to the southeast of y, then x would be S of z.
4. If y is inside z and y is close to the northwest corner of z, and x is a small region to the southeast of y (but still inside z), then x would be B of z.

I think these four relations are the only possible ones between x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is B of z. But actually, let me think about B again:

For x B z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

Given that x is SE of y, we know that x is to the east and south of y. This means infx(x) > supx(y), so x is strictly to the east of y.

Given that y is B of z, we know that y is inside z. This means infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Now, for x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x). But we know infx(x) > supx(y) (from x being SE of y), and supx(y) >= infx(y) (assuming y has a non-zero width). If infx(y) = infx(z) (i.e., y touches the western boundary of z), then infx(x) > supx(y) >= infx(y) = infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, for x to be B of z, we would need infx(y) > infx(z), meaning y is not touching the western boundary of z.

Actually, I made an error in reasoning above. From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the east of y. This doesn't necessarily mean infx(x) > supx(y); it could be that infx(x) = supx(y) if x is touching y. However, this doesn't change the fact that for x to be B of z, we would need infx(z) <= infx(x).

Actually, scratch all that. I think the issue lies in the fact that cardinal relations are not based on region interiors in the definition we're using, but on the projections of the regions onto the axes. Let's be more careful and precise.

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [z's left bound is to the left of or equal to y's left bound]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [y's right bound is to the left of or equal to z's right bound]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [z's bottom bound is below or equal to y's bottom bound]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's top bound is below or equal to z's top bound]

Let's carefully analyze all nine cardinal directions.

1. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x).
   - From y B z, we know supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - So, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= supx(z), but we don't know the relation between supx(z) and infx(x) in general. There are configurations where supx(z) <= infx(x) and others where supx(z) > infx(x).
   - For the second condition, from x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y).
   - From y B z, we know infy(z) <= infy(y).
   - Again, we don't know the relation between supy(x) and infy(z) in general.
   
   However, we can construct a configuration where both supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z), making SE a possible relation.

2. S: For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - The analysis for supy(x) <= infy(z) is the same as for SE.
   - For infx(z) <= infx(x), from x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x). If supx(y) > infx(z), then infx(z) < supx(y) <= infx(x), so infx(z) <= infx(x) is satisfied. But if infx(z) > supx(y), then we don't know the relation between infx(z) and infx(x) in general.
   - For supx(x) <= supx(z), we don't have direct constraints, so this is possible.
   
   We can construct a configuration where all three conditions are met, making S a possible relation.

3. E: For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - The analysis for supx(z) <= infx(x) is the same as for SE.
   - For infy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have direct constraints, so this is possible.
   - For supy(x) <= supy(z), from x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y). From y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z). So, supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z) is satisfied.
   
   We can construct a configuration where all three conditions are met, making E a possible relation.

4. B: For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - The analyses for infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) are the same as for S.
   - The analyses for infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) are the same as for E.
   
   We can construct a configuration where all four conditions are met, making B a possible relation.

5. SW: For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - For supx(x) <= infx(z), from x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x), which implies supx(y) <= supx(x). From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), which implies infx(z) <= supx(y) (assuming y has a non-zero width). So, we have supx(y) <= supx(x) and infx(z) <= supx(y), which means infx(z) <= supx(x) in general, which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z).
   
   Thus, SW seems impossible in a common spatial configuration.

6. W: For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - The analysis for supx(x) <= infx(z) is the same as for SW, which suggests that W is impossible in a common spatial configuration.

7. NW: For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - The analysis for supx(x) <= infx(z) is the same as for SW, which suggests that NW is impossible in a common spatial configuration.

8. N: For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - For supy(z) <= infy(x), from x SE y, we know supy(x) <= infy(y). From y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z). If x is below y, then supy(x) <= infy(y), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) because infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z). So, N seems impossible in a common spatial configuration.

9. NE: For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - The analysis for supx(z) <= infx(x) is the same as for SE.
   - The analysis for supy(z) <= infy(x) is the same as for N, which suggests that NE is impossible in a common spatial configuration.

Based on this detailed analysis, the possible relations are:
- x SE z
- x S z
- x E z
- x B z

Actually, wait. In the relationships in the context the regions are just homeomorphic to the closed disk, they're not rectangles aligned with the axes. Moreover, the directions are based on the bounding boxes of the regions, not the regions themselves. So, I need to be careful with my reasoning.

But the definition of a relation being x R y is in terms of the x and y coordinate bounds (inf_x, sup_x, etc.). So it's not about the actual shapes, but about the projections onto the x and y axes.

Let's reconsider. Relations 5-9 from above (SW, W, NW, N, NE) all seem to be impossible or extremely unlikely given our constraints. But relations 1-4 (SE, S, E, B) are all possible.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- x SE z
- x S z
- x E z
- x B z

Let me revisit the part about B, because that's the one I'm least confident in. For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Intuitively, this seems unlikely because x is southeast of y and y is inside z. However, let's see if it's possible.

From x SE y, we know:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
- supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) [z's left bound is to the left of or equal to y's left bound]
- supx(y) <= supx(z) [y's right bound is to the left of or equal to z's right bound]
- infy(z) <= infy(y) [z's bottom bound is below or equal to y's bottom bound]
- supy(y) <= supy(z) [y's top bound is below or equal to z's top bound]

For x to be B of z, we need:
a. infx(z) <= infx(x)
b. supx(x) <= supx(z)
c. infy(z) <= infy(x)
d. supy(x) <= supy(z)

Let's check each condition:

a. For infx(z) <= infx(x), we know from y B z that infx(z) <= infx(y). But there's no direct constraint between infx(y) and infx(x), so we need to find an indirect path. We know from x SE y that supx(y) <= infx(x). But we also know that infx(y) <= supx(y) (this is true for any region with non-zero width). So, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= infx(x) if we assume that region y has non-zero width. But if y is degenerate (i.e., has zero width), then it's possible to have infx(y) = supx(y) = infx(x), which still satisfies infx(z) <= infx(x).

b. For supx(x) <= supx(z), there's no direct constraint, so this is possible.

c. For infy(z) <= infy(x), we know from y B z that infy(z) <= infy(y). But there's no direct constraint between infy(y) and infy(x), so, like in (a), we need to find an indirect path. We know from x SE y that supy(x) <= infy(y). However, this doesn't directly give us a constraint on infy(x) and infy(y).

d. For supy(x) <= supy(z), we know from x SE y that supy(x) <= infy(y). From y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z). But we also know that infy(y) <= supy(y) (this is true for any region with non-zero height). So, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means supy(x) <= supy(z).

After reviewing these, I believe x B z is out because condition (c) is not always satisfied. That's because for x to be B of z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x). But all we have is infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y), which doesn't tell us how infy(z) relates to infy(x).

Actually, wait. I'm thinking about it more intuitively. If x is to the southeast of y, that means x is to the east and south of y. If y is inside z, and x is to the south of y, then x could potentially be inside z (B), to the south of z (S), to the east of z (E), or to the southeast of z (SE).

I think what I've confused is the fact that x SE y means "x is to the east of y AND x is to the south of y," not "x is to the southeast of y" in the colloquial sense. So, x being southeast of y doesn't necessarily mean x is in the "corner" of y; it could be directly to the east or directly to the south.

Given that, let's redo the analysis for B:

For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From x SE y, we know supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(y). This means x is to the east of y and to the south of y.

From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z). This means y is inside z.

If x is to the east of y, then infx(x) >= supx(y). If y is inside z, then supx(y) <= supx(z). So, we have infx(x) >= supx(y) <= supx(z), which means we can't determine the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z) in general.

Similarly, if x is to the south of y, then supy(x) <= infy(y). If y is inside z, then infy(y) >= infy(z). So, we have supy(x) <= infy(y) >= infy(z), which means we can't determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) in general.

Given these uncertainties, it's challenging to make a general statement about whether x can be B of z.

Actually, maybe I should trust my intuition: the relations SE, S, E, and B are all possible. Let's quickly try to construct examples for all of them:

1. SE: Let z be {(x, y): x^2 + y^2 <= 4, x >= 0, y >= 0}, y be {(x, y): (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 <= 0.1}, and x be {(x, y): (x-2.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2 <= 0.1}. In this case, y is inside z (at the top right), and x is to the southeast of y and outside of z.

2. S: Let z be {(x, y): x^2 + y^2 <= 4, |x| <= 1}, y be {(x, y): (x)^2 + (y-1)^2 <= 0.1}, and x be {(x, y): (x)^2 + (y-2.5)^2 <= 0.1}. In this case, y is inside z (at the top), and x is to the south of y and outside of z. Since both y and x are centered on the y-axis, this makes x to the south of z as well.

3. E: Let z be {(x, y): x^2 + y^2 <= 4, |y| <= 1}, y be {(x, y): (x-1)^2 + (y)^2 <= 0.1}, and x be {(x, y): (x-2.5)^2 + (y)^2 <= 0.1}. In this case, y is inside z (at the right), and x is to the east of y and outside of z. Since both y and x are centered on the x-axis, this makes x to the east of z as well.

4. B: Let z be {(x, y): x^2 + y^2 <= 4}, y be {(x, y): (x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 <= 0.1}, and x be {(x, y): (x+0.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2 <= 0.1}. In this case, y is inside z (at the top left), and x is to the southeast of y but still inside z.

Wait, I don't think I got the B example right. Let's try again:

4. B: Let z be {(x, y): x^2 + y^2 <= 4}, y be {(x, y): (x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 <= 0.1}, and x be {(x, y): (x+0.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2 <= 0.1}.

No, that's not correct either. The regions need to satisfy specific constraint (y B z and x SE y). Let's use the definitions directly and see if I can construct an example:

y B z implies:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

x SE y implies:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

Let's set z to be {(x, y): -2 <= x <= 2, -2 <= y <= 2}, which is a square centered at the origin with side length 4.
This means:
- infx(z) = -2, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = -2, supy(z) = 2

Now, let's set y to be {(x, y): -1 <= x <= 0, 0 <= y <= 1}, which is a square in the top-left quadrant of z.
This means:
- infx(y) = -1, supx(y) = 0, infy(y) = 0, supy(y) = 1

For this y, we have:
- infx(z) = -2 <= infx(y) = -1 ✓
- supx(y) = 0 <= supx(z) = 2 ✓
- infy(z) = -2 <= infy(y) = 0 ✓
- supy(y) = 1 <= supy(z) = 2 ✓

So, y is indeed B of z.

Now, for x to be SE of y, we need:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(x) <= infy(y)

For x to be SE of y, x should be to the east and south of y. One example would be x = {(a, b): 1 <= a <= 1.5, -1 <= b <= -0.5}, which is a square in the bottom-right quadrant of z.
This means:
- infx(x) = 1, supx(x) = 1.5, infy(x) = -1, supy(x) = -0.5

For this x, we have:
- supx(y) = 0 <= infx(x) = 1 ✓
- supy(x) = -0.5 <= infy(y) = 0 ✓

So, x is indeed SE of y.

Now, to check if x is B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), which is -2 <= 1 ✓
- supx(x) <= supx(z), which is 1.5 <= 2 ✓
- infy(z) <= infy(x), which is -2 <= -1 ✓
- supy(x) <= supy(z), which is -0.5 <= 2 ✓

So, x is also B of z. This demonstrates that it's possible for x to be both SE of y and B of z at the same time.

To summarize: the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- x SE z
- x S z
- x E z
- x B z

That's my final answer.

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine the possible relations between x and z given that x is SE of y and y is B of z.

First, let me understand what these given relations mean:
- x SE y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y B z means: infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Analyzing the possible relationships between x and z:

1. SE: For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   - This is possible if y is positioned near the southeast corner of z.

2. S: For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   - This is possible if y is positioned near the southern boundary of z.

3. E: For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - This is possible if y is positioned near the eastern boundary of z.

4. B: For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - This is possible if y is positioned in the northwest portion of z and x is southeast of y but still inside z.

The other cardinal directions (SW, W, NW, N, NE) are not possible given the constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: SE, S, E, B.
