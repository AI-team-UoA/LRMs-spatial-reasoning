PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's use the definitions of cardinal directions to reason through this problem.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y (x N y)
- Region y is SE of region z (y SE z)

We want to find the possible relation(s) between x and z.

Let's use the definitions of N and SE relations:

1. For x N y, we have:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y)

2. For y SE z, we have:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's try to derive possible relations between x and z.

First, we need to determine the relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z.
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y SE z: supx(z) <= infx(y)

Combining these, we get:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)

So, we know that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x must be to the right of z in terms of x-coordinates. This is a condition for relations E, NE, or SE.

Next, let's determine the relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z.
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y SE z: supy(y) <= infy(z)

From these, we can't directly determine the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). Both x and z could be at different heights.

Let's analyze this geometrically:
- x is north of y, so x is above y.
- y is southeast of z, so y is below and to the right of z.
- x is to the right of z (as determined above).

Given these constraints, x could be:
1. Northeast of z (NE) if x is above z.
2. East of z (E) if x is at the same height as z.
3. Southeast of z (SE) if x is below z.

However, we need to be careful. Let's double-check.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)

From y SE z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

These conditions don't directly compare the y-coordinates of x and z. Without knowing more, x could be above, at the same height, or below z.

Actually, wait, I think I can still reason through this a bit more.

If y is SE of z, then z is NW of y.
If x is N of y, and y is SE of z, let's think about the positioning of all regions.

We know:
- z is NW of y
- y is SE of z
- x is N of y

I think I can derive more direct constraints using the relationships between the minimum bounding box coordinates.

For x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z)

Let's now try to derive the relationship between x and z.

First, for the x-coordinates:
- From y SE z, we have: supx(z) <= infx(y)
- From x N y, we have: infx(y) <= infx(x)
Combining these: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
So, supx(z) <= infx(x), which is a condition for E, NE, or SE relation.

Next, for the y-coordinates:
- From x N y, we have: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y SE z, we have: supy(y) <= infy(z)
But these don't directly give us a constraint between infy(x) and infy(z).

Actually, from y SE z, we also have: supx(z) <= infx(y), which means z is to the left of y.
From x N y, we have: infx(y) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(y), which means x is within the x-range of y.

Now, combining these:
z is to the left of y, and x is within the x-range of y, which means x could be to the right of z, within the x-range of z, or to the left of z.

But wait, we've established earlier that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z. So, x is to the right of z.

For the y-coordinates:
From x N y, we have: supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above y.
From y SE z, we have: supy(y) <= infy(z), which means y is below z.

So, y is below z, and x is above y. But this doesn't directly tell us the vertical relationship between x and z.

Actually, let's think clearer geometrically.

Let me draw out the constraints based on the given relations:

1. x N y: x is directly above y, with a potential overlap in the x-range.
2. y SE z: y is southeast of z, so it's below and to the right of z.

Considering these:
- z is to the left of y, and y can have an x-range overlap with x. This means z is to the left of x.
- z is above y, and x is also above y. But we don't know the vertical relationship between x and z directly.

Given the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:
- NE: If x is above z.
- E: If x is at the same height as z.
- SE: If x is below z.

In fact, let me elaborate a bit more. The reference region is z, and we're determining the relation of x with respect to z.

For x to be NE of z, we need: 
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is at the same height as z)

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

We've established that x is to the right of z, but we don't have direct constraints on the vertical relationship. Let's try to derive it.

From x N y, we have: supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above y.
From y SE z, we have: supy(y) <= infy(z), which means y is below z.

So, y is below z, and x is above y. But this doesn't give us a definitive relationship between x and z vertically. 

Let me think more: if y is SE of z, then supy(y) <= infy(z).
If x is N of y, then supy(y) <= infy(x).

Combining these: supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)).
This doesn't give us a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z).

Without more constraints, x could be above, at the same level, or below z, leading to relations NE, E, or SE respectively.

Actually, let me re-read the problem and reinterpret it.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y (x N y)
- Region y is SE of region z (y SE z)

Let's use the constraints again:

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is within the x-range of y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

For the x-coordinates:
From y SE z, we have: supx(z) <= infx(y).
From x N y, we have: infx(y) <= infx(x).
Combining these: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
This means x is to the right of z, which is a constraint for relations E, NE, or SE.

For the y-coordinates:
From x N y, we have: supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y SE z, we have: supy(y) <= infy(z).
Combining these: supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)).
From this, we don't get a direct comparison between infy(x) and infy(z).

Now, consider the positions of x, y, and z in a geometrical sense:
- y is in the southeast of z (below and to the right).
- x is to the north of y (directly above).

Based on these, z is in the northwest of y, and x is to the north of y.
Without more constraints, x could be in one of several positions relative to z.

To enumerate the possible relationships:

1. If x is above and to the right of z, then the relation is NE.
2. If x is directly to the right of z, then the relation is E.
3. If x is below and to the right of z, then the relation is SE.

But wait, is SE really possible? Let's double-check our constraints again.

From x N y, we have: supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y SE z, we have: supy(y) <= infy(z).

From these, we know that x is above y and y is below z. While these conditions don't directly compare x and z, it seems contradictory for x to be below z. If x is below z, and y is below z, then it might violate the fact that x is above y.

Actually let's think about this geometrically. If:
- y is SE of z (i.e., y is below and to the right of z)
- x is N of y (i.e., x is above y)

Given these constraints, x must be above y, and y must be below z. This suggests that x can be at a variety of heights, though positioned to the right of z.

Given the constraints:
1. If x is also above z, then the relation is NE.
2. If x is at the same height as z, then the relation is E.
3. If x is below z, it would mean x is above y but below z. This is possible if z is above both x and y, and x is above y. In this case, the relation would be SE.

So the possible relationships between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

But I'm still not confident in this answer, let me reason through it once more carefully.

From the definitions:
- If x N y, then x is directly above y with a potential overlap in the x-range.
- If y SE z, then y is below and to the right of z (no overlap in either the x or y range).

Let me draw a simple diagram to visualize this:

```
    z
      \
       \
        y
        |
        |
        x
```

In this diagram, z is at the top-left, y is below and to the right of z, and x is directly below y.

But this isn't the only valid configuration. For instance, x could be above y but shifted to the right or left (as long as there's some vertical overlap in the x-range).

Let's analyze the constraints again:

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is within the x-range of y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

For the x-coordinates:
From y SE z, we have: supx(z) <= infx(y). This means that the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of y. In other words, z and y don't overlap in the x-range.
From x N y, we have: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y). This means that x's x-range is within the x-range of y.

Combining these:
- Since z is to the left of y, and x is within the x-range of y, x could be to the left, right, or have an overlap with z in the x-range.
- However, from y SE z, we have: supx(z) <= infx(y).
- And from x N y, we have: infx(y) <= infx(x).
- Together, we get: supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
This means that the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x. In other words, x is completely to the right of z, with no overlap in the x-range.

For the y-coordinates:
From x N y, we have: supy(y) <= infy(x). This means that the topmost point of y is below the bottommost point of x. In other words, x is completely above y, with no overlap in the y-range.
From y SE z, we have: supy(y) <= infy(z). This means that the topmost point of y is below the bottommost point of z. In other words, y is completely below z, with no overlap in the y-range.

Given these constraints, x is completely to the right of z, and:
1. x could be above z, which would make the relation NE.
2. x could have an overlap with z in the y-range, which would make the relation E.
3. x could be below z, which would make the relation SE.

Actually, wait. I think I have to reconsider SE.

We know that:
- x is N of y, so x is above y.
- y is SE of z, so y is below z.

So x is above y, and y is below z. It seems contradictory for x to be below z in this setup.

Let's re-analyze the constraints for the y-coordinates.

From x N y, we have: supy(y) <= infy(x). This means the top of y is below the bottom of x.
From y SE z, we have: supy(y) <= infy(z). This means the top of y is below the bottom of z.

Combining these, we have: supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)).

This doesn't directly give us a comparison between infy(x) and infy(z). However, based on the setups, I think I can infer the following:

- x is above y (no overlap in the y-range).
- y is below z (no overlap in the y-range).

Given these, it's possible for:
1. x to be above z (relation NE).
2. x to have an overlap with z in the y-range (relation E).
3. x to be below z. However, given that y is below z, and x is above y, for x to be below z, we'd need: infy(x) <= supy(z). But since x is above y, and y is below z, we'd have: supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), which doesn't give us a direct comparison.

Hmm, I need to be even more careful here. Actually, let me try to determine the y-coordinate constraints one more time.

From x N y, we know that x is directly above y, which means supy(y) <= infy(x).
From y SE z, we know that y is below z, which means supy(y) <= infy(z).

These constraints don't directly give us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), which means we don't directly know the vertical relationship between x and z.

Without further constraints, x could be:
1. Above z, which would result in the relation NE.
2. At the same height as z (vertical overlap), which would result in the relation E.
3. Below z, which would result in the relation SE.

Actually, I have to reason out whether x SE z is consistent with the given conditions.

From x N y, we have: x is directly above y. 
From y SE z, we have: y is below and to the right of z.

For relation x SE z to be valid, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

We've established that x is to the right of z, but for x to be below z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z).
Since x is above y, we have: supy(y) <= infy(x).
From this, it's clear that supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x).

For x to be below z, we want supy(x) <= infy(z).
From y SE z, we have: supy(y) <= infy(z).

So, we have:
supy(y) <= infy(x) < supy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

These constraints don't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, x could be below z, which would make the relation SE consistent with the given conditions.

Let's think about this from another angle. If we consider a concrete example:
- y is SE of z: This means y is below and to the right of z.
- x is N of y: This means x is directly above y.

In this setup, x is above y and y is below z. While this suggests that x should be above z, it's not necessarily the case. The regions y and z could be positioned such that y is below z, but x, while above y, is still below the bottom of z.

I think my reasoning was right after all. The possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Now let us also reconsider N as a possible relation. For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is within the x-range of z)

We've already established that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z. This contradicts the requirement for N, which says infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

Similarly, NW, W, SW, and S would all require x to not be strictly to the right of z, which contradicts our established constraint. And for B, x would need to be inside the minimum bounding box of z.

So, the possible relations are: NE, E, and SE.

Actually, let me recheck the constraint for SE.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

We've established that supx(z) <= infx(x), so the first condition is met. 

For the second condition, supy(x) <= infy(z), we need to check if x can be below z.

From y SE z, we know: supy(y) <= infy(z). This means the top of y is below the bottom of z.
From x N y, we know: supy(y) <= infy(x). This means the top of y is below the bottom of x.

Combining these, we get: supy(y) <= min(infy(x), infy(z)). 

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z), nor does it give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

So, it's possible for SE to be a valid relation between x and z.

Alright, let's consolidate: Given that x is N of y, and y is SE of z, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE.

Actually let me think about a concrete example for SE. 

If x is SE of z, then x is below and to the right of z. Let's see if this is consistent with our setup:
- y is SE of z, so y is below and to the right of z.
- x is N of y, so x is directly above y.

If x is below z, then we'd have:
z
 \
  \
   x
  /
 /
y

This seems to check out visually. But let me verify with the constraints:

For y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is within the x-range of y)

From these, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (top of y is below bottom of x)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (top of y is below bottom of z)

For x to be SE of z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

The first condition is satisfied. For the second condition, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). But from our constraints, we don't directly know the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Given the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x), and assuming x isn't very tall, it's plausible for supy(x) <= infy(z) to also hold. This would make x SE of z.

Let's see if NE and E are also consistent.

For NE, we would need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z)

Actually, let me think about this pictorially. If:
- y is SE of z, so y is below and to the right of z.
- x is N of y, so x is directly above y.

Visually, this would look something like:
    x
    |
    |
z---y

In this case, x would be NE of z, since it's above and to the right of z. But, depending on the exact positioning, x could also be E of z or even SE of z.

Given the constraints, x is definitely to the right of z. Vertically, x could be above, at the same level, or below z. This gives us the relations NE, E, and SE.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

But I might be missing other possibilities. Let's double-check with our constraints again.

From y SE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x is within the x-range of y)

From these, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- We don't have a direct constraint between y-coordinates of x and z.

Based on the x-coordinate constraint, x must be to the right of z, which aligns with relations E, NE, SE, B (if x is inside z's bounding box).

But actually, B relation requires x to be within z's bounding box, which isn't possible given that supx(z) <= infx(x). So B is not a possibility.

Similarly, from the x-coordinate constraint, relations NW, W, SW, S, and N are also ruled out.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: E, NE, and SE.

Therefore, if x is N of y and y is SE of z, then the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Hmm, I think I need to check one more time, particularly with respect to the B relation. Let's check the bounding box relation against the constraints we have.

For a relation B, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's x-range is within z's x-range)
- infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-range is within z's y-range)

Given that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means x is completely to the right of z, x cannot be inside the bounding box of z. So B is not a possible relation.

For a relation NW, we'd need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But given that supx(z) <= infx(x), which means z is completely to the left of x, x cannot be to the left of z. So NW is not a possible relation.

I can verify the other potential relations similarly, and each one will have a problem either with the x-coordinate constraint or with the basic setup of our regions. I'm sure that the potential relations between x and z are: E, NE, and SE.

Let me wrap up:

Given that x is N of y and y is SE of z, we have established the constraint supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which means x is to the right of z. This rules out relations NW, W, SW, S, N, and B.

The y-coordinate constraints, supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= infy(z), don't give us a direct comparison between x and z in the y-direction. As a result, x could be above, at the same level, or below z, giving the relations NE, E, and SE as the possible ones.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

So, my final answer: If region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, then the possible relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE.

Actually, let me triple-check my reasoning to make sure I haven't dismissed any potential relations incorrectly.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

From these, we have the constraints:
1. From x N y:
   - supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's x-range is within y's x-range)

2. From y SE z:
   - supx(z) <= infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

From these constraints, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- No direct constraint between the y-coordinates of x and z.

Possible relations:

1. NW, W, SW: These relations require x to be to the left of z. But our constraint says x is to the right of z, so these are ruled out.

2. N: This requires x to be directly above z (with the x-ranges overlapping). But our constraint says x is to the right of z, so this is ruled out.

3. S: This requires x to be directly below z (with the x-ranges overlapping). But our constraint says x is to the right of z, so this is ruled out.

4. B: This requires x to be inside the bounding box of z. But our constraint says x is to the right of z, so this is ruled out.

5. NE: This is possible. It requires x to be to the right and above z, which does not conflict with our constraints.

6. E: This is possible. It requires x to be directly to the right of z (with the y-ranges overlapping), which does not conflict with our constraints.

7. SE: This is possible. It requires x to be to the right and below z. While it might seem counterintuitive (given x is N of y and y is SE of z), the constraints don't rule it out. Specifically, y can be so far below z that even though x is above y, x can still be below the bottom of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Actually, let me try to reason once more about the SE relation, as I'm still not fully convinced.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

The first condition is satisfied based on our constraints.

For the second condition, we need to check if supy(x) <= infy(z) is compatible with our constraints. 
From y SE z, we have: supy(y) <= infy(z).
From x N y, we have: supy(y) <= infy(x).

These conditions don't directly tell us about the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

However, let me think of a specific example to see if SE is indeed possible:

Let's place z at coordinates (0, 4) to (2, 6), meaning infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 4, and supy(z) = 6.
Given z's position, and the constraint supx(z) <= infx(y), y must have infx(y) >= 2. Let's place y at (3, 0) to (5, 2), meaning infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 5, infy(y) = 0, and supy(y) = 2.
This satisfies the constraint supy(y) <= infy(z) (2 <= 4).

Now, given y's position and the constraint supy(y) <= infy(x), x must have infy(x) >= 2. Let's place x at (4, 3) to (5, 4), meaning infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 3, and supy(x) = 4.
This satisfies the constraints infx(y) <= infx(x) (3 <= 4) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (5 <= 5).

In this setup:
- x is N of y (the bottom of x, which is 3, is above the top of y, which is 2).
- y is SE of z (y is to the right and below z).

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- x is to the right of z (the left of x, which is 4, is to the right of the right of z, which is 2).
- x is below z (the top of x, which is 4, is below the bottom of z, which is 4).

Wait, the top of x is equal to the bottom of z. That doesn't satisfy supy(x) < infy(z), at best it's supy(x) <= infy(z). But for the SE relation, we need supy(x) <= infy(z). So the relation would be... E?

Actually, no. Let me check the E relation.
For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-range is within z's y-range)

In our example:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 4, so the first condition is satisfied.
- infy(z) = 4 <= infy(x) = 3? This is not true. So, x is not E of z.

Let me adjust my example to ensure x is SE of z.
Let's place z at (0, 4) to (2, 7), y at (3, 0) to (5, 2), and x at (4, 3) to (5, 3.5). 
In this setup:
- x is N of y (the bottom of x, which is 3, is above the top of y, which is 2).
- y is SE of z (y is to the right and below z).
- x is to the right of z (the left of x, which is 4, is to the right of the right of z, which is 2).
- x is below z (the top of x, which is 3.5, is below the bottom of z, which is 4).

So, x is indeed SE of z.

This example confirms that SE is a possible relation between x and z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E, and SE.

Actually, i'm not convinced that E is a valid relation. Let's revisit and validate.

For x E z, we'd need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x's y-range is within z's y-range)

We've established that the first condition, supx(z) <= infx(x), is satisfied. We need to check if the second condition is compatible with our constraints.

From y SE z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)

From these, we don't directly get constraints on the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), nor between supy(x) and supy(z).

Let me try to design an example to see if x E z is possible.

Let's place z at coordinates (0, 4) to (2, 6). Then y can be at (3, 2) to (4, 3), based on the condition that y is SE of z. Now, for x to be N of y, it must be directly above y, so let's place x at (3, 4) to (4, 5). 

Let's check if these satisfy our constraints:
1. x is N of y:
   - supy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 4. ✓
   - infx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 3 and supx(x) = 4 <= supx(y) = 4. ✓
2. y is SE of z:
   - supx(z) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3. ✓
   - supy(y) = 3 <= infy(z) = 4. ✓

Now, let's check if x is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3. ✓
- infy(z) = 4 <= infy(x) = 4 and supy(x) = 5 <= supy(z) = 6. ✓

So, based on this example, x E z is a valid relationship.

But to double-check, let me make sure I'm really satisfying all constraints.

From z at (0, 4) to (2, 6), we have infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 4, and supy(z) = 6.

From y at (3, 2) to (4, 3), we have infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 2, and supy(y) = 3.

From x at (3, 4) to (4, 5), we have infx(x) = 3, supx(x) = 4, infy(x) = 4, and supy(x) = 5.

Now, let's evaluate the constraints:
1. x is N of y:
   - supy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 4. ✓
   - infx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 3 and supx(x) = 4 <= supx(y) = 4. ✓
2. y is SE of z:
   - supx(z) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3. ✓
   - supy(y) = 3 <= infy(z) = 4. ✓

Now, let's check if x is E of z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3. ✓
- infy(z) = 4 <= infy(x) = 4 and supy(x) = 5 <= supy(z) = 6. ✓

So we can indeed have the E relation.

Let me also verify that SE and NE are valid.

For NE, I'll adjust only the y-coordinate of x to ensure it's above z.
Let's place z at (0, 4) to (2, 6) and y at (3, 2) to (4, 3) as before. But now, let's place x at (3, 7) to (4, 8).

1. x is N of y:
   - supy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 7. ✓
   - infx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 3 and supx(x) = 4 <= supx(y) = 4. ✓
2. y is SE of z:
   - supx(z) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3. ✓
   - supy(y) = 3 <= infy(z) = 4. ✓

Now, let's check if x is NE of z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3. ✓
- supy(z) = 6 <= infy(x) = 7. ✓

So, x NE z is valid.

For SE, I'll adjust the y-coordinate of x to ensure it's below z.
Let's place z at (0, 6) to (2, 8) and y at (3, 2) to (4, 3) as before. But now, let's place x at (3, 4) to (4, 5).

1. x is N of y:
   - supy(y) = 3 <= infy(x) = 4. ✓
   - infx(y) = 3 <= infx(x) = 3 and supx(x) = 4 <= supx(y) = 4. ✓
2. y is SE of z:
   - supx(z) = 2 <= infx(y) = 3. ✓
   - supy(y) = 3 <= infy(z) = 6. ✓

Now, let's check if x is SE of z:
- supx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 3. ✓
- supy(x) = 5 <= infy(z) = 6. ✓

So, x SE z is valid.

In conclusion, all three relations are valid: NE, E, and SE.

Therefore, if region x is N of region y and region y is SE of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, and SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z given the constraints.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

From x N y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is within the x-range of y)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right of z

This immediately rules out relations NW, W, SW, S, N, and B, as they all require x to not be strictly to the right of z.

For the vertical relationship, we have:
- x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

But these don't directly constrain the vertical relationship between x and z. Therefore:
- x could be above z (NE relation)
- x could be at the same height as z (E relation)
- x could be below z (SE relation)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE
