PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the given information:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is B of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let me recall the definitions of the cardinal direction relations:

1. a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
2. a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So, 
- x W y means: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- y B z means: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, I need to determine what constraints these relations place on x relative to z.

From x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now, let's combine these to understand the constraints on x relative to z:

From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can't directly deduce a constraint between supx(x) and infx(z). 

From infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we get infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so infy(z) <= infy(x).

From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we get supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

Now, I need to determine what cardinal relations these constraints allow between x and z.

Let's consider the definition of each cardinal relation and check if the constraints we've derived are compatible:

1. x W z: Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - We've established infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - But we can't determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - So, x W z is a possibility, but not a certainty.

Hmm, on second thought, I need to reason more carefully here. Let's look at the constraints from a different angle:

From x W y and y B z, we have:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
2. infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

We can't directly deduce a relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from these. So, x could be west of z, or it could overlap with z in the east-west direction.

From the y-axis constraints:
1. infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
2. infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
3. So, infy(z) <= infy(x)

4. supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
5. supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)
6. So, supy(x) <= supy(z)

Based on the y-axis constraints (3 and 6), x could be to the north, south, or within the y-extent of z.

Actually, let me draw it out to better visualize:

x W y means x is to the west of y.
y B z means y is contained within the bounding box of z.

So, z's bounding box contains y, and x is to the west of y. 

This means x could be:
1. W of z (if x is entirely west of z)
2. NW of z (if x extends north of z)
3. SW of z (if x extends south of z)

Let's double-check my logic:

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Actually, I'm not sure if supx(x) <= infx(z) is definitely satisfied. Let's reason through this differently:

We have:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
2. infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

From (1) and (2), we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y). But we can't directly deduce a relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). 

Hmm, wait. Let's consider the definition of B more carefully:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

So, y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

And x W y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

Let's see if we can determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z):

From x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y).
From y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y).

If infx(z) < supx(x), then infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y), which means infx(z) < infx(y). This is consistent with y B z.

If supx(x) < infx(z), then supx(x) < infx(z) <= infx(y), which means supx(x) < infx(y). This is consistent with x W y.

If infx(z) = supx(x), then infx(z) = supx(x) <= infx(y), which means infx(z) <= infx(y). This is also consistent with y B z.

So, all three cases are possible:
1. infx(z) < supx(x)
2. supx(x) < infx(z)
3. infx(z) = supx(x)

Cases 2 and 3 satisfy the condition for x W z (i.e., supx(x) <= infx(z)). Case 1 would mean there's some east-west overlap between x and z.

Hmm, let me redo this with figures to clarify.

Given:
- x W y: x is west of y without overlapping in the east-west direction. In terms of the y-axis, x is contained within the y-extent of y.
- y B z: y is fully contained within the bounding box of z. This means the x and y extents of y are fully contained within the x and y extents of z.

Visually, we can imagine:

```
      +---+
      | z |
+---+ |   |
| x | | y |
+---+ |   |
      +---+
```

In this case, x is west of z.

But y could also be positioned in other ways within z. For example:

```
      +---+
      | z |
      | y |
+---+ |   |
| x | |   |
+---+ +---+
```

In this case, x is northwest of z.

Or:

```
      +---+
      | z |
      |   |
+---+ | y |
| x | |   |
+---+ +---+
```

In this case, x is southwest of z.

Or y could be fully contained without touching any border of z:

```
    +-----+
    |  z  |
    | +--+|
+---+ |y ||
| x | |  ||
+---+ +--+|
    +-----+
```

In all these cases, x doesn't overlap with z in the east-west direction.

But there's another possibility: y could touch the western border of z:

```
    +-----+
    |  z  |
+---+--+  |
| x |y |  |
+---+--+  |
    +-----+
```

In this case, x still doesn't overlap with z, but it touches z at a single point.

Wait, these two constraints actually help determine the relationship more precisely:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
2. infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

Since infx(y) is the left boundary of y, (1) tells us x is to the left of y without overlap, and (2) tells us z's left boundary is to the left of y's left boundary.

So, z's left boundary is at or to the left of y's left boundary, and x is strictly to the left of y's left boundary. This means x is strictly to the left of z's right boundary, but x could be to the left of z's left boundary, or it could overlap with z in the east-west direction. In other words, x's right boundary is strictly to the left of z's right boundary.

For the y-axis, the constraints tell us that x's y-extent is contained within z's y-extent (because x's y-extent is contained within y's y-extent, and y's y-extent is contained within z's y-extent).

Ok, let's be very careful here.

x W y means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

One thing to consider when analyzing the possible relations between x and z is the relationship between the left boundary of z (infx(z)) and the right boundary of x (supx(x)).

From the given constraints, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

From these, we can't directly deduce the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

If supx(x) < infx(z), then x is completely to the west of z, satisfying the W relation.
If supx(x) = infx(z), then x touches z at a single point on the east-west axis, still satisfying the W relation.
If infx(z) < supx(x), then there's some east-west overlap between x and z.

For the y-axis, we have:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

From these, we deduce:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means the y-extent of x is contained within the y-extent of z, plus potentially some overlap. This is consistent with the W, NW, and SW relations, depending on the exact positioning along the y-axis.

Actually I think I've been making an error in my reasoning above. Let's very carefully examine the definitions of the relations:

a W b if and only if 
- supx(a) <= infx(b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) 
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

a B b if and only if 
- infx(b) <= infx(a)
- supx(a) <= supx(b)
- infy(b) <= infy(a) 
- supy(a) <= supy(b)

Given that x W y and y B z, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

Now, let's deduce the y-axis constraints for x relative to z:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y) implies infy(z) <= infy(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z) implies supy(x) <= supy(z).

For the x-axis, the relationship is a bit more complex:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)

From these, we can't directly deduce the relation between supx(x) and infx(z).

At this point, there are three possibilities:
1. supx(x) < infx(z): This means x is completely to the west of z without any overlap in the east-west direction. This corresponds to the W relationship.
2. supx(x) = infx(z): This means x touches z at a single point along the east-west axis. This still corresponds to the W relationship.
3. infx(z) < supx(x): This means there's some east-west overlap between x and z.

Actually, I'm going to draw a detailed diagram to get this right.

Given:
- x W y
- y B z

Drawing:
```
Scenario 1:
z: +---------------+
   |               |
   |    y: +---+   |
   |       |   |   |
   |       |   |   |
x: +---+   +---+   |
   |   |           |
   +---+           |
   |               |
   +---------------+
```

In this scenario, region x is to the west of region z, since x's x-extent is completely to the west of z's x-extent. But, x's y-extent overlaps with z's y-extent. This would be the W relation.

```
Scenario 2:
   z: +---------------+
      |               |
      |    y: +---+   |
      |       |   |   |
      |       |   |   |
      |       +---+   |
      |               |
      |               |
x: +---+              |
   |   |              |
   +---+              |
      |               |
      +---------------+
```

In this scenario, x is to the northwest of z. This would be the NW relation.

```
Scenario 3:
      z: +---------------+
         |               |
         |               |
         |               |
     x: +---+   y: +---+ |
        |   |      |   | |
        +---+      +---+ |
         |               |
         +---------------+
```

In this scenario, x is to the west of z. This would be the W relation.

```
Scenario 4:
   z: +---------------+
      |               |
      |               |
      |               |
      |   y: +---+    |
      |      |   |    |
      |      +---+    |
      |               |
x: +---+              |
   |   |              |
   +---+              |
      |               |
      +---------------+
```

In this scenario, x is to the southwest of z. This would be the SW relation.

Wait, actually I think I've been wrong in my reasoning. A W B says that a is to the west of b. The definition gives the constraints that must be satisfied, and I've been focusing on those. Let me be more concrete.

Given:
- x W y means region x is west of region y
- y B z means region y is contained within the bounding box of region z

The possible spatial configurations would be:

1. x W z (x is west of z):
This is possible. We know x is west of y, and y is within the bounding box of z. If z's left boundary is the same as y's left boundary, or if z's left boundary is to the right of y's left boundary, then x is west of z.

2. x NW z (x is northwest of z):
This is possible. We know x is west of y, and y is within the bounding box of z. If z's top boundary is below the top of x, and z's left boundary is to the right of x's right boundary, then x is northwest of z.

3. x SW z (x is southwest of z):
This is possible. We know x is west of y, and y is within the bounding box of z. If z's bottom boundary is above the bottom of x, and z's left boundary is to the right of x's right boundary, then x is southwest of z.

4. x N z, x S z, x NE z, x E z, x SE z, x B z:
These relations can be ruled out. We know x is west of y, which means x's right boundary is to the left or at most touching y's left boundary. Given that y is within the bounding box of z, x cannot be to the north, south, east, or fully contained within the bounding box of z.

5. Multi-tile relations like x W:N z or x NW:W z:
These might be possible but I need to consider them carefully.

Let's reason through each possible single-tile relation more systematically:

1. x W z (x is west of z):
Recall the definition: a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
So, x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

We have the constraints:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

From the constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y) implies infy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies the second condition.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z) implies supy(x) <= supy(z), which satisfies the third condition.
- But for the first condition, from the constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which don't directly imply supx(x) <= infx(z).

Actually, let's again draw out the situation:

Given:
- x W y means region x is west of region y
- y B z means region y is contained within the bounding box of region z

In spatial terms:
- x is to the west of y (x's east boundary is to the west of or touching y's west boundary).
- y is fully contained within the bounding box of z (y is inside z or touches z's boundary).

Let's consider the east-west positioning:
- We know x's east boundary is to the west of y's west boundary.
- We know y's west boundary is to the east of z's west boundary.

From these, we can't conclusively say that x's east boundary is to the west of z's west boundary. It's possible that x's east boundary is to the west of z's west boundary (making x W z), but it's also possible that x's east boundary is to the east of z's west boundary (making x overlapping with z in the east-west direction).

Let me reconsider the more concrete meaning of these relationships, instead of looking at point-based conditions.

For x W y:
- This means x is to the west of y. Every point in x has an x-coordinate less than or equal to the smallest x-coordinate of any point in y.

For y B z:
- This means y is contained within the bounding box of z. Every point in y has an x-coordinate between the smallest and largest x-coordinates of points in z, and a y-coordinate between the smallest and largest y-coordinates of points in z.

Given these, how are x and z related?

From x W y, we know every point in x has an x-coordinate less than or equal to the smallest x-coordinate of any point in y. And from y B z, we know the smallest x-coordinate of any point in y is greater than or equal to the smallest x-coordinate of any point in z.

So, we can't definitively say that every point in x has an x-coordinate less than or equal to the smallest x-coordinate of any point in z. Therefore, the relation x W z is only a possibility, not a certainty.

The same reasoning applies to other potential relations. The exact relation between x and z depends on the specific positions of x, y, and z.

Oh wait, actually, let's be careful about the definition of the bounding box.

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This is saying that a is contained within the bounding box of b. Every point in a has an x-coordinate between infx(b) and supx(b), and a y-coordinate between infy(b) and supy(b).

So, y B z means y is contained within the bounding box of z. In other words, z's bounding box completely contains y's bounding box.

With this understanding, let's re-analyze:

From x W y, we know every point in x has an x-coordinate less than or equal to the smallest x-coordinate of any point in y (i.e., supx(x) <= infx(y)).

From y B z, we know the smallest x-coordinate of any point in y is greater than or equal to the smallest x-coordinate of any point in z (i.e., infx(z) <= infx(y)).

These two constraints together don't definitively tell us the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). It's possible that supx(x) <= infx(z) (making x W z), but it's also possible that infx(z) < supx(x) (making x overlap with z in the east-west direction).

Let's analyze systematically with the direction relations.

For W (West):
x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
From our constraints:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y) implies infy(z) <= infy(x), which satisfies the second condition.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z) implies supy(x) <= supy(z), which satisfies the third condition.
But for the first condition, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which doesn't give us a direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).
So, x W z is a possibility, not a certainty.

For NW (Northwest):
x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
From our constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(z) and infy(x). So, x NW z is a possibility, not a certainty.

For N (North):
x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
From our constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) (required for x N z). So, x N z is not possible.

For NE (Northeast):
x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
From our constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (required for x NE z). So, x NE z is not possible.

For E (East):
x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
From our constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (required for x E z). So, x E z is not possible.

For SE (Southeast):
x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
From our constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (required for x SE z). So, x SE z is not possible.

For S (South):
x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
From our constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) (required for x S z). So, x S z is not possible.

For SW (Southwest):
x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
From our constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). So, x SW z is a possibility, not a certainty.

For B (Bounding Box):
x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
From our constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) (required for x B z). So, x B z is not possible.

OK, let me reason about this more carefully.

Given x W y and y B z, let me figure out which of the 9 directional relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B) could possibly hold between x and z.

Let's recall the definitions:

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

Given that x W y and y B z, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

Let's go through each of the 9 relations:

1. x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From our constraints, we know infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z) and infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y), so infy(z) <= infy(x). ✓
   - We also know supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z), so supy(x) <= supy(z). ✓
   - For the first condition, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z). This gives us two possibilities:
     a. supx(x) <= infx(z): In this case, x W z holds. ✓
     b. infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y): In this case, x W z does not hold. ✗
   So, x W z is a possibility, but not a certainty.

2. x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z).
     a. If supx(x) <= infx(z), the first condition for x NW z holds. ✓
     b. If infx(z) < supx(x) <= infx(y), the first condition for x NW z does not hold. ✗
   - For the second condition, we know infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z). These don't directly give us a relation between supy(z) and infy(x). They are consistent with both supy(z) <= infy(x) and infy(x) < supy(z).
   
   So, the relation x NW z is a possibility, but not a certainty.

3. x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - From our constraints, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), which means x's right boundary is to the left of y's left boundary. But for x N z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of x's left boundary. Given that y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), so z's left boundary is to the left of y's left boundary. This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infx(z) and infx(x), but it's possible that infx(z) is to the left of infx(x).
   
   But here's the important point: For x N z, we need both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). That means x's east-west extent is contained within z's east-west extent. Given that x is to the west of y, and y's west boundary is to the east of z's west boundary, it's possible that x's east-west extent overlaps with z's, but it's also possible that it doesn't.
   
   Actually, the constraints supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) mean that supx(x) is to the west of infx(y) and infx(z) is also to the west of infx(y). It's possible that infx(z) is to the west of supx(x), but that would contradict the assumption that x is north of z, because the east-west extents wouldn't overlap. So, x N z is not possible.
   
   Upon further reflection, I realize this reasoning isn't quite sound. Let's be more precise.

   For x N z, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x): This means x is entirely above z.
   - infx(z) <= infx(x): This means z's left boundary is to the left of or at x's left boundary.
   - supx(x) <= supx(z): This means x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary.

   From our constraints, we have:
   - supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y): This means x's right boundary is to the left of or at y's left boundary.
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z): This means z's left boundary is to the left of or at y's left boundary.

   These constraints don't directly give us the relation between infx(z) and infx(x). But it's possible that infx(z) <= infx(x), which would allow for x N z.

   Actually I realize this isn't quite right still. Let me see if I can fix my reasoning.

   For x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). This means x is entirely to the west of y, or at most, x's easternmost point touches y's westernmost point.

   For a N b, we need supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b). This means a's south extent is to the north of b's north extent, and a's east-west extent is contained within b's east-west extent.

   Given that x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). This means x is entirely to the west of y. But for x N z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which means x's east-west extent is contained within z's east-west extent.

   Actually, let me be very concrete and precise. Let me determine whether each of the 9 basic cardinal directions is possible for the relation between x and z, given that x W y and y B z.

1. x W z (x is west of z): 
   - For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - From x W y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
   - From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z).
   - From infy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), we get infy(z) <= infy(x). ✓
   - From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), we get supy(x) <= supy(z). ✓
   - From supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), we can't directly infer the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x W z holds. ✓
   - If infx(z) < supx(x), then x W z does not hold. ✗
   
   Thus, x W z is possible.

2. x SW z (x is southwest of z): 
   - For this, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - From x W y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= supy(y).
   - From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y).
   - For the first condition, as with W, we can't directly infer the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from the given constraints.
   - If supx(x) <= infx(z), the first condition for x SW z holds. ✓
   - If infx(z) < supx(x), the first condition for x SW z does not hold. ✗
   - For the second condition, from supy(x) <= supy(y) and infy(z) <= infy(y), we can't directly infer the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - If supy(x) <= infy(z), the second condition for x SW z holds. ✓
   - If infy(z) < supy(x), the second condition for x SW z does not hold. ✗
   
   Thus, x SW z is possible.

3. x S z (x is south of z): 
   - For this, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - From x W y, we know supx(x) <= infx(y).
   - From y B z, we know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).
   - For the second condition, given that x W y, we know x is entirely to the west of y. And from y B z, we know z's left boundary is to the left of or at y's left boundary. It's not necessarily the case that z's left boundary is to the left of or at x's left boundary.
   - If infx(z) <= infx(x), the second condition for x S z could hold.
   - But given that supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y), we know x's right boundary is to the left of or at y's left boundary. If infx(z) <= infx(x), then we'd have infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) < infx(y), which is consistent with y B z.
   - So, it's possible for the second condition to hold, but not necessary. ✗
   - For the third condition, given that x W y, we know x's right boundary is to the left of or at y's left boundary. And from y B z, we know y's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary. This gives us supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(x) <= supx(z). ✓
   - For the first condition, as with SW, we can't directly infer the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) from the given constraints.
   - If supy(x) <= infy(z), the first condition for x S z holds.
   - If infy(z) < supy(x), the first condition for x S z does not hold.
   
   Thus, if both supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) hold, then x S z could be possible.

   Actually, I need to reconsider this. For x S z, we need both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means x's east-west extent is contained within z's east-west extent. But from x W y, we know x is entirely to the west of y. And from y B z, we know z's west boundary is to the left of or at y's west boundary. If z's west boundary is at y's west boundary, and x is entirely to the west of y, then x can't be within z's east-west extent. If z's west boundary is to the left of y's west boundary, then it's possible that x's east-west extent is contained within z's, but it's not a certainty.

   So, x S z is possible but not guaranteed.

Actually, let's again approach this problem systematically. I'm getting myself confused.

Given that x W y and y B z, I want to determine which of the 9 single-tile cardinal directions could possibly hold between x and z.

For x W y:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or touching y's left boundary)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above or at y's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's top boundary is below or at y's top boundary)

For y B z:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (z's left boundary is to the left of or at y's left boundary)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) (z's bottom boundary is below or at y's bottom boundary)
- supy(y) <= supy(z) (y's top boundary is below or at z's top boundary)

From these, I can deduce:
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x) (from y B z and x W y), so infy(z) <= infy(x).
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z) (from x W y and y B z), so supy(x) <= supy(z).

But for the east-west direction, I have supx(x) <= infx(y) and infx(z) <= infx(y), which doesn't directly give me a relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).

Now, let's check each of the 9 possible cardinal directions:

1. x W z (x is west of z): 
   - Need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Already proved: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Uncertain: The relation between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - Possibility: If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x W z. ✓

2. x SW z (x is southwest of z): 
   - Need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Already proved: None of these.
   - Uncertain: The relations between supx(x) and infx(z), and between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - Possibility: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x SW z. ✓

3. x S z (x is south of z): 
   - Need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - Already proved: None of these directly.
   - Uncertain: The relations between supy(x) and infy(z), between infx(z) and infx(x), and between supx(x) and supx(z).
   - But, from supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), I can deduce supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - Possibility: If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then x S z. ✓

4. x SE z (x is southeast of z): 
   - Need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
   - Already proved: None of these.
   - Uncertain: The relations between supx(z) and infx(x), and between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - But, given that x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y). For x SE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). This would imply supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y). But from y B z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z), which gives us infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). Combining, we get supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(z), which is a contradiction unless infx(y) = supx(z). But even in this case, we'd have supx(z) = infx(y) and supx(x) <= infx(y), giving us supx(z) <= supx(x), which contradicts the requirement supx(z) <= infx(x) (since infx(x) < supx(x)).
   - Thus, x SE z is not possible. ✗

5. x E z (x is east of z): 
   - Need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Already proved: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Uncertain: The relation between supx(z) and infx(x).
   - But, as reasoned for SE, x E z is not possible due to the contradiction with the given constraints. ✗

6. x NE z (x is northeast of z): 
   - Need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Already proved: None of these.
   - Uncertain: The relations between supx(z) and infx(x), and between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - But, as reasoned for SE, x NE z is not possible due to the contradiction with the given constraints. ✗

7. x N z (x is north of z): 
   - Need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - Already proved: None of these directly.
   - Uncertain: The relations between supy(z) and infy(x), between infx(z) and infx(x), and between supx(x) and supx(z).
   - From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), I can deduce supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - Possibility: If supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then x N z. ✓

8. x NW z (x is northwest of z): 
   - Need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
   - Already proved: None of these.
   - Uncertain: The relations between supx(x) and infx(z), and between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - Possibility: If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then x NW z. ✓

9. x B z (x is contained within the bounding box of z): 
   - Need: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Already proved: infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).
   - Uncertain: The relations between infx(z) and infx(x), and between supx(x) and supx(z).
   - From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), I can deduce supx(x) <= supx(z).
   - Possibility: If infx(z) <= infx(x), then x B z. ✓

So in summary, from our analysis, the possibilities are:
1. x W z ✓
2. x SW z ✓
3. x S z ✓
4. x SE z ✗
5. x E z ✗
6. x NE z ✗
7. x N z ✓
8. x NW z ✓
9. x B z ✓

Hmm, wait a moment. Let me be more careful about the reasoning for S, N, and B.

For x S z, I need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). From the constraints, I have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y). For x S z, I need infx(z) <= infx(x). Given the constraint supx(x) <= infx(y), for infx(z) <= infx(x) to be true, we need infx(z) < infx(y). This is consistent with y B z (which gives us infx(z) <= infx(y)). However, if infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(y), then we have infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y). This gives us infx(z) < infx(y), which is consistent with y B z.

So, it's possible for x S z to hold, but it's not a certainty. For it to hold, we need both supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x).

Let me rethink this. For x S z, I need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

Actually, let me double-check for S.

For x S z, I need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

From the constraints, I have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) which means x's right boundary is to the left of y's left boundary.
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z) which means z's left boundary is to the left of y's left boundary.

For x S z, one of the requirements is infx(z) <= infx(x). If this holds, then we have infx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y). This implies infx(z) < infx(y), which is consistent with the constraint from y B z. So, it's possible for this requirement to be satisfied.

Another requirement is supx(x) <= supx(z). From the constraints, we have supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z). This gives us supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which means supx(x) <= supx(z). So, this requirement is satisfied.

The third requirement is supy(x) <= infy(z). From the constraints, we have supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z). These don't directly give us the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It's possible that supy(x) <= infy(z), but it's also possible that infy(z) < supy(x).

So, if both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) hold, then x S z is possible. Otherwise, x S z doesn't hold.

Now for N: For x N z, I need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).

The reasoning is similar to that for S. The requirements infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) can be satisfied under the given constraints, but the requirement supy(z) <= infy(x) may or may not be satisfied. It's possible that supy(z) <= infy(x), but it's also possible that infy(x) < supy(z).

So, if both infx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) hold, then x N z is possible. Otherwise, x N z doesn't hold.

And for B: For x B z, I need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From the constraints, I have:
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (as derived earlier) ✓
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (as derived earlier) ✓
- supx(x) <= supx(z) (as derived for S and N) ✓
- The relationship between infx(z) and infx(x) is uncertain, as discussed for S and N.

So, if infx(z) <= infx(x) holds, then x B z is possible. Otherwise, x B z doesn't hold.

Based on this analysis:
1. x W z ✓
2. x SW z ✓
3. x S z ✓
4. x SE z ✗
5. x E z ✗
6. x NE z ✗
7. x N z ✓
8. x NW z ✓
9. x B z ✓

Actually, wait a moment. Let's be very careful. I think I was being sloppy.

For x W y, we have the condition supx(x) <= infx(y). This is the key constraint:
- the right boundary of x is to the left of or touching the left boundary of y.

For y B z, we have the condition infx(z) <= infx(y). This tells us that:
- the left boundary of z is to the left of or touching the left boundary of y.

These conditions together don't allow us to infer the relationship between the right of x and the left of z. So, x could be west of z, or it could overlap with z in the east-west direction.

Let me list out all the relationships for which we have derived conclusions:
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)

We don't know the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) or between infx(z) and infx(x). We also don't know the relationships between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x).

Let's check each cardinal direction to see if they are consistent with these constraints (and the rest of the reasoning we've done):

1. x W z (x is west of z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but not the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).
   - If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x W z. ✓

2. x SW z (x is southwest of z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). 
   - We don't know the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) or between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), then x SW z. ✓

3. x S z (x is south of z): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). 
   - We know supx(x) <= supx(z), but not the relationships between supy(x) and infy(z) or between infx(z) and infx(x).
   - If supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then x S z. ✓

4. x SE z (x is southeast of z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). 
   - We don't know the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) or between supy(x) and infy(z).
   - But from x W y, we have supx(x) <= infx(y), and from y B z, we have supx(y) <= supx(z). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then supx(z) <= infx(x) < supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). This gives us supx(z) < supx(z), which is a contradiction.
   - So, x SE z is not possible. ✗

5. x E z (x is east of z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), but not the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
   - But as reasoned for SE, if supx(z) <= infx(x), it leads to a contradiction.
   - So, x E z is not possible. ✗

6. x NE z (x is northeast of z): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). 
   - We don't know the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x) or between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - But as reasoned for SE, if supx(z) <= infx(x), it leads to a contradiction.
   - So, x NE z is not possible. ✗

7. x N z (x is north of z): Requires supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). 
   - We know supx(x) <= supx(z), but not the relationships between supy(z) and infy(x) or between infx(z) and infx(x).
   - If supy(z) <= infy(x) and infx(z) <= infx(x), then x N z. ✓

8. x NW z (x is northwest of z): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). 
   - We don't know the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) or between supy(z) and infy(x).
   - If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x), then x NW z. ✓

9. x B z (x is contained within the bounding box of z): Requires infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). 
   - We know infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z), and supx(x) <= supx(z), but not the relationship between infx(z) and infx(x).
   - If infx(z) <= infx(x), then x B z. ✓

Based on the constraints, I analyze that the following are possible directions for the relation from x to z:
- W
- SW
- S
- N
- NW
- B

And the following are not possible:
- SE
- E
- NE

Thus, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
W, SW, S, N, NW, B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is B of region z

From x W y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Analyzing each possible direction:

- W: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- NW: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- N: Possible if supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- NE: Not possible (contradicts x being west of y)
- E: Not possible (contradicts x being west of y)
- SE: Not possible (contradicts x being west of y)
- S: Possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- SW: Possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- B: Possible if infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: W, NW, N, SW, S, B
