PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

We need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is W of region y and region y is SW of region z.

Let's first recall the definitions of the cardinal directions:

x W y if and only if supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
y SW z if and only if supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z.

From x W y, we have:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y SW z, we have:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z)
5. supy(y) <= infy(z)

Now, let's see what we can deduce about the relationship between x and z.

First, we know that:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from 1)
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (from 4)

By transitivity, we can say:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

This means that the x-coordinate of any point in region x is less than the x-coordinate of any point in region z. But for determining the exact cardinal direction, we also need to consider the y-coordinates.

From 3 and 5, we have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 3)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from 5)

By transitivity, we can say:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

This means that the y-coordinate of any point in region x is less than the y-coordinate of any point in region z.

Given supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z), the relation between x and z could be SW.

But we need to check if it could be anything else.

Given that supy(x) <= infy(z), region x is below region z, so the relation could also be S or SE. But since supx(x) <= infx(z), region x is to the left of region z, so the relation cannot be SE. 

Given that supx(x) <= infx(z), region x is to the left of region z, so the relation could also be W or NW. But since supy(x) <= infy(z), region x is below region z, so the relation cannot be NW.

Wait, let me double-check. From the given relationships:
- x W y means x is to the left of y, with some overlap in the y-direction.
- y SW z means y is to the left and below z.

If x is to the left of y, and y is to the left and below z, then x is definitely to the left of z. But the y-coordinate relationship between x and z is not so clear.

Let's revisit these relationships:

From x W y, we can deduce:
- The x-coordinates of x are all less than the minimum x-coordinate of y.
- The y-coordinates of x have some overlap with the y-coordinates of y, meaning the minimum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of y, and the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of y.

From y SW z, we can deduce:
- The x-coordinates of y are all less than the minimum x-coordinate of z.
- The y-coordinates of y are all less than the minimum y-coordinate of z.

Given these constraints, we have:
- The x-coordinates of x are all less than the minimum x-coordinate of z (by transitivity).
- The y-coordinates of x... well, actually we can't determine a strict relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z.

Given what we know, x must be to the left of z. In terms of y-coordinates, x could be below z, it could have some overlap with z, or it could be above z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: SW, W, and NW.

But let me double-check this more carefully.

From x W y, we have:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y SW z, we have:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z)
5. supy(y) <= infy(z)

Looking at the constraints on the y-coordinates:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from 2)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 3)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from 5)

By transitivity from 3 and 5, we can derive:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)

This means that the y-coordinates of x are all less than the minimum y-coordinate of z. In other words, x is below z.

Given that x is to the left of z and below z, the only possible relation is SW.

Actually, but I think I am getting confused with the constraints.

The relation x W y means:
- The maximum x-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of y.
- The minimum y-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x.
- The maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of y.

And y SW z means:
- The maximum x-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the minimum x-coordinate of z.
- The maximum y-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of z.

I want to think about this more carefully and visualize it. 

Actually, I need to define the regions more precisely. Let's try to use specific coordinates to understand the constraints better.

Suppose region z is defined by its bounding box: [infx(z), supx(z)] x [infy(z), supy(z)].

Given y SW z, region y is to the southwest of z. This means:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

Now, let's consider region x. Given x W y, region x is to the west of y. This means:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (y's minimum y-coordinate is less than or equal to x's minimum y-coordinate)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (x's maximum y-coordinate is less than or equal to y's maximum y-coordinate)

From these constraints, we can deduce that supx(x) <= infx(y) <= infx(z), so x is to the left of z.

In terms of y-coordinates, we have:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

Combining these, we get:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) < supx(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)

Oh wait, let's be more precise. The terms infy, supx, etc. is about the projections.

For x W y:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y on the x-axis)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the minimum y-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of y)

For y SW z:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z on the x-axis)
5. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z on the y-axis)

From 1 and 4, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) <= infx(z)
This means x is to the left of z.

From 3 and 5, we have:
- supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z)
This means x is below z.

Thus, just tying together the implications, x is to the left of z and below z, which would make the relation between x and z be SW.

Let me double check this answer. Actually, let me try ot make sure I have the definition of the cardinal directions correct.

a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

Let's try to understand this in a different way. The first constraint, supx(a) <= infx(b), means that the rightmost point of a is to the left of the leftmost point of b, i.e., a is completely to the left of b.

The second constraint, infy(b) <= infy(a), means that the bottom edge of b is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of a.

The third constraint, supy(a) <= supy(b), means that the top edge of a is below or at the same level as the top edge of b.

So, a W b means a is completely to the left of b, and the vertical extent of a falls within the vertical extent of b. In other words, a is to the west of b, with a possible vertical overlap.

Similarly, a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

The first constraint, supx(a) <= infx(b), means a is completely to the left of b. The second constraint, supy(a) <= infy(b), means a is completely below b. So, a SW b means a is to the southwest of b, with no overlap.

Now, let's go back to our problem.

We know that x W y, which means:
- x is completely to the left of y.
- The vertical extent of x falls within the vertical extent of y.

And we know that y SW z, which means:
- y is completely to the left of z.
- y is completely below z.

From these, we can deduce that x is to the left of z (by transitivity). But we need to be careful about the vertical relationship.

Given x W y:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (The bottom edge of y is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of x.)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (The top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of y.)

Given y SW z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is completely below z.)

From these, we can deduce that supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z), which means the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. Thus, x is completely below z.

Since x is completely to the left of z and completely below z, the relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, wait, let me think about this more carefully. It's possible I'm missing another possibility.

From the constraints:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (from x W y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x W y)
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (from y SW z)
5. supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y SW z)

From 1 and 4, we get supx(x) <= infx(z), so x is to the left of z.
From 3 and 5, we get supy(x) <= infy(z), so x is below z.

Thus, the relation between x and z is SW.

But is that the only possibility?

From the given constraints, we've deduced that x is to the left of z and below z. This means x is in the SW direction with respect to z.

But actually let me check one more time. 

We are given:
1. Region x is W of region y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
2. Region y is SW of region z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (from 1) and supx(y) <= infx(z) (from 2), so by transitivity, supx(x) <= infx(z). This means that x is to the left of z.
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (from 1) and supy(y) <= infy(z) (from 2), so by transitivity, supy(x) <= infy(z). This means that x is below z.

Since x is to the left of z and below z, the relation between x and z is SW.

But there's an additional constraint from 1: infy(y) <= infy(x). Given that y is to the southwest of z, and x is to the west of y, this constraint on the bottom edges of x and y could lead to different scenarios.

Actually, I don't think W and SW are the only possibities. Let's think about it.

Here, let me draw regions to illustrate the constraints.

1. Region z (used as a reference):
```
   +-----+
   |  z  |
   +-----+
```

2. Region y is SW of z:
```
   +-----+
   |  z  |
   +-----+

+---+
| y |
+---+
```

3. Region x is W of y:
```
        +-----+
        |  z  |
        +-----+

+---+
| y |
+---+

+---+
| x |
+---+
```

But wait, the above isn't quite right. The constraints for region x being west of region y include:
- supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of y is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of y)

This means region x could look like:
```
        +-----+
        |  z  |
        +-----+

    +---+
    | y |
    +---+

+--+
| x|
+--+
```

And actually there are multiple ways to arrange region x while satisfying the constraints. Let me remind myself that "a W b" means that a is to the west of b, which means a is to the left of b, potentially with vertical overlap.

Let's remember the definition of "W", that is, a W b if and only if:
1. supx(a) <= infx(b) [a is to the left of b]
2. infy(b) <= infy(a) [the bottom edge of b is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of a]
3. supy(a) <= supy(b) [the top edge of a is below or at the same level as the top edge of b]

Similarly, a SW b if and only if:
1. supx(a) <= infx(b) [a is to the left of b]
2. supy(a) <= infy(b) [a is below b]

We know that x W y, which means:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) [x is to the left of y]
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) [the bottom edge of y is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of x]
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) [the top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of y]

And y SW z, which means:
1. supx(y) <= infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
2. supy(y) <= infy(z) [y is below z]

From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), we can deduce supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), we can deduce supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

So, the relation between x and z is that x is to the left of z and below z, which corresponds to the SW direction.

Specifically, x SW z.

Let me just confirm that I haven't missed anything. If x is W of y and y is SW of z, then x is in the same direction as y with respect to z, which is SW.

so x SW z

Actually, one more thing: let me just make sure that there's no way that the two regions can partially overlap, since that wouldn't be SW anymore.

For x and z to partially overlap, either their x-coordinates or y-coordinates would need to overlap. 

From the given constraints, we've deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means the x-coordinates don't overlap (x is entirely to the left of z). We've also deduced that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the y-coordinates don't overlap (x is entirely below z).

So, x and z don't overlap in any way, and the relation is SW.

Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me check the possible relations and see which ones satisfy the deduced constraints:
- x NW z: This would mean supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(z) <= infy(x). But we already deduced that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x).
- x N z: This would mean supy(z) <= infy(x) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). We already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).
- x NE z: This would mean supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(z) <= infy(x). We already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
- x W z: This would mean supx(x) <= infx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). We already deduced that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts infy(z) <= infy(x).
- x B z: This would mean infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). We already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).
- x E z: This would mean supx(z) <= infx(x) AND infy(z) <= infy(x) AND supy(x) <= supy(z). We already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).
- x SW z: This would mean supx(x) <= infx(z) AND supy(x) <= infy(z). These are exactly the conditions we deduced.
- x S z: This would mean supy(x) <= infy(z) AND infx(z) <= infx(x) AND supx(x) <= supx(z). We already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).
- x SE z: This would mean supx(z) <= infx(x) AND supy(x) <= infy(z). We already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

So, the only relation between x and z that is consistent with our deductions is SW.

So the correct answer is: x SW z.

Wait, let me look at the constraints again more closely. I'm given:
1. Region x is W of region y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
2. Region y is SW of region z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(z), I can deduce that supx(x) <= infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.

From supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(z), I can deduce that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x is below z.

But I need a bit more information. This is because "W" and "SW" are specific relations with specific constraints. A region can be to the left of another region without satisfying the "W" relation, and similarly, a region can be to the left and below another region without satisfying the "SW" relation.

For x to satisfy the "SW" relation with respect to z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (which we have)

So, the relation is SW.

Let's check another potentially valid relation, "W", for which we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (which we have)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) (which we need to check)
- supy(x) <= supy(z) (which we need to check)

Given our constraints, we know that supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies that supy(x) <= supy(z) (since infy(z) <= supy(z)). But it doesn't guarantee infy(z) <= infy(x). In fact, if supy(x) <= infy(z), then x and z don't overlap vertically, which means either infy(z) > supy(x) or infy(x) > supy(z). Given supy(x) <= infy(z), we get infy(z) > supy(x), but this doesn't tell us about infy(x) and infy(z).

Actually, we know:
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (from x W y)
But this doesn't provide a direct relationship between infy(x) and infy(z).

It's possible that infy(z) <= infy(x), but it's also possible that infy(x) < infy(z). We can't determine this from the given constraints.

If infy(z) <= infy(x), then we would have to check other constraints to distinguish between W and SW. But we know that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means the top edge of x is below the bottom edge of z. This rules out the possibility of a W relation, as W requires some vertical overlap between the regions.

So, the relation between x and z is SW.

Let's look at regions like this:
```
          +-----+
          |  z  |
          +-----+

     +---+
     | y |
     +---+

+-----+
|  x  |
+-----+
```

Here, x is to the west of y, and y is to the southwest of z. It's also clear that x is to the southwest of z.

So, the relation between x and z is SW.

I think we need to do a bit more careful analysis here.

From x W y, we have:
1. supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is entirely to the left of y)
2. infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottom edge of y is below or at the same level as the bottom edge of x)
3. supy(x) <= supy(y) (the top edge of x is below or at the same level as the top edge of y)

From y SW z, we have:
4. supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is entirely to the left of z)
5. supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is entirely below z)

From 1 and 4, we have:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is entirely to the left of z)

From 3 and 5, we have:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is entirely below z)

Based on these constraints, x is entirely to the left of z and entirely below z, which corresponds to the "SW" relation.

But let me check if there's any other possibility. Here's yet another set of regions:
```
          +-----+
          |  z  |
          +-----+

     +---+
     | y |
     +---+

+--+
| x|
+--+
```
This is also a valid configuration. X is West of y; y is SouthWest of z; and x is SouthWest of z.

Let me try to think of an counter-example, where x is not SouthWest of z. Remember, x is west of y (x is completely to the left of y, potentially with vertical overlap) and y is southwest of z (y is completely to the left and below z).

Given that y is completely below z, and x and y have some vertical overlap, x is also below z. Given that y is completely to the left of z, and x is completely to the left of y, x is also to the left of z.

So, the relation between x and z is SW. I believe this is the only possible relation given the constraints.

Wait, I think I see where the issue is. When I saw the constraint infy(y) <= infy(x), I kept thinking of a different arrangement, but I just mean that the bottom of x is no lower than the bottom of y. So that looks fine.

So I still come to the same conclusion, the relation between x and z is SW. It's the only relation consistent with the constraints.
Let me correct myself:

- The constraint infy(y) <= infy(x) means that the minimum y-coordinate of y is less than or equal to the minimum y-coordinate of x. This means the bottom edge of y is below or at the same height as the bottom edge of x.
- The constraint supy(x) <= supy(y) means that the maximum y-coordinate of x is less than or equal to the maximum y-coordinate of y. This means the top edge of x is below or at the same height as the top edge of y.

So, region x might have its bottom edge above the bottom edge of region y, but its top edge must be below or at the same height as the top edge of region y.

But this doesn't change the conclusion. Given that y is entirely below z, and the top edge of x is not above the top edge of y, x is still entirely below z.

So now, let me just do a complete check based on the definitions.

- W relation: a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- SW relation: a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
- S relation: a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- NW relation: a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- N relation: a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- NE relation: a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- E relation: a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- SE relation: a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
- B relation: a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

OK so now I need to check which relations are consistent with supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

For the NW relation, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we already deduced that supy(x) <= infy(z), which contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x).

For the N relation, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).

For the NE relation, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But we already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the W relation, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we deduced that supy(x) <= infy(z), which means x and z don't overlap vertically. Given that z is non-empty, infy(z) < supy(z), so for infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z) to both hold, we'd need supy(x) <= infy(x), which is a contradiction for a non-empty region.

For the B relation, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).

For the E relation, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

For the SW relation, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). These are exactly the conditions we deduced.

For the S relation, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x).

For the SE relation, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But we already deduced that supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

So, the only relation that's in line with the constraints is SW.

OK so the relation has to be SW.

Wait actually, let me think through this one more time. I think I might be overcomplicating things here.

Given:
- x W y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- y SW z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From these, we can deduce several constraints for the relationship between x and z.

The x-coordinate constraint:
- From "x W y", we know supx(x) <= infx(y).
- From "y SW z", we know supx(y) <= infx(z).
- Combining these, supx(x) <= infx(y) <= infx(z).
- This means x is to the left of z.

The y-coordinate constraint:
- From "x W y", we know supy(x) <= supy(y).
- From "y SW z", we know supy(y) <= infy(z).
- Combining these, supy(x) <= supy(y) <= infy(z).
- This means x is below z.

Given the above, we have:
- x is to the left of z.
- x is below z.

Since x is to the left of z and below z, the relation between x and z is SW.

I think I see my issue of understanding now. Before, I was thinking maybe there is a case where x could be S of x or W of z. But after carefully checking, those cases don't align with the constraints:

For x S z, we'd need x to be directly below z (not to the left), which doesn't align with the derived constraint supx(x) <= infx(z).

For x W z, we'd need x to be directly to the left of z, potentially with vertical overlap. But the derived constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) ensures that x and z don't overlap vertically.

Let's just double check to make sure that there really is no other possible relation than SW. 

Actually, there's also a possibility of regions being disjoint but not in a cardinal direction relationship. For example, consider:
```
    +---+
    | z |
    +---+

+--+
| x|
+--+
```
In this case, x isn't directly SW of z, but rather is disjointly positioned.

But actually, the definition of SW I'm working with is precisely a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b). This just means a is to the left of b and below b. It doesn't necessarily have to be in a strict SW direction.

The constraints I've deduced for the relationship between x and z are exactly the ones for the SW direction:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

So, the relation between x and z is SW.

Now I'm confident that SW is the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints.

To recap:
- Region x is W of region y: supx(x) <= infx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(y).
- Region y is SW of region z: supx(y) <= infx(z) and supy(y) <= infy(z).

From these, we deduced:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z)

These constraints correspond to the SW relation.

The answer is: SW.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- Region y is SW of region z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, I can deduce:
- From supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), by transitivity: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- From supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), by transitivity: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These two deduced constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) match exactly the definition of the SW relation.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.
