PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step.

Given:
- x is SW of y
- y is E of z

Let's use the definitions to understand what these relations mean geometrically.

x is SW of y means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

y is E of z means:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z and y have vertical overlap)

Now, let's analyze what this means for the relation between x and z.

From x is SW of y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y is E of z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z and y have vertical overlap)

Comparing x and z:
- For the x-coordinates: We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means both x and z are to the left of y, but we can't determine the exact relationship between x and z based on the x-coordinates.
- For the y-coordinates: We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z and y have vertical overlap). This implies that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), meaning x is below z as well.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- S (South): If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x has horizontal overlap with z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).
- SW (South West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).
- SE (South East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z).

However, I realize I made a mistake. Given that both x and z are to the left of y, it's not possible for x to be to the right of z, so SE is not a valid relation. So I need to reconsider.

Wait, I need to be more careful with the interpretation. From y is E of z, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y). From x is SW of y, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y). These two conditions don't allow us to determine the relative placement of x and z along the x-axis, since both are just constrained to be to the left of y. 

So, based on the given information, I need to more carefully analyze what relations are possible between x and z.

From the given constraints, we only know that:
- x is to the left of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
- x is below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y))
- z is to the left of y (supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
- z and y have vertical overlap (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

From these, we can deduce that x is below z. This is because x is below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), and y is within the vertical range of z (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)). 

Therefore, we can say that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z.

For the horizontal relationship, we don't have enough information to determine whether x is to the left, right, or overlapping with z horizontally, since both x and z are just constrained to be to the left of y.

Hmm, actually, let me revisit the definitions and make sure I'm interpreting them correctly.

a is SW of b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).
a is E of b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

So, we have:
- x is SW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- y is E of z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

OK, so from y is E of z, we know that supx(z) ≤ infx(y), meaning z is to the left of y. Also, we know that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z), meaning y has a vertical overlap with z but is placed lower than the top of z and higher than the bottom of z.

From x is SW of y, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y), meaning x is to the left of y. Also, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y), meaning x is below y.

So, for the horizontal relationship between x and z, both x and z are to the left of y, but we can't determine the exact relationship between x and z based on the given information. x could be to the left, right, or have an overlap with z.

For the vertical relationship between x and z, we know that x is below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)) and y has a vertical overlap with z (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)). This means that x could be below z, or x could have a vertical overlap with z but be placed lower.

Given these observations, the potential relationships between x and z include:
- S (South): If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- SW (South West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- SE (South East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- W (West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- B (Bounding box): If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- E (East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

However, some of these might not be feasible given the constraints. Let's revisit.

OK I realize I've been making a conceptual mistake. The fact that y has a vertical overlap with z doesn't necessarily imply anything direct about the vertical relationship between x and z. Similarly, the fact that both x and z are to the left of y doesn't necessarily restrict their horizontal relationship with each other.

Let's approach this differently. Let's consider the cardinal directions as regions in a 2D space and try to understand the potential positions of x, y, and z.

Ah, I think part of my confusion stems from trying to deduce too directly from the definitions rather than visualizing the problem. Let's revisit with a clearer picture.

Given:
- x is SW of y
- y is E of z

This means:
- x is below and to the left of y.
- y is to the right of z and has some vertical overlap with z.

Now, think about where x could be in relation to z. x is below and to the left of y, while z is to the left of y and has a vertical overlap with y. So, x is to the left of y (which is to the right of z), and below y (which has a vertical overlap with z).

Let's visualize this. Let's say the 2D space is divided into 9 regions with z at the center:

NW  N  NE
 W  z   E
SW  S  SE

We know that y is E of z, so y is in the E region. Now, x is SW of y. So, where can x be?

Since y is in the E region relative to z, and x is SW of y, x could be in:
- S of z (if x is directly below z)
- SW of z (if x is below and to the left of z)
- W of z (if x is to the left of z and has a vertical overlap with z)
- B of z (if x is inside the bounding box of z)
- SE of z (if x is below and to the right of z, but still to the left of y)
- E of z (if x is to the right of z, has a vertical overlap with z, but is still to the left of y)

Wait, I think I might still be missing something here. Let me revisit once more.

Let's make this simpler. If y is E of z, then y is in the E region of z. Now, if x is SW of y, then x is in the SW region of y.

Relative to z, y is in the E region, which looks roughly like:
```
  |
z | y
  |
```

Now, relative to y, x is in the SW region:
```
  |
y |
  |
x |
```

Combine both, and we get:
```
  |
z | y
  |
x |
```

So, x could be south of z (if directly below), southwest of z (if below and to the left), or west of z (if to the left and at the same vertical level).

However, I realize that the relationship between x and z depends on the exact positions of x, y, and z. We only know the cardinal direction relations, not the exact positions. So, we need to explore all possible scenarios.

Let's think of it geometrically. We know that x is SW of y and y is E of z. Visually, I can place z in the middle of a 3x3 grid:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | z | E
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Since y is E of z, y is somewhere in the E region.

Now, the SW region of y comprises all points that are both below and to the left of y. Given that y is in the E region of z, the SW region of y could overlap with:
- The B (bounding box) region of z (if y is very close to z)
- The S region of z
- The SW region of z
- The W region of z
- The SE region of z
- The E region of z (if y extends far to the right and x is still to the left of y but to the right of z)

Let's simplify further. I'll place y exactly in the E region of z:

```
NW | N | NE
---+---+---
 W | z | y
---+---+---
SW | S | SE
```

Now, the SW region of y looks like this:

```
    |
    |
----y
    |
   x|
```

Combining these two diagrams, the SW region of y (where x lies) could overlap with the B, S, SW, W, SE, or E regions of z, depending on how far y is from z.

But let's think about this in terms of the constraints provided.

Given:
- x is SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is E of z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's analyze these constraints more systematically.

For the x-coordinate relationship between x and z:
- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means both x and z are to the left of y. However, we can't determine the exact relationship between x and z based on the x-coordinates. x could be to the left, right, or have an overlap with z.

For the y-coordinate relationship between x and z:
- We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y). We also know infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (the bottom of z is above or at the same level as the bottom of y). This means supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but we can't directly deduce the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).

Let's simplify this analysis. We know:
- Both x and z are to the left of y.
- x is below y.
- z has a vertical overlap with y, such that the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y.

Given these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- SW (South West): If x is below and to the left of z.
- S (South): If x is directly below z.
- SE (South East): If x is below and to the right of z (but still to the left of y).
- W (West): If x is directly to the left of z and has a vertical overlap with z.
- B (Bounding box): If x is within the bounding box of z.
- E (East): If x is directly to the right of z, has a vertical overlap with z, and is still to the left of y.

However, I should analyze carefully which of these are truly possible given the constraints. 

Let's revisit. We know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (the top of y is below or at the same level as the top of z)

Let's analyze the relationship between infy(z) and supy(x):
- We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y).
- From these, we can't deduce the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It could be the case that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), or supy(x) > infy(z).

This means x could be below z or have a vertical overlap with z.

Now, let's analyze the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z):
- We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
- From these, we can't deduce the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z). It could be the case that infx(x) ≤ supx(z), or infx(x) > supx(z).

This means x could be to the left, right, or have a horizontal overlap with z, as long as both are to the left of y.

Given these analyses, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- SW (South West): If x is below and to the left of z.
- S (South): If x is directly below z.
- SE (South East): If x is below and to the right of z (but still to the left of y).
- W (West): If x is directly to the left of z and has a vertical overlap with z.
- B (Bounding box): If x is within the bounding box of z.
- E (East): If x is directly to the right of z, has a vertical overlap with z, and is still to the left of y.

Additionally:
- NW: If x is to the left of z and above the bottom of z.
- N: If x is above z and not to the left or right of z.
- NE: If x is to the right of z and above the bottom of z.

Wait, let me recheck the definition of the cardinal directions:

A cardinal direction relation is defined as:
- a B b if and only if infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- a S b if and only if supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)
- a W b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- a N b if and only if supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supx(a) ≤ supx(b)
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- a E b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

I'll check whether the relation NW is feasible:
For x NW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). From the constraints, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). If we were to have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then combining these inequalities would give supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which implies supy(x) ≤ infy(x), a contradiction for a valid region. So, x cannot be NW of z.

I'll check whether the relation N is feasible:
For x N of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). As with the NW case, having supy(z) ≤ infy(x) would lead to a contradiction. So, x cannot be N of z.

I'll check whether the relation NE is feasible:
For x NE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). As with the NW and N cases, having supy(z) ≤ infy(x) would lead to a contradiction. So, x cannot be NE of z.

For the remaining relations, I'll check each individually:

For x B z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x S z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x W z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x E z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: B, S, SW, W, SE, E.

But wait! Let's double-check if x E z is feasible.

For x E z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y). If we have supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then we would have supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y). This doesn't contradict any of the given constraints, so x E z is feasible.

But actually, let's revisit. x E z and x SE z require that supx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning x is to the right of z. At the same time, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), meaning both x and z are to the left of y. So, it's possible for x to be to the right of z yet still be to the left of y.

Let's make sure this horizontal arrangement is feasible: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y). This arrangement complies with the constraints, so x E z and x SE z are feasible.

Actually, let's visualize the constraints:

From x is SW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

From y is E of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the left of y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (the bottom of z is below or at the same level as the bottom of y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (the top of y is below or at the same level as the top of z)

As I visualize, I'm thinking that the constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(y) could indeed place x below z. Specifically, if infy(z) is near or at infy(y), then x would be below z. But if infy(z) is significantly lower than infy(y), then x and z might have a vertical overlap.

Similarly, for the horizontal relationship, both x and z are to the left of y. But the exact horizontal relationship between x and z depends on their exact positions, which we don't know. So, I think the relations I previously listed (B, S, SW, W, SE, E) remain feasible.

But I'll double-check. For x to be NW, N, or NE of z, x needs to be above z, which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But from the constraints, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). Combining these would give supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). For x to be above z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). But we've just shown that supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(x), a contradiction for a valid region. So, x cannot be NW, N, or NE of z.

So, the feasible relations are: B, S, SW, W, SE, E.

But, I'm forgetting to account for the connectedness of regions. Let me revisit the conditions for a valid cardinal direction relation. A cardinal direction relation  R1: ... : Rk, must ensure that the regions a1, ..., ak (where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b)) should be such that a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG (the set of regions that are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk).

This basically means that the union of the tiles must form a connected region. Let's see if this adds any constraints.

Actually, I've been making a mistake. I've been interpreting the question as "In what tile of z can x be?" But the cardinal direction relations are defined from the perspective of the primary region. So, the question is asking for the cardinal direction relation from x to z, not from z to x.

So, the interpretation should be: If x is SW of y and y is E of z, then what is the cardinal direction relation from x to z? 

Let's go back to the definitions:
- x is SW of y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is E of z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For x to be N of z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But, as I've shown earlier, having supy(z) ≤ infy(x) would lead to a contradiction with the given constraints.

For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Again, having supy(z) ≤ infy(x) would lead to a contradiction.

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Again, having supy(z) ≤ infy(x) would lead to a contradiction.

So, the relations N, NE, and NW are not feasible for the cardinal direction from x to z.

For x to be B of z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x to be S of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x to be SW of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x to be W of z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x to be SE of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

For x to be E of z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This seems feasible given the constraints.

But wait, let me revisit the region connectedness constraint. I'm forgetting to account for it.

No, I mis-understood. The connectedness constraint is a criterion for a valid cardinal direction relation, but it doesn't impact this specific problem. We're not constructing a new cardinal direction relation; instead, we're deducing the relationship based on given cardinal directions. The regions x, y, and z are presumed to be in REG (connected regions), so no special adjustment for connectedness is necessary.

So, to summarize, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are: B, S, SW, W, SE, E.

Actually, wait, I think I just had a realization: for x to be B of z, we'll need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), meaning z's x span fully covers x. But we already know both supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), but that doesn't constrain their relative positions except that they're both to the left of y. So, for B to work, we need an x and z configuration where x is horizontally contained within z, which is completely possible as there's nothing preventing infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Similarly, for the vertical constraint, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The latter is a direct result of supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). And the former? We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't relate infy(z) and infy(x) directly. It's plausible for x to have its bottom edge (infy(x)) above the bottom edge of z (infy(z)). So, x could be B of z, meaning x can be contained within the bounding box of z.

Mmm, let me just double check that. I know that x is SW of y, so supx(x) <= infx(y) and supy(x) <= infy(y). Also, y is E of z, so supx(z) <= infx(y).

If x is B of z, then we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).  But I realize now we've no reason to believe infx(z) ≤ infx(x). We have that supx(x) <= infx(y) and supx(z) <= infx(y), but those doesn't tell us much about where z starts on the x coordinate compared to where x starts (they just tell us that both x and z end, on the x coordinate, to the left of where y starts).

Hmm, I'm noticing the problem is underconstrainted.  We're given about about how x relates to y (x is the southwest quarter of the plane, relative to y) and how y relates to z (y is in the eastern third of the plane, relative to z), but that means x could be in a lot of places, relative to z.

Let's try to be more systematic and draw some pictures to gain insight.

Given:
- x is SW of y: This means x is in the bottom-left quarter of the plane with respect to y.
- y is E of z: This means y is in the right third of the plane with respect to z, with some vertical overlap.

Let's consider a specific layout where z is the reference, and then place y to the right of z (the E region), and then place x in the SW region of y. As I draw this out, I see that there are certain positions where x's location relative to z could be: B, S, SW, W, SE, or E.

But the more I think about it, the more I realize that NW, N, and NE are not feasible. Because if x were to be in any of these regions with respect to z, it means x is above z, which would contradict the constraint that x is below y (from x is SW of y) and y has a vertical overlap with z (from y is E of z).

Similarly, as I try to visualize these scenarios, I realize that the fact that x is SW of y and y is E of z, doesn't actually constrain x to be within the bounding box of z. For x to be B of z, we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), but the given constraints don't guarantee this.

So, as I revisit, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are: S, SW, W, SE, E.  Actually, I realize that B also works: if we have a configuration where infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), this is consistent with the constraints that x is SW of y and y is E of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are: B, S, SW, W, SE, E.

Let me do one final sanity check. 

For x is SW of y, we have: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
For y is E of z, we have: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z).

From these, we can infer:
1. Both x and z are to the left of y.
2. x is below y, and z starts at or below where y starts, and extends to or above where y ends.
3. We can't determine exactly where x is with respect to z. x could be to the left of z, to the right of z, or even overlap with z, as long as they're both to the left of y.
4. Similarly, x could be below z, or they could have a vertical overlap, as long as x is below y and z starts at or below where y starts.

With these considerations, I believe the following cardinal direction relations from x to z are possible: B, S, SW, W, SE, E.

Given these, we need to determine whether the x-coordinate interval of x (infx(x) to supx(x)) overlaps with, is to the left of, or is to the right of the x-coordinate interval of z (infx(z) to supx(z)).

Similarly, we need to determine whether the y-coordinate interval of x (infy(x) to supy(x)) overlaps with or is below the y-coordinate interval of z (infy(z) to supy(z)).

Let's make this more concrete with an example. Suppose we have:
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2
- infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 0.5

Checking the constraints:
- x is SW of y: supx(x) = 1 ≤ infx(y) = 3 and supy(x) = 0.5 ≤ infy(y) = 1. ✓
- y is E of z: supx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 3, infy(z) = 0 ≤ infy(y) = 1, and supy(y) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 3. ✓

Now, analyzing the relation between x and z:
- Horizontal relationship: infx(x) = 0 = infx(z) and supx(x) = 1 < supx(z) = 2, so x spans a portion of z along the x-axis.
- Vertical relationship: infy(x) = 0 = infy(z) and supy(x) = 0.5 < supy(z) = 3, so x spans a portion of z along the y-axis.

According to the cardinal direction relation definitions, x is B (bounding box) of z.

Now, let's modify our example. Suppose we have:
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2
- infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 0.5

Checking the constraints:
- x is SW of y: supx(x) = 1 ≤ infx(y) = 3 and supy(x) = 0.5 ≤ infy(y) = 1. ✓
- y is E of z: supx(z) = 2 ≤ infx(y) = 3, infy(z) = 1 ≤ infy(y) = 1, and supy(y) = 2 ≤ supy(z) = 3. ✓

Analyzing the relation between x and z:
- Horizontal relationship: infx(x) = 0 = infx(z) and supx(x) = 1 < supx(z) = 2, so x spans a portion of z along the x-axis.
- Vertical relationship: supy(x) = 0.5 < infy(z) = 1, so x is below z.

According to the cardinal direction relation definitions, x is S (south) of z.

Actually, let's redo this to cover all possible relations, making sure to focus on x vs z horizontal and vertical relationships.

For x to be B of z, I'll need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x inside z's horizontal span)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x inside z's vertical span)

For example:
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2
- infx(x) = 0.5, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 0.5, supy(x) = 0.8

For x to be S of z, I'll need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x inside z's horizontal span)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x below z's vertical span)

For example:
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2
- infx(x) = 0.5, supx(x) = 1, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 0.5

For x to be SW of z, I'll need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x to the left of z's horizontal span)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x below z's vertical span)

For example:
- infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2
- infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 0.5, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 0.5

For x to be W of z, I'll need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x to the left of z's horizontal span)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x inside z's vertical span)

For example:
- infx(z) = 1, supx(z) = 2, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2
- infx(x) = 0, supx(x) = 0.5, infy(x) = 0.5, supy(x) = 0.8

For x to be SE of z, I'll need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x to the right of z's horizontal span)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x below z's vertical span)

For example:
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 1, supy(z) = 3
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 2.5, infy(x) = 0, supy(x) = 0.5

For x to be E of z, I'll need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x to the right of z's horizontal span)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x inside z's vertical span)

For example:
- infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 3
- infx(y) = 3, supx(y) = 4, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 2
- infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 2.5, infy(x) = 0.5, supy(x) = 0.8

I've checked each relation and provided a possible configuration for each. All of the relations B, S, SW, W, SE, and E are feasible given the constraints that x is SW of y and y is E of z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are: B, S, SW, W, SE, E.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints, I need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is E of z: This means supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, I can determine:
1. Both x and z are to the left of y (since supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
2. x is below y (since supy(x) ≤ infy(y))
3. z has vertical overlap with y (infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

Analyzing the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z:

- B: If x is inside z's bounding box
- S: If x is directly below z with horizontal overlap
- SW: If x is to the left and below z
- W: If x is to the left of z with vertical overlap
- SE: If x is to the right of z (but still left of y) and below z
- E: If x is to the right of z (but still left of y) with vertical overlap

The relations N, NE, and NW are not possible because these would require x to be above z in some capacity, which contradicts our constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: B, S, SW, W, SE, E.
