PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step. We're given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is S of region z

And we need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

According to the definitions:
- x N y means: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y S z means: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's see what we can infer about the relationship between x and z.

From x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) 
- supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's try to determine the possible relations between x and z:

From the y-coordinates:
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z)

These don't directly tell us about the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). Both infy(x) and infy(z) are greater than or equal to supy(y), but we can't determine their relationship to each other.

From the x-coordinates:
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means that the x-projections of region x are contained within the x-projections of region z. Specifically, the x-projection of x is narrower than or equal to the x-projection of z.

But for the y-coordinates, we only know that both infy(x) and infy(z) are greater than or equal to supy(y), but we don't know their relationship to each other.

Let's visualize some possibilities:

Case 1: infy(x) > infy(z)
In this case, region x is strictly north of region z. This corresponds to the relation "x N z".

Case 2: infy(x) = infy(z)
If they have the same lower y-coordinate, then x could be any of: N, NE, NW, B (depending on the relationship between the x-coordinates).

However, from our derivation above, we know that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This restricts the possibilities.

If infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) < supx(z), then x is completely inside the x-bounds of z. Combined with infy(x) = infy(z), this means x is in the northern part of z, which corresponds to "x N z".

If infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(x) < supx(z), then x is aligned with z on the left but is narrower. This corresponds to either "x N z" or "x NW z" (depending on other conditions).

If infx(z) < infx(x) and supx(x) = supx(z), then x is aligned with z on the right but is narrower. This corresponds to either "x N z" or "x NE z" (depending on other conditions).

If infx(z) = infx(x) and supx(x) = supx(z), then x and z have the same x-bounds. With infy(x) = infy(z), this means x is directly on top of z, which is "x N z".

Case 3: infy(x) < infy(z)
If x's lower y-bound is below z's, then x could overlap with z or be completely inside or beside it, etc. This would give various relations like B, NE, NW, etc.

But wait, we need to be more careful here. The definition of cardinal direction relations requires regions to belong to REG, which means they are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk. This means they are "nice" shapes without holes or disconnected parts.

Given that x is N of y and y is S of z, and considering what REG implies, let's rediscuss the possible relations between x and z:

1. N (North): This is possible if x is strictly north of z, with no overlap in the y-coordinates.
2. NE (Northeast): This is possible if x is to the northeast of z.
3. NW (Northwest): This is possible if x is to the northwest of z.
4. E (East): This is possible if x is strictly to the east of z.
5. W (West): This is possible if x is strictly to the west of z.
6. B (Bounding box): This is possible if x is entirely inside the bounding box of z.
7. NE/E, NW/W, etc.: These combined relations would not be single tile relations as described in the definitions, but would represent more complex spatial arrangements.

Let's re-evaluate based on the constraints we've derived.

From our earlier analysis, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

I'm a bit confused because the constraints we derived don't seem to match the possible tile relationships I thought of. Let me revisit the definitions and the given conditions to ensure I'm on the right track.

So the cardinal direction relation "x N y" means that region x is North of region y, and the tile relation "y S z" means that region y is South of region z.

From the definition of N, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge or aligned with it)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of y's right edge or aligned with it)

In simple terms, x is above y and x's x-projection is contained within the x-projection of y.

Similarly, for y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of z's left edge or aligned with it)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of z's right edge or aligned with it)

In simple terms, y is below z and y's x-projection is contained within the x-projection of z.

Now, let's see what we can derive about the relationship between x and z.

From the conditions, we can determine:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge)

This doesn't match with what I said before. Let me recalculate:

For the x-coordinates:
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (from the first and third inequalities)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (from the second and fourth inequalities)

Actually, this doesn't fully make sense logically. Let me re-read the definitions and constraints.

For the x-coordinates:
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means that the x-projections are not necessarily contained within each other. It seems like the x-projection of x is shifted to the right compared to the x-projection of z, and the x-projection of z is wider or at least as wide as the x-projection of x.

For the y-coordinates:
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z)

This tells us that both x and z are above y, but doesn't directly tell us about the relationship between x and z in the y-direction. They could be at the same height, one above the other, or overlapping in the y-direction.

Given the constraints, let's enumerate the possible relations between x and z:

1. N (North): This is possible if x is strictly north of z, with no overlap in the y-coordinates.
2. NE (Northeast): This is possible if x is to the northeast of z, with x's left edge to the right of z's right edge and x being above z.
3. NW (Northwest): This doesn't seem possible given the constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
4. E (East): This is possible if x is strictly to the east of z, with x's left edge to the right of z's right edge and x overlapping with z in the y-direction.
5. W (West): This doesn't seem possible given the constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
6. SE (Southeast): This is possible if x is to the southeast of z, with x's left edge to the right of z's right edge and x being below z.
7. SW (Southwest): This doesn't seem possible given the constraint infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x).
8. S (South): This doesn't seem possible given the relationships we've derived.
9. B (Bounding box): This is possible if x is entirely inside the bounding box of z.

Actually, I think I'm confusing myself.

Let's simplify this problem by drawing the constraints as bounding boxes:

For x N y, we have:
```
   +---x---+
   |       |
   +-------+
      |       |
      +---y---+
```

For y S z, we have:
```
      +---z---+
      |       |
      +-------+
   +---y---+
   |       |
   +-------+
```

Combining the two scenarios, we have:
```
      +---x---+
      |       |
      +-------+
         |       |
         +---y---+
      +---z---+
      |       |
      +-------+
```

This is where I get confused, because it's not clear from the constraints where x and z should be in relation to each other.

Let's approach this differently. The constraint x N y means that x is north of y. The constraint y S z means that y is south of z. If y is south of z, then z is north of y. And if x is north of y, then x is north of z's south, which means x could be anywhere north of the southern part of z (e.g. N, NE, NW, B).

Hmm, let me be even more precise in the constraints:

For x N y, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge or aligned with it)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of y's right edge or aligned with it)

For y S z, we have:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of z's left edge or aligned with it)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of z's right edge or aligned with it)

Now, let's derive the relationships between x and z:

For the y-coordinates:
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

So, both x and z are above y, but we can't determine their relationship to each other in the y-direction without additional information.

For the x-coordinates:
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, the x-projection of x is to the right of the x-projection of z, and x's x-projection is narrower than z's x-projection.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. x N z: This is possible if infy(z) <= infy(x) (z is below x).
2. x NE z: This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) (x is above z).
3. x B z: This is possible if infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (x is vertically inside z), and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x is horizontally inside z).

But the conditions I gave don't match with the condition we derived. The original definition of x NE z requires supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a), whereas I said supx(z) <= infx(x). Let me revisit the definition.

For x NE z, the definition says: "a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)". Replacing a with x and b with z, we get: x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).

The condition I provided previously, supx(z) <= infx(x), says that x is to the right of z, which is consistent with the NE direction. But the condition we derived, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), suggests that x's x-projection is inside z's x-projection but shifted to the right. This doesn't align with x NE z.

Let me look at the definition of bounding box again: "a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b)". Replacing a with x and b with z, we get: x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

The conditions we derived, infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), do match with part of the definition of x B z. However, we need additional constraints on the y-coordinates to fully determine if x B z.

I think I've been making an error in my reasoning. The constraints x N y and y S z don't fully determine the relationship between x and z. They give us partial information, and based on that partial information, there are multiple possible relationships between x and z. Let's enumerate them by considering the y-coordinates as well.

Given the constraints:
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)

We know both x and z are above y. The relationship between x and z in the y-direction can be any of the following:
1. infy(x) > supy(z): x is above z.
2. infy(x) = supy(z): x's bottom edge aligns with z's top edge.
3. infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) > supy(z): x overlaps with z in the y-direction, but x extends above z.
4. supy(x) = supy(z): x's top edge aligns with z's top edge.
5. supy(x) < supy(z): x is entirely within z in the y-direction.
6. infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) > infy(z): x overlaps with z in the y-direction, but x extends below z.
7. infy(x) = infy(z): x's bottom edge aligns with z's bottom edge.
8. infy(x) < infy(z) and supy(x) < infy(z): x is below z.

And in the x-direction:
- We derived: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

This means x's x-projection is inside z's x-projection but shifted to the right.

Let me revisit the definition of the possible cardinal direction relations again:

1. B (Bounding box): x B z if and only if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). This corresponds to case 5 in the y-direction enumeration.

2. S (South): x S z if and only if supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). This corresponds to case 8 in the y-direction enumeration.

3. SW (Southwest): x SW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Given the derived constraints, this doesn't seem possible.

4. W (West): x W z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Given the derived constraints, this doesn't seem possible.

5. NW (Northwest): x NW z if and only if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Given the derived constraints, this doesn't seem possible.

6. N (North): x N z if and only if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). This corresponds to case 1 in the y-direction enumeration.

7. NE (Northeast): x NE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Given the derived constraints, this doesn't seem possible because we derived supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x).

8. E (East): x E z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Given the derived constraints, this doesn't seem possible for the same reason as NE.

9. SE (Southeast): x SE z if and only if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). Given the derived constraints, this doesn't seem possible for the same reason as NE.

Wait, I think I have a mistake in my derivation above.

For the x-coordinates:
- From x N y: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Combining, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (this is linear, so it's correct)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (this is also linear, so it's correct)

But I just realized this doesn't restrict the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z), or between supx(x) and infx(z). So, x could be to the right of z, to the left of z, or overlapping with z in the x-direction.

I'm being very careful with my reasoning. The key is to precisely identify what the constraints tell us and what they don't. Let me restate the constraints and the possible relations.

From x N y:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of y's left edge or aligned with it)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of y's right edge or aligned with it)

From y S z:
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of z's left edge or aligned with it)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of z's right edge or aligned with it)

Combing the constraints for the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)

This means both x and z are above y, but it doesn't tell us the relationship between x and z in the y-direction.

Combining the constraints for the x-coordinates:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y S z)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y S z)

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge)

But this doesn't determine the relationship between infx(x) and supx(z), so x and z could either overlap in the x-direction or not.

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. N (North): This is possible if supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The last two conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints, and the first is possible based on the possible relationships in the y-direction.

2. NE (Northeast): This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The second condition is possible based on the possible relationships in the y-direction, but the first contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z).

3. NW (Northwest): This is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x).

4. E (East): This is possible if supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z).

5. W (West): This is possible if supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x).

6. B (Bounding box): This is possible if infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints, and the last two are possible based on the possible relationships in the y-direction.

That's weird. Based on my analysis, the only possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are N and B.

Let me revisit the constraints more carefully to make sure I'm not overlooking anything.

Wait, I think I see my confusion. I've been treating the derived constraints as absolute, but they are just necessary conditions. Let's think more carefully about what the original constraints tell us.

Given the constraints:
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let me try to think in terms of the positions of the regions on the plane.

Region y is south of z, which means y is below z. Region x is north of y, which means x is above y. So, we have y at the bottom, and above y, we have both x and z. But we don't know the vertical relationship between x and z. x could be higher, at the same height, or lower than z.

In the horizontal direction, the constraints tell us that the x-projection of y is contained within the x-projection of z (because infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)). Similarly, the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y (because infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)). So, the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z.

However, these constraints just give us the boundaries of where regions can be. The actual regions can be any homeomorphic image of the closed unit disk within these boundaries. So, there are many possible configurations.

Given the constraints, let's enumerate the possible relations between x and z.

North (N): x is north of z.
For x to be north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The second and third conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints. The first condition can be satisfied in some configurations, so x N z is possible.

NorthWest (NW): x is northwest of z.
For x to be northwest of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x), so x NW z is not possible.

West (W): x is west of z.
For x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x), so x W z is not possible.

SouthWest (SW): x is southwest of z.
For x to be southwest of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x), so x SW z is not possible.

South (S): x is south of z.
For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The second and third conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints. The first condition can be satisfied if infy(z) is large enough, so x S z is possible.

SouthEast (SE): x is southeast of z.
For x to be southeast of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z), so x SE z is not possible.

East (E): x is east of z.
For x to be east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z), so x E z is not possible.

NorthEast (NE): x is northeast of z.
For x to be northeast of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z), so x NE z is not possible.

Bounding Box (B): x is inside the bounding box of z.
For x to be inside the bounding box of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints. The last two conditions can be satisfied in some configurations, so x B z is possible.

Actually, I've been assuming that the regions have non-zero area. But let's consider the case where region x, region y, or region z are single points. This will give us boundary cases.

But actually, this doesn't change the possible relations. The analysis above should still hold.

Let's actually manually check each potential relationship between x and z:

1. N (North): For x to be north of z, x needs to be completely above z. This is possible if x is also further above than z is.
2. S (South): For x to be south of z, x needs to be completely below z. But this doesn't seem possible because x is north of y, and y is south of z. So, x is north of something that is south of z, which suggests x should be somewhere around z, not south of it. But let me think about this more...
Wait, it seems not initially intuitive but actually, x S z is possible. Just because y is south of z and x is north of y, it doesn't necessarily mean x is north of z. x could be at a middle height, such that it's above y but still below z.
3. E (East): For x to be east of z, x's left boundary should be to the right of z's right boundary. But we derived supx(x) <= supx(z), which means x's right boundary is to the left of or at z's right boundary. So, x cannot be completely to the east of z. Thus, x E z is not possible.
4. W (West): For x to be west of z, x's right boundary should be to the left of z's left boundary. But we derived infx(z) <= infx(x), which means z's left boundary is to the left of or at x's left boundary. So, x cannot be completely to the west of z. Thus, x W z is not possible.
5. NE (Northeast): For x to be northeast of z, x should be completely to the right and above z. But, as we've seen, x cannot be completely to the right of z. Thus, x NE z is not possible.
6. NW (Northwest): For x to be northwest of z, x should be completely to the left and above z. But, as we've seen, x cannot be completely to the left of z. Thus, x NW z is not possible.
7. SE (Southeast): For x to be southeast of z, x should be completely to the right and below z. But, as we've seen, x cannot be completely to the right of z. Thus, x SE z is not possible.
8. SW (Southwest): For x to be southwest of z, x should be completely to the left and below z. But, as we've seen, x cannot be completely to the left of z. Thus, x SW z is not possible.
9. B (Bounding box): For x to be inside the bounding box of z, x's boundaries should be within z's boundaries. We've derived that x's x-projection is within z's x-projection. If x's y-projection is also within z's y-projection (which is possible), then x B z is possible.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relations between x and z are N, S, and B.

But let me revisit the relationship between the constraints and the possible configurations.

From the original constraints:
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Let's see what they tell us about the relationships between x and z.

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (x is above y)
- supy(y) <= infy(z) (z is above y)

This means both x and z are above y. But it doesn't tell us the relationship between x and z in the y-direction.

For the x-coordinates:
- From the original constraints, we derived infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which means x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection.

Given these constraints, let's reconsider the possible relations between x and z:

1. N (North): For x to be north of z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The second and third conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints. The first condition depends on the specific positions of x and z. If x is higher up than z, then x N z is possible.

2. S (South): For x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The second and third conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints. For the first condition, we need x to be below z. Given that x is above y and y is below z, it's possible for x to be in a position where it's above y but below z. Thus, x S z is possible.

3. E (East): For x to be east of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z). Thus, x E z is not possible.

4. W (West): For x to be west of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). Thus, x W z is not possible.

5. NE (Northeast): For x to be northeast of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z). Thus, x NE z is not possible.

6. NW (Northwest): For x to be northwest of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). Thus, x NW z is not possible.

7. SE (Southeast): For x to be southeast of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z). Thus, x SE z is not possible.

8. SW (Southwest): For x to be southwest of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The first condition contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x). Thus, x SW z is not possible.

9. B (Bounding box): For x to be inside the bounding box of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). The first two conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints. The last two conditions depend on the specific positions of x and z. If x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection, then x B z is possible.

Based on this analysis, the only possible relations between x and z are N, S, and B.

Let me double check.

Given the original constraints:
- x is north of y
- y is south of z

And the derived constraints:
- Both x and z are above y
- x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z))

Let's visually represent the possible relationships between x and z:

1. x N z: x is above z
```
+--x--+
|      |
+------+
   +--z--+
   |      |
   +------+
     +--y--+
     |      |
     +------+
```

2. x S z: x is below z (but still above y)
```
  +--z--+
  |      |
  +------+
+--x--+
|      |
+------+
  +--y--+
  |      |
  +------+
```

3. x B z: x is inside z's bounding box
```
  +--z--+
  |      |
  | +--x--+
  | |      |
  | +------+
  +------+
    +--y--+
    |      |
    +------+
```

Thinking again, I'm wondering if the requirements for 'x S z' is possible.

Recall that the derived constraints showed that infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This indicates that x's horizontal extent is contained within that of z, thereby ruling out the possibility that x could be positioned entirely to the east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest of z. So Cardinal directions E, W, NE, NW, SE, and SW are not possible.

Let's consider x S z. For this to be true, supy(x) <= infy(z) (x is below z), infx(z) <= infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of z's left edge or aligned with it), and supx(x) <= supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge or aligned with it).

The second and third conditions are satisfied by the derived constraints. For the first condition, we need x to be completely below z.

x N y indicates that supy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above y.
y S z indicates that supy(y) <= infy(z), which means y is below z.

So, y is below z and x is above y. If x is below z (as required for x S z), and x is above y (as given), and y is below z (as given), then we have:
infy(z) >= supy(x) (from x S z)
supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
supy(y) <= infy(z) (from y S z)

The above set of constraints is consistent. In fact, we can construct a valid configuration where x is below z but above y. So, x S z is indeed possible.

So, my analysis stands: the possible relations between x and z are N, S, and B.

Let me check one more time, but from a slightly different angle. Let's explicitly draw the possible configurations based on the original constraints.

From x N y, we have:
```
+--x--+
|      |
+------+
+--y--+
|      |
+------+
```

From y S z, we have:
```
+--z--+
|      |
+------+
+--y--+
|      |
+------+
```

Combining them:
```
???????
+--x--+     or     +--z--+     or     +--z--+
|      |           |      |           |      |
+------+           +------+           | +--x--+
+--y--+            +--x--+           | |      |
|      |           |      |           | +------+
+------+           +------+           +------+
                  +--y--+            +--y--+
                  |      |           |      |
                  +------+           +------+
```

As we can see, the possible relations between x and z are:
1. x N z (x is above z)
2. x S z (x is below z but above y)
3. x B z (x is contained within z's bounding box)

These align with what we derived in the analysis.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are N, S, and B.

Wait, I reconsider again. I've been a bit imprecise in my visual representations. Let's actually apply the constraints more directly.

From the original constraints:
- From x N y: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- From y S z: supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y), and supx(y) <= supx(z)

Now, let's visualize the configuration more precisely:
```
      +--x--+
      |      |
      +------+
+--y--+
|      |
+------+
```

Here, the width of the x is for visualization; the actual constraints only tell us that the left boundary of x is to the right of or at the left boundary of y, and the right boundary of x is to the left of or at the right boundary of y.

Similarly for y S z:
```
+--z--+
|      |
+------+
    +--y--+
    |      |
    +------+
```

Combining both:
```
    +--z--+
    |      |
    +------+
        +--x--+
        |      |
        +------+
    +--y--+
    |      |
    +------+
```

Again, the relative positions and sizes are for visualization. The constraints only tell us that:
- y is below both x and z
- The x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of z (derived from the constraints)

Given these constraints, here are the possible relations between x and z:

1. x N z: x is completely above z. This is possible if x is positioned high enough.
2. x S z: x is completely below z. This is possible if z is positioned high enough and x is just above y.
3. x B z: x is inside the bounding box of z. This is possible if x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection.
4. x NE z: x is to the northeast of z. This would require supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the derived constraint supx(x) <= supx(z).
5. x NW z: x is to the northwest of z. This would require supx(x) <= infx(z), which contradicts the derived constraint infx(z) <= infx(x).
6. x SE z: x is to the southeast of z. Same contradiction as x NE z.
7. x SW z: x is to the southwest of z. Same contradiction as x NW z.
8. x E z: x is to the east of z. Same contradiction as x NE z.
9. x W z: x is to the west of z. Same contradiction as x NW z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are N, S, and B.

Actually, I think I've been making a mistake. Let me establish more precisely the constraints we have on the relative positions.

From the original constraints:
- From x N y: y is below x (supy(y) <= infy(x))
  In the x-direction, for N, we have infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y), which means x's x-projection is within y's x-projection.
- From y S z: y is below z (supy(y) <= infy(z))
  In the x-direction, for S, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z), which means y's x-projection is within z's x-projection.

Combining these, we can derive:
- y is below both x and z.
- x's x-projection is within y's x-projection, and y's x-projection is within z's x-projection. So, x's x-projection is within z's x-projection (more formally: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)).

But we can't deduce anything directly about the y-relationship between x and z. x could be above, at the same level, or below z, as long as it's above y.

If x is above z, then we have x N z. If x is below z, then we have x S z. And if x overlaps with z in the y-coordinate, we need to check the x-boundaries. Since x's x-projection is within z's x-projection, if x overlaps with z in the y-coordinate, then parts of x are inside z's bounding box, so we have the relation x B z.

Actually, the relation "x B z" means that region x is entirely inside the bounding box of region z. For this to be true, we need to satisfy all of these conditions: infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).

From the derived constraints, we know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), which means x's x-projection is inside z's x-projection. But for x to be inside the bounding box of z, x's y-projection should also be inside z's y-projection. This means infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z).

This results in three distict possibilities: N, S, and B.

So, based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are N, S, and B.

Actually, let me try drawing a specific counterexample to check whether SW or other relations are possible. Let's see if I can craft a scenario where x SW z, given the constraints.

From x N y, y is below x, and x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection.
From y S z, y is below z, and y's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection.

For x to be southwest of z, x would need to be below z and to the left of z. Since x is above y and y is below z, it seems like x could be positioned such that it's at the same height or below z while still being above y. But for the horizontal component, x's x-projection is within y's x-projection, and y's x-projection is within z's x-projection. This means x's x-projection is within z's x-projection, which contradicts the requirement for a southwest relationship (where x is to the left of z).

So, x SW z is indeed not possible. Similar reasoning can be applied to discordant other relations like NW, NE, SE, E, and W.

Following this logic, I can continue to be certain that the possible relations between x and z are N, S, and B.

ANSWER:

The question asks for the possible relations between region x and region z, given that:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is S of region z

To solve this, I need to analyze what these constraints tell us about the relative positioning.

From x N y:
- x is above y
- x's horizontal extent is contained within y's horizontal extent

From y S z:
- y is below z
- y's horizontal extent is contained within z's horizontal extent

Combining these constraints:
- y is below both x and z
- x's horizontal extent is contained within z's horizontal extent (since x's extent is within y's, which is within z's)

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

1. N (North): x could be completely above z
2. S (South): x could be below z (but still above y)
3. B (Bounding box): x could be inside z's bounding box

The other cardinal directions (NE, NW, E, W, SE, SW) are not possible because x's horizontal extent must be contained within z's horizontal extent, which contradicts these relations.
