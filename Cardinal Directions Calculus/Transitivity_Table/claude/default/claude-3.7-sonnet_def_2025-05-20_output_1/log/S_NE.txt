PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. We're told that region x is S of region y
   - This means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

2. We're also told that region y is NE of region z
   - This means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now we want to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Let me analyze what we can derive from these constraints:

From (1), we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
From (2), we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

So we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But this doesn't tell us directly the relation between supy(x) and supy(z). They could be in any order.

From (1), we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
From (2), we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)

So we know that supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the east of z (either E, NE, or SE).

But we don't have a direct constraint between the y-coordinates of x and z, so x could be north, south, or at the same latitude as z.

Given that:
- x is definitely to the east of z (because supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- x could be north, south, or at the same latitude as z

The possible relations between x and z are:
- E (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- NE (if x is to the north of z)
- SE (if x is to the south of z)

Let me double-check this by considering specific cases:

Case 1: If supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
Then x would be to the south or at the same latitude as z, and given that x is to the east of z, the relation would be either E or SE.

Case 2: If supy(z) < supy(x)
We need to compare infy(x) and supy(z):
- If infy(x) > supy(z), then x would be to the north of z, and given that x is to the east of z, the relation would be NE.
- If infy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x would overlap with z in terms of latitude, and given that x is to the east of z, the relation would be E.

But wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me be more precise with the definitions:

For x to be S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For y to be NE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

I want to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let's analyze systematically:

1. Comparing x-coordinates:
   - From "x is S of y", we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - From "y is NE of z", we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   - Combining these, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - This means x is to the east of z (in the E, NE, or SE direction)

2. Comparing y-coordinates:
   - From "x is S of y", we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - From "y is NE of z", we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - Combining these, we get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supy(x) and supy(z) or infy(x) and infy(z)

Let's consider all possible cases based on y-coordinates:

Case 1: If supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
Then x is to the south of z. Given that x is also to the east of z, the relation would be SE.

Case 2: If infy(z) < supy(x) and infy(x) ≤ supy(z)
Then x and z overlap in terms of latitude. Given that x is to the east of z, the relation would be E.

Case 3: If supy(z) < infy(x)
Then x is to the north of z. Given that x is also to the east of z, the relation would be NE.

Actually, wait. I just realized there's a constraint I'm not considering fully. Let me re-examine the problem.

For y to be NE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

These constraints place y entirely in the northeast quadrant relative to z.

For x to be S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

These constraints place x below y, but within the same x-range as y.

Given these constraints, can x be to the north of z? Let's see:

- We know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from "x is S of y")
- We know supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from "y is NE of z")

From these two constraints, we can't directly determine whether supy(x) is greater than, less than, or equal to supy(z). Therefore, x could be to the north, south, or at the same latitude as z.

Now, can x be to the east of z? Let's see:

- We know infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from "x is S of y")
- We know supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from "y is NE of z")

Combining these, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This means x is definitely to the east of z.

So, x is definitely to the east of z, and could be north, south, or at the same latitude as z.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
- E (if x is at the same latitude as z)
- NE (if x is to the north of z)
- SE (if x is to the south of z)

Actually, I realize I may have been over-complicating things. Let me approach this more systematically.

Given that:
- x is S of y
- y is NE of z

Let's place z at the origin, so the bounding box of z is centered at (0,0). Then, since y is NE of z, the bounding box of y is entirely in the upper-right quadrant relative to z. Let's say the bounding box of y is at position (a,b) with width w_y and height h_y, where a > 0 and b > 0 (because y is NE of z).

Now, since x is S of y, the bounding box of x is below y but within the same x-range as y. Let's say the bounding box of x is at position (c, d) with width w_x and height h_x, where infx(y) ≤ c ≤ c + w_x ≤ supx(y) and d + h_x ≤ infy(y).

Given that y is at position (a,b) and y is NE of z, we know that a > supx(z) and b > supy(z).

Now, since x is S of y, and y is within the x-range of x, we know that c ≥ a and c + w_x ≤ a + w_y.

Wait, I think I've been misunderstanding the definition. Let me re-check the definition of "x is S of y":
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

This means x is to the south of y and within the x-projection of y.

Sorry for the confusion. Let me approach this correctly now.

Given that:
- x is S of y
- y is NE of z

Let's place z at the origin, so the bounding box of z is centered at (0,0). Then, since y is NE of z, the bounding box of y is entirely in the upper-right quadrant relative to z. Let's say the bounding box of y has bounds:
- infx(y) > supx(z)
- infy(y) > supy(z)

Now, since x is S of y, the bounding box of x has bounds:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

Ah, I see. The definition says "x is S of y" means x is to the south of y and within the x-range of y. But "within the x-range" means the x-projection of x is contained within the x-projection of y, which is different from what I was thinking.

Ok, so given that:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from "x is S of y")
- infy(y) > supy(z) (from "y is NE of z")

We get supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) > supy(z). But this doesn't give us a direct comparison between supy(x) and supy(z). They could be in any order.

Hmm, I actually did the right analysis earlier. Let me redo this to double check.

Given:
- x is S of y, which means:
  - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
  - infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
  - supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

- y is NE of z, which means:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

For the x-coordinate, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from "x is S of y")
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from "y is NE of z")

Combining these, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x). This indicates that x is to the east of z.

For the y-coordinate, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from "x is S of y")
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from "y is NE of z")

These constraints don't provide a direct comparison between the y-coordinates of x and z. So, x could be to the north, south, or at the same latitude as z.

Given that x is definitely to the east of z and could be north, south, or at the same latitude as z, the possible relations between x and z are:
- E (if x and z have overlapping y-projections)
- NE (if x is to the north of z)
- SE (if x is to the south of z)

Let's ensure I'm right. The definition of cardinal direction relations:

- E: supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b)
- NE: supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a)
- SE: supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b)

Now, given that:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (from our analysis)

For E to be a possible relation, we'd need:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Are these conditions always satisfied based on the given constraints? Not necessarily. So, E is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For NE to be a possible relation, we'd need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

Is this condition always satisfied based on the given constraints? Not necessarily. So, NE is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

For SE to be a possible relation, we'd need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Is this condition always satisfied based on the given constraints? Not necessarily. So, SE is a possible relation, but not guaranteed.

Given the constraints, all three relations (E, NE, and SE) are possible, but none is guaranteed.

Actually, I realize I can approach this problem with a concrete example to verify my reasoning.

Let's say:
- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), which is NE of z
- x has bounds (2.5,0.5) to (3.5,2.5), which is S of y

Now, let's check the relation between x and z:
- supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2.5, so x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) = 2.5 > infy(z) = 0, and infy(x) = 0.5 < supy(z) = 1, so x and z have overlapping y-projections.

Given these, the relation between x and z is E.

But this is just one example. Let's modify it:

- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), which is NE of z
- x has bounds (2.5,1.5) to (3.5,2.5), which is S of y

In this case:
- supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2.5, so x is to the east of z.
- infy(x) = 1.5 > supy(z) = 1, so x is to the north of z.

Given these, the relation between x and z is NE.

Let's do one more:

- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), which is NE of z
- x has bounds (2.5,-1) to (3.5,0.5), which is S of y

In this case:
- supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2.5, so x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) = 0.5 < infy(z) = 0, so x is to the south of z.

But wait, that doesn't make sense. If z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1), then infy(z) is 0, not supy(z). 

Let me redo this:

- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), which is NE of z
- x has bounds (2.5,-1) to (3.5,0.5), which is S of y

In this case:
- supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2.5, so x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) = 0.5 < infy(z) = 0, so x cannot be to the south of z.

Actually, this is a mistake. If z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1), then infy(z) is 0, not -1. 

Let me redo this:

- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), which is NE of z
- x has bounds (2.5,-1) to (3.5,0.5), which is S of y

In this case:
- supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2.5, so x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) = 0.5 > infy(z) = 0, and infy(x) = -1 < supy(z) = 1, so x and z have overlapping y-projections.

Given these, the relation between x and z is E.

Let me try once more, being very careful:

- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), which is NE of z
- x has bounds (2.5,-1) to (3.5,-0.2), which is S of y

In this case:
- supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2.5, so x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) = -0.2 < infy(z) = 0, so x is to the south of z.

Given these, the relation between x and z is SE.

Actually, I need to double-check the definition for region A being south of region B again:

"a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)"

This means a is below b, and the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b.

OK, let me correctly redefine:

- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), which is NE of z (since supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(z) = 1 < infy(y) = 3)
- x has bounds (2.5,-1) to (3.5,-0.2), which is S of y (since supy(x) = -0.2 < infy(y) = 3, infx(y) = 2 < infx(x) = 2.5, and supx(x) = 3.5 < supx(y) = 4)

In this case:
- supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2.5, so x is to the east of z.
- supy(x) = -0.2 < infy(z) = 0, so x is to the south of z.

Given these, the relation between x and z is SE.

Let me try one more example to ensure NE is a possibility:

- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), which is NE of z (since supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2 and supy(z) = 1 < infy(y) = 3)
- x has bounds (2.5,2) to (3.5,2.9), which is S of y (since supy(x) = 2.9 < infy(y) = 3, infx(y) = 2 < infx(x) = 2.5, and supx(x) = 3.5 < supx(y) = 4)

In this case:
- supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 2.5, so x is to the east of z.
- infy(x) = 2 > supy(z) = 1, so x is to the north of z.

Given these, the relation between x and z is NE.

So, based on our analysis and examples, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

OK, so through examples I've managed to show that E, NE, and SE are all possible relations between x and z. Is there a simpler way to see this?

We know that:
- x is S of y
- y is NE of z

From "y is NE of z", we know that y is entirely in the upper-right quadrant relative to z.

From "x is S of y", we know that x is below y and within the x-range of y. This placement allows for x to be in different positions relative to z. Specifically, since y is to the right of z (from it being NE of z), and x is within the x-range of y, we know x is to the right of z. This restricts x to be in the E, NE, or SE direction from z.

Let's confirm this using the cardinal direction definitions:

1. E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)
2. NE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(z) <= infy(x)
3. SE: supx(z) <= infx(x), supy(x) <= infy(z)

Let's check if each of these can be true given the constraints:

For E:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This is true from "y is NE of z" and "x is S of y" (as shown in our analysis).
- infy(z) <= infy(x): This is not guaranteed by the constraints.
- supy(x) <= supy(z): This is not guaranteed by the constraints.
But by choosing specific values for the regions, we can make these true. So, E is a possible relation.

For NE:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This is true from "y is NE of z" and "x is S of y" (as shown in our analysis).
- supy(z) <= infy(x): This is not guaranteed by the constraints, but by choosing specific values for the regions, we can make it true. So, NE is a possible relation.

For SE:
- supx(z) <= infx(x): This is true from "y is NE of z" and "x is S of y" (as shown in our analysis).
- supy(x) <= infy(z): This is not guaranteed by the constraints, but by choosing specific values for the regions, we can make it true. So, SE is a possible relation.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

OK, to summarize:

We know that "x is S of y", which means x is below y and within the x-range of y. We also know that "y is NE of z", which means y is to the northeast of z. Given these constraints, we've determined that the possible relations between x and z are:

- E (if x and z have overlapping y-projections)
- NE (if x is to the north of z)
- SE (if x is to the south of z)

We've verified this through both abstract reasoning and concrete examples. The key insight is that because y is NE of z, it's in the upper-right quadrant relative to z. And because x is S of y, it's below y but within the x-range of y. This allows for x to be in different positions relative to z, but always to the east.

Therefore, the answer is: the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Actually, I realized that so far I've been using examples, and I want to be more rigorous. Let me carefully apply the definitions step by step.

Given:
- x is S of y
- y is NE of z

Let me confirm what these statements tell us:

For "x is S of y":
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For "y is NE of z":
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, I want to determine the possible relations between x and z. Let me analyze all constraints we can derive from the given information:

From "x is S of y" and "y is NE of z", we can deduce:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
- We also have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't give us a direct comparison between the y-coordinates of x and z.

So, the only definitive constraint is supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the east of z. This allows for x to be in the E, NE, or SE direction from z, depending on how the y-coordinates compare.

Let's check each possible relation:

For E:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the y-coordinate ranges for x and z overlap)

Is this possible? Yes, by placing x in such a way that its y-range overlaps with z's y-range.

For NE:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely above z)

Is this possible? Yes, by placing x high enough that it's entirely above z.

For SE:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (which we've established)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is entirely below z)

Is this possible? Yes, by placing x low enough that it's entirely below z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Actually, I realize we can't fully determine the relationship without some additional constraints or information. Let me double-check if there's anything I'm missing…

Actually, I think this is right. The constraints only tell us that x is to the east of z, but the relative positioning in the y-direction is not fixed. By choosing different positions for the regions (within the constraints), we can have x be in the E, NE, or SE direction from z.

So, the answer is: the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Ok, I want to make one more convincing argument. I'll show that, given the constraints, I can construct specific regions x, y, and z such that x has relation E with z, or NE with z, or SE with z. If I can do this for all three relations, then those are the only possible relations.

Scenario 1: x has relation E with z
- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), so y is NE of z
- x has bounds (2.5,0.5) to (3.5,0.9), so x is S of y
- Checking the relation between x and z, we have: infx(x) = 2.5 > supx(z) = 1 (x is to the east of z), infy(x) = 0.5 > infy(z) = 0 (x is above z's bottom), supy(x) = 0.9 < supy(z) = 1 (x is below z's top). So, the relation is E.

Scenario 2: x has relation NE with z
- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), so y is NE of z
- x has bounds (2.5,2) to (3.5,2.9), so x is S of y
- Checking the relation between x and z, we have: infx(x) = 2.5 > supx(z) = 1 (x is to the east of z), infy(x) = 2 > supy(z) = 1 (x is entirely above z). So, the relation is NE.

Scenario 3: x has relation SE with z
- z has bounds (0,0) to (1,1)
- y has bounds (2,3) to (4,5), so y is NE of z
- x has bounds (2.5,-1) to (3.5,-0.1), so x is S of y
- Checking the relation between x and z, we have: infx(x) = 2.5 > supx(z) = 1 (x is to the east of z), supy(x) = -0.1 < infy(z) = 0 (x is entirely below z). So, the relation is SE.

Given that all three relations (E, NE, and SE) can be realized while satisfying the constraints, and given that the only definitive constraint is that x is to the east of z, these are the only possible relations.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

So the final answer is: the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Hm, let me check once more if S or B are possible.

For S:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our analysis, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the third condition for S. So, S is not a possible relation.

For B:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Again, from our analysis, we know supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the second condition for B. So, B is not a possible relation.

For the other directions, I can go through each of them similarly, but the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x) means x is to the east of z, which restricts the possible relations to E, NE, and SE.

Oops, I think I need to consider the full set: {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Let me go through each: 

For B:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraint, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the requirement for B (because supx(x) cannot be ≤ supx(z) if infx(x) > supx(z)). So, B is not possible.

For S:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Again, from our constraint, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the requirement for S (for the same reason as B). So, S is not possible.

For SW:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This doesn't match our constraint (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), so SW is not possible.

For W:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

This doesn't match our constraint (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), so W is not possible.

For NW:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

This doesn't match our constraint (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), so NW is not possible.

For N:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our constraint, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is in line with the requirement for N. But the constraint also says that supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which contradicts our finding. So, N is not possible.

For NE:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

This matches our constraint, so NE is a possibility.

For E:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

This matches our constraint, so E is a possibility.

For SE:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This matches our constraint, so SE is a possibility.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are NE, E, and SE. All of these involve x being to the east of z, which aligns with our constraint (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).

So the final answer is: the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Oh, I got confused with the condition for N.

Let's explicitlty check the definition for N again:

"a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)"

So for x to be N of z, we'd need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x starts to the right of the left edge of z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x ends to the left of the right edge of z)

That's not quite what I said above. It's not that "supx(x) ≤ supx(z) contradicts our finding" — more specifically, from our constraint, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), so x starts to the right of z's right edge. This means supx(x) > infx(x) > supx(z), which contradicts the condition for N. So, N is still not a possibility.

And I should do a similar check for the other directions to be sure.

Actually, I'll be very precise and just carefully consider every candidate relation.

For B (bounding box):
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

From our constraint, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies infx(x) > supx(z). This contradicts the requirement for B, which is supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The contradiction comes from the fact that if x starts to the right of where z ends, then x can't end to the left of where z ends. So, B is not possible.

For S (South):
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Again, from our constraint, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts the requirement for S, which is supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The contradiction comes from the same reasoning as for B. So, S is not possible.

For SW (Southwest):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

From our constraint, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which implies infx(x) > supx(z). This contradicts the requirement for SW, which is supx(x) ≤ infx(z). The contradiction comes from the fact that if x starts to the right of where z ends, then x can't end to the left of where z starts. So, SW is not possible.

For W (West):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

For the same reason as SW, this contradicts our constraint. So, W is not possible.

For NW (Northwest):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

For the same reason as SW, this contradicts our constraint. So, NW is not possible.

For N (North):
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For the same reason as S, this contradicts our constraint. So, N is not possible.

For NE (Northeast):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

This matches our constraint, so NE is a possibility.

For E (East):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

This matches our constraint, so E is a possibility.

For SE (Southeast):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

This matches our constraint, so SE is a possibility.

In summary, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are NE, E, and SE. All of these involve x being to the east of z, which aligns with our derived constraint (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)).

So the final answer is: the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Actually, I realize I should check if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is even possible, given the constraints.

We're given:
- "x is S of y", which means supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- "y is NE of z", which means supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

From these, we can't directly determine the relation between supy(x) and infy(z). They could be in any order. This means that x could be above z, below z, or overlap with z in the y-dimension.

So, all three cardinal direction relations—NE, E, and SE—are indeed possible.

Therefore, the final answer is: the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- E
- NE
- SE

Here's why:

From "x is S of y", we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From "y is NE of z", we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)

This means x must be to the east of z (since supx(z) ≤ infx(x)), which limits us to E, NE, or SE relations.

For the y-coordinates, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But this doesn't establish a definitive relationship between the y-coordinates of x and z. Therefore, x could be:
- Above z (giving NE relation)
- At the same latitude as z (giving E relation)
- Below z (giving SE relation)
