PROMPT: If region x is W of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z given that:
1. Region x is W of region y
2. Region y is NE of region z

Let's analyze what these given relations mean first:

x W y means:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is entirely to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-projection is contained within y's y-projection)

y NE z means:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is entirely to the north of z)

Now, I need to determine what these conditions tell us about the relationship between x and z.

From x W y, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
From y NE z, we know that supx(z) ≤ infx(y).

However, this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between supx(x) and supx(z), or between infx(x) and infx(z). We need to consider all possible arrangements.

Also, from x W y, we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y).
From y NE z, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Combining these, we get supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

This implies that x is either to the north of z or has no vertical overlap with z. But we still need to determine the horizontal relationship.

Let's work through the possible relationships:

1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Combined with supy(z) ≤ infy(x), this gives x NW z.

2. If infx(z) ≤ supx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x partially overlaps with z horizontally. Combined with supy(z) ≤ infy(x), this gives x N z.

3. If supx(z) ≤ supx(x), then x is to the east of z or overlaps with z's eastern part. But we know from x W y and y NE z that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), so supx(x) and supx(z) are both less than or equal to infx(y). This means we could have either supx(x) ≤ supx(z) or supx(z) ≤ supx(x).

Actually, let me be more systematic. Given the constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y NE z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from y NE z and x W y)

We can say:
- x is to the west of y
- z is to the west of y
- z is to the south of y, which is to the south of x (so z is to the south of x)

Now, the relative positioning of x and z horizontally can vary:

1. x could be to the west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Combined with z being to the south of x, this gives x NW z.

2. x could overlap with z horizontally. There are a few cases:
   a. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x): x overlaps with the eastern part of z. Combined with z being to the south of x, this gives a relation that's not a single-tile relation. It's a combination of N and NE.
   b. infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z): x overlaps with the western part of z. Combined with z being to the south of x, this gives a relation that's not a single-tile relation. It's a combination of NW and N.
   c. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z): z contains x horizontally. Combined with z being to the south of x, this gives x N z.
   d. infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x): x contains z horizontally. Combined with z being to the south of x, this gives a relation that's not a single-tile relation. It's a combination of NW, N, and NE.

3. x could be to the east of z: infx(x) ≥ supx(z). Combined with z being to the south of x, this gives x NE z.

Actually, wait. I need to be more careful here. Using the above constraints, let me reconsider.

Based on x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Based on y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can infer:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), so both x and z are to the west of y, but we can't directly infer the relationship between x and z horizontally.
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so z is to the south of x.

Let's enumerate the possible directional relations:

1. x NW z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is to the south of x).

2. x N z: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (z contains x horizontally) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is to the south of x).

3. x NE z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is to the south of x).

4. x W z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection). But wait, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so this case is not possible.

5. x E z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection). But again, we know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), so this case is not possible.

6. x SW z: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the west of z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z). But we know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is to the south of x, which contradicts x being to the south of z. So, this case is not possible.

7. x S z: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (z contains x horizontally) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z). Again, this contradicts our knowledge that z is to the south of x, so this case is not possible.

8. x SE z: If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z). This contradicts z being to the south of x, so it's not possible.

9. x B z: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (z contains x horizontally) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (z contains x vertically). But we know supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts x being contained within z vertically, so this case is not possible.

Based on the constraints, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

But wait, I just realized I may have misunderstood something. I need to think again.

Given:
- x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the west of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom is below or at x's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is below or at y's top)

From the last three conditions, we can infer supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which confirms that z is to the south of x.

Now, for the horizontal positioning, we know both x and z are to the west of y, but we don't know the exact relationship between x and z horizontally.

Hmm, actually let me be even more methodical. Let me consider all the cases carefully.

Let's take the possible positions of x with respect to z. I'll use a coordinate system where the positive y-axis is north and the positive x-axis is east.

First, we know that z is to the south of x, which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

For the horizontal relationship, there are several cases:

1. x is to the west of z: supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
2. z is to the west of x: supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
3. x and z overlap horizontally:
   a. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   b. infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x)
   c. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x)
   d. infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Combined with the fact that z is to the south of x, we have:

1. If x is to the west of z and z is to the south of x, then x is NW of z.
2. If z is to the west of x and z is to the south of x, then x is NE of z.
3. For the overlapping cases, always z is to the south of x:
   a. If z contains x horizontally, then x is N of z.
   b. If x contains z horizontally, then x is N:NW:NE of z (a combination).
   c,d. For partial overlaps, we get combinations (N:NE or NW:N).

But let me go back to the constraints from the given relations. We know that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y NE z)

This means both x and z are to the west of y. But we still don't have a direct relationship between x and z horizontally.

However, we have the constraint that y is NE of z, which means y is to the east and north of z. And x is W of y, which means x is to the west of y. Given these constraints, x can be in various positions relative to z horizontally: to the west of z, overlapping with z horizontally, or to the east of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z, considering that z is to the south of x, are:
- NW (if x is to the west of z)
- N (if x overlaps with z horizontally, specifically if z contains x horizontally)
- NE (if x is to the east of z)

But there are also cases where x and z have a more complex relation, like N:NW:NE, N:NE, or NW:N. But since the problem asks for pure single-tile direction relations, I'll go with NW, N, and NE.

Actually, let me reconsider the constraints more carefully: 

Given:
- x W y:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-projection is contained within y's y-projection)
- y NE z:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

I've established that z is to the south of x because supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x).

For the horizontal relationship, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), which means both x and z are to the west of y. But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between x and z horizontally.

Let's try a different approach. From the constraints, we have:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x W y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y NE z)

This means both supx(x) and supx(z) are ≤ infx(y). But we don't know the relation between supx(x) and supx(z).

If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Combined with z being to the south of x, this gives x NW z.

If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then z is to the west of x. Combined with z being to the south of x, this gives x NE z.

If infx(z) ≤ supx(x) and infx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x and z overlap horizontally. Combined with z being to the south of x, this gives a relation that's not a pure single-tile relation. But if the overlap is such that one contains the other horizontally (e.g., infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z)), then it can be a pure single-tile relation (in this case, x N z).

Actually, I think I've overcomplicated this. Let me just list out the possible configurations.

Given that z is to the south of x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), the possible configurations are:

1. x is to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)) => x NW z

2. x and z overlap horizontally in one of the ways:
   a. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) => z contains x horizontally => x N z
   b. infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x) => x contains z horizontally => x is (NW:N:NE) of z, which is not a pure relation
   c. infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(z) ≤ supx(x) => partial overlap => x is (N:NE) of z, not a pure relation
   d. infx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z) => partial overlap => x is (NW:N) of z, not a pure relation

3. x is to the east of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) => x NE z

So, the possible single-tile cardinal directions between x and z are NW, N, and NE.

But, let me take a step back and consider again. I may have been hasty in concluding that z is to the south of x.

We have supy(z) ≤ infy(y) from y NE z, and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) from x W y, so supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Additionally, from y NE z, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
And from x W y, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y).

So both x and z are to the west of y. But we don't have enough information to say if x is to the west, east, or overlapping with z horizontally.

Given that z is to the south of x, and the horizontal relationship is undetermined, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:

NW (if x is to the west of z)
N (if x is directly north of z, which happens when x is contained within z horizontally)
NE (if x is to the east of z)

But if we consider multi-tile relations, there are additional possibilities like (NW:N) or (N:NE) or (NW:N:NE).

Actually, let's consider another constraint. We know that y is to the east of z, and x is to the west of y. This doesn't help us determine the horizontal relationship between x and z.

Actually, let me also check if there's a possibility for x to have a relation like W, SW, S, SE, E, or B with z.

W: x is to the west of z and x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection. But we know z is to the south of x, so this is not possible.

SW: x is to the west and south of z. But we know z is to the south of x, so this is not possible.

S: x is to the south of z and x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection. But we know z is to the south of x, so this is not possible.

SE: x is to the east and south of z. But we know z is to the south of x, so this is not possible.

E: x is to the east of z and x's y-projection is contained within z's y-projection. But we know z is to the south of x, so this is not possible.

B: x is contained within z both horizontally and vertically. But we know z is to the south of x, so this is not possible.

So, the only possible relations are NW, N, and NE.

Let me carefully verify the possible relationships one more time. I'm going to avoid using containment and overlap terminology and directly refer to the single-tile cardinal direction relations as defined.

Given:
- x W y:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y NE z:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Let's check each of the possible relations between x and z:

1. x B z:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   But we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) for B. So, x B z is not possible.

2. x S z:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   But we have supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is to the south of x, not the other way around. So, x S z is not possible.

3. x SW z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   Again, we have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

4. x W z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   Given supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we can't have both infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   There's no contradiction with our constraints. So, x NW z is possible.

6. x N z:
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   There's no contradiction with our constraints. So, x N z is possible.

7. x NE z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   There's no contradiction with our constraints. So, x NE z is possible.

8. x E z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   Given supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we can't have both infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z:
   - supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   Again, we have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, x SE z is not possible.

In summary, the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z are NW, N, and NE.

Actually, wait, I should also check for multi-tile relations as defined in the problem.

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1:...:Rk where:
i) 1 ≤ k ≤ 9,
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE},
iii) Ri ≠ Rj for every i, j such that 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k and i ≠ j,
iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

However, it seems the problem is asking me about the single-tile cardinal direction relation between x and z, so I'll stick with the possibilities NW, N, and NE.

Ok, let's reason from the beginning again, just to double-check.

Given:
- x W y:
  - supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
  - infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y NE z:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
  - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can deduce:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is to the west of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (z is to the south of x)

For x NW z to be true, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We already have supy(z) ≤ infy(x). For the horizontal constraint, since supx(x) can be anywhere up to infx(y) and supx(z) can also be anywhere up to infx(y), it's possible for supx(x) ≤ infx(z) to be true. So, x NW z is a possible relation.

For x N z to be true, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). We already have supy(z) ≤ infy(x). For the horizontal constraints, since infx(z), infx(x), supx(x), and supx(z) can vary and we only have the upper bounds of supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(z) ≤ infx(y), it's possible for both infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) to be true. So, x N z is a possible relation.

For x NE z to be true, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). We already have supy(z) ≤ infy(x). For the horizontal constraint, since supx(z) can be anywhere up to infx(y) and infx(x) can be anywhere, it's possible for supx(z) ≤ infx(x) to be true. So, x NE z is a possible relation.

Let me verify the remaining relations to confirm they are not possible:

For x W z to be true, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). We have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means z is entirely below x, so we can't have both infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So, x W z is not a possible relation.

I can similarly check for all the other relations.

Let's consider x S z. For this to be true, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). But we have supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x). This contradicts the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) for x S z. So, x S z is not a possible relation.

All right. I went through all the relations, and confirmed that only relations NW, N, and NE are possible for x and z.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x W y: This means x is west of y
- y NE z: This means y is northeast of z

From these relations, I can deduce:
- Since x is west of y, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- Since y is northeast of z, we know that supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- From x W y, we also know that infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Combining these constraints, I can determine that supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means z is south of x.

For the horizontal relationship, both x and z are west of y, but their relative horizontal positioning could vary.

The possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
NW, N, NE
