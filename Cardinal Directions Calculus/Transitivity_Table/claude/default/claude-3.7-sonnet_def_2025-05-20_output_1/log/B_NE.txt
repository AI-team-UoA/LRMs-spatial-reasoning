PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this problem step-by-step.

We have:
1. Region x is B of region y
2. Region y is NE of region z

We need to find possible relations between region x and region z.

First, let me recall what each relation means:

x B y means that x is inside the minimum bounding box of y, i.e.:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

y NE z means that y is in the northeast of z, i.e.:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, let's derive what we know about x and z based on these conditions:

For x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now, let's combine these to find constraints between x and z:

From x B y and y NE z, we can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This means that:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which is a condition for x being in E, NE, or SE of z
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which is a condition for x being in N, NE, or NW of z

Given both constraints, x must be in the NE of z, because it satisfies both conditions for being in the northeast.

However, let's verify this more carefully by considering all possible positions of x relative to z:

For x to be in N of z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✗ (we can't guarantee this)

For x to be in NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓ (from our derivation)

For x to be in E of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ✗ (we can't guarantee this)

For x to be in SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✗ (we can't guarantee this)

For x to be in S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✗ (we can't guarantee this)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✗ (we can't guarantee this)

For x to be in SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✗ (we can't guarantee this)

For x to be in W of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ✗ (we can't guarantee this)

For x to be in NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓ (from our derivation)

For x to be in B of z, we need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✗ (we can't guarantee this)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓ (from supy(z) ≤ infy(x), as infy(z) < supy(z))
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ✗ (we can't guarantee this)

Wait, let me double-check my logic. The conditions for x to be in different directions relative to z:

For x to be in N of z, we need:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ❓ (uncertain)

Actually, I need to be more careful with my reasoning. Let's start again more systematically.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Let's visualize this. The minimum bounding box of z is below and to the left of y. And x is contained within the minimum bounding box of y.

So what are the possible positions of x relative to z?

From supx(z) ≤ infx(x), we know that x is entirely to the right of z's bounding box. And from supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we know that x is entirely above z's bounding box.

This means x must be in the NE direction from z.

Actually, hold on. Let me think more carefully about this. Just because x is B of y doesn't mean x is entirely contained within y. It means x is contained within the minimum bounding box of y.

Actually, I think I was correct before. From the conditions:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x): x is entirely to the right of z's bounding box.
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x): x is entirely above z's bounding box.

These two conditions together mean that x is in the NE direction from z.

Wait, let me be very careful with this. My two conditions are:
1. x B y: x is inside the bounding box of y
2. y NE z: y is northeast of z

Let's denote the bounding box of a region a as BB(a).

From x B y, x is inside BB(y). This means x could be anywhere inside the bounding box of y.

From y NE z, we know that BB(y) is entirely to the northeast of BB(z).

Now, if x is inside BB(y) and BB(y) is entirely to the northeast of BB(z), then x must also be entirely to the northeast of BB(z). Therefore, the relation between x and z must be NE.

But wait, I'm not being careful with the definition of "inside". If x is B of y, it means x is inside the bounding box of y, but it doesn't necessarily mean x is strictly inside y or that x is strictly smaller than y. It could be that x and y have the same bounding box, in which case x B y still holds.

Given that, let's reconsider the possibilities.

If x and y have the same bounding box, and y is NE of z, then x would also be NE of z.

If x is strictly inside the bounding box of y, then x would still be NE of z.

It seems like the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Let me verify this one more time to make sure I'm not missing any possibility.

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Ah, wait. Let me reconsider the problem and the definitions. 

We have regions, not points. So the relation "x is B of y" means x is inside the bounding box of y. And "y is NE of z" means y is in the northeast tile of z.

Let's use a concrete example. Suppose z is a region with bounding box [0,10] x [0,10]. If y is NE of z, then the bounding box of y might be something like [15, 20] x [15, 20]. And if x is B of y, then x's bounding box might be something like [16, 19] x [16, 19].

In this case, x would also be NE of z, because x is entirely to the northeast of z's bounding box.

But could there be other possibilities? Let's try to find a counterexample. Let me consider the same z and y as before, but let's change x.

If x's bounding box is [15, 20] x [15, 20], then x and y have the same bounding box, and x would be NE of z.
If x's bounding box is [16, 19] x [16, 19], then x is strictly inside y's bounding box, and x would be NE of z.

I can't see any way for x to not be NE of z, given the constraints. I think this is the only possible relation.

Actually, let me approach this from another angle. 

Given:
1. x B y
2. y NE z

Let's think about the 9-tile direction system. If we consider the extended bounding box of z, it divides the plane into 9 regions or "tiles": B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW. 

If y is NE of z, then y lies entirely in the NE tile of z.

Now, since x B y, x lies entirely within the bounding box of y. But since y lies entirely in the NE tile of z, the bounding box of y must also lie entirely in the NE tile of z. And since x lies entirely within the bounding box of y, x must also lie entirely in the NE tile of z. Thus, x is also NE of z.

Given these considerations, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Wait, I think I've been making a mistake in my reasoning. The definition of cardinal direction relations is more complex than I've been considering. Let me re-analyze based on the precise definition.

Given:
1. x B y
2. y NE z

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓ (from our derivation)

Both conditions are satisfied, so one possible relation between x and z is NE. But are there other possible relations?

Actually, I just realized there's another thing to consider: A cardinal direction relation can be a composite, e.g., "N:NE". This would mean that the region spans both the N and NE tiles of the reference region.

But in this case, since x is entirely in the NE tile of z, the only possible basic relation is NE. And since x doesn't span multiple tiles of z, the only possible cardinal direction relation is just NE.

Actually, wait. One more thing to consider: The fact that x B y means x is inside the bounding box of y. It doesn't necessarily mean that x is inside y. So it's possible for x to extend beyond the boundaries of y, as long as it stays within the bounding box of y.

But even considering this, it doesn't change the fact that x is entirely in the NE tile of z, because the bounding box of y is entirely in the NE tile of z. So, again, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Actually, now I realize there's a significant fact I need to take into account. If x is B of y, it means x is inside the minimum bounding box of y, not necessarily inside y. Given the definition of the cardinal direction relation, this means that x could be anywhere inside the bounding box, including touching the boundary. It doesn't have to be strictly inside.

Given this, let's reconsider the possibilities. From y NE z, the bounding box of y is entirely in the NE direction from z. Since x is B of y, x is inside the bounding box of y.

So, is it possible for x to be in a relation other than NE with z?

Let me try to construct a counterexample. Suppose z is a region with bounding box [0,10] x [0,10], y is a region with bounding box [15, 20] x [15, 20]. Now, let's consider different possibilities for x:

1. If x's bounding box is [15, 20] x [15, 20], then x would be NE of z.
2. If x's bounding box is [16, 19] x [16, 19], then x would still be NE of z.

I can't think of a case where x would have any relation other than NE with z, given the constraints. It seems like the only possible relation is NE.

Hmm, actually, let me just make sure I'm not missing anything with the definition of the bounding box relationship. Let me double check the definition:

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).

This means that the region a is completely inside the minimum bounding box of region b. It doesn't mean a is inside b, but rather a is inside the rectangular bounding box of b.

Given this, if x B y and y NE z, it's still the case that x must be NE of z. The bounding box of y is entirely to the northeast of z, and x is inside the bounding box of y, so x must also be entirely to the northeast of z.

I think the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Wait, let me think one more time explicitly about how regions and bounding boxes are related. The problem is in the 2D plane, and regions are homeomorphic to a closed unit disk, so they are connected and "nice". The bounding box of a region is the smallest rectangle aligned with the x and y axes that contains the region.

Given that, let's reconsider the problem.

We have:
1. x B y: Region x is inside the bounding box of region y.
2. y NE z: Region y is in the NE tile of region z.

We want to determine all possible relations between regions x and z.

From the second condition, we know that the bounding box of y is entirely to the northeast of the bounding box of z. This means:
- The leftmost point of y is to the right of the rightmost point of z.
- The bottommost point of y is above the topmost point of z.

Mathematically:
- supx(z) < infx(y)
- supy(z) < infy(y)

From the first condition, we know that x is inside the bounding box of y. This means:
- The leftmost point of x is to the right of, or at the same position as, the leftmost point of y's bounding box.
- The rightmost point of x is to the left of, or at the same position as, the rightmost point of y's bounding box.
- The bottommost point of x is above, or at the same position as, the bottommost point of y's bounding box.
- The topmost point of x is below, or at the same position as, the topmost point of y's bounding box.

Mathematically:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

Combining these conditions:
- supx(z) < infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) < infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means:
- The leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of z.
- The bottommost point of x is above the topmost point of z.

These are precisely the conditions for x to be in the NE tile of z. Thus, the relation between x and z is NE.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is that the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Hmm, wait a minute. Let me be more explicit here. I need to check if there's any other possible relation between x and z. Let's go through the 9 possible basic relations and see if any of them (besides NE) can hold:

1. x B z: For this to be true, we need:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   But we know supx(z) < infx(x), which contradicts the condition infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) required for x B z. So, x B z is not possible.

2. x N z: For this to be true, we need:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) < infx(x))
   
   So, x N z is not possible.

3. x NE z: For this to be true, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
   
   Both conditions are satisfied, so x NE z is possible.

4. x E z: For this to be true, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) < infy(x))
   
   So, x E z is not possible.

5. x SE z: For this to be true, we need:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) ✗ (contradicts infy(z) < supy(z) < infy(x) < supy(x))
   
   So, x SE z is not possible.

6. x S z: For this to be true, we need:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) ✗ (contradicts infy(z) < supy(z) < infy(x) < supy(x))
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) < infx(x))
   
   So, x S z is not possible.

7. x SW z: For this to be true, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) ✗ (contradicts infx(z) < supx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x))
   - supy(x) <= infy(z) ✗ (contradicts infy(z) < supy(z) < infy(x) < supy(x))
   
   So, x SW z is not possible.

8. x W z: For this to be true, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) ✗ (contradicts infx(z) < supx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x))
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) < infy(x))
   
   So, x W z is not possible.

9. x NW z: For this to be true, we need:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z) ✗ (contradicts infx(z) < supx(z) < infx(x) < supx(x))
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (from our derivation)
   
   So, x NW z is not possible.

After checking all 9 basic relations, it seems that the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Actually, there's another interesting point: our understanding of cardinal direction relations in the problem definition allows for composites, like "N:NE" or "NE:E:SE" (as I mentioned earlier). But since we've established that the only basic relation that can hold is NE, the only possible composite relation is just NE.

Actually, hang on. I think I got the logic confused a bit when I took the "less than or equal to" from the definition of cardinal directions as "less than" in my checks. Let me re-do this using the precise definitions.

The constraints from our given conditions are:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

For x B z to be true, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

The third condition is satisfied by our constraints, but the first and second conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously (because supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(x) > supx(z), contradicting the second condition). So, x B z is not possible.

For x N z to be true, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (from our constraints)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x))

So, x N z is not possible.

For x NE z to be true, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (from our constraints)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (from our constraints)

Both conditions are satisfied, so x NE z is possible.

For x E z to be true, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (from our constraints)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x), as it would imply supy(x) <= infy(x), which can't be true for a non-empty region)

So, x E z is not possible.

Using the same logic, we can verify that none of the other cardinal direction relations are possible, except for NE.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Actually, let's re-do this just to be sure. The constraints from our given conditions are:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

For x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (from our constraints)
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (from our constraints)

Both conditions are satisfied, so x NE z is possible.

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (from our constraints)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x))

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓ (from our constraints)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x))

So, x N z and x E z are not possible.

Using similar reasoning, we can check that x can't be B, S, SW, W, NW, or SE of z. The only possible relation is NE.

Wait, am I missing something? Let me double check the definitions again to make sure I understand everything correctly.

For two regions a and b, their relationship is determined by the relative positions of their bounding boxes. The bounding box of a region is the smallest rectangle aligned with the x and y axes that contains the region.

The cardinal direction relations are defined based on the relative positions of the projections of the regions on the x and y axes:

- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b).
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b).
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b).
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b).

Now, let's use these to determine the possible relations between x and z, given that x B y and y NE z.

Wait, I just noticed a discrepancy in the definitions I've been using. For a NE b, I've been using supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b), but the actual definition is supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a). This is basically the opposite direction. Let me re-check everything.

Wait, I realize what's going on. I inconsistently referred to directions in some places. The definition says:

a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

This means a is in the northeast of b, not b is in the northeast of a. So if y NE z, then y is in the northeast of z, not z is in the northeast of y. And thus:

- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Okay, so the constraints from our given conditions are:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

Now, for x to be NE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓

Both conditions are satisfied, so x can be NE of z.

Let's check if there's anything else...

For x to be N of z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x))

So x N z is not possible.

For x to be NW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x))
- supy(z) <= infy(x) ✓

So x NW z is not possible.

For x to be W of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x))
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x))

So x W z is not possible.

For x to be SW of z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x))
- supy(x) <= infy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x))

So x SW z is not possible.

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x))
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x))

So x S z is not possible.

For x to be SE of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
- supy(x) <= infy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x))

So x SE z is not possible.

For x to be E of z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) ✓
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x))

So x E z is not possible.

For x to be B of z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x))
- supx(x) <= supx(z) ✗ (contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x))
- infy(z) <= infy(x) ✓ (implied by supy(z) <= infy(x))
- supy(x) <= supy(z) ✗ (contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x))

So x B z is not possible.

After exhaustively checking all 9 basic cardinal direction relations, we find that the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is that the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

So the answer is:

If region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

Actually, wait, let me double-triple check this. For the NE relation, we have:

a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a).

From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

So, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

These are the exact conditions for x NE z. 

So, indeed, the only possible relation between x and z is NE. The answer is "NE".

Okay, but I just want to be really sure that I didn't miss anything. Let's double-check (one last time) that we didn't miss any other possibilities.

From our constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)

For x to be B of z, we would need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

Given our constraints, the first and second conditions can't both be true (because supx(z) <= infx(x) implies supx(z) < supx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z)). So, x B z is not possible.

For x to be in relation S to z, we would need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Given our constraints, supy(z) <= infy(x) implies infy(z) < supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x S z is not possible.

I think I don't need to repeat the checks for all other relations, as we've already done that. The key is that our constraints, supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x), are precisely the conditions for x NE z. Any other relation would include conditions that contradict these constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

Hmm, I just realized that I've been a little sloppy with my logic. Let me be very explicit. For a to be in the NE of b, we need:
- supx(b) <= infx(a)
- supy(b) <= infy(a)

For our problem:
From x B y, we have:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NE z, we have:
- supx(z) <= infx(y)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

These are precisely the conditions for x NE z. Thus, the only possible relation between x and z is NE.

So, the answer is "NE."

Actually, let me think about one more thing. I've been thinking about the "relation" as one of the 9 basic cardinal direction relations: B, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW. But, actually, the statement of the problem allows for composite relations (like "N:NE" or "NE:E:SE").

But here's the thing: When asking for the possible relations between x and z, we're looking for all possible relationships that could hold, not just a single one. And we've already determined that NE is the only basic relation that could potentially hold. So, even considering composites, the only possible relation is NE.

But wait, actually I think I'm overthinking this. The question specifically asks for "the possible relations," which can be interpreted as "the possible basic relations that could hold."

Let's think about this one more time. If x B y and y NE z, then we've established that x NE z. Could x have any other basic relation with z? We've checked, and the answer is no.

So the answer to the problem is: NE.

Actually, I would feel safer giving the answer the problem is asking for without adding any of my own constraints or interpretations: after analyzing all possible relations, the only one that could exist between region x and region z is NE.

ANSWER:

The problem asks for possible relations between region x and region z, given that region x is B of region y and region y is NE of region z.

Let me work through this step by step:

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these inequalities:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

These combined inequalities tell us that:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) 
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These are exactly the conditions for x NE z.

I've checked all other possible relations (N, NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, B), and none of them are possible because they would contradict our derived constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

NE
