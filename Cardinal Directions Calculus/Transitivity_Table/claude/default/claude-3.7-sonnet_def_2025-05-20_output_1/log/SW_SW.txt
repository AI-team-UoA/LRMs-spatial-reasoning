PROMPT: If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We know:
- x is SW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is SW of z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

Now, we need to figure out the possible relations between x and z.

First, let's consider the x-coordinates:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x SW y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (from y SW z)

Combining these, we get:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)

This simplifies to:
supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

Now, let's consider the y-coordinates:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x SW y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y SW z)

Combining these, we get:
supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

This simplifies to:
supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Based on these inequalities, we can say:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This means x is to the left of z.
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This means x is below z.

Now, let's check which cardinal relations satisfy these conditions:

1. SW (South West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). 
   This is satisfied based on our derivation.

2. W (West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The first condition is satisfied, but we don't have enough information about the relative positions of infy(x) and infy(z) or supy(x) and supy(z) to determine if W is a possible relation.

3. NW (North West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The first condition is satisfied, but we don't know if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

4. S (South): If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The first condition is satisfied, but we don't have enough information about the relative positions of infx(x) and infx(z) or supx(x) and supx(z) to determine if S is a possible relation.

5. SE (South East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   The second condition is satisfied, but we've derived that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, SE is not a possible relation.

6. E (East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   Similar to SE, this contradicts our derivation. So, E is not a possible relation.

7. NE (North East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   Similar to SE and E, this contradicts our derivation. So, NE is not a possible relation.

8. N (North): If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   We don't know if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

9. B (Bounding box): If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We don't have enough information to determine if these conditions are met.

Wait, I notice that I made an error in my reasoning. Let me reconsider the implications more carefully.

From x SW y and y SW z, we've established:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These conditions are only consistent with the SW relation. The conditions for W, NW, S, and B might be satisfied under certain conditions, but they're not guaranteed based on the given constraints.

Let me verify each relation one by one using the constraints we've established:

1. SW (South West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   This is satisfied.

2. W (West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The first condition is satisfied, but we don't know if infy(z) ≤ infy(x). It's possible that x extends further south than z, which would invalidate the W relation.

3. NW (North West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The first condition is satisfied, but we've derived that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which suggests that x is below z. For NW to be possible, x would need to be above z, which seems contradictory. So, NW might not be a possible relation.

   Actually, let me think more carefully. The relation supy(x) ≤ infy(z) does not exclude the possibility that supy(z) ≤ infy(x). Consider the case where z is far to the northeast of y, and y is far to the northeast of x. In such a scenario, x could potentially be both southwest of y and northwest of z. So, NW can be a possible relation.

4. S (South): If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The first condition is satisfied, but we've derived that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x) when combined with the constraint that infx(z) ≤ supx(z) (which is true for any region). So, S is not a possible relation.

   Hmm, let me recheck. From supx(x) ≤ infx(z), we can deduce that x is to the left of z. For S to be possible, x would need to overlap with z horizontally, which contradicts them being horizontally separated. So, S is not a possible relation.

5. SE (South East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   The second condition is satisfied, but we've derived that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x) when combined with the constraint that infx(z) ≤ supx(z). So, SE is not a possible relation.

6. E (East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   Similar to SE, this contradicts our derivation. So, E is not a possible relation.

7. NE (North East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   Similar to SE and E, this contradicts our derivation. So, NE is not a possible relation.

8. N (North): If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   We've derived that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, N is not a possible relation.

9. B (Bounding box): If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We've derived that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, B is not a possible relation.

So, the possible relations are:
- SW (South West)
- W (West), possibly
- NW (North West), possibly

But I'm not 100% sure about W and NW. Let me think further.

For W to be a possible relation, we need infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).

Let's think about an example. Imagine y being just a bit southwest of z, and x being far to the west of y but at the same latitude. In this case, x would be west of z.

Let's confirm with the inequalities:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

In the scenario I described:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) = infy(y) (x is at the same latitude as the bottom of y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) = supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x and z overlap vertically)

This satisfies the condition for W. So, W is a possible relation.

Similarly, for NW to be a possible relation, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Imagine y being just a bit northwest of x, and z being far to the east of y but at the same latitude. In this case, z would be southeast of y.

Let's confirm with the inequalities:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

In the scenario I described:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) = infy(z) (y is at the same latitude as the bottom of z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(z) = supy(y) = infy(x) (x and z align vertically)

Actually, I realized this scenario doesn't work. Let me re-examine.

For NW to be a possible relation, we need x to be to the left and above z. But we've derived that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z. These conditions contradict each other. So, NW is not a possible relation.

Let me reconsider the conditions for all relations once more to ensure clarity. The definitions given for the cardinal directions in the context are as follows:

1. SW (South West): If supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).
2. W (West): If supx(a) ≤ infx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).
3. NW (North West): If supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).
4. S (South): If supy(a) ≤ infy(b), infx(b) ≤ infx(a), and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).
5. SE (South East): If supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).
6. E (East): If supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).
7. NE (North East): If supx(b) ≤ infx(a) and supy(b) ≤ infy(a).
8. N (North): If supy(b) ≤ infy(a), infx(b) ≤ infx(a), and supx(a) ≤ supx(b).
9. B (Bounding box): If infx(b) ≤ infx(a), supx(a) ≤ supx(b), infy(b) ≤ infy(a), and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

Now, let's apply these definitions to our scenario where x SW y and y SW z. We've derived that:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Checking each relation:

1. SW (South West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   This is satisfied.

2. W (West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The first and third conditions are satisfied, but the second condition (infy(z) ≤ infy(x)) needs to be verified. It's possible if x and z have overlapping y-projections.

3. NW (North West): If supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The first condition is satisfied, but the second condition (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)) contradicts our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This is because if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which leads to supy(x) ≤ infy(x), which is logically impossible for a non-empty region. So, NW is not a possible relation.

   Actually, I made a mistake. Let me think more carefully. The constraint supy(x) ≤ infy(z) means that the top of x is below the bottom of z. The constraint for NW, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), means that the top of z is below the bottom of x. These two constraints can't be simultaneously satisfied because they would imply that the top of x is below the bottom of z, which is in turn below the bottom of x. This is a contradiction. So, NW is indeed not a possible relation.

4. S (South): If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The first condition is satisfied, but the second condition (infx(z) ≤ infx(x)) contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This is because if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which leads to supx(x) ≤ infx(x), which is logically impossible for a non-empty region. So, S is not a possible relation.

5. SE (South East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   The second condition is satisfied, but the first condition (supx(z) ≤ infx(x)) contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This is because if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which leads to supx(x) ≤ infx(x), which is logically impossible for a non-empty region. So, SE is not a possible relation.

6. E (East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   Similar to SE, the first condition contradicts our derivation. So, E is not a possible relation.

7. NE (North East): If supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   Similar to SE and E, the first condition contradicts our derivation. Also, the second condition contradicts our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as explained in the analysis for NW. So, NE is not a possible relation.

8. N (North): If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   As explained in the analyses for NW and S, the first and second conditions contradict our derivations. So, N is not a possible relation.

9. B (Bounding box): If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The second and fourth conditions are compatible with our derivations, but the first and third conditions contradict them. So, B is not a possible relation.

So now I have narrowed down the possible relations to:
- SW (South West): Definitely possible.
- W (West): Possibly, if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

Let's check if W is truly a possible relation. We need three conditions for x W z:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This is satisfied based on our derivation.
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(x): We don't know this definitively.
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(z): We don't know this definitively.

For conditions 2 and 3, we have derived that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which implies that the top of x is below the bottom of z. But for W to be a possible relation, we also need infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means the bottom of z is below the bottom of x. These conditions can coexist, but they imply that the top of x (supy(x)) is below the bottom of z (infy(z)), which is below the bottom of x (infy(x)). This gives us supy(x) < infy(x), which is logically impossible for a non-empty region.

So, W is also not a possible relation.

In conclusion, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, wait. I think I misunderstood the problem. Let's start from basics. I need to find the possible relations between x and z, given that x is SW of y, and y is SW of z.

Let me establish the facts again:
- x SW y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y). In other words, x is completely to the left and below y.
- y SW z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). In other words, y is completely to the left and below z.

From these, we can derive that x is completely to the left and below z. This is because:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z). So, supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

But note that these are just inequalities. For example, it's possible that supx(x) is much less than infx(z), which means x is far to the left of z. Or, it's possible that supx(x) is just slightly less than infx(z), which means x is just to the left of z.

Let's think about specific scenarios:

1. If x, y, and z are all aligned diagonally, then x is directly SW of z.
2. If x is far to the west of y, then x might be more "W" of z than "SW" of z.
3. If x is far to the south of y, then x might be more "S" of z than "SW" of z.

But we need to formalize these intuitions using the defined cardinal relations.

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) match exactly with the definition of SW. So, SW is definitely a possible relation.

Now, let's check the conditions for W:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(z): This is satisfied based on our derivation.
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(x): We don't know this definitively.
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(z): We don't know this definitively.

The latter two conditions mean that x and z overlap vertically. But we've derived that supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is completely below z. If x is completely below z, it can't overlap vertically with z. So, W is not a possible relation.

Similarly, let's check the conditions for S:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(z): This is satisfied based on our derivation.
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(x): We don't know this definitively.
3. supx(x) ≤ supx(z): We don't know this definitively.

The latter two conditions mean that x and z overlap horizontally. But we've derived that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is completely to the left of z. If x is completely to the left of z, it can't overlap horizontally with z. So, S is not a possible relation.

In a similar vein, we can argue that the other cardinal relations (NW, N, NE, E, SE, B) are also not possible because they each require conditions that would contradict our derivation that x is completely to the left and below z.

Given our assumptions and the definitions of the cardinal relations, I am confident that the only possible relation between x and z is SW, which means x is directly southwest of z.

Actually, I reviewed the problem definition again and I think I might have misunderstood something. The problem states that we're looking for the possible relations between region x and region z. I've been approaching this from the perspective of the basic single-tile relations (N, S, E, W, NE, SE, SW, NW, B). 

However, the problem also mentions that a cardinal direction relation can be an expression R1:...:Rk, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 9, and Ri ∈ {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}.

Given this, maybe I'm supposed to consider the possibility that the relation between x and z can be a combination of single-tile relations, not just a single one.

But, no, I think I'm overthinking. The problem is asking for which of the single-tile relations could possibly hold between x and z given the constraints. We've already established that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is completely to the left and below z. This matches exactly with the SW relation. None of the other single-tile relations are compatible with these constraints (for reasons I've explained above, like the fact that x can't overlap horizontally or vertically with z if x is completely to the left and below z).

Actually, let me rethink this problem from the beginning once more.

Given:
- x is SW of y: This means x is entirely to the left and below y. Formally, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y).
- y is SW of z: This means y is entirely to the left and below z. Formally, supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).

We want to find the possible relations between x and z.

From the given conditions, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z). So, supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z). So, supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Let's now check each of the possible relations:

1. B (Bounding box): For x B z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   But we've derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, B is not a possible relation.

2. S (South): For x S z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The first condition is satisfied, but we've derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, S is not a possible relation.

3. SW (South West): For x SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   Both conditions are satisfied. So, SW is a possible relation.

4. W (West): For x W z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The first condition is satisfied, but the second condition contradicts our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This is because if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (top of x below bottom of z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of z below bottom of x), then we'd have supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is impossible for a non-empty region. So, W is not a possible relation.

I've been making an error. The constraints infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) are not inherently contradictory. It just means that the top of x is below the bottom of z, and the bottom of z is below the bottom of x. These can be satisfied if we have: infy(x) < infy(z) ≤ supy(z) > supy(x). But that's not the condition for W. For W, we also need supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This, combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), implies supy(x) ≤ min(infy(z), supy(z)) = infy(z). But we already know that infy(z) ≤ infy(x). Putting them together: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x). This means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is a contradiction.

So, W is indeed not a possible relation.

5. NW (North West): For x NW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The first condition is satisfied, but the second condition contradicts our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This is because if supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (top of x below bottom of z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (top of z below bottom of x), then we'd have supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means the top of x is below the bottom of x, which is impossible for a non-empty region. So, NW is not a possible relation.

6. N (North): For x N z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   As explained in the analysis for NW, the first condition contradicts our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Additionally, the second condition contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, N is not a possible relation.

7. NE (North East): For x NE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The second condition contradicts our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as explained in the analysis for NW. The first condition also contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, NE is not a possible relation.

8. E (East): For x E z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The first condition contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Additionally, as explained in the analysis for W, the second and third conditions, combined with our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z), lead to a contradiction. So, E is not a possible relation.

9. SE (South East): For x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   The second condition is satisfied, but the first condition contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This is because if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (right of x to the left of left of z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (right of z to the left of left of x), then we'd have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of x, which is impossible for a non-empty region. So, SE is not a possible relation.

So, in conclusion, the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

Actually, let me think about this problem in a more geometric way. I think it might help clarify my reasoning.

We know that x is SW of y, which means x is completely to the left and below y. Similarly, y is SW of z, which means y is completely to the left and below z.

Now, if we place these regions on a 2D plane:

- z would be in the top-right.
- y would be completely to the left and below z.
- x would be completely to the left and below y.

Given this configuration, it's clear that x is also completely to the left and below z. This matches the definition of the SW relation. So, SW is a possible relation between x and z.

But let's try to think if any other relation is possible. 

For W to be possible, x would need to partially or fully align with z vertically (i.e., they'd need to have overlapping y-coordinates). But we know x is SW of y, which is SW of z. If x is completely below y, and y is completely below z, then x must be completely below z. So, W is not possible.

For S to be possible, x would need to partially or fully align with z horizontally (i.e., they'd need to have overlapping x-coordinates). But we know x is SW of y, which is SW of z. If x is completely to the left of y, and y is completely to the left of z, then x must be completely to the left of z. So, S is not possible.

For similar reasons, NW, N, NE, E, SE, and B are also not possible.

Given the geometry of the problem, I am confident that the only possible relation between x and z is SW.

Wait, I think I need to be more precise about what the problem is asking. The problem states, "If region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?"

I've been interpreting this as: given x SW y and y SW z, what are the possible single-tile cardinal direction relations between x and z?

But I realized there's another interpretation: given x SW y and y SW z, which of the single-tile cardinal direction relations could potentially hold between x and z depending on the specific placement of x, y, and z (while still satisfying the given constraints)?

Let me think about this more carefully.

Given x SW y and y SW z, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

Now, let's think about each cardinal relation again:

1. B (Bounding box): For x B z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   But we've derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, B is not a possible relation.

2. S (South): For x S z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   The first condition is satisfied, but we've derived supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which contradicts infx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, S is not a possible relation.

3. SW (South West): For x SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   Both conditions are satisfied. So, SW is a possible relation.

Actually, I'm overthinking this. Let me go back to the simple geometric interpretation:

- z is at the top-right.
- y is completely to the left and below z.
- x is completely to the left and below y.

From this, x is also completely to the left and below z. This satisfies the definition of SW and only SW. No other single-tile cardinal relation can hold between x and z given the constraints.

But I'll double-check all the relations to be thorough:

4. W (West): For x W z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The first and third conditions are satisfied, but for the second condition, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z). This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z). The condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) would mean the bottom of z is below or equal to the bottom of x. Combined with supy(x) ≤ infy(z), we'd have supy(x) ≤ infy(x), which is a contradiction for a non-empty region. So, W is not a possible relation.

5. NW (North West): For x NW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The first condition is satisfied, but for the second condition, we know supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z). This means supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z). The condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) would mean the top of z is below or equal to the bottom of x. But that contradicts the fact that the bottom of z (infy(z)) is above the top of x (supy(x)). So, NW is not a possible relation.

6. N (North): For x N z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   As explained in the analysis for NW, the first condition contradicts our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z). Additionally, the second condition contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, N is not a possible relation.

7. NE (North East): For x NE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   The second condition contradicts our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z), as explained in the analysis for NW. The first condition also contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). So, NE is not a possible relation.

8. E (East): For x E z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   The first condition contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). Additionally, as explained in the analysis for W, the second condition, combined with our derived inequality supy(x) ≤ infy(z), leads to a contradiction. So, E is not a possible relation.

9. SE (South East): For x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   The second condition is satisfied, but the first condition contradicts our derived inequality supx(x) ≤ infx(z). This is because if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (right of x to the left of left of z) and supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (right of z to the left of left of x), then we'd have supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means the right edge of x is to the left of the left edge of x, which is impossible for a non-empty region. So, SE is not a possible relation.

Ok, I've verified all the relations, and indeed, SW is the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints.

Therefore, the answer to the original question is: SW.

While I was writing I just realized that it might be possible that, while the inequality supx(x) ≤ infy(z) implies the regions are non-overlapping on the x-coordinate, it's an inequality, not a strict inequality. There could be a case where supx(x) = infx(z), which means the right edge of x touches the left edge of z. Similarly, supy(x) = infy(z) means the top edge of x touches the bottom edge of z. 

In this case, would x still be SW of z? Let's re-read the definition:

SW (South West): a SW b if and only if supx(a) ≤ infx(b) and supy(a) ≤ infy(b).

So, even if the edges of x and z touch, x is still SW of z.

To ensure I haven't made any errors, let's once again consider all possible relations between x and z, assuming x SW y and y SW z:

1. B (Bounding box): Requires z to be a subset or equal to x, which isn't possible given the constraints.
2. S (South): Requires x to be directly below z, which isn't possible given x is to the left of z.
3. SW (South West): Requires x to be to the left and below z, which is exactly what we've derived.
4. W (West): Requires x to be directly to the left of z, which isn't possible given x is below z.
5. NW (North West): Requires x to be to the left and above z, which isn't possible given x is below z.
6. N (North): Requires x to be directly above z, which isn't possible given x is to the left of z.
7. NE (North East): Requires x to be to the right and above z, which isn't possible given x is to the left and below z.
8. E (East): Requires x to be directly to the right of z, which isn't possible given x is to the left of z.
9. SE (South East): Requires x to be to the right and below z, which isn't possible given x is to the left of z.

So, SW is the only possible relation between x and z given the constraints.

In summary, if region x is SW of region y and region y is SW of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.

Therefore, the answer to the original question is: SW.

Upon a final reflection, I realize I can make a very simple argument. We have been given that "region x is SW of region y" and "region y is SW of region z". By the definition of SW, x is to the left and below y, and similarly y is to the left and below z. It immediately follows that x is to the left and below z, which means x is SW of z. This is the only possible relation given the constraints.

So, the answer is SW.

ANSWER:

Given:
- x is SW of y: This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is SW of z: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These derived conditions (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) exactly match the definition of the SW relation.

Let me verify no other relation is possible:
- For S: Would require infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- For W: Would require infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- For B, N, NE, E, SE, NW: All require conditions that contradict our derived inequalities

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SW.
