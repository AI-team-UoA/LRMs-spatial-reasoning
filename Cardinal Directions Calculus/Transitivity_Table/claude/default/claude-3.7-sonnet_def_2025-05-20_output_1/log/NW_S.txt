PROMPT: If region x is NW of region y and region y is S of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let me work through this problem step by step.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y: x NW y
- Region y is S of region z: y S z

I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Let's recall the definitions of the relevant cardinal directions:
- x NW y if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y S z if and only if supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From x NW y, we get:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

From y S z, we get:
3. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
4. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
5. supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

Now, let's derive the constraints on the relationship between x and z:

From constraints 1 and 4, we get:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
However, we can't directly compare supx(x) and infx(z) from these. 
So x could be W, NW, SW of z, or possibly other relations.

From constraints 2 and 3, we get:
supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
This means supy(y) ≤ min(infy(x), infy(z))
But we still can't directly compare infy(x) and infy(z).

Let's think about the possible cardinal direction relations:

1. Could x be N of z?
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   From our constraints, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x).
   But we can't determine the relationship between supy(z) and infy(x).
   So, x could potentially be N of z.

2. Could x be NE of z?
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   From our constraints, we don't have direct information about supx(z) relative to infx(x).
   So, x could potentially be NE of z.

3. Could x be E of z?
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From our constraints, we don't have direct information about the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), or between supy(x) and supy(z).
   So, x could potentially be E of z.

4. Could x be SE of z?
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   From our constraints, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
   But we don't know the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   So, x could potentially be SE of z.

5. Could x be S of z?
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   From constraints 2 and 3, we have supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
   This suggests x and z are both north of y, but it's not clear which is more north.
   If x is more north than z, then x cannot be S of z.
   If z is more north than x, then x could be S of z.
   Since we don't have enough information, x could potentially be S of z.

6. Could x be SW of z?
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   From constraints 1 and 4, we have: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
   If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z. Otherwise, they might overlap in the x-direction.
   Given the constraints, x could potentially be SW of z.

7. Could x be W of z?
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From our constraints, we don't have direct information about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).
   So, x could potentially be W of z.

8. Could x be NW of z?
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   From our constraints, we don't have direct information about the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z), or between supy(z) and infy(x).
   So, x could potentially be NW of z.

9. Could x be B of z (bounding box)?
   For x B z, we need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From our constraints, we don't have direct information about all these relationships.
   So, x could potentially be B of z.

Hmm, so based on the information we have, it seems like x could potentially be in any cardinal direction relation with z. But I think I should be more careful with my analysis since there are specific constraints that might rule out some possibilities.

Let's think more carefully. We have:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)
3. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
4. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
5. supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

From 1 and 4, we can derive:
supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
This tells us that both x and z have their eastern and western boundaries, respectively, to the left of the western boundary of y. However, we can't directly determine the relationship between the eastern boundary of x and the western boundary of z.

From 2 and 3, we can derive:
supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
This tells us that both x and z have their southern boundaries above the northern boundary of y. However, we can't directly determine the relationship between the southern boundaries of x and z.

Given these constraints, let's examine each possible cardinal direction relation:

1. X N Z:
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   We know from 2 that supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and from 3 that supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
   From 4, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y).
   From 1, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
   From 5, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
   
   We can't directly compare supy(z) and infy(x), so we can't definitively say x is N of z.
   Similarly, we can't directly compare infx(z) and infx(x), or supx(x) and supx(z).
   
   Since we can't rule out any of the conditions for x N z, it's a possibility.

2. X NE Z:
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   Given our constraints, we can't determine the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
   Thus, x could potentially be NE of z.

Let me go back to the constraints and see if I'm missing something:

From x NW y, we get:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

This tells us that region x is in the northwest quadrant of region y. The entire region x is to the left (west) of the left boundary of y, and it's entirely above (north of) the top boundary of y.

From y S z, we get:
3. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)
4. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
5. supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

This tells us that region y is in the south part of region z. The entire region y is below (south of) the bottom boundary of z. Also, the left boundary of z is to the left of or coincides with the left boundary of y, and the right boundary of z is to the right of or coincides with the right boundary of y.

With these clearer descriptions, let's redraw the scenario:

z: A region with its bottom boundary above region y, and its left and right boundaries extending at least as far as the left and right boundaries of y, respectively.
y: A region with its top boundary below region x, and its left boundary to the right of the right boundary of x.
x: A region with its right boundary to the left of the left boundary of y, and its bottom boundary above the top boundary of y.

Given this setup:

1. X N Z:
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   We know that region y is to the south of z and region x is to the north of y. So, x is north of y, and y is south of z. This suggests x is north of z, but we need to check all the conditions.
   We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
   But we don't know which of infy(x) or infy(z) is greater. 
   Similarly, we can't determine the relationship between supx(z) and supx(x).
   
Let me try to draw a simple diagram to better visualize the constraints.

```
    x (NW of y)
      |
      v
    y (S of z)
      |
      v
      z
```

From this, I can see:
- x is NW of y, so it's to the left and above y.
- y is S of z, so it's below z.

Given these, x is to the left and above y, which is below z. So, x can be to the left of z (W), to the left and below z (SW), to the left and above z (NW), or directly below z (S), or above z (N), or below and to the right of z (SE), or to the right of z (E), or to the right and above z (NE). x might also be inside the bounding box of z (B).

Actually, I need to be more careful. Let's redraw the diagram with more details based on the constraints.

```
    +---+
    | x |
    +---+
           +---+
           | y |
           +---+
       +-------+
       |   z   |
       +-------+
```

From the constraints:
- x is NW of y, so the right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of y, and the bottom boundary of x is above the top boundary of y.
- y is S of z, so the top boundary of y is below the bottom boundary of z, and the left boundary of z is to the left of or coincides with the left boundary of y, and the right boundary of z is to the right of or coincides with the right boundary of y.

Given this visualization, it seems more clear that x can be in various positions relative to z, including W, NW, SW, N, NE, SE, E, or S, or B. It's not specifically constrained.

Wait, I might have made a misleading diagram. Let me revisit the constraints and draw a more accurate representation.

From x NW y, we get:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of y)
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (top boundary of y is below the bottom boundary of x)

From y S z, we get:
3. supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (top boundary of y is below the bottom boundary of z)
4. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (left boundary of z is to the left of or coincides with the left boundary of y)
5. supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (right boundary of z is to the right of or coincides with the right boundary of y)

Redrawing:

```
    +---+
    | x |
    +---+
           +---+
           | y |
           +---+
       +-------+
       |   z   |
       +-------+
```

Given this visualization and the constraints, I believe x can have the following relations with z:

1. W (West): If x is completely to the left of z, which is possible because x is to the left of y, and z is around y.
2. NW (Northwest): If x is completely to the left and above z.
3. N (North): If x overlaps with z in the x-direction but is completely above z.
4. NE (Northeast): If x is completely to the right and above z.
5. E (East): If x is completely to the right of z, which is possible because the left boundary of z can be far enough to the left.
6. SE (Southeast): If x is completely to the right and below z.
7. S (South): If x overlaps with z in the x-direction but is completely below z.
8. SW (Southwest): If x is completely to the left and below z.
9. B (Bounding Box): If x is completely inside the bounding box of z.

However, I need to double-check each of these against the constraints to see if any can be ruled out.

The main restrictions are:

1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y): x is completely to the left of y.
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x): y is completely below x.
3. supy(y) ≤ infy(z): y is completely below z.
4. infx(z) ≤ infx(y): Left boundary of z is to the left of or coincides with the left boundary of y.
5. supx(y) ≤ supx(z): Right boundary of z is to the right of or coincides with the right boundary of y.

Now, let's examine each potential relation:

1. x W z:
   For this, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   From constraints 1 and 4, we know: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y).
   We can't directly deduce the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z) from this.
   Similarly, we don't have direct information about the relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), or between supy(x) and supy(z).
   So, x W z is a possibility.

2. x NW z:
   For this, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   Similar to above, we can't definitively determine the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z), or between supy(z) and infy(x).
   So, x NW z is a possibility.

3. x N z:
   For this, we need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   Again, we don't have direct information about these relationships from our constraints.
   So, x N z is a possibility.

4. x NE z:
   For this, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   We don't have direct information about these relationships.
   So, x NE z is a possibility.

5. x E z:
   For this, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We don't have direct information about these relationships.
   So, x E z is a possibility.

6. x SE z:
   For this, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We don't have direct information about the relationship between supx(z) and infx(x).
   From constraints 2 and 3, we know: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z).
   But we can't directly determine the relationship between supy(x) and infy(z).
   So, x SE z is a possibility.

7. x S z:
   For this, we need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   We don't have direct information about these relationships.
   So, x S z is a possibility.

8. x SW z:
   For this, we need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
   We don't have direct information about these relationships.
   So, x SW z is a possibility.

9. x B z:
   For this, we need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   We don't have direct information about these relationships.
   So, x B z is a possibility.

Based on the constraints, it seems like any of the 9 cardinal direction relations could be possible for the relationship between x and z.

But lets carefully think about this problem.

We have:
1. x NW y: Region x is in the northwest quadrant of region y.
2. y S z: Region y is in the south part of region z.

Given these constraints, let's analyze what we know and what we don't know:

x NW y means:
- Region x is completely to the west of region y.
- Region x is completely to the north of region y.

y S z means:
- Region y is completely to the south of region z.
- Region y's left boundary is to the right of or coincides with the left boundary of z.
- Region y's right boundary is to the left of or coincides with the right boundary of z.

Now, let's determine the relationship between x and z:

x is completely to the west of y, and y's left boundary is to the right of or coincides with the left boundary of z. This means z extends at least as far west as y. But, we don't know if z extends further west than y. If it does, it could potentially overlap with x in the x-direction. If it doesn't, then x is completely to the west of z.

x is completely to the north of y, and y is completely to the south of z. This means x and z are both north of y. However, we don't know the relative north-south positions of x and z. x could be north of z, z could be north of x, or they could overlap in the y-direction.

Given these observations, the possible relations for x relative to z include:
- x W z: If x is completely to the west of z and overlaps with z in the y-direction.
- x NW z: If x is completely to the west and north of z.
- x N z: If x overlaps with z in the x-direction and is completely to the north of z.
- x S z: If x overlaps with z in the x-direction and is completely to the south of z.
- x SW z: If x is completely to the west and south of z.

I'm still not entirely confident if I've eliminated all impossible relations. Let's double-check.

x is NW of y:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y): Right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of y.
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x): Top boundary of y is below the bottom boundary of x.

y is S of z:
3. supy(y) ≤ infy(z): Top boundary of y is below the bottom boundary of z.
4. infx(z) ≤ infx(y): Left boundary of z is to the left of or coincides with the left boundary of y.
5. supx(y) ≤ supx(z): Right boundary of z is to the right of or coincides with the right boundary of y.

Now, let's deduce the possible x to z relations.

From 1 and 4, we know: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
But this doesn't tell us the relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).
x could be to the west of z (supx(x) ≤ infx(z)), or x and z could overlap in the x-direction (infx(z) < supx(x)).

From 2 and 3, we know: supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
But this doesn't tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z).
x could be to the north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), z could be to the north of x (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), or x and z could overlap in the y-direction.

Given these, I can't definitively narrow down the list of possible relations. The possible relations remain all 9 cardinal directions.

I realize I might be making this too complex. Let's try a different approach.

Given x NW y and y S z, let's re-envision the scenario from a simpler, more intuitive perspective.

If x is NW of y, it means x is to the left (west) and above (north) of y.
If y is S of z, it means y is below (south) of z, and z spans at least the entire width of y.

Now, where can x be relative to z?

x is to the left and above y. z is above y and spans at least the entire width of y. 

If z spans exactly the width of y, x is to the left of z and above y. This would make x either W, NW, or SW of z (depending on how far north or south x and z are relative to each other).

If z spans more than the width of y, extending further left, it could potentially overlap with x in the x-direction. In this case, x could be B, N, S of z, or still remain W, NW, or SW of z.

But there's another possibility: z might not extend much to the west of y, but it might extend further to the east. In this case, x would still be to the west of z, making x either W, NW, or SW of z.

From this, it seems like the possible relations are: W, NW, SW, B, N, S.

Hold on, I need to be more careful. I know from the constraints that z spans at least the width of y, and x is to the left of y. But, I can't definitively rule out that x is to the right of z. 

The reason is: x is to the left of y, but z might extend very far to the left, beyond x. In this case, depending on the relative north-south positions, x could be E, NE, or SE of z.

Ok, so it seems like the possible relations are still all 9 cardinal directions.

Let me check once more with a clearer visualization:
- x is to the left of y.
- x is above y.
- y is below z.
- z spans at least the width of y.

With these, can x be to the right of z?
If z spans exactly the width of y, then x is to the left of z because x is to the left of y.
But if z extends farther to the left than y, it could potentially be to the left of x, making x to the right of z. This depends on how far left z extends.

Can x be below z?
y is below z. x is above y. But we don't know how high z extends. If z extends very high, it could be above x. In this case, x would be below z.

Given these possibilities, I can't definitively rule out any of the cardinal directions. It seems like x can have any of the 9 cardinal direction relations with z, depending on the specific geometry.

Actually, let me step back and think about this problem more rigorously. I think I've been making it more complex than it is.

Let's go back to the constraints:

x NW y means:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y): Right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of y.
2. supy(y) ≤ infy(x): Top boundary of y is below the bottom boundary of x.

y S z means:
3. supy(y) ≤ infy(z): Top boundary of y is below the bottom boundary of z.
4. infx(z) ≤ infx(y): Left boundary of z is to the left of or coincides with the left boundary of y.
5. supx(y) ≤ supx(z): Right boundary of z is to the right of or coincides with the right boundary of y.

The key constraints that could limit the possible directions between x and z are 1 and 4, and 2 and 3.

From 1 and 4, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). However, this doesn't tell us the direct relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is to the west of z. If infx(z) ≤ supx(x), then x and z might overlap in the x-direction.

From 2 and 3, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z). But this doesn't tell us the relationship between infy(x) and infy(z). If supy(z) ≤ infy(x), then x is to the north of z. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is to the south of z. They could also overlap in the y-direction.

Given this, the possible directions from x to z are: N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, B. In other words, all the directions are possible.

Actually I think I realize what's happening now. 

See, we don't have a strict constraint on how much z expands westward and upward. Let's consider a concrete example: if region z barely spans the width of y, then x can be left of z, west of z, etc. If region z stretches largely leftward, so that z is in fact to the left of x, then z is NE, E, or SE from x. I need to be more careful with this.

Let me try to draw pictures representing several possible arrangements to ascertain which directions x could be from z.

Scenario 1: z spans just the width of y, and z and x are at the same vertical level.
```
    +---+
    | x |
    +---+
           +---+
           | y |
           +---+
           +---+
           | z |
           +---+
```
In this scenario, x is W of z.

Scenario 2: z spans just the width of y, but z extends very high, above x.
```
           +---+
           | z |
           +---+
    +---+
    | x |
    +---+
           +---+
           | y |
           +---+
```
In this scenario, x is SW of z.

Scenario 3: z spans just the width of y, but x extends very high, above z.
```
    +---+
    | x |
    +---+
           +---+
           | z |
           +---+
           +---+
           | y |
           +---+
```
In this scenario, x is NW of z.

Scenario 4: z extends significantly to the left, to the left of x, and z and x are at the same vertical level.
```
+-------+
|   z   |
+-------+
    +---+
    | x |
    +---+
    +---+
    | y |
    +---+
```
In this scenario, x is E of z.

Scenario 5: z extends significantly to the left, to the left of x, and z extends very high, above x.
```
+-------+
|   z   |
+-------+
    +---+
    | x |
    +---+
    +---+
    | y |
    +---+
```
In this scenario, x is SE of z.

Scenario 6: z extends significantly to the left, to the left of x, but x extends very high, above z.
```
    +---+
    | x |

In this scenario, x is S of z.

I think I've now shown that x can be in any of the cardinal directions from z: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

Just to double-check the S direction (Scenario 12), let's verify that x can be directly below z while still being NW of y.

For x to be S of z, x would need to be directly below z, which means their x-projections overlap. For x to be NW of y, x would need to be to the left and above y. 

Let's check if this is feasible:
- z is above y (y S z)
- x is above y (since x NW y)
- x could be below z, as the constraint "y S z" doesn't specifying how high z extends.
- x is to the left of y (since x NW y)
- z spans at least the width of y (since y S z), which means z's x-projection encompasses y's x-projection.
- x and z could have overlapping x-projections, though x is to the left of y.

Given these, I believe x S z is feasible.

Given all the analysis, I believe x can be in any of the cardinal directions from z: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or B.

Actually, sorry. Let's double-check the E, NE, and SE directions once more.

For x to be E of z, x needs to be to the right of z. But we know x is to the left of y (since x NW y) and z spans at least the width of y (since y S z). This doesn't preclude x from being to the right of z, but it requires z's right boundary to be to the left of x's left boundary, which means z doesn't span to the right of y.

OK but the constraint y S z doesn't mean that z covers the entirety of y in the x-direction; it just means that z extends at least the full width of y, but z could extend further in either direction. 

Actually, let's reread our rules:

y S z if and only if supy(y) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)

So y S z means:
- y is below z
- left boundary of z is to the left of (or coincident with) the left boundary of y
- right boundary of z is to the right of (or coincident with) the right boundary of y

So, y S z means z covers at least the full width of y.

Now, can x be to the right of z? For this, z's right boundary would need to be to the left of x's left boundary. But it is z's left boundary that is to the left (or coincident with) y's left boundary. We don't know about z's right boundary in relation to x, except that z's right boundary is to the right of y's right boundary. Since x is to the left of y, it suggests x is to the left of z as well.

However, that's not conclusive, because both the left and right boundaries of x could be to the left of the left boundary of y. And z's left and right boundaries could be far to the left, possibly to the left of x's left boundary.

So, it still seems plausible that x could be E, NE, or SE of z, though it requires specific configurations.

Actually, let me carefully analyze this. For x to be E, NE, or SE of z, x's left boundary would need to be to the right of z's right boundary. 

x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
y S z means: supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y)

From this, we know that supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z). However, we don't have a direct relationship between supx(z) and infx(x). 

If z extends very far to the right, beyond the left boundary of x, then x can have its left boundary to the right of z's right boundary, making x E, NE, or SE of z.

Upon reflection, though, I think this contradicts the constraint that x is to the left of y and z spans at least the width of y. This should prevent x from being to the right of z.

Here's the reasoning:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
2. infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z's left boundary is to the left of or coincides with y's left boundary)
3. supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z's right boundary is to the right of or coincides with y's right boundary)

For x to be E, NE, or SE of z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

From 1, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
From 2, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y).

For x to be to the right of z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
But from 1, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
So, supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y).

This means supx(z) ≤ infx(y). But from 3, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

So, supx(y) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y), which implies supx(y) ≤ infx(y), which is a contradiction because the right boundary of a region can't be to the left of the left boundary of the same region.

This contradiction suggests that x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z.

Given this, the possible directions for x relative to z are: N, W, NW, S, SW, B.

Wait, I need to double-check my own logic.

For x to be E, NE, or SE of z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

From 1, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
From 2, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y).
From 3, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

So, we have: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

For x to be to the right of z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
But from 1, we know: supx(x) ≤ infx(y).

If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), then: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y).

This means supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
But from 3, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

So, supx(y) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
This means supx(y) ≤ infx(y), which is impossible for a region. The right boundary can't be to the left of the left boundary.

Therefore, x can't be E, NE, or SE of z.

I believe the valid directions for x relative to z are: N, W, NW, S, SW, B.

Wait, let's double-check the B direction once more.

For x to be B of z, which means x is inside the bounding box of z, we'd need:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom boundary is above z's bottom boundary)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top boundary is below z's top boundary)

Let's check the first two conditions with our constraints: 
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y S z)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (from x NW y)

For infx(z) ≤ infx(x) to be true, we'd need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y). This is possible.

For supx(x) ≤ supx(z) to be true, we'd need supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Given supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z), this condition is satisfied: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Let's now check the other two conditions:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x NW y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y S z)

For infy(z) ≤ infy(x) to be true, we'd need to compare infy(z) and infy(x). From the constraints, we know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but we don't have direct information on the relation between infy(z) and infy(x).

OK, so I can't definitively rule out the B direction.

Let's re-summarize everything:

From the given constraints:
- x NW y: x is to the left and above y.
- y S z: y is below z and z spans at least the width of y.

We've shown that x can't be E, NE, or SE of z, due to the contradiction it leads to.

The remaining possible directions for x relative to z are: N, W, NW, S, SW, B.

Upon deeper reflection, I believe I need to make a correction. Let's revisit the impossibility of E, NE, and SE relations.

For x to be E, NE, or SE of z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

From 1, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
From 2, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y).
From 3, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

Let's check the contradiction I found:

If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), then: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y).

But hold on, the inequality infx(x) ≤ supx(x) should be reversed. The left boundary of a region is always to the left of its right boundary. So, it should be: infx(x) ≤ supx(x).

With this in mind, the sequence becomes: supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y).

And from there, supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
But from 3, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

So, supx(y) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(y).
This means supx(y) ≤ infx(y), which is indeed impossible for a valid region.

I think my logic was correct earlier. x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z.

Actually, wait, let me rethink this:

From 1, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y).
From 2, we know infx(z) ≤ infx(y).
From 3, we know supx(y) ≤ supx(z).

For x to be E, NE, or SE of z, we need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x).

Thus, for such a scenario to be consistent with the other constraints, we'd have: supx(y) ≤ supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ infx(y). This implies supx(y) ≤ infx(y), which is impossible for a valid region. (Actually, here is where I keep getting confused, because we should have infx(region) <= supx(region). But I do believe that my logic is correct: since x is to the left of y, and z has a width that includes the width of y, the x cannot be to the right of z.)

Therefore, x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z. The possible directions for x relative to z are: N, W, NW, S, SW, B.

Actually, I'm not sure if I can even rule out the B direction. Let me verify this:
- For x B z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- From constraints, supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y). This means supx(x) ≤ infx(y), so unless z has a very narrow width, x won't be inside z's bounding box.

Let's re-read the constraints for y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z): Top boundary of y is below the bottom boundary of z.
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y): Left boundary of z is to the left of or coincides with the left boundary of y.
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z): Right boundary of z is to the right of or coincides with the right boundary of y.

The way I understand it, z spans at least the width of y. It doesn't have to be directly above y; it just needs to be above and encompass the width of y.

Given that x is to the left of y, and z encompasses the width of y, it's hard to see how x can be inside the bounding box of z. For x to be inside, z would need to extend further to the left than x's left boundary, which violates the constraint that x is to the left of y. Or to put it more carefully, supx(x) <= infx(y), which means that the right boundary of x is to the left of the left boundary of y. Meanwhile, from y S z, we get that infx(z) <= infx(y), meaning z's left boundary is to the left of (or coincides with) y's left boundary. And since supx(x) <= infx(y), in order for infx(z) <= infx(x) (which is required for x B z), we'd need infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y). This is possible.

But for the other condition, supx(x) ≤ supx(z), again, from the constraints, we have supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z's right boundary is to the right of or coincides with y's right boundary). These combined give: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So, supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which satisfies the condition.

Since I haven't identified a clear contradiction yet, I can't definitively rule out the B direction.

OK so let's do a clearer check. I'll try to argue why x B z is impossible:

Suppose that x B z. This means that x is contained within the bounding box of z.

For x B z, we need:
1. infx(z) <= infx(x): z's left boundary is to the left of (or coincides with) x's left boundary.
2. supx(x) <= supx(z): x's right boundary is to the left of (or coincides with) z's right boundary.
3. infy(z) <= infy(x): z's bottom boundary is below (or coincides with) x's bottom boundary.
4. supy(x) <= supy(z): x's top boundary is below (or coincides with) z's top boundary.

From the constraint x NW y, we know:
5. supx(x) <= infx(y): x's right boundary is to the left of y's left boundary.
6. supy(y) <= infy(x): y's top boundary is below x's bottom boundary.

From the constraint y S z, we know:
7. supy(y) <= infy(z): y's top boundary is below z's bottom boundary.
8. infx(z) <= infx(y): z's left boundary is to the left of (or coincides with) y's left boundary.
9. supx(y) <= supx(z): y's right boundary is to the left of (or coincides with) z's right boundary.

From 5 (supx(x) <= infx(y)) and 8 (infx(z) <= infx(y)), we can't directly derive a relationship between infx(z) and infx(x). So condition 1 (infx(z) <= infx(x)) could be satisfied.

From 5 (supx(x) <= infx(y)) and 9 (supx(y) <= supx(z)), we can deduce: supx(x) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= supx(z). This means supx(x) <= supx(z), so condition 2 is satisfied.

From 6 (supy(y) <= infy(x)) and 7 (supy(y) <= infy(z)), we can't directly derive a relationship between infy(z) and infy(x). So I can't determine if condition 3 (infy(z) <= infy(x)) is satisfied.

Similarly, I can't directly determine if condition 4 (supy(x) <= supy(z)) is satisfied.

OK so there is a route to satisfying all of the conditions. So x B z remains a possibility.

So returning to the list of possible directions for x relative to z: N, W, NW, S, SW, and B.

Actually, wait. Let's think about the constraints and the possible positions for x, y, and z once more.

Let's assume, the most straightforward scenario where:
- x is directly NW of y (i.e., diagonally).
- y is directly S of z (i.e., directly below).

In this scenario, x would be NW of z.

But if y is shifted slightly to the right, while still being S of z and having x to its NW, then x could end up being W of z.

If y is far below z, and x is diagonally above y, then x could be directly below z, making it S of z.

If x is far to the left of y, and y is directly below z, then x could be SW of z.

If z extends far to the left and up, it could possibly encapsulate x, making x B z.

And if z doesn't extend far up, but x extends far up beyond the top of z, then x could be N of z.

Given all these scenarios, I think the possible directions for x relative to z are: N, W, NW, S, SW, B.

The ones I'm confident in ruling out are E, NE, and SE, due to the contradictions I worked out earlier. In order for x to be to the right of z, z's right boundary would need to be to the left of x's left boundary, which contradicts the constraints.

So, to summarize, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: N, W, NW, S, SW, B.

Actually, wait, I need to be more careful. Let's check if all of those are valid.

1. N: Since x is above y, and y is below z, is x necessarily below z? No, because x could be higher than z. So N is possible.

2. W: Since x is to the left of y, and z spans the width of y, is x necessarily to the left of z? Yes, but z might not extend much to the right, meaning x and z could have overlapping y-projections. So W is possible.

3. NW: Similar to the above, x could be both to the left and above z. So NW is possible.

4. S: Since x is above y, and y is below z, can x be below z? If z extends very high, and x doesn't, then yes, x could be below z. So S is possible.

5. SW: Can x be both to the left and below z? Again, if z extends high, this is possible. So SW is possible.

6. B: Can x be inside the bounding box of z? From the constraints, I can't rule this out. So B is possible.

So, all of N, W, NW, S, SW, B are possible cardinal direction relations for x relative to z, and E, NE, SE are not possible.

Actually, I want to make sure we aren't missing anything:
7. E: Can x be to the right of z?

For this, supx(z) <= infx(x) would need to be true.

From the constraints, supx(x) <= infx(y) (x is to the left of y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (z spans at least the width of y).

If supx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= infx(y), then supx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x) <= infx(y).

This would mean supx(z) <= infx(y). But we also know supx(y) <= supx(z), so supx(y) <= supx(z) <= infx(y), which implies supx(y) <= infx(y). This is a contradiction for a valid region.

So, x can't be E of z.

8. NE: Can x be to the right and above z?

I've already shown that x can't be to the right of z, so x can't be NE of z either.

9. SE: Can x be to the right and below z?

Similarly, since x can't be to the right of z, x can't be SE of z either.

So, to finalize, the possible cardinal direction relations for x relative to z are: N, W, NW, S, SW, B.

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y (x NW y)
- Region y is S of region z (y S z)

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely to the north of y)

From y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is completely to the south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

To determine the relation between x and z, I need to consider these constraints:

For x E z (or NE or SE): 
This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x), but from our constraints we can derive: supx(y) ≤ supx(z) and supx(x) ≤ infx(y), which would lead to supx(y) ≤ infx(y) - a contradiction. So x cannot be E, NE, or SE of z.

For the remaining relations:
- N: x can be above z
- W: x can be to the west of z
- NW: x can be to the northwest of z
- S: x can be below z (if z extends high enough)
- SW: x can be to the southwest of z
- B: x can be inside z's bounding box

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, W, NW, S, SW, B
