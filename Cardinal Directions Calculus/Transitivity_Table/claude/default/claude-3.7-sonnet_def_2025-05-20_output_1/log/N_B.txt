PROMPT: If region x is N of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze the relations we have:
- x is N of y
- y is B of z

First, let's understand what these relations mean:

x is N of y means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

This means x is completely to the north of y, and x's projection on the x-axis is contained within y's projection on the x-axis.

y is B of z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

This means y is completely inside the minimum bounding box of z.

Now, let's find the possible relations between x and z.

First, let's determine the y-coordinate relationship:
- We know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y)
- We know supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z)

But this doesn't tell us directly about the relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

For the x-coordinate:
- We know infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
- We know infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

Combining these, we get:
infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

So, x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection on the x-axis.

Now, let's consider the possible positions of x relative to z:

1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is to the north of z, so x N z.

2. If infy(x) <= supy(z), then x might overlap with z in the y-dimension. Since x is to the north of y and y is inside z, x could be in several positions relative to z:
   - If x is completely inside z, then x B z.
   - If x overlaps with the northern part of z, then x N z.
   - If x overlaps with the northeastern part of z, then possibly x NE z.
   - If x overlaps with the northwestern part of z, then possibly x NW z.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Since y is B of z, it means y is completely inside z. Since x is N of y, it means x is completely to the north of y. But since z can extend further north than y, x could be in various positions relative to z.

Let's visualize this with a diagram. Let's say z is the outermost region, y is inside z, and x is to the north of y.

```
    x
   ---
  |   |
   ---
    |
   ---
  |   |  y
   ---
    |
   ---------
  |         |
  |   z     |
  |         |
   ---------
```

In this diagram, x is N of z. But if z extends further north:

```
   ---------
  |         |
  |  x      |
  |    z    |
  |  y      |
  |         |
   ---------
```

In this diagram, x is B of z. And if z doesn't completely contain x:

```
   ---
  | x |
   ---
    |
   ---------
  |    |    |
  |  y z    |
  |         |
   ---------
```

Here, x could be N, NW, or NE of z, depending on how x's x-coordinates relate to z's x-coordinates.

Given that y is B of z, it means z's minimum bounding box contains y. And since x is N of y, the possible relations between x and z could be:

- x N z (if x is completely to the north of z)
- x NW z (if x is to the northwest of z)
- x NE z (if x is to the northeast of z)
- x B z (if x is inside z's minimum bounding box)

But there's a constraint from our derivation earlier: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). This means x's projection on the x-axis is contained within z's projection on the x-axis.

So, the possible relations could be:
- x N z
- x B z

So the possible relationships are N and B.

Actually, I need to check this more carefully. I made an error. Let's reconsider.

We have:
- x is N of y means: supy(y) <= infy(x), infx(y) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(y)
- y is B of z means: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), and supy(y) <= supy(z)

Let's combine these:
From x N y and y B z, we know:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

But we can't directly derive any relationship between infy(x) and supy(z).

For the x-coordinates:
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y)
- infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z)

Combining these, we get:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

From the above, we can infer that x's projection on the x-axis is within z's projection on the x-axis, meaning infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

Now, for the possible relations between x and z:

1. If infy(x) > supy(z), then x is strictly to the north of z, so x N z.

2. If infy(x) <= supy(z), then we need to consider the relationship in the y-dimension more carefully. 

Since from y B z, we know: infy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

And from x N y, we know: supy(y) <= infy(x)

Combining these, we get: supy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(y) <= supy(z)

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z). So, the range of possibilities is:

- x could be completely north of z, so x N z.
- x could be inside the bounding box of z, so x B z.

Given the constraints on the x-coordinates (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)), x can't be in the northeast (NE), east (E), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), west (W), or northwest (NW) of z. This is because for these directions, the x-coordinate constraints would be violated.

So, the possible relations seem to be just N and B.

But I need to double check! Let's confirm if N and B are the only possibilities.

Actually, let's directly use the definitions from the problem to check the possible relations between x and z.

1. x N z:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) from our derivation. But we need to check if supy(z) <= infy(x) can hold.

   From y B z, we know supy(y) <= supy(z).
   From x N y, we know supy(y) <= infy(x).

   So, it's possible that supy(z) > infy(x) (e.g., z extends further north than y, possibly overlapping with x). And it's also possible that supy(z) <= infy(x) (z doesn't extend too far north).

   If supy(z) <= infy(x), then x N z is valid.

2. x B z:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) from our derivation. 
   For the y-coordinates, we know supy(y) <= infy(x) from x N y. We know infy(z) <= infy(y) from y B z. We get infx(z) <= infx(y) <= .... This doesn't directly give us a relationship between infy(z) and infy(x).

   If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), then x B z is valid.

I've been overcomplicating this. Let me simplify and consider concrete examples.

Consider the following setup:
- z is a large region.
- y is a smaller region completely inside z (so y B z).
- x is a region north of y (so x N y).

With this setup, several scenarios are possible:
1. x could be completely north of both y and z, in which case x N z.
2. x could be inside z (but north of y), in which case x B z.
3. If z is not as tall as it is wide, and x extends to the west or east beyond z's boundaries but is still north of y, then x could be NW or NE of z.

Wait, but I said earlier that "From the above, we can infer that x's projection on the x-axis is within z's projection on the x-axis, meaning infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)". This would rule out the NW and NE cases. But did I deduce this correctly?

From x N y, we know: infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y).
From y B z, we know: infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z).

Combining these, we get: infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z).

So we have: infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z).

This indeed confirms that x's projection on the x-axis is within z's projection on the x-axis. So, the possible relations are N and B, and not NW or NE.

But now, let me check all the cardinal direction relations based on the problem's definition:

1. x B z:
   This means:
   - infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)

   From our derivation, we know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But for y-coordinates, we only know supy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y). This doesn't guarantee that infy(z) <= infy(x). So, x B z is possible but not guaranteed.

2. x S z:
   This means:
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   But we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y), so x is above y. And since y is inside z, it's not possible for x to be south of z. So, x S z is not possible.

3. x SW z:
   This means:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   But we know infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) (from our derivation), so supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible. So, x SW z is not possible.

4. x W z:
   This means:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   But as with SW, infx(z) <= infx(x) means supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible. So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z:
   This means:
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   But infx(z) <= infx(x) means supx(x) <= infx(z) is not possible. So, x NW z is not possible.

6. x N z:
   This means:
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

   We know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) from our derivation. For supy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have direct derivation, but it's possible depending on how far north z extends.

7. x NE z:
   This means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)

   But we know supx(x) <= supx(z) from our derivation, which means supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible. So, x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z:
   This means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

   But as with NE, supx(x) <= supx(z) means supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible. So, x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z:
   This means:
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)

   But as with E, supx(x) <= supx(z) means supx(z) <= infx(x) is not possible. And, similar to the S direction, supy(x) <= infy(z) is not likely if x is north of y and y is inside z. So, x SE z is not possible.

Ah, wait. I think I've been misusing the derived relations. Let me double check.

From x N y, we know: 
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining these:
- supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and supy(y) <= supy(z) (from y B z), but this doesn't directly tell us about the relation between infy(x) and supy(z).
- infx(y) <= infx(x) (from x N y) and infx(z) <= infx(y) (from y B z), which gives us infx(z) <= infx(x).
- supx(x) <= supx(y) (from x N y) and supx(y) <= supx(z) (from y B z), which gives us supx(x) <= supx(z).

So, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Now, for the possible relations:

1. x B z:
This means infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
We have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). We don't have direct relations for infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But it's possible if z extends sufficiently north.

2. x S z:
This means supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). But we know supy(y) <= infy(x) (from x N y) and infy(z) <= infy(y) (from y B z), giving us infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x). This means infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z), so x S z is not possible.

3. x SW z:
This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
But we derived infx(z) <= infx(x), which means infx(z) <= supx(x) (as infx(x) <= supx(x)), contradicting supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x SW z is not possible.

4. x W z:
This means supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
As with SW, this contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x W z is not possible.

5. x NW z:
This means supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
As with W, this contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x). So, x NW z is not possible.

6. x N z:
This means supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
We have infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). For supy(z) <= infy(x), we don't have a direct relation, but it's possible depending on how far north z extends.

7. x NE z:
This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
But we derived supx(x) <= supx(z), which means infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), contradicting supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x NE z is not possible.

8. x E z:
This means supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
As with NE, this contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z). So, x E z is not possible.

9. x SE z:
This means supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
This contradicts both our relations. So, x SE z is not possible.

So, based on our derived relations, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- x B z (if z extends sufficiently north)
- x N z (if z doesn't extend too far north)

Actually, wait. Let me take an alternate approach:

x N y means:
- supy(y) <= infy(x)
- infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y)

y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Given the three regions x, y, and z, I'll reason about different scenarios and see which cardinal direction relation applies for x and z:

1. If supy(z) <= infy(x) (which is possible, especially if z doesn't extend too far north), and given that infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), we have x N z.

2. If infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z) (which is possible, especially if z extends sufficiently north), and given the same x-coordinate relationships, we have x B z.

In the previous reasoning, I wasn't able to derive direct relationships for infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z), so both N and B relations are possible depending on the exact positions of x, y, and z.

Let's also consider potential edge cases to see if any other directions are possible.

First, could x potentially be in the NE, NW, SW, SE, E, W, or S of z? 

For x to be in any of these directions, specific relations must hold:
- NE: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- NW: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- SW: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- SE: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- E: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- W: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- S: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)

But from our derived relations, we have:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For NE and SE, the relation supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) (because if supx(x) <= supx(z), then infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z)).
For NW, SW, and W, the relation supx(x) <= infx(z) contradicts infx(z) <= infx(x) (because if infx(z) <= infx(x), then infx(z) <= infx(x) <= supx(x)).
For S, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z). But given that x is N of y (so supy(y) <= infy(x)) and y is B of z (so infy(z) <= infy(y)), we can derive infy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x).  This means infy(z) <= infy(x). For the relation supy(x) <= infy(z) to be true, we need infy(x) <= supy(x) <= infy(z). But this would contradict the earlier relationship infy(z) <= infy(x). 
For E, the relation supx(z) <= infx(x) contradicts what I just derived.

So, the only possible relations are:
- x B z (if the y-coordinates align in a way that x is inside z)
- x N z (if the y-coordinates align in a way that x is north of z)

What about other multi-tile cardinal direction relations? Given that x's projection on the x-axis is within z's projection on the x-axis, if x has parts that are both inside z and to the north of z, it would be a multi-tile relation. If a region has parts that are:
- Inside the minimum bounding box of a reference region, and
- To the north of the reference region,
then it would be described as having a "B:N" relation with the reference region.

Let me check this:
If some part of x is B of z (inside the minimum bounding box of z) and another part is N of z (to the north of z), then we might have a multi-tile relation like B:N. 

But wait, in the problem description, it's given that:
"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

This suggests that multi-tile relations are permissible. But in the context of the question, it's asking for the possible relations between region x and region z. If x is a "region" that's homeomorphic to the closed unit disk (as defined in the problem), then x must be connected. This means x doesn't have separate parts; it's a single connected region.

Given the derived relations and the assumption that x is a single connected region, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- x B z (if x is completely inside the minimum bounding box of z)
- x N z (if x is completely to the north of z)

My final answer is: The possible relations between region x and region z are B and N. There could also be a multi-tile relation B:N, but I'm really skeptical about this.

Actually, wait. Let me make sure whether a single region (like x) can have a multi-tile relation with respect to a reference region (like z). If a single region straddles multiple tiles with respect to a reference region, would it be described as having a multi-tile relation?

According to the problem definition, a cardinal direction relation R1: ... : Rk is defined by regions a1, ..., ak, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b). This suggests that a single region a could be divided into regions a1, ..., ak, and each a_i belongs to Ri(b).

So, if a region x straddles, for instance, the bounding box tile and the north tile with respect to z, it could be described as having a B:N relation with z. This is because x can be divided into two regions: x1 which is B of z, and x2 which is N of z.

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- x B z (if x is completely inside the minimum bounding box of z)
- x N z (if x is completely to the north of z)
- x B:N z (if x straddles the bounding box tile and the north tile with respect to z)

Hmm, I'm less sure about this again. Let me try to understand the problem statement more clearly. 

In the problem, we're given:
"A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG."

Let's break this down:
- A cardinal direction relation is an expression like `R1:R2:...Rk`.
- Each Ri is one of the cardinal directions (B, S, SW, etc.).
- For a cardinal direction relation `R1:R2:...Rk` from region a to region b, region a can be partitioned into regions a1, a2, ..., ak such that:
  - a1 is in the relation R1 to b
  - a2 is in the relation R2 to b
  - and so on…
  - and the union of a1, a2, …, ak is a valid region.

In this problem we're asked for the possible relations between region x and region z. Given that we know x is N of y and y is B of z.

Wait, I think I have a better understanding now. I think the problem is actually asking for all possible cardinal direction relations, which could be a single cardinal direction or a multi-tile cardinal direction.

In the given problem, we have regions x, y, and z, and we know that x is N of y and y is B of z. We want to find all possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

From our derivation, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- x can either be completely B of z, completely N of z, or straddle the B and N regions with respect to z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
- x B z
- x N z
- x B:N z

But wait, I've made an error in multi-tile reasoning. Let me recheck:
If a region x has a part in the N relation of z and another part in the B relation of z, then we would say that x has a N:B relation with z. 

The multi-tile direction relation `R1: ... :Rk` describes the relation where a region is partitioned into k sub-regions, each in relation R1, ..., Rk with a reference region. If x has a part in the B relation and another part in the N relation, then we say x has a B:N relation or N:B relation. The order of the cardinal directions in the relation notation might depends on a canonical order, but i think based on how they're listed in the problem it would be B:N.

But actually, rereading the problem statement, it seems that the regions {a1, ..., ak} don't have to be a partition of a. They could be a cover of a or some other decomposition. I'm not certain. However, I'll assume that for a multi-tile relation R1:...Rk, there exists some decomposition of the primary region into regions {a1, ..., ak} such that a1 has relation R1 to the reference region, and so on.

Let's redo the checking:

From our derived relations, we know:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

So, the possible cardinal direction relations (including multi-tile) between x and z are:
- x B z (if x is completely inside the minimum bounding box of z)
- x N z (if x is completely to the north of z)
- x B:N z (if x straddles the bounding box and the north tiles with respect to z)

I don't think any other multi-tile relations are possible given the constraints.

Wait, I'm osciallating again..., let me just look at what's the most likely interpretation.

A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where:
i) 1 <= k <= 9
ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}
iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j
(iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

The (iv) clause suggests that a cardinal direction relation R1: ... : Rk provides a way to break up a region into multiple regions, based on the cardinal direction relations with a reference region.

For example, a region a could be in relation B:N with region b if:
- a can be broken down into regions a1 and a2.
- a1 is in relation B with b.
- a2 is in relation N with b.
- a1 union a2 is a valid region (i.e., it's homeomorphic to the closed unit disk).

In our problem we're trying to find the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is N of y and y is B of z. The constraints we derived are:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

Based on these, the possible relations between x and z could be:
- x B z (if x is completely inside the minimum bounding box of z)
- x N z (if x is completely to the north of z)
- x B:N z (if x can be broken down into regions x1 and x2, where x1 is B of z and x2 is N of z, and x1 union x2 is a valid region)

Now, is a multi-tile relation like B:N achievable for a single region? if it is contiguous?

The whole point of the multi-tile relations in this model is to handle cases where a region straddles multiple tiles with respect to a reference region!

So yes, B:N is definitely possible and i'm confident that the possible relations between x and z based on the given conditions are:
- B
- N
- B:N

Actually, wait. One more way to check this. Let me look at some visualization examples:

Suppose we have the situation where x is N of y and y is B of z, and x is B of z:
```
   -----------
  |           |
  |     x     |
  |     |     |
  |     y     |
  |           |
  |     z     |
  |           |
   -----------
```

In this diagram, x is completely inside the minimum bounding box of z, so x B z.

Now, let's consider a scenario where x is N of y and y is B of z, and x is N of z:
```
     -----
    |  x  |
     -----
        |
   -----------
  |     |     |
  |     y     |
  |           |
  |     z     |
  |           |
   -----------
```

In this case, x is completely to the north of z, so x N z.

Finally, let's look at a scenario where x straddles the bounding box and the north tiles with respect to z:
```
     -----
    |  x  |
     -----
        |
   -----------
  |     |     |
  |     x     |
  |     |     |
  |     y     |
  |           |
  |     z     |
  |           |
   -----------
```

In this case, part of x is inside the bounding box of z, and part of x is to the north of z. So, x B:N z.

But wait, could x also be in a different multi-tile relation with z? For example, could x be in relation B:NW or B:NE? 

Let's check based on the constraints we derived:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For x to have a relation B:NW with z, it would mean that part of x is inside the bounding box of z, and part of x is to the northwest of z. For a region to be NW of another region, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But from our derived relations, we can't have supx(x) <= infx(z), as infx(z) <= infx(x) means infx(z) <= supx(x). So, B:NW is not possible.

Similarly, for B:NE, we'd need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But supx(x) <= supx(z) means infx(x) <= supx(x) <= supx(z), contradicting supx(z) <= infx(x). So, B:NE is not possible.

Let's check for a few more possible multi-tile relations:
- B:S would mean part of x is inside the bounding box of z, and part of x is to the south of z. But since x is N of y and y is B of z, it's unlikely that x would extend to the south of z. I think we can rule out any relation that includes S, SE, or SW. Let's try to visualize a counterexample:
```
     -----
    |  x  |
     -----
        |
   -----------
  |     |     |
  |     y     |
  |           |
  |     z     |
  |           |
   -----------
       |
       -
      | |
      | |
      |x|
       -
```
But this would violate the condition that x is N of y, because a part of x would be to the south of y, which would make the overall relation between x and y not a simple N but a multi-tile relation like N:S, which isn't the given relation in the problem.

- B:W and B:E would mean parts of x are to the west or east of z, respectively. But our derived condition says that x's projection on the x-axis is within z's projection on the x-axis, which means x can't extend to the west or east of z. So, B:W and B:E are not possible.

Alright, so the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- B
- N
- B:N

Are there any other possible multi-tile combinations? I think I've exhausted the direct ones, but let's consider more complex combinations:
- B:N:NW? This means parts of x are inside z, to the north of z, and to the northwest of z. But as I just derived, the NW relation is not possible due to our constraints. So, this combination is not possible.
- B:N:NE? Similarly, the NE relation is not possible.
- B:N:E or B:N:W? The E and W relations are not possible due to our constraints.
- B:N:S, B:N:SE, or B:N:SW? As I discussed, any relation involving S, SE, or SW is unlikely given the context of the problem.

So, I'm really confident that the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- B
- N
- B:N

And now, finally to double check let me enumerate and verify all the ways a region could be situated if it has regions x is N of y and y is B of z:

Possible configurations would be:
- B: x is completely inside the bounding box of z.
- N: x is completely to the north of z.
- B:N: x straddles both the bounding box and north regions with respect to z.

Given the constraints derived from the conditions (infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)), none of the other cardinal direction relations or multi-tile combinations are permissible. This is because x cannot extend beyond z in the x-direction, eliminating possibilities involving W, NW, E, NE, etc. And it's unlikely for x to be to the south of z since x is to the north of y, which is inside z.

Alright, my final answer for the possible relations between region x and region z, given that x is N of y and y is B of z, is:
- B
- N
- B:N

ANSWER:

The possible relations between region x and region z are:

- N (North): This occurs when x is completely to the north of z
- B (Bounding box): This occurs when x is completely inside z
- B:N: This occurs when part of x is inside z and part of x extends north of z

The relation cannot involve E, W, NE, NW, S, SE, or SW because:
- From x N y and y B z, we can derive that infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- This means x's x-coordinate projection must be contained within z's x-coordinate projection
- This constraint eliminates any cardinal direction that would require x to extend beyond z in the east or west directions
