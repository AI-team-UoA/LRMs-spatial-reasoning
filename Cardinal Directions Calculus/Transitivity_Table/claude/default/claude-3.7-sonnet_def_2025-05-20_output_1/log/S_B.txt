PROMPT: If region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. Region x is S of region y
   - This means that supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
   - In other words, x is entirely to the south of y, and the x-projection of x is within the x-projection of y.

2. Region y is B of region z
   - This means that infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   - In other words, y is entirely inside the bounding box of z.

Now, we need to determine the possible relations between x and z.

Since y is B of z, y is inside z's bounding box. Since x is S of y, x is below y. But the relationship between x and z depends on the exact positions of these regions.

Let's consider all the possible relations:

1. B (x is inside z's bounding box):
   For this to happen, we would need:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   
   Given that infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x is S of y), and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from y is B of z), we have:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
   
   So, the x-coordinate conditions for B are met.
   
   But for the y-coordinates, we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x is S of y), and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y is B of z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(z) and infy(x), or between supy(x) and supy(z).
   
   If infy(z) is low enough to be below or equal to infy(x), and if supy(z) is high enough to be above or equal to supy(x), then B could be a possible relation. But this is not guaranteed from the given conditions.

2. S (x is to the south of z):
   For this to happen, we would need:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   
   Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x is S of y), and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y is B of z), we can't conclude whether supy(x) ≤ infy(z). It could be that infy(z) is even lower than supy(x), making this relation impossible.
   
   But, as we've established above, the x-coordinate conditions (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) are met.
   
   If infy(z) is high enough to be above supy(x), then S could be a possible relation.

3. SW (x is to the southwest of z):
   For this to happen, we would need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   
   Given that supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x is S of y), and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y is B of z), there's no clear relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). It could be that supx(x) > infx(z), making this relation impossible.
   
   Similarly, given that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x is S of y), and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y is B of z), there's no clear relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). It could be that supy(x) > infy(z), making this relation impossible.
   
   If supx(x) is small enough to be to the left of infx(z), and if infy(z) is high enough to be above supy(x), then SW could be a possible relation.

4. W (x is to the west of z):
   For this to happen, we would need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   
   Given that supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (from x is S of y), and infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y is B of z), there's no clear relationship between supx(x) and infx(z). It could be that supx(x) > infx(z), making this relation impossible.
   
   Given that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x is S of y), and infy(y) ≤ supy(y) (since y is a valid region), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y is B of z), we have:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   
   But there's no clear relationship between infy(z) and infy(x). It could be that infy(z) > infy(x), making this relation impossible.
   
   If supx(x) is small enough to be to the left of infx(z), and if infy(z) is low enough to be below or equal to infy(x), then W could be a possible relation.

5. NW (x is to the northwest of z):
   For this to happen, we would need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   
   The first condition is the same as for W, and as we've established, there's no clear relationship between supx(x) and infx(z).
   
   For the second condition, given that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x is S of y), and infy(y) ≤ supy(y) (since y is a valid region), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from y is B of z), we have:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   
   This means infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (since infy(x) ≤ supy(x) for any valid region). This contradicts the condition supy(z) ≤ infy(x) required for NW.
   
   So, NW is not a possible relation.

Hmm, I made an error above. Let's think about this differently, and more precisely.

1. Region x is S of region y:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x doesn't extend farther left than y)
   - supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x doesn't extend farther right than y)

2. Region y is B of region z:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y doesn't extend farther left than z)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y doesn't extend farther right than z)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y doesn't extend farther down than z)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend farther up than z)

Now, let's deduce the relationship between x and z by combining these constraints:

From 1 and 2:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x doesn't extend farther left than z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x doesn't extend farther right than z)

This rules out some relations immediately.

From 1 and 2:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from 1)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from 2)

There's no direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z), which is crucial for determining some of the directions.

Let's consider each of the 9 possible cardinal directions relations:

1. B (x is inside z's bounding box): 
   - Need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our deductions, the first two conditions are met, but we're uncertain about the third. The fourth condition is implied from supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). So, B is possible if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

2. S (x is south of z): 
   - Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - From our deductions, the last two conditions are met, but we're uncertain about the first. So, S is possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

3. SW (x is southwest of z): 
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - From our deductions, we're uncertain about both conditions. So, SW is possible if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

4. W (x is west of z): 
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our deductions, the last condition is met (as mentioned in 1), but we're uncertain about the first two. So, W is possible if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

5. NW (x is northwest of z): 
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From our deductions, we're uncertain about the first condition. For the second condition, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from 1) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from 2). This gives us supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). For a valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x), so infy(x) ≤ supy(z). This contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x). So, NW is not possible.

6. N (x is north of z): 
   - Need: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - From our deductions, the last two conditions are met, but the first condition leads to a contradiction (as we established in 5). So, N is not possible.

7. NE (x is northeast of z): 
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From our deductions, for the first condition, we have infx(x) ≤ supx(x), which gives us supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x). But we also have supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which gives us supx(z) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), implying supx(x) = supx(z). But then, for the first condition to be met, we would need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which then gives us supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) = supx(z), implying infx(x) = supx(x) = supx(z), which is only possible if x is a vertical line, which contradicts our assumption that x is in REG. So, NE is not possible.

8. E (x is east of z): 
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our deductions, the last condition is met, but the first condition leads to a contradiction (as we established in 7). So, E is not possible.

9. SE (x is southeast of z): 
   - Need: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - From our deductions, the first condition leads to a contradiction (as we established in 7). So, SE is not possible.

Let me re-examine this, as I'm making errors in the analysis.

Actually, I believe my logic in 7. was flawed. From our deductions, we have:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from 1 and 2)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (from 1 and 2)

This doesn't force supx(x) = supx(z). Let me reconsider each of the 9 possible cardinal directions:

1. B (x is inside z's bounding box): 
   - Need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our deductions, the first two conditions are met, and the fourth condition is implied from supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). So, B is possible if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

2. S (x is south of z): 
   - Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - From our deductions, the last two conditions are met. So, S is possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

3. SW (x is southwest of z): 
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - From infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from our deductions), and since infx(x) ≤ supx(x) for any valid region, we have infx(z) ≤ supx(x). This doesn't necessarily contradict the first condition, so it's indeterminate. So, SW is possible if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

4. W (x is west of z): 
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our deductions, the last condition is met. As established in 3, the first condition is indeterminate. So, W is possible if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

5. NW (x is northwest of z): 
   - Need: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - From our deductions, for the second condition, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from 1) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from 2). This gives us supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z). For a valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x), so infy(x) ≤ supy(z). This means either infy(x) < supy(z) or infy(x) = supy(z). If infy(x) < supy(z), then it contradicts the requirement supy(z) ≤ infy(x). If infy(x) = supy(z), then supy(z) = infy(x). But, for a valid region, infy(x) < supy(x) (otherwise it would be a line, not a disk), so supy(z) < supy(x). This contradicts the deduction supy(x) ≤ supy(z) from B.

   Wait, let me think about this again. We have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from 1) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from 2). This doesn't directly give a relationship between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). The only relation we can directly infer is that supy(x) ≤ infy(y), but this doesn't necessarily mean supy(x) ≤ supy(z). So I made an error in my analysis.

   Let's go back to the definition. For NW, we need:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x doesn't extend right past the left edge of z)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z doesn't extend up past the bottom edge of x)

   From Region x is S of region y, we know:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x doesn't extend up past the bottom edge of y)

   From Region y is B of region z, we know:
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y doesn't extend down past the bottom edge of z)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend up past the top edge of z)

   So we have:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x is S of y)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y is B of z)

   This gives:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

   But this doesn't directly tell us the relation between supy(x) and infy(z) or between supy(x) and supy(z). So the second condition for NW, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), is indeterminate. So NW is possible if supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

   Actually, if we look at the conditions for 1. and 5., we have contradicting conditions:

   From 1. (B): supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   From 5. (NW): supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

   Since infy(x) ≤ supy(x) for any valid region, if both conditions were true, we would have supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which means supy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x) = supy(z). For a valid region, infy(x) < supy(x) (otherwise it would be a line, not a disk), so this is a contradiction.

   But I'm making a mistake again: the conditions for B are only required if the relation is actually B. Similarly for NW. So I can't conclude a contradiction from them.

I think I am confusing myself. Let me take a step back and think more carefully, reason case by case.

Let's define region z with its bounding box delimited by lines x = infx(z), x = supx(z), y = infy(z), and y = supy(z). This divides the plane into 9 areas, corresponding to the 9 cardinal directions: B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, and SE.

Given that "region x is S of region y", we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x doesn't extend farther left than y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x doesn't extend farther right than y)

Given that "region y is B of region z", we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y doesn't extend farther left than z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y doesn't extend farther right than z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y doesn't extend farther down than z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend farther up than z)

From the above, we can deduce:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x doesn't extend farther left than z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x doesn't extend farther right than z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is at most as far down as y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)

Let's check which of the 9 cardinal directions are possible for x relative to z:

1. B (x is inside z's bounding box): 
   - Conditions: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - From our deductions, the first two conditions are met. The fourth is implied by supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z).
   - The third condition, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), is not guaranteed from our deductions. It's possible if z extends far enough down.
   So, B is a possible relation if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

2. S (x is south of z): 
   - Conditions: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - From our deductions, the last two conditions are met.
   - The first condition, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), is not guaranteed. It's possible if z doesn't extend too far down.
   So, S is a possible relation if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

3. SW (x is southwest of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The second condition is the same as the first condition for S, which is not guaranteed.
   - The first condition is not guaranteed either, given that infx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   So, SW could be a possible relation if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

4. W (x is west of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - The first condition is not guaranteed, as mentioned in SW.
   - The third condition is met, as deduced from B.
   - The second condition is not guaranteed, as mentioned in B.
   So, W is a possible relation if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

5. NW (x is northwest of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - The first condition is not guaranteed, as mentioned in SW.
   - The second condition, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), is not guaranteed. It's possible if z doesn't extend too far up.
   So, NW is a possible relation if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

6. N (x is north of z): 
   - Conditions: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The last two conditions are met, as deduced.
   - The first condition is not guaranteed, as mentioned in NW.
   So, N is a possible relation if supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

7. NE (x is northeast of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - The second condition is not guaranteed, as mentioned in NW.
   - The first condition contradicts our deduction infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
   So, NE is not a possible relation.

8. E (x is east of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - The first condition contradicts our deduction, so E is not a possible relation.

9. SE (x is southeast of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The first condition contradicts our deduction, so SE is not a possible relation.

From my analysis, the possible relations are:
- B (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- S (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
- SW (if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
- W (if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- NW (if both supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- N (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

Now I realize I'm still making some mistakes in the analysis because these possibilities are not all consistent with each other. Let's see what's going wrong.

Actually, wait a second. We have infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z). So, there's no way that supx(x) ≤ infx(z) which is needed for SW, W, and NW. This means:
- SW, W, and NW are not possible.

Now the possible relations are:
- B (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- S (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
- N (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

But N and S seem contradictory...

Let's think about this more carefully:

From our deductions:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is at most as far down as y)

Combined, this gives us:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). Depending on the actual positions, supy(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z).

Similarly, from:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y doesn't extend farther up than z)

This gives us:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

So, supy(x) ≤ supy(z). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infy(x) and supy(z). Depending on the actual positions, supy(z) could be less than, equal to, or greater than infy(x).

Let's reconsidering the conditions more carefully:

We have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) from "x is S of y", and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) from "y is B of z". Actually, this tells us that infy(z) ≤ infy(y) which directly gives us no information about infy(z) relative to supy(x). It could be that supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (as in S) or that infy(z) < supy(x) (not S). 

Similarly, we have supy(y) ≤ supy(z) from "y is B of z", and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) from "x is S of y". This tells us that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), or simply supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Now, for any valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x), so infy(x) ≤ supy(z). But this is consistent with both supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (as in N) and infy(x) < supy(z) (not N).

So, S and N are still potential relations, depending on the specific positions. But they can't both hold for the same configuration, as they have contradicting constraints: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (for S) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (for N).

I believe the correct answer is:
- B (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) - note: the second condition is always true given our deductions.
- S (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
- N (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

But actually, the condition for N, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), combined with the deduction supy(x) ≤ supy(z), gives: supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x). For a valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x), so this would mean supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), implying supy(x) = supy(z) = infy(x). But infy(x) < supy(x) for a valid region, which leads to a contradiction. So, N is not a possible relation.

I think I'm struggling a bit to maintain a clear line of reasoning. Let's carefully go through each of the 9 possible cardinal directions again, one by one:

1. B (x is inside z's bounding box): 
   - Conditions: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - We've already established the first two conditions.
   - For the third condition, we've seen that it's not guaranteed from our deductions, but it could be true if z extends far enough down.
   - For the fourth condition, from our deductions, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z), and the fourth condition is met.
   So, B is a possible relation if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

2. S (x is south of z): 
   - Conditions: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The last two conditions are already established from our deductions.
   - For the first condition, from our deductions, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y). This doesn't give us a direct relationship between supy(x) and infy(z). Depending on the exact positions, supy(x) could be less than, equal to, or greater than infy(z). So the first condition is not guaranteed, but it could be true.
   So, S is a possible relation if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

3. SW (x is southwest of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - For the first condition, our deductions tell us infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ supx(x). This contradicts the first condition, which requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z).
   So, SW is not a possible relation.

4. W (x is west of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - The first condition is contradicted by our deductions, just as in SW.
   So, W is not a possible relation.

5. NW (x is northwest of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - The first condition is contradicted by our deductions, just as in SW.
   So, NW is not a possible relation.

6. N (x is north of z): 
   - Conditions: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The last two conditions are already established from our deductions.
   - For the first condition, from our deductions, we have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Also, for a valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x). Combining these, we get infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which means infy(x) ≤ supy(z). This contradicts the first condition, which requires supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
   So, N is not a possible relation.

7. NE (x is northeast of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - For the first condition, our deductions tell us infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z), which means infx(x) ≤ supx(z). This contradicts the first condition, which requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x).
   - Additionally, the second condition is contradicted just as in N.
   So, NE is not a possible relation.

8. E (x is east of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - The first condition is contradicted, just as in NE.
   So, E is not a possible relation.

9. SE (x is southeast of z): 
   - Conditions: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - The first condition is contradicted, just as in NE.
   So, SE is not a possible relation.

Alright, so from our complete analysis, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- B (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- S (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z))

So, given that region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are B or S, depending on the exact positions of the regions.

Thinking more about this, actually even B and S might be considered mutually exclusive in this context, because:

For B, we require infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (among other conditions).
For S, we require supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (among other conditions).

If both were possible for the same configuration, we would have:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) from B's condition
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) from S's condition

Combining, we get:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x)

But for a valid region, infy(x) ≤ supy(x). So, this would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), or supy(x) = infy(z) = infy(x) = supy(x). This implies infy(x) = supy(x), which means x would be a horizontal line, contrary to our assumption that it's in REG.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. The conditions for B and S are for different scenarios. If the relation is B, then infy(z) ≤ infy(x). If the relation is S, then supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

These don't have to both be true for the same configuration. Depending on the relative positions, either B or S could be the relation.

So, I still conclude that the possible relations between region x and region z are B or S.

Actually, let's try tracing out some simple examples with diagrams to help clarify. Since I can't draw in text, let me just describe a few scenarios...

Scenario 1:
- Region z is a large square covering the entire area.
- Region y is a smaller square inside z (satisfying y is B of z).
- Region x is a square directly below y, outside of z (satisfying x is S of y).
In this case, x would be S of z.

Scenario 2:
- Region z is a large square, but with a chunk missing from the bottom.
- Region y is a smaller square inside z (satisfying y is B of z).
- Region x is a square directly below y, but still inside the bounds of z (satisfying x is S of y).
In this case, x would be B of z.

So based on these examples, the answer seems correct: the possible relations between region x and region z are B or S.

Actually, I think we need to be a bit more careful. While we're working with regions in REG, which are homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, we need to remember that they can be of any shape, not just squares or rectangles.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y.
- Region y is B of region z.

Let's define coordinates:
- z is defined by boundaries at x = infx(z), x = supx(z), y = infy(z), and y = supy(z).
- y is contained within z, with its lower bound at infy(y).
- x is below y, with its upper bound at supy(x) such that supy(x) ≤ infy(y).

Now, for the relation between x and z:

1. For B (x is inside z's bounding box): 
   - Need: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - The first two are met based on our deductions: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z).
   - For the last one, supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
   - The third, infy(z) ≤ infy(x), is not guaranteed. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then the relation is B.
   - If infy(x) < infy(z), then the relation is not B.

2. For S (x is south of z):
   - Need: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
   - The last two are met, as we've seen above.
   - For the first one, supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is not guaranteed from our deductions. If this holds, then the relation is S.
   - If infy(z) < supy(x), then the relation is not S.

Now, let's consider if both B and S can be true simultaneously:

For both to be true, we would need both infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (from B) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (from S).

This would give us:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x)

For a valid region in REG, infy(x) ≤ supy(x). Combining, we get:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x)

This would mean supy(x) = infy(z) = infy(x). But for a region in REG, infy(x) < supy(x), so this is a contradiction.

So, B and S are mutually exclusive: it's either one or the other, based on the specific configuration.

I think the answer is: Given that region x is S of region y and region y is B of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are B or S, but not both for the same configuration.

Actually, let's be precise. The conditions can be mutually exclusive, but that doesn't mean the relations themselves. Let's check once more:

For region x to be S of region z, the condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z) must be met, along with infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The last two are always met, so the relation is S if and only if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

For region x to be B of region z, the condition infy(z) ≤ infy(x) must be met, along with infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). The last three conditions are always met, so the relation is B if and only if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

So, the possible relations between region x and region z are determined by the relative positions of infy(z), infy(x), and supy(x):

- If supy(x) < infy(z), then x is strictly S of z.
- If infy(z) < infy(x), then x is strictly B of z.
- If supy(x) = infy(z) and also (somehow) infy(z) = infy(x), then both conditions for S and B are met. But for a valid region, we know infy(x) < supy(x), so this scenario is mathematically impossible.

Therefore, the only possible relations are strictly S or strictly B, but not both.

Actually, I think I've been overcomplicating this. Let's be really careful and define regions x, y, and z using their bounding boxes:

- Region x: [infx(x), supx(x)] × [infy(x), supy(x)]
- Region y: [infx(y), supx(y)] × [infy(y), supy(y)]
- Region z: [infx(z), supx(z)] × [infy(z), supy(z)]

Given that region x is S of region y, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

Given that region y is B of region z, we have:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining, we get:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's determine what relation x has with z. We can use the definitions (condensing them for clarity):

- B: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- S: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- SW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- W: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- NW: supx(x) ≤ infx(z), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- N: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- NE: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- E: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- SE: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

Let's check each:

For B: 
- Conditions: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
- From our deductions: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), and supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z).
- The only condition not directly given or deduced is infy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- So, B is possible if infy(z) ≤ infy(x).

For S: 
- Conditions: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- From our deductions: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- The only condition not directly given or deduced is supy(x) ≤ infy(z).
- So, S is possible if supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

For SW (and subsequently for W, NW, N, NE, E, SE), from our deductions, infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x doesn't extend as far left as z. But for SW, W, NW, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), or x entirely to the left of z. This can't be true simultaneously with infx(z) ≤ infx(x). Similarly, for NE, E, SE, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), or x entirely to the right of z. This can't be true with supx(x) ≤ supx(z).

So, SW, W, NW, NE, E, and SE are impossible.

For N: 
- Conditions: supy(z) ≤ infy(x), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- From our deductions: infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z).
- We also have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z). This would mean supy(x) ≤ supy(z). Given that infy(x) ≤ supy(x) (for a valid region), we would have infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z), or infy(x) ≤ supy(z). This contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x).
- So, N is impossible.

In summary, only B and S are possible relations, given the constraints. The specific relation depends on the relative positions of infy(z), infy(x), and supy(x).

- If infy(z) ≤ infy(x), then B is a possible relation.
- If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then S is a possible relation.

Can both conditions hold simultaneously? If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then supy(x) ≤ infy(x), which would make x a horizontal line, contrary to the assumption that it's in REG. So, if x is genuinely in REG, it can't be both B and S of z.

So, the possible relations are B or S, with the specific relation depending on the relative positions.

So the answer is B or S.

ANSWER:

To solve this problem, I need to analyze what the given relationships tell us about the possible positions of regions x, z, and then determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Given information:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is B of region z

From the definition of S relation:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x doesn't extend further left than y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x doesn't extend further right than y)

From the definition of B relation:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is within z's left bound)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within z's right bound)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is within z's lower bound)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is within z's upper bound)

Combining these relations:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Now I'll check each possible cardinal direction relation:

The x-coordinate constraints (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)) rule out SW, W, NW, NE, E, and SE, as these require x to be either entirely left or entirely right of z.

For N: We have supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means x cannot be north of z.

This leaves us with two possibilities:

1. B relation: Possible when infy(z) ≤ infy(x), in which case x would be inside z's bounding box.

2. S relation: Possible when supy(x) ≤ infy(z), in which case x would be south of z.

The answer is: B, S
