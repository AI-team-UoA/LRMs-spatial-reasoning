PROMPT: If region x is NE of region y and region y is NE of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's consider the cardinal direction relations NE.

For a NE b, we know that supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a). This means that region a is to the northeast of region b. Specifically, a is both to the east and to the north of b.

Now for our problem:
- x is NE of y, so supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NE of z, so supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

We want to find the possible relations between x and z. Let's use the transitivity of <= to see what we can deduce.

From supx(z) <= infx(y) and infx(y) <= supx(y) (which is true for any region), we get supx(z) <= supx(y).
From supx(y) <= infx(x), we get supx(z) <= infx(x).

From supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= supy(y) (which is true for any region), we get supy(z) <= supy(y).
From supy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(z) <= infy(x).

So we have both supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This means that x is to the northeast of z, or using the notation, x NE z.

But now I realize I'm not being thorough enough. The problem is asking for "possible" relations, which suggests there might be multiple valid answers. Let me think more carefully.

Actually, I jumped to a conclusion too quickly. Let's reconsider.

For x NE y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)

For y NE z, we have:
supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these, we can deduce:
supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x)
So supx(z) <= infx(x)

supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x)
So supy(z) <= infy(x)

Now, with these two conditions, let's check the definition of each cardinal direction relation to see which ones are satisfied.

For x B z, we need:
infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
But we derived supx(z) <= infx(x), which means it's not possible for supx(x) <= supx(z) to also be true. So x B z is not a possible relation.

For x S z, we need:
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
Again, this contradicts our derived condition supx(z) <= infx(x). So x S z is not a possible relation.

For x SW z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
This contradicts our derived condition supx(z) <= infx(x). So x SW z is not a possible relation.

For x W z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
This contradicts our derived condition supx(z) <= infx(x). So x W z is not a possible relation.

For x NW z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
The second condition is consistent with what we derived, but the first condition contradicts our derived condition supx(z) <= infx(x). So x NW z is not a possible relation.

For x N z, we need:
supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z).
The first two conditions are consistent with what we derived, but the third condition contradicts our derived condition supx(z) <= infx(x). So x N z is not a possible relation.

For x NE z, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
Both conditions are consistent with what we derived. So x NE z is a possible relation.

For x E z, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z).
The first two conditions are consistent with what we derived, but we don't know if supy(x) <= supy(z) is true. So x E z could be a possible relation if supy(x) <= supy(z).

For x SE z, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).
The first condition is consistent with what we derived, but the second condition contradicts our derived condition supy(z) <= infy(x) (because for regions, infy(z) <= supy(z), so supy(x) <= infy(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x) would mean supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x), which is only possible if all these are equal, which is not generally true for distinct regions). So x SE z is not a possible relation for distinct regions.

Actually, I made an error. I need to be more careful. Let's redo this.

For x SE z, we need:
supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z).

We know supy(z) <= infy(x) from what we derived. For supy(x) <= infy(z) to also be true, we would need infy(z) >= supy(x) and infy(x) >= supy(z). This is possible if, for example, the z region is much taller than both x and y, such that infy(z) is quite high. 

Actually, let's think about a concrete case. 

Imagine y is at coordinates (1, 1) and is a small square with sides of length 0.1.
z is to the southwest of y, say at coordinates (0, 0), and is a rectangle that's 0.5 wide and 2 tall.
x is to the northeast of y, say at coordinates (2, 2), and is a small square with sides of length 0.1.

Now, for these positions:
infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 0.5, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 2
infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 1.1, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 1.1
infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 2.1, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 2.1

With these coordinates, we have:
y NE z (since 0.5 <= 1 and 2 <= 1 is not true, this isn't correct)

Ok, this particular example doesn't work. Let me choose better coordinates.

Imagine y is at coordinates (1, 1) and is a small square with sides of length 0.1.
z is to the southwest of y, say at coordinates (0, 0), and is a small square with sides of length 0.1.
x is to the northeast of y, say at coordinates (2, 2), and is a small square with sides of length 0.1.

Now, for these positions:
infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 0.1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 0.1
infx(y) = 1, supx(y) = 1.1, infy(y) = 1, supy(y) = 1.1
infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 2.1, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 2.1

With these coordinates, we have:
y NE z (since 0.1 <= 1 and 0.1 <= 1, which is correct)
x NE y (since 1.1 <= 2 and 1.1 <= 2, which is correct)
x NE z (since 0.1 <= 2 and 0.1 <= 2, which is correct)

So, x NE z is a valid relation.

hmm, there are issues still, because I can't seem to discover any other solution other than 'x NE z'. I need to reconstruct my thinking process. Let me try a different approach.

Let me think about the constraints we have on regions x, y, and z, and then I'll reason about the possible cardinal directions from x to z.

For x NE y:
- x is completely to the right of and above y
- supx(y) <= infx(x) means the right edge of y is to the left of the left edge of x
- supy(y) <= infy(x) means the top edge of y is below the bottom edge of x

For y NE z:
- y is completely to the right of and above z
- supx(z) <= infx(y) means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of y
- supy(z) <= infy(y) means the top edge of z is below the bottom edge of y

Given these constraints, what can we say about the relationship between x and z?

Directly from the constraints:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) imply supx(z) <= infx(x), which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) imply supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top edge of z is below the bottom edge of x.

Ok so x is definitely to the right and above Z, but the question is, does it have to be strictly x NE z?

Let's check if x could be related to z by any direction other than NE, given the constraints we have.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x), which we've established is true.
- infx(z) <= infx(x), which means the left edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. This can be true.
- supx(x) <= supx(z), which means the right edge of x is to the left of the right edge of z. But we've established supx(z) <= infx(x), which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. These conditions can't both be true for distinct regions, so x N z is not possible.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which we've established is true.
- supy(z) <= infy(x), which we've established is true.
So x NE z is a possible relation.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), which we've established is true.
- infy(z) <= infy(x), which means the bottom edge of z is below the bottom edge of x. This can be true.
- supy(x) <= supy(z), which means the top edge of x is below the top edge of z. But we've established supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the top edge of z is below the bottom edge of x. These conditions can't both be true for distinct regions, so x E z is not possible.

For x NW z, x W z, x SW z, x S z, and x SE z, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) or supy(x) <= infy(z), which would contradict our established supx(z) <= infx(x) or supy(z) <= infy(x). So these directions are not possible.

For x B z (or x contained in z's bounding box), we would need infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've established supx(z) <= infx(x), which means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x. This contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z), so x B z is not possible.

That again leaves just x NE z, which is consistent with what I said earlier. But I'm really starting to wonder if I'm approaching the problem correctly. The question asks for "possible" relations, which suggests there might be multiple valid answers, but I've only found one. Let me reconsider the problem.

Actually, I think I'm confounding myself. Given the constraints that x is NE of y, and y is NE of z, it does seem like the only possible relation is that x is NE of z. I've checked all cardinal directions and z can only be in the SW direction from x, which means x can only be in the NE direction from z.

But I should be even more methodical. The problem is asking for the possible relations between x and z, which means I need to check all 9 cardinal direction relations. Let's examine them again.

For a B b, we need:
- infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For a S b, we need:
- supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a), and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For a SW b, we need:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

For a W b, we need:
- supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For a NW b, we need:
- supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

For a N b, we need:
- supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a), and supx(a) <= supx(b)

For a NE b, we need:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

For a E b, we need:
- supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a), and supy(a) <= supy(b)

For a SE b, we need:
- supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

Now, let's check the possible cardinal directions from x to z:

We know:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x) imply supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) and supy(y) <= infy(x) imply supy(z) <= infy(x)

For x B z, we need:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we've established supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) for distinct regions.
- So, x B z is not a possible relation.

For x S z, we need:
- supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- But we've established supy(z) <= infy(x), and for distinct regions, infy(z) <= supy(z), which means infy(z) <= infy(x). For supy(x) <= infy(z) to also be true, we would need supy(x) <= infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x), which is not possible for distinct regions unless they're touching in a very specific way.
- Also, we've established supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) for distinct regions.
- So, x S z is not a possible relation.

For x SW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- But we've established supx(z) <= infx(x), and for distinct regions, infx(z) <= supx(z), which means infx(z) <= infx(x). For supx(x) <= infx(z) to also be true, we would need supx(x) <= infx(z) <= supx(z) <= infx(x), which is not possible for distinct regions.
- So, x SW z is not a possible relation.

For x W z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- But we've established supx(z) <= infx(x), and the argument for x SW z applies here as well.
- So, x W z is not a possible relation.

For x NW z, we need:
- supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- But we've established supx(z) <= infx(x), and the argument for x SW z applies here as well.
- So, x NW z is not a possible relation.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- The first two can be true, but we've established supx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= supx(z) for distinct regions.
- So, x N z is not a possible relation.

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
- Both are true from what we've established.
- So, x NE z is a possible relation.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z)
- The first two can be true, but we've established supy(z) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) < supy(x) (because infy(x) < supy(x) for any region). This contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z).
- So, x E z is not a possible relation.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
- The first is true from what we've established. But for the second, we've established supy(z) <= infy(x), which means infy(z) <= supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x) for any regions. This contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z).
- So, x SE z is not a possible relation.

After this thorough check, the only possible cardinal direction relation from x to z is NE, which means x is to the northeast of z (or z is to the southwest of x). So the answer is "NE".

Actually, I want to be even more careful. Let me check a specific example.

Let's set up a coordinate system and place three regions in a way that satisfies the given conditions: x is NE of y, and y is NE of z.

Imagine:
- z is a square with its bottom-left corner at (0, 0) and top-right corner at (1, 1).
- y is a square with its bottom-left corner at (2, 2) and top-right corner at (3, 3).
- x is a square with its bottom-left corner at (4, 4) and top-right corner at (5, 5).

Now we can compute the infx, supx, infy, and supy values for each region:
- For z: infx(z) = 0, supx(z) = 1, infy(z) = 0, supy(z) = 1.
- For y: infx(y) = 2, supx(y) = 3, infy(y) = 2, supy(y) = 3.
- For x: infx(x) = 4, supx(x) = 5, infy(x) = 4, supy(x) = 5.

Let's check if our constraints are satisfied:
- For y NE z: supx(z) = 1 < infx(y) = 2, and supy(z) = 1 < infy(y) = 2. This satisfies the constraints for y NE z.
- For x NE y: supx(y) = 3 < infx(x) = 4, and supy(y) = 3 < infy(x) = 4. This satisfies the constraints for x NE y.

Now let's check the cardinal direction from x to z:
- For x NE z: supx(z) = 1 < infx(x) = 4, and supy(z) = 1 < infy(x) = 4. This satisfies the constraints for x NE z.

As I thought, the only possible cardinal direction from x to z is NE. It makes intuitive sense too: if x is NE of y, and y is NE of z, then x is even further to the northeast of z.

Let's double-check that a different relation couldn't hold. For example, could x be N of z? For x N z, we'd need supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). The first two conditions are true in our example, but the third is not: supx(x) = 5, which is not <= supx(z) = 1. So, x N z is not a valid relation in our example.

Similarly, x E z would require supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x), and supy(x) <= supy(z). Again, the first two are true in our example, but the third is not: supy(x) = 5, which is not <= supy(z) = 1. So, x E z is also not a valid relation.

So, the only possible cardinal direction relation from x to z is NE.

But now I realize that I might have been making an error in this thinking process. I've been assuming that all regions x, y, and z are of the same size, but I shouldn't make this assumption. In the real problem, the regions can vary in size and shape. I need to be more flexible and check for other constraints.

Ok so let's try to look for counterexamples. For example, can x be in any direction other than NE from z?

Actually, I'm not sure I was making an error; I was just being too cautious. Let's revisit our constraints:

For x NE y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) means the right edge of y is to the left of the left edge of x.
- supy(y) <= infy(x) means the top edge of y is below the bottom edge of x.

For y NE z:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) means the right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of y.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) means the top edge of z is below the bottom edge of y.

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= supx(y) <= infx(x), which means supx(z) <= infx(x). The right edge of z is to the left of the left edge of x.
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) <= infy(x), which means supy(z) <= infy(x). The top edge of z is below the bottom edge of x.

With these constraints, can x be in any direction other than NE from z? 

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
Both of these are satisfied by the constraints we've derived. So, x NE z is definitely a possible relation.

For x N z, we need:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
The first two can be true, but the third constraint contradicts our derived supx(z) <= infx(x), because it would require the regions to overlap, which isn't allowed.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)
The first two can be true, but the third constraint contradicts our derived supy(z) <= infy(x), because it would require the regions to overlap, which isn't allowed.

I think I was correct in saying that the only possible relation is x NE z, but I was right to be cautious and to check every possible direction.

To be absolutely sure, let me try to construct counterexamples for every direction. For example, can we construct regions x, y, and z such that x is NE of y, y is NE of z, but x is not NE of z? I don't think so, because the constraints derivable from x NE y and y NE z directly lead to the constraints required for x NE z.

Let me try a simpler approach. Think of the cardinal directions in 2D space. If x is to the NE of y, then x is both to the east and to the north of y. And if y is to the NE of z, then y is both to the east and to the north of z. By transitivity, x would be both to the east and to the north of z, which is precisely the NE direction.

So, after all this analysis, the only possible cardinal direction relation from x to z given the constraints is NE.

Actually let me try one more time to be absolutely certain. I'll consider cardinal directions in a grid, where each region is in one of 9 tiles: N, NE, NW, E, W, S, SE, SW, or B (which is the central tile, the "bounding box").

Let's think of a 3x3 grid for cardinal directions. The central tile is the bounding box (B), and the other 8 are the cardinal directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW. For a relation like 'a NE b', we're saying that the a region is in the NE tile relative to the b region. Similarly, for 'a N b', the a region is in the N tile relative to the b region.

Given that x is NE of y and y is NE of z, let's try to visualize where x, y, and z might be:

```
. z .
. . .
. y .
. . .
. . x
```

This is a 5x5 grid (I've expanded the 3x3 grid to show a larger space). Here, x is in the NE direction from y, and y is in the NE direction from z. And, as we can see, x is also in the NE direction from z. 

Ok, I think I'm overthinking this. Given the constraints, x must be in the NE direction from z. So the answer to the question is: 

The possible relation between region x and region z is "NE".

ANSWER:

Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I need to determine what's possible between regions x and z given the constraints:

- x is NE of y, which means: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supy(y) <= infy(x)
- y is NE of z, which means: supx(z) <= infx(y) and supy(z) <= infy(y)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which gives: supx(z) <= infx(x)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which gives: supy(z) <= infy(x)

These derived conditions mean that:
1. The rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x
2. The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x

Looking at the definition of NE: a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)

The conditions supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x) perfectly match the definition for x NE z.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.
