PROMPT: If region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's think through this step by step.

We are told:
- Region x is E of region y, meaning x E y.
- Region y is NW of region z, meaning y NW z.

We need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

To do this, I'll use the definitions provided for the cardinal direction relations and trace the constraints on the coordinates.

From x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, let's try to determine the constraints on x with respect to z:

For the x-coordinates:
- From x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z)

This means supx(y) is less than or equal to both infx(x) and infx(z). However, this doesn't directly tell us the relationship between infx(x) and infx(z). They could be arranged in any order as long as they're both greater than or equal to supx(y).

For the y-coordinates:
- From x E y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y NW z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means infy(x) is greater than or equal to supy(z), which suggests that x is either above z or at the same level.

So, based on the constraints, region x could be in the following cardinal directions relative to region z:
- N (North): If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This satisfies our derived constraints.
- NE (North East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). This also satisfies our derived constraints.
- E (East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). But we've derived that supy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= supy(z) if infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is always true for a valid region). So, E is not a possible relation.

However, I'm not entirely confident in this derivation. Let me reconsider.

From x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

Let's see how these constraints relate x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z), but this doesn't give us a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z).

For the y-coordinates:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means x is above or at the same level as z.

Let's consider the possible cardinal direction relations:

1. N (North):
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've derived)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   The first constraint is met. The latter two constraints could be met depending on the specific regions, so N is a possible relation.

2. NE (North East):
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've derived)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   
   The first constraint is met. The second constraint could be met depending on the specific regions, especially given that supx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(x). It's possible that supx(z) <= infx(x), so NE is a possible relation.

3. E (East):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   The first two constraints are possible. But the constraint supy(x) <= supy(z) conflicts with the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for valid regions). So, E is not a possible relation.

4. SE (South East):
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   The first constraint could be met. The second constraint, supy(x) <= infy(z), contradicts the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(z) <= supy(z) (which is true for valid regions). So, SE is not a possible relation.

5. S (South):
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   The constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(z) <= supy(z) (which is true for valid regions). So, S is not a possible relation.

6. SW (South West):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(x) <= infy(z)
   
   The constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(z) <= supy(z) (which is true for valid regions). So, SW is not a possible relation.

7. W (West):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   The constraint supx(x) <= infx(z) couldn't be guaranteed from the given conditions. So, W is not a possible relation.

8. NW (North West):
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   - supy(z) <= infy(x)
   
   The second constraint is met. The first constraint, supx(x) <= infx(z), could be met if supx(x) is sufficiently small. So, NW is a possible relation.

9. B (Bounding Box):
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   
   The constraints infy(z) <= infy(x) is possible. But supy(x) <= supy(z) conflicts with the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for valid regions). So, B is not a possible relation.

Something seems off with my reasoning and I'm running into contradictions. Let me rethink this.

From x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)

I may have misinterpreted the constraints when combining them. Let's carefully think about what the regions x, y, and z look like based on the given relations, rather than just algebraically combining the constraints.

Region y is North West of region z. This means y is both to the left of z and above z. Specifically, the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z, and the bottommost point of z is below the topmost point of y.

Region x is East of region y. This means x is to the right of y. Specifically, the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x. Additionally, the bottommost point of y is below or at the level of the bottommost point of x, and the topmost point of x is below or at the level of the topmost point of y.

Visually, if we divide the plane into the 9 tiles (NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE), with y at the center (B):
- z is South East of y.
- x is East of y.

Now, to determine the possible relations between x and z, I need to think about where z can be in relation to x.

Given that:
- y is to the left of x,
- z is to the right of y,
- y is above z,
- x's y-range is within y's y-range.

Visually, it seems like x could be:
- North of z: If x is sufficiently high such that the bottommost point of x is above the topmost point of z.
- North East of z: If x is sufficiently high and to the right such that the bottommost point of x is above the topmost point of z, and the leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of z.
- East of z: If x is sufficiently to the right such that the leftmost point of x is to the right of the rightmost point of z, but x's y-range overlaps with z's y-range.
- Bounding box of z: If x's x-range and y-range are contained within z's x-range and y-range.
- Other relations: If x has other positions in relation to z.

But I think my visual reasoning might be incorrect. Let me reconsider the problem.

Let's look at the constraints again:

From x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)  (y's bottom is below or at the level of x's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)  (x's top is below or at the level of y's top)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)  (z is below y)

Now, let's see what constraints we can derive for x and z:

For the x-coordinates:
- From x E y: supx(y) <= infx(x)
- From y NW z: supx(y) <= infx(z)

This doesn't give us a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z), so x could be to the left, to the right, or at the same level as z in terms of the leftmost point.

Similarly, from the given constraints, we don't have a direct relationship between supx(x) and supx(z), so x's rightmost point could be to the left, to the right, or at the same level as z's rightmost point.

For the y-coordinates:
- From x E y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y NW z: supy(z) <= infy(y)

Combining these, we get:
supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)

This means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x, which implies x is strictly north of z in terms of the y-coordinates.

Given the x-coordinate constraints (or lack thereof), x's leftmost and rightmost points can be in various positions relative to z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z could be:
- N (North): If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The last constraint is met, but the first two depend on the specific regions.
- NE (North East): If supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The last constraint is met, but the first depends on the specific regions.
- NW (North West): If supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). The last constraint is met, but the first depends on the specific regions.

Other direction relations like E, SE, S, SW, W, and B wouldn't be possible because they all require conditions on the y-coordinates that are inconsistent with the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x).

Actually, let me double-check the inconsistencies:

- E (East): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The constraint supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for valid regions). So, E is not a possible relation.

- SE (South East): Requires supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(z) <= supy(z) (which is true for valid regions). So, SE is not a possible relation.

- S (South): Requires supy(x) <= infy(z) and infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). The constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(z) <= supy(z) (which is true for valid regions). So, S is not a possible relation.

- SW (South West): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). The constraint supy(x) <= infy(z) contradicts the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(z) <= supy(z) (which is true for valid regions). So, SW is not a possible relation.

- W (West): Requires supx(x) <= infx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The constraint supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for valid regions). So, W is not a possible relation.

- B (Bounding Box): Requires infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). The constraint supy(x) <= supy(z) contradicts the derived constraint supy(z) <= infy(x) if infy(x) <= supy(x) (which is true for valid regions). So, B is not a possible relation.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: N, NE, and NW.

Wait, let me reconsider. I realized that the constraints we derived are necessary, but they may not be sufficient to determine all possible relations. Let me think about this a bit more carefully.

From x E y:
- supx(y) <= infx(x)  (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)  (y's bottom is below or at the level of x's bottom)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)  (x's top is below or at the level of y's top)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) <= infx(z)  (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y)  (z is below y)

Now, from the above, we can infer the following about the positions of x, y, and z:

y is to the west/left of both x and z. And z is south/below y.

Given that x is east of y and y is northwest of z, visually, z is in the southeast direction from y, and x is in the east direction from y.

The main constraints we have derived is that supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x). This means supy(z) <= infy(x), which means z is strictly below x in terms of the y-coordinates.

For the x-coordinates, we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z). But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between infx(x) and infx(z).

Looking at the constraints in the cardinal direction definitions, I can say that the possible relations between x and z are:

1. N (North): 
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (derived)
   - infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   
   The first constraint is met. The latter two depend on the specific regions. If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is strictly N of z.

2. NE (North East): 
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (derived)
   - supx(z) <= infx(x)
   
   The first constraint is met. The second constraint could be met depending on the specific regions. If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is strictly NE of z.

3. NW (North West): 
   - supy(z) <= infy(x) (derived)
   - supx(x) <= infx(z)
   
   The first constraint is met. The second constraint could be met depending on the specific regions. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is strictly NW of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, and NW.

Actually, there's something that bothers me. I said earlier that y is to the left (west) of both x and z, and z is to the south of y. Visually, this means that z is to the south-east of y, and x is to the east of y.

Given this visualization, it's hard to see how x could be to the north-west of z. Let me recheck my reasoning.

From the given constraints:
- y is to the left of both x and z (from x E y and y NW z).
- y is above z (from y NW z).
- x is vertically contained within y's y-range (from x E y).

Visually, y is to the north-west of z, and x is to the east of y.

If x is to the east of y and y is to the north-west of z, then x is to the east of the north-west of z. 

Let's visualize this:
z is the reference region. Divide the plane into the 9 tiles based on z: NW, N, NE, W, B, E, SW, S, SE.
y is in the NW tile in relation to z.
x is to the east of y.

So, if y is in the NW tile, and x is to the east of y, then x could be:
- In the NW tile (if x is close enough to y)
- In the N tile (if x is sufficiently to the east of y)
- In the NE tile (if x is quite a bit to the east of y)

This reasoning suggests that the possible relations between x and z could be: NW, N, or NE. Which aligns with our earlier derived result.

Actually, let's double-check the visualizing for the third time. 

Alright, so we have the following constraints:
- x is to the East of y: This means x is horizontally to the right of y.
- y is to the North-West of z: This means y is both horizontally to the left of z AND vertically above z.

Let's visualize this with a simple diagram. Using a coordinate system, let's say:
- z is centered at (0, 0).
- Given y NW z, y could be around (-1, 1) (i.e., left and above z).
- Given x E y, x could be around (0, 1) (i.e., to the right of y but at the same vertical level).

Now, in relation to z, x is around (0, 1). This is North of z. So N is a possible relation.

If x is a bit more to the right, say at (1, 1), then x is North-East of z. So NE is a possible relation.

If x is a bit to the left, say at (-0.5, 1), then x is still North of z. If x is even further to the left, it could be North-West of z, but it should still be to the East of y (which can be at, say, (-1, if it's NW of z.

The constraint "y NW z" means that the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z (supx(y) <= infx(z)), and the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y (supy(z) <= infy(y)). The condition "x E y" means that the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x (supx(y) <= infx(x)), and the y-range of x is contained within the y-range of y (infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)).

Let's consider the constraint supy(x) <= supy(y) more carefully. If the topmost point of x is below the topmost point of y, and the bottommmost point of y is below the bottommost point of x, then x's y-range is stuck within y's y-range. This means that x cannot be too high or too low compared to y.

Given that y is NW of z, the constraint supy(z) <= infy(y) means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y. Combining with the constraint infy(y) <= infy(x), we get supy(z) <= infy(x), so x is vertically above z.

The constraint supx(y) <= infx(z) means the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z. Combining with the constraint supx(y) <= infx(x), we know that the rightmost point of y is to the left of both the leftmost point of x and the leftmost point of z. But this doesn't give us a direct relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z.

If infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), then x is vertically above z (North). If supx(z) <= infx(x), then x is to the North-East of z. If supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the North-West of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: N, NE, and NW.

Actually, I realize that the third case (NW) is a special one and I should think on it carefully. 

For x to be to the North-West of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We already know that supy(z) <= infy(x). As for supx(x) <= infx(z), this means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z.

But we also know that supx(y) <= infx(x), i.e., the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x. And supx(y) <= infx(z), i.e., the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z.

These three constraints together are: supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(y) <= infx(z) and supx(x) <= infx(z). 

In general, this gives us supx(y) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). But this doesn't immediately tell us anything specific, except that from supx(y) <= infx(x), we might infer that y is strictly to the left of x. And from supx(x) <= infx(z), we might infer that x is strictly to the left of z. Both of these are consistent with our problem setup.

So, it seems like x could be to the North-West of z after all. 

To summarize, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are: N, NE, and NW.

Actually, I realize now that there's a bit more subtlety. Let's dig deeper.

I said earlier that if supx(x) <= infx(z), then x is to the North-West of z. But I forgotten to consider the relationship between x and y.

If x is East of y, then supx(y) <= infx(x). In other words, the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x.

And if we're saying x is to the North-West of z, then supx(x) <= infx(z). In other words, the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z.

But if y is to the North-West of z, then supx(y) <= infx(z). In other words, the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z.

So we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= infx(z) and supx(y) <= infx(z). These can all be satisfied as long as we have the rightmost point of y (supx(y)) being to the left of the leftmost point of x (infx(x)) and the rightmost point of x (supx(x)) being to the left of the leftmost point of z (infx(z)).

However, the constraint "x E y" also means that the y-range of x is contained within the y-range of y: infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). 

Let's think about this geometrically. If y is to the North-West of z, then y is in, well, the North-West direction from z. And if x is to the East of y, then x is to the East (right) of y.

Now, can x be to the North-West of z? Yes, it's possible! Even if x is to the East of y, it can still be to the North-West of z, as long as x is not so far East that it crosses into the North region in relation to z.

Similarly, x can be to the North of z if it's at the right distance to the East of y. And x can be to the North-East of z if it's even further to the East of y.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

Again, I might be missing something. Let me re-check this.

From x E y:
- The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x (supx(y) <= infx(x)).
- The y-range of x is contained within the y-range of y (infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y)).

From y NW z:
- The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z (supx(y) <= infx(z)).
- The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y (supy(z) <= infy(y)).

Now, let's think about where x can be in relation to z.

For the y-coordinates:
- From the constraints, we know supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x). This gives us supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x. So, in terms of y-coordinates, x is above z.

For the x-coordinates:
- We know supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y) and supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z).
- But these don't give us a direct relationship between the x-coordinates of x and z.

Now, for x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've already established that supy(z) <= infy(x). For supx(x) <= infx(z), this means the rightmost point of x is to the left of the leftmost point of z.

For x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). Again, we've established supy(z) <= infy(x). The other two constraints, infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z), mean that the x-range of x is contained within the x-range of z.

For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). We've established supy(z) <= infy(x). The constraint supx(z) <= infx(x) means the rightmost point of z is to the left of the leftmost point of x.

Now, let's see which of these are compatible with the given constraints.

For x to be NW of z, we need supx(x) <= infx(z). Given that supx(y) <= infx(x), we have supx(y) <= supx(x) <= infx(z). This is compatible with the constraint supx(y) <= infx(z).

For x to be N of z, we need infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z). Given supx(y) <= infx(x), we have supx(y) <= infx(x), infx(z) <= infx(x), and supx(x) <= supx(z). We need to check if this is compatible with the constraint supx(y) <= infx(z). It's unclear if this is always satisfied, so let's consider specific examples.

Imagine y has a rightmost point at supx(y) = 0. Let infx(z) = 2 (leftmost point of z) and infx(x) = 1 (leftmost point of x). Also, suppose supx(x) = 3 (rightmost point of x) and supx(z) = 4 (rightmost point of z). In this case, we have supx(y) = 0 <= infx(z) = 2, supx(y) = 0 <= infx(x) = 1, infx(z) = 2 <= infx(x) = 1 (which is not satisfied), and supx(x) = 3 <= supx(z) = 4. So, this specific configuration doesn't satisfy the N relation.

But if we adjust the values, say with infx(z) = 1, then we'd have infx(z) = 1 <= infx(x) = 1, which is satisfied. So, the N relation is possible.

For x to be NE of z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x). Given supx(y) <= infx(x), we have supx(y) <= infx(x) and supx(z) <= infx(x). This doesn't immediately tell us anything about the relationship between supx(y) and supx(z), but both are to the left of infx(x). The constraint supx(y) <= infx(z) from y NW z implies that the rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z. This doesn't contradict anything we've derived.

Actually, I think I convoluted my logic. Let me start with simpler reasoning. If x is E of y and y is NW of z, then z is SE of y. To visualize this, I've repeatedly claimed that x could be NW, N, or NE in relation to z. Let me be a bit more methodical in my visual reasoning.

Given that z is SE of y, if we divide the plane into the 9 tiles with z as the reference, then y would be in the NW tile, and x would be to the East of y (i.e., either in the NW, N, or NE tiles in relation to z).

If x is very close to y, it might still be in the NW tile but a bit to the East of y. If x is more to the East, it might be in the N tile. And if x is even more to the East, it might be in the NE tile.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

But I've stated this multiple times already. Let's try to gain even more confidence by working out a more rigorous logical reasoning step-by-step.

Given x E y, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(x)
infy(y) <= infy(x)
supy(x) <= supy(y)

Given y NW z, we have:
supx(y) <= infx(z)
supy(z) <= infy(y)

Now, given these, I want to determine if the relation x R z can hold for each basic spatial relation R.

For x N z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've derived supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), so the first constraint is met. The other constraints depend on the specific regions. So, x N z is possible.

For x NE z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

We've derived supy(z) <= infy(x), so the first constraint is met. The second constraint, supx(z) <= infx(x), could be satisfied depending on the specific regions. So, x NE z is possible.

For x E z, the constraints are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

We've derived supy(z) <= infy(y) and infy(y) <= infy(x), so supy(z) <= infy(x). But for x E z, we need infy(z) <= infy(x). These might not always be consistent. Plus, for x E z, we also need supy(x) <= supy(z). But from x E y and y NW z, we've derived supy(x) <= supy(y) (from x E y) and supy(z) <= infy(y) (from y NW z). If regions are non-empty, we can infer infy(y) <= supy(y). This means supy(z) <= infy(y) <= supy(y) and supy(x) <= supy(y). These don't directly tell us whether supy(x) <= supy(z), so it's possible that x E z might hold.

Wait, I think I've been making a mistake. Let's again consider the constraint supy(z) <= infy(y) from y NW z. This means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y. In other words, z doesn't overlap vertically with y.

Now, from x E y, we have infy(y) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y). This means the y-range of x is contained within the y-range of y.

Combining these, since the y-range of x is contained within the y-range of y and z doesn't overlap vertically with y, z also doesn't overlap vertically with x.

So, the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x, which is supy(z) <= infy(x). This means x is strictly above z in terms of the y-coordinates.

The only cardinal direction relations where the first region is strictly above the second in terms of the y-coordinates are NW, N, and NE. So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

For x NW z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

We've derived supy(z) <= infy(x), so the first constraint is met. The second constraint, supx(x) <= infx(z), could be satisfied depending on the specific regions. So, x NW z is possible.

For x N z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

We've derived supy(z) <= infy(x), so the first constraint is met. The other constraints depend on the specific regions. So, x N z is possible.

For x NE z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

We've derived supy(z) <= infy(x), so the first constraint is met. The second constraint, supx(z) <= infx(x), could be satisfied depending on the specific regions. So, x NE z is possible.

For all other relations (E, SE, S, SW, W, B), one of the required constraints on the y-coordinates would be violated, given that x is strictly above z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

Actually, hold on. Let me check the E case once more, because I think I made a logical error.

For x E z, the constraints are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

The first constraint could be satisfied. For the second, we need infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z). We've derived supy(z) <= infy(x), which means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x. But for supy(x) <= supy(z), we would need the topmost point of x to be below the topmost point of z. Since x is strictly above z (the bottommost point of x is above the topmost point of z), the topmost point of x can't be below the topmost point of z. So, x E z isn't possible.

So, I'm more confident now that the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

Wait, about the E case... in an E relation, the topmost point of x has to be below the topmost point of z. But to concurrently be on the East, the region X's y-range has to wholly overlap with Z's y-range. If z is strictly below x (the bottommost of x is above the topmost of z), then it's not an E relation.

Very specifically, for x E z, the constraints are:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the right of z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)  (the bottommst point of z is below the bottommost point of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)  (the topmost point of x is below the topmost point of z)

For a valid region, the bottommost point should be below the topmost point, i.e., infy(x) <= supy(x). From our derived constraint, the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x, i.e., supy(z) <= infy(x). Using these two, we get: supy(z) <= infy(x) <= supy(x). The first and last terms give supy(z) <= supy(x), which contradicts the constraint supy(x) <= supy(z) required for x E z. So, x E z isn't possible.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

Alright, so I've reasoned my way to the answer, and I've been quite assiduous in my process. Let's double-check once more.

From x E y, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x) (the bottommost point of y is below the bottommost point of x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y) (the topmost point of x is below the topmost point of y)

From y NW z, we have:
- supx(y) <= infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(z) <= infy(y) (z is below y)

From these, we have derived:
- supy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x. So, x is strictly north/above of z.

The only cardinal direction relations where the primary region is strictly north of the secondary region are NW, N, and NE. So the potential directions of x from z are:
- x NW z (x is North-West of z)
- x N z (x is North of z)
- x NE z (x is North-East of z)

We've also checked that the other spatial relations (B, SW, W, S, SE, E) aren't possible, due to constraints on the y-coordinates.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

OK, let me double-check to make sure:

For x NW z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)  (x is to the left of z)

For x N z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)  (x is horizontally contained within z's x-range)

For x NE z, the constraints are:
- supy(z) <= infy(x)  (x is above z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)  (x is to the right of z)

Given that supy(z) <= infy(x) (which we've derived), x is indeed strictly above z. The other constraints on the x-coordinates can be satisfied depending on the specific regions. For instance, if the x-range of x is sufficiently to the left, it can satisfy supx(x) <= infx(z) and be to the NW of z. Similarly, it can be to the N or NE of z, depending on its x-range.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

Continuing with the reasoning, let's ensure that none of the other six cardinal direction relations could be possible.

I've elaborated that for B, the constraints would be:
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For the y-coordinates, we've derived supy(z) <= infy(x). If the region x is a proper region, then infy(x) < supy(x). This means supy(z) < supy(x). But for x to be in the bounding box of z, we need supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) < supy(x). So, x B z isn't possible.

For S, the constraints would be:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)

For the y-coordinates, we've derived supy(z) <= infy(x). For a proper region z, infy(z) < supy(z). This means infy(z) < infy(x). But for x to be south of z, we need supy(x) <= infy(z), which implies supy(x) < infy(x) if combined with infy(z) < infy(x). This contradicts the definition of a region, which has infy(x) <= supy(x). So, x S z isn't possible.

For SW, the constraints would be:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(x) <= infx(z)

The reasoning for the y-coordinates is similar to the S case, so x SW z isn't possible.

For W, the constraints would be:
- supx(x) <= infx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For the y-coordinates, we've derived supy(z) <= infy(x). For a proper region x, infy(x) < supy(x). This means supy(z) < supy(x). But for x to be west of z, we need supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) < supy(x). So, x W z isn't possible.

For SE, the constraints would be:
- supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x)

The reasoning for the y-coordinates is similar to the S case, so x SE z isn't possible.

For E, the constraints would be:
- supx(z) <= infx(x)
- infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

For the y-coordinates, we've derived supy(z) <= infy(x). For a proper region x, infy(x) < supy(x). This means supy(z) < supy(x). But for x to be east of z, we need supy(x) <= supy(z), which contradicts supy(z) < supy(x). So, x E z isn't possible.

So, the possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, and NE.

Therefore, based on all the reasoning, the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z are: NW, N, and NE.

In summary:
Given that region x is E of region y and region y is NW of region z, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- North West (NW)
- North (N)
- North East (NE)

ANSWER:

Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From x E y:
- The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of x (supx(y) ≤ infx(x))
- The y-range of x is contained within the y-range of y (infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y))

From y NW z:
- The rightmost point of y is to the left of the leftmost point of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z))
- The topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of y (supy(z) ≤ infy(y))

Combining these constraints:
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- This means the topmost point of z is below the bottommost point of x, so x must be strictly north of z

The only possible cardinal direction relations where region x is strictly north of region z are:
- NW (if x is sufficiently to the left relative to z)
- N (if x overlaps horizontally with z)
- NE (if x is sufficiently to the right relative to z)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, N, NE
