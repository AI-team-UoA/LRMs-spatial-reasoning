PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Here we have three regions x, y, and z. We're given that:
- x is B of y (meaning x is in the bounding box of y)
- y is B of z (meaning y is in the bounding box of z)

We need to find what relations could possibly hold between x and z.

Let's recall the definition of the B (bounding box) relation:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

So x B y means:
- infx(y) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(y)
- infy(y) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(y)

And y B z means:
- infx(z) <= infx(y)
- supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y)
- supy(y) <= supy(z)

Now let's combine these to see the relationship between x and z:

1. For the x-coordinate:
   - infx(y) <= infx(x) and infx(z) <= infx(y)
   - This means infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) and supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - This means supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)

2. For the y-coordinate:
   - infy(y) <= infy(x) and infy(z) <= infy(y)
   - This means infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z)
   - This means supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

Putting these together:
- infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x)
- supy(x) <= supy(z)

These are exactly the conditions for x B z. 

So, if region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then region x must be B of region z.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. Let me reconsider. The relations described above are sufficient for x B z, but I need to check if other relations are possible as well.

Let's see if other relations between x and z are possible:

1. Could x be S of z?
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   But we already established infy(z) <= infy(x), which contradicts supy(x) <= infy(z) (unless x is a very thin horizontal line, which is not a general case). So x cannot be S of z.

2. Could x be SW of z?
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   But we already established infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (unless x is a single point, which is not a general case). So x cannot be SW of z.

3. Could x be W of z?
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But we already established infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (unless x is a single vertical line, which is not a general case). So x cannot be W of z.

4. Could x be NW of z?
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   But we already established infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) <= infx(z) (unless x is a single point, which is not a general case). So x cannot be NW of z.

5. Could x be N of z?
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   But we already established infy(x) <= supy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(y) and supy(y) <= supy(z), which means infy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts supy(z) <= infy(x) (unless x is a very thin horizontal line, which is not a general case). So x cannot be N of z.

6. Could x be NE of z?
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   But we already established supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless x is a single point, which is not a general case). So x cannot be NE of z.

7. Could x be E of z?
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   But we already established supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless x is a single vertical line, which is not a general case). So x cannot be E of z.

8. Could x be SE of z?
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   But we already established supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts supx(z) <= infx(x) (unless x is a single point, which is not a general case). So x cannot be SE of z.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in my analysis. I've been too quick to rule out other relations.

Actually, I need to be more precise here. The condition x B y means that x is entirely contained within the bounding box of y. Similarly, y B z means y is entirely within the bounding box of z. These relationships do not uniquely determine the relative positions of x and z.

Let me rethink this. The bounding box relation B is somewhat special because it doesn't precisely specify where one region is relative to another; it just says one region is within the bounding box of the other.

If x B y and y B z, what we know about the bounding boxes is:
- The bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of y.
- The bounding box of y is contained within the bounding box of z.

From this, we can deduce that the bounding box of x is contained within the bounding box of z, which means x B z is definitely a possibility.

However, there are other possible relations too, depending on the exact shape and position of x, y, and z. Let's consider some examples.

Imagine z is a large square, y is a smaller square situated in the top-right corner of z, and x is an even smaller square situated in the bottom-left corner of y. In this case, x is inside the bounding box of y (so x B y), and y is inside the bounding box of z (so y B z), but x might be situated such that it's in the N direction from the center of z, or NE, or E, etc.

I think I need to reconsider what the cardinal direction relations mean. The cardinal directions (N, NE, E, etc.) are determined by dividing the plane into regions based on the bounding box of the reference region.

Given this, if x B y and y B z, then x must be within the bounding box of z, but it could be positioned in various ways relative to the center of z.

Actually, hold on. Let me re-read the definitions to ensure I'm getting this right.

For a cardinal direction like N (North), the definition is:
a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This says that region a is to the North of region b if a is completely above b (supy(b) <= infy(a)), and the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b.

Given this understanding, let's reconsider:

If x B y and y B z, then:
- x is entirely contained within the bounding box of y.
- y is entirely contained within the bounding box of z.

It's still true that x must be within the bounding box of z (so x B z is a possibility), but now I'm not sure if other cardinal direction relations are possible.

Actually I think I was right earlier. Let's reconsider one by one:

1. Could x be S of z?
   For x S z, we need: supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   We know from x B y and y B z that:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   We have infy(z) <= infy(x), which means it's not generally true that supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot generally be S of z.

2. Could x be SW of z?
   For x SW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We already know:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
   
   These contradict the conditions for x SW z. So, x cannot be SW of z.

3. Could x be W of z?
   For x W z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We already know:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
   
   This contradicts the condition supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be W of z.

4. Could x be NW of z?
   For x NW z, we need: supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We already know:
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   These contradict the conditions for x NW z. So, x cannot be NW of z.

5. Could x be N of z?
   For x N z, we need: supy(z) <= infy(x), infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
   We already know:
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   This contradicts the condition supy(z) <= infy(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

6. Could x be NE of z?
   For x NE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x)
   We already know:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)
   
   These contradict the conditions for x NE z. So, x cannot be NE of z.

7. Could x be E of z?
   For x E z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x), infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)
   We already know:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
   
   This contradicts the condition supx(z) <= infx(x). So, x cannot be E of z.

8. Could x be SE of z?
   For x SE z, we need: supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z)
   We already know:
   - supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
   - infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
   
   These contradict the conditions for x SE z. So, x cannot be SE of z.

So, based on my analysis, if x B y and y B z, the only possible relation between x and z is x B z.

Wait, I need to be more careful here. In my analysis, I'm assuming rather strict containment for the bounding boxes. 

Actually, let's assume x B y and y B z, and let's describe the extent of these regions:
- x has bounds [x_min, x_max] in x and [y_min, y_max] in y
- y has bounds [y_min', y_max'] in x and [y_min', y_max'] in y
- z has bounds [z_min, z_max] in x and [z_min, z_max] in y

From x B y:
- y_min' <= x_min <= x_max <= y_max'
- y_min' <= y_min <= y_max <= y_max'

From y B z:
- z_min <= y_min' <= y_max' <= z_max
- z_min <= y_min' <= y_max' <= z_max

Combining these:
- z_min <= y_min' <= x_min <= x_max <= y_max' <= z_max
- z_min <= y_min' <= y_min <= y_max <= y_max' <= z_max

This clearly shows that x is fully within the bounding box of z, which means x B z.

But are other cardinal directions possible?

Let's consider a specific example. Imagine:
- z is a large square centered at (0, 0) with bounds [-10, 10] in both x and y.
- y is a square within z with bounds [-5, 5] in both x and y.
- x is a square within y with bounds [-2, 2] in both x and y.

Clearly, x B y and y B z. But where is x relative to z? If we consider the center of z as the reference, x is still at the B direction.

But what if:
- z remains the same.
- y is a square with bounds [0, 5] in x and [0, 5] in y (so it's in the top-right quadrant of z).
- x is a square with bounds [3, 4] in x and [3, 4] in y (so it's in the center of y).

In this case, x is in the NE direction relative to the center of z.

Let me reconsider.

From the definition of the cardinal directions:
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This means region a is to the south of region b if a is completely below b, and the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b.

I don't think I've been understanding these directions correctly. 

Actually, let's revisit the definitions in the directions more carefully.

From the provided definition:
- a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a SW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(a) <= infy(b)
- a W b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a NW b if and only if supx(a) <= infx(b) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a N b if and only if supy(b) <= infy(a), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)
- a NE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(b) <= infy(a)
- a E b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)
- a SE b if and only if supx(b) <= infx(a) and supy(a) <= infy(b)

The B relation means one region (a) is entirely within the bounding box of another region (b).

The S relation means region a is to the south of region b, meaning a is completely below b (supy(a) <= infy(b)), and the x-projection of a is contained within the x-projection of b (infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)).

And so on for the other cardinal directions.

Now, let's revisit our problem. If x B y and y B z, then x must be within the bounding box of z, which means x B z is a possibility.

But as I showed with the specific example, it's also possible for x to be in other directions relative to z, even though x is within the bounding box of z. This is because the bounding box relation B allows for a lot of flexibility in the relative positions of the regions.

So, the possible relations between x and z given x B y and y B z are:
- x B z: This is definite, as x is within the bounding box of y, which is within the bounding box of z.

Are there any other possibilities? Let's go through the other directions systematically:

1. x S z: This would require supy(x) <= infy(z). But since x B y and y B z, we have infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which contradicts the requirement. So x cannot be S of z.

2. x SW z: This would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But since x B y and y B z, we have infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), which contradicts the first requirement. So x cannot be SW of z.

3. x W z: This would require supx(x) <= infx(z). But as above, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the requirement. So x cannot be W of z.

4. x NW z: This would require supx(x) <= infx(z) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But as above, we have infx(z) <= infx(x), which contradicts the first requirement. So x cannot be NW of z.

5. x N z: This would require supy(z) <= infy(x). But since x B y and y B z, we have supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z), which means infy(x) <= supy(x) <= supy(z). This contradicts the requirement. So x cannot be N of z.

6. x NE z: This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x). But since x B y and y B z, we have supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z), which contradicts the first requirement. So x cannot be NE of z.

7. x E z: This would require supx(z) <= infx(x). But as above, we have supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the requirement. So x cannot be E of z.

8. x SE z: This would require supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(x) <= infy(z). But as above, we have supx(x) <= supx(z), which contradicts the first requirement. So x cannot be SE of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z given x B y and y B z is x B z.

Hmm, this contradicts what I said earlier about x potentially being in the NE direction relative to the center of z in my specific example. Let me reconsider that example.

For x and z as described:
- z: bounds [-10, 10] in both x and y
- x: bounds [3, 4] in both x and y

For x NE z, we need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x).
- supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 3, so supx(z) > infx(x), which means the first condition is not satisfied.
- supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 3, so supy(z) > infy(x), which means the second condition is not satisfied.

So, x is not NE of z in my example. It's as I just concluded: the only possible relation between x and z given x B y and y B z is x B z.

Actually, let's be really, really careful here. I think my interpretation of the cardinal directions is still not quite right.

The provided definitions are about the bounding boxes of the regions, not about the regions themselves. The bounding box of a region is a rectangle that tightly encloses the region.

So, for instance, a N b means that the bounding box of a is to the north of the bounding box of b. It doesn't mean a is to the north of the center of b or anything like that.

The bounding box of region a is the rectangle with bounds [infx(a), supx(a)] in x and [infy(a), supy(a)] in y.

Given this, the definitions make perfect sense.

For example, a N b means:
- supy(b) <= infy(a): The top edge of the bounding box of b is below or at the same height as the bottom edge of the bounding box of a.
- infx(b) <= infx(a): The left edge of the bounding box of b is to the left or at the same x-coordinate as the left edge of the bounding box of a.
- supx(a) <= supx(b): The right edge of the bounding box of a is to the left or at the same x-coordinate as the right edge of the bounding box of b.

The second and third conditions ensure that the bounding box of a is horizontally contained within the bounding box of b, and the first condition ensures that a is above b.

Now, let's re-examine our problem: If x B y and y B z, then what are the possible relations between x and z?

From:
- x B y implies the bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of y.
- y B z implies the bounding box of y is entirely within the bounding box of z.

It follows that the bounding box of x is entirely within the bounding box of z, which means x B z.

No other cardinal direction relation is possible, because all other cardinal direction relations require at least part of the bounding box of x to be outside the bounding box of z, which contradicts what we just established.

So, the only possible relation between x and z given x B y and y B z is x B z.

Actually, let's be careful here. In my understanding of the problem, the expressions like infx(a), supx(a), infy(a), and supy(a) refer to the least and greatest coordinates of the region a in the x and y directions. The B relation indeed indicates that one region is entirely within the bounding box of another.

Based on our premises:
- x B y: The region x is entirely within the bounding box of y.
- y B z: The region y is entirely within the bounding box of z.

It does follow that the region x is entirely within the bounding box of z, which means x B z.

Is it possible for x to also satisfy other directional relations with respect to z?

Let's understand the nature of the B relation better. The B relation means that a region is entirely within the bounding box of another region. But it doesn't restrict where within that bounding box the region can be.

Given that x B y and y B z:
- x can be anywhere within the bounding box of y.
- y can be anywhere within the bounding box of z.

So, it's possible that y is in the NE corner of the bounding box of z, and x is in the SW corner of the bounding box of y. In such a scenario, where exactly is x with respect to z? It's still within the bounding box of z, so x B z. But can it also be, for example, N of z or NE of z?

Let's think about x N z. This would require:
1. supy(z) <= infy(x): The top edge of the bounding box of z is below or at the same height as the bottom edge of the bounding box of x.
2. infx(z) <= infx(x): The left edge of the bounding box of z is to the left or at the same x-coordinate as the left edge of the bounding box of x.
3. supx(x) <= supx(z): The right edge of the bounding box of x is to the left or at the same x-coordinate as the right edge of the bounding box of z.

Condition 1 can't be satisfied given x B y and y B z. We know:
- From x B y: infy(y) <= infy(x)
- From y B z: infy(z) <= infy(y)
- Combining: infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x)
- Also, from x B y: supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y B z: supy(y) <= supy(z)
- Combining: supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

It's not possible that supy(z) <= infy(x) given infy(x) <= supy(x) (a basic property of a region) and supy(x) <= supy(z). So, x cannot be N of z.

Similar arguments can be made for the other cardinal directions. The conclusion is that the only possible relation between x and z given x B y and y B z is x B z.

Let me walk through one more example, for clarity.

Imagine:
- z is a square centered at (0, 0) with bounds [-10, 10] in both x and y.
- y is a square with bounds [0, 5] in x and [0, 5] in y (so it's in the top-right quadrant of z).
- x is a square with bounds [2, 3] in x and [2, 3] in y (so it's inside y).

We can confirm:
- x B y: 0 <= 2 <= 3 <= 5 (in x) and 0 <= 2 <= 3 <= 5 (in y)
- y B z: -10 <= 0 <= 5 <= 10 (in x) and -10 <= 0 <= 5 <= 10 (in y)

Now, let's determine the relation between x and z:
- infx(z) = -10, infx(x) = 2, supx(x) = 3, supx(z) = 10, so infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) = -10, infy(x) = 2, supy(x) = 3, supy(z) = 10, so infy(z) <= infy(x) and supy(x) <= supy(z)

This confirms x B z. Let's check if x might be in any other cardinal direction relative to z:

For x N z, we need supy(z) <= infy(x):
supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 2, so supy(z) > infy(x). This means x is not N of z.

Let's try x NE z. We need supx(z) <= infx(x) and supy(z) <= infy(x):
supx(z) = 10, infx(x) = 2, so supx(z) > infx(x).
supy(z) = 10, infy(x) = 2, so supy(z) > infy(x).
This means x is not NE of z.

Similarly, x can't be in any of the other cardinal directions relative to z. It can only be B of z.

So, based on this examination, the only possible relation between x and z given x B y and y B z is x B z.

Actually let's try once more, with a clear mind. We have:
- x B y means that the region x is entirely inside the bounding box of region y (not inside the region y itself).
- y B z means that the region y is entirely inside the bounding box of region z.

Given these, where can x be with respect to z?

We have:
- From x B y: infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y), infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y)
- From y B z: infx(z) <= infx(y), supx(y) <= supx(z), infy(z) <= infy(y), supy(y) <= supy(z)

Combining:
- infx(z) <= infx(y) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(y) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(y) <= supy(z)

This gives us:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)

These are exactly the conditions for x B z. So, x B z is one possible relation between x and z.

Let's check if any other relations are possible:

For x S z, we need:
supy(x) <= infy(z), infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)

We already know infx(z) <= infx(x) and supx(x) <= supx(z) from our deductions. But we also know infy(z) <= infy(y) <= infy(x), which implies infy(z) <= supy(x) (since infy(x) <= supy(x)). This contradicts the requirement supy(x) <= infy(z). So, x cannot be S of z.

For x SW z, we need:
supx(x) <= infx(z), supy(x) <= infy(z)

We know from our deductions that infx(z) <= infx(x), which implies infx(z) <= supx(x) (since infx(x) <= supx(x)). This contradicts the requirement supx(x) <= infx(z). So, x cannot be SW of z.

Using similar logic, we can show that x cannot be W, NW, N, NE, E, or SE of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is x B z.

Ah, perhaps I have not been precise enough. The definition of the S region is: 
a S b if and only if supy(a) <= infy(b), infx(b) <= infx(a) and supx(a) <= supx(b)

This doesn't mean the region a is S of the region b. It means the region a is in the S tile of region b. These tiles (B, S, SW, etc.) are defining a partition of the plane based on the reference region's bounding box.

Let me clarify with the B relation:
a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

This means the bounding box of a is fully inside the bounding box of b, not that a is "within" b.

With this understanding, let's reconsider our problem:

If x B y and y B z, what is the relation between x and z?

From our earlier deductions:
- infx(z) <= infx(x), supx(x) <= supx(z)
- infy(z) <= infy(x), supy(x) <= supy(z)

These are exactly the conditions for x B z. So, the relation between x and z is B.

Could there be any other relation? For any other relation, x would have to be in a different tile of the partition induced by z, which would contradict the fact that the bounding box of x is fully inside the bounding box of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is B.

Let me triple-check this. The definitions are based on the tiling of the plane with respect to the reference object. If x B y and y B z, then the bounding box of x is fully inside the bounding box of y, and the bounding box of y is fully inside the bounding box of z. This implies the bounding box of x is fully inside the bounding box of z, which means x B z.

Could x be in any other tile of the partition induced by z? No, because all other tiles (S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) lie partially or completely outside the bounding box of z, and we've established that x is fully inside the bounding box of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is B.

Actually, let's check the defintion one more time:

"A single-tile cardinal direction relation B (bounding box), S (South), SW (South West), W (West), NW (North West), N (North), NE (North East), E (East) and SE (South East) is defined as follows:"

This is definitely partitioning the 2D region into 9 tiles, indexed by the 9 cardinal directions. The bounding box B is a single region from this partition, namely the tile that coincides exactly with the bounding box of the reference region. The other tiles are outside the bounding box of the reference region.

So our reasoning is correct. If x B y and y B z, then the only possible relation between x and z is B.

Actually, I'm a bit confused now because the problem mentions:
A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

This suggests that a region might not be in just a single tile but instead could span multiple tiles. Therefore, a cardinal direction relation is an expression like R1: ... : Rk which represents that with respect to some directions there is a relation. Here, we're told that region x is B of region y, so x is fully inside the bounding box of y.

OK, I think the question is asking: if region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, what might be the relationship between region x and region z?

When they ask "which could be the possible relations", I think they're asking which single-tile cardinal direction relation(s) could describe the position of x relative to z.

Given what we know:
- x B y: Region x is fully inside the bounding box of y.
- y B z: Region y is fully inside the bounding box of z.

It follows that region x is fully inside the bounding box of z, which means x B z is a possible relation. And from our earlier analysis, no other single-tile cardinal direction relation is possible, because all other tiles lie partially or completely outside the bounding box of z, and x must be fully inside the bounding box of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is B.

Let's be clear about the definitions one more time before we finalize.

Let's say the bounding box of a region b has coordinates [infx(b), supx(b)] in the x-direction and [infy(b), supy(b)] in the y-direction.

The cardinal direction tiles are defined as follows:
- The B tile is the bounding box of b itself.
- The S tile is the region below the bounding box of b, but with the same x-projection.
- The SW tile is the region to the bottom-left of the bounding box of b.
- And so on for the other tiles.

For a region a to be in the B tile of b, its bounding box must be fully inside the bounding box of b. For a to be in the S tile of b, it must be below the bounding box of b and have its x-projection contained within the x-projection of b.

Given these definitions, if x B y and y B z, then x B z is the only possible relation.

Let's answer the question: If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

Based on our analysis, the only possible relation is x B z.

Actually, now I want to check the statement mentioned in the problem once more:
A cardinal direction relation is an expression R1: ... : Rk, where the following should be applied: i) 1 <= k <= 9, ii) R1,...,Rk belongs to {B, S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE}, iii) Ri <> Rj for every i, j such that 1 <= i, j <= k and i <> j, iv) there are regions a1, ..., ak belongs to REG, where a1 belongs to R1(b), ..., ak belongs to Rk(b) and a1 union ... union ak belongs to REG for any reference region b belongs to REG.

Actually, I think I might have been confused earlier. This statement is providing a definition for compound cardinal direction relations, not for simple single-tile relations. It's saying that a region could span multiple tiles, and in that case, we'd represent its relation to the reference region as a compound cardinal direction like "NW:N:NE" (meaning the region spans the NW, N, and NE tiles of the reference region).

Actually, I think I need to clarify the premises once more:
- "Region x is B of region y" means that x is in the B tile of the partition of the plane induced by the bounding box of y. Since the B tile is exactly the bounding box of y, this means x is fully inside the bounding box of y.
- Similarly, "Region y is B of region z" means that y is fully inside the bounding box of z.

From these two premises, we can deduce that x is fully inside the bounding box of z, which means "Region x is B of region z". And, as established earlier, this is the only possible relation between x and z given the premises.

So, our answer remains: If region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is B.

Actually, let's double-check the definition of relations once more.

a B b if and only if infx(b) <= infx(a), supx(a) <= supx(b), infy(b) <= infy(a) and supy(a) <= supy(b)

which says "a is in the B tile of b, if and only if the bounding box of a is inside the bounding box of b".

Given x B y and y B z, we've established that the bounding box of x must be inside the bounding box of z, which means x B z.

Could x have any other relation with z? No, because all other tiles (S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE) lie partially or completely outside the bounding box of z, and we've established that x must be fully inside the bounding box of z.

So, the only possible relation between x and z is B.

Based on this final reasoning, I'm confident in my answer.

ANSWER:

The question asks about the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that region x is B of region y and region y is B of region z.

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:

When x is B of y, this means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

When y is B of z, this means:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these inequalities:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These four combined inequalities exactly match the definition of x B z.

For any other cardinal direction relation to hold (S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE), region x would need to be at least partially outside the bounding box of z, which contradicts our derived inequalities.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

B
