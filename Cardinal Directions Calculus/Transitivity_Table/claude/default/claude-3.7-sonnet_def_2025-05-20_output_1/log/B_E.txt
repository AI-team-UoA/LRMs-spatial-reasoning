PROMPT: If region x is B of region y and region y is E of region z, then which could be the possible relations between region x and region z?

THINKING:

Let's work through this step-by-step:

First, let's understand what we have:
- x B y (region x is in the bounding box of region y)
- y E z (region y is East of region z)

Now, let's use the definitions provided to understand what these relations mean:

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

This means that region x is completely contained within the bounding box of region y.

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means that region y is completely to the east of region z.

Now, let's determine the possible relations between x and z.

From x B y, we know that x is contained within y's bounding box.
From y E z, we know that y is to the east of z.

The eastern boundary of z (supx(z)) is at most the western boundary of y (infx(y)). And from the first relation, x's western boundary (infx(x)) is at least y's western boundary (infx(y)).

So, we have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)

This suggests that region x is also to the east of region z, since x's western boundary is to the east of z's eastern boundary.

But there are more constraints to consider. Since x is within y's bounding box, and y is to the east of z, the possible relations between x and z could be:

1. x E z (x is East of z)
2. x NE z (x is North-East of z)
3. x SE z (x is South-East of z)

Let's check if these are all the possibilities or if there are more.

From the relations:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (as derived above)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from y E z and x B y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (from x B y and y E z)

These constraints imply that x is to the east of z, and its vertical extent (along the y-axis) can overlap with z's vertical extent. This confirms that the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Wait, let me check a bit more. I want to be more precise.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let's combine these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (implies x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (implies x is above or at the same level as the bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (implies x is below or at the same level as the top of z)

These constraints suggest that x is to the east of z, and its vertical extent can be:
- Completely above the bottom of z (infy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- Completely below the top of z (supy(x) ≤ supy(z))

The relation between x and z depends on how x's vertical extent compares to z:
- If x is vertically aligned with z (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), then x E z.
- If x is completely above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), then x NE z.
- If x is completely below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)), then x SE z.

But wait, the conditions I just inferred don't guarantee that x is completely above or below z. They allow for partial overlap.

Hmm, let me think again. I need to be more careful.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y, which is at or above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (the top of x is at or below the top of y, which is at or below the top of z)

Let's think about the vertical relationship more carefully:
- The bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z (infy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- The top of x is at or below the top of z (supy(x) ≤ supy(z))

This actually allows for several possibilities:
- x can be completely contained within the vertical extent of z (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
- x can be vertically aligned with z (infy(x) = infy(z) and supy(x) = supy(z))
- x can be partially overlapping with z vertically

Given that x is to the east of z, the possible cardinal directions are:
- x E z: If the vertical extent of x overlaps with the vertical extent of z (without x being completely above or below z)
- x NE z: If x is completely above the bottom of z and to the east (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- x SE z: If x is completely below the top of z and to the east (supy(x) ≤ infy(z))

But the conditions I inferred above don't guarantee x is completely above or below z. They allow for various vertical positions. Let me try again.

The key relations are:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y, which is at or above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (the top of x is at or below the top of y, which is at or below the top of z)

Let's look at the vertical relationship:
- We know infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z)
- We know supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (the top of x is at or below the top of z)

This allows x to be anywhere vertically as long as it's not completely above or below z. But that's not quite right, because we also have the constraints from x B y and y E z, which means the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y, and the top of x is at or below the top of y.

Actually, I may have been over-complicating this. Let's start directly from the definitions and see.

Given:
- x B y
- y E z

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right or at the same level as the left boundary of y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is to the left or at the same level as the right boundary of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above or at the same level as the bottom of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x is below or at the same level as the top of y)

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (the bottom of y is at or above the bottom of z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (the top of y is at or below the top of z)

Now, what can we infer about x in relation to z?

From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right (east) of z.

For the vertical relationship, we have:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (the bottom of x is at or above the bottom of y, which is at or above the bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (the top of x is at or below the top of y, which is at or below the top of z)

Now, depending on how these vertical constraints specifically play out, there are three potential cardinal direction relations:
- x E z: If x's vertical extent overlaps with z's vertical extent
- x NE z: If x is completely above z
- x SE z: If x is completely below z

Let's check for specific constraints that would place x completely above or below z:
- For x to be NE of z: supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above z)
- For x to be SE of z: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is completely below z)

From our given constraints, we have:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These don't directly enforce either supy(z) ≤ infy(x) or supy(x) ≤ infy(z). So, based on the given constraints, the vertical position of x relative to z can vary. It can be above, below, or have a partial vertical overlap with z.

So, the possible cardinal direction relations from x to z are E, NE, and SE.

Actually, maybe I'm still being too restrictive. Let's consider a concrete example:

Imagine a coordinate system where:
- z occupies the region [0,1] x [0,3] (x-coordinates 0 to 1, y-coordinates 0 to 3)
- y occupies the region [2,3] x [1,2] (which is to the east of z)
- x occupies the region [2.5, 2.8] x [1.2, 1.8] (which is within the bounding box of y)

In this example, x is to the east of z, and its vertical extent partially overlaps with z. So, the relation would be x E z.

Now, let's adjust y a bit:
- z remains [0,1] x [0,3]
- y occupies [2,3] x [2,3] (to the east and the north of z)
- x occupies [2.5, 2.8] x [2.2, 2.8] (within the bounding box of y)

In this case, x is to the east of z and completely to the north. So, the relation would be x NE z.

If we adjust y to be in the south:
- z remains [0,1] x [0,3]
- y occupies [2,3] x [0,1] (to the east and the south of z)
- x occupies [2.5, 2.8] x [0.2, 0.8] (within the bounding box of y)

The relation would be x SE z.

These examples confirm that the possible relations are E, NE, and SE. Moreover, we discovered that y can also be NE or SE of z (not just E), and this influences the relation between x and z.

Let's generalize a bit more. If:
- y E z: y is to the east of z with vertical overlap
- y NE z: y is to the northeast of z (no vertical overlap, y is above)
- y SE z: y is to the southeast of z (no vertical overlap, y is below)

And if x B y, then:
- If y E z, x can be E, NE, or SE of z.
- If y NE z, x is most likely NE of z.
- If y SE z, x is most likely SE of z.

But, it's worth noting that even if y is NE of z, x might not be completely above z (it could have a vertical overlap), in which case x E z. The same goes for y SE z.

I think the precise statement is:
- If x B y and y E z, then x can be E, NE, or SE of z.
- If x B y and y NE z, then x can be E, NE, or SE of z.
- If x B y and y SE z, then x can be E, NE, or SE of z.

But I see I'm getting too involved in the wrong scenarios. Let's just focus on the given: x B y and y E z.

Given:
- x B y: x is within the bounding box of y
- y E z: y is to the east of z

Let's examine the specific constraints and see what they imply for the relation between x and z.

For x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, let's see what other possible relations can exist.

For x W z (x is West of z):
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Since supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (from our derived constraints), and for x W z we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z), it's clear that x cannot be to the west of z.

Similarly, x cannot be NW, SW, or B of z.

For x N z (x is North of z):
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

From our derived constraints, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means infx(z) ≤ infx(x) is always satisfied. But we also need supx(x) ≤ supx(z) for x N z, which contradicts the constraint that x is to the east of z. So, x cannot be to the north of z.

For x S z (x is South of z):
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

Similarly, x cannot be to the south of z due to the horizontal constraints.

So, what's left?

For x NE z (x is Northeast of z):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

From our derived constraints, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(x). The second constraint, supy(z) ≤ infy(x), is not directly enforced but is not contradicted either. So, x can be NE of z if it's completely above z.

For x E z (x is East of z):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

We already have supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x). The constraint supy(x) ≤ supy(z) is also satisfied from our derived constraints. So, x can be E of z.

For x SE z (x is Southeast of z):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

We have supx(z) ≤ infx(x). The second constraint, supy(x) ≤ infy(z), is not directly enforced but is not contradicted either. So, x can be SE of z if it's completely below z.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Actually, in thinking further, I think there's a subtlety I might have over-complicated. 

Given:
- x B y (x is within the bounding box of y)
- y E z (y is to the east of z)

The first relation, x B y, means x is completely within the bounding box of y. The second relation, y E z, means y is to the east of z.

When I say "y is to the east of z," it means y is completely to the east of z. But this doesn't constrain the vertical relationship; y could be vertically aligned with z, completely above z, completely below z, or have a partial vertical overlap with z.

Given the constraints on x from x B y, and the constraints on y from y E z, what can we say about the position of x relative to z?

For x to be E of z, it needs to be completely to the east of z and have a vertical overlap with z.
For x to be NE of z, it needs to be completely to the east of z and completely above z.
For x to be SE of z, it needs to be completely to the east of z and completely below z.
For x to be N of z, it needs to be completely to the north of z and have a horizontal overlap with z.
For x to be S of z, it needs to be completely to the south of z and have a horizontal overlap with z.
For x to be NW of z, it needs to be completely to the northwest of z.
For x to be SW of z, it needs to be completely to the southwest of z.
For x to be W of z, it needs to be completely to the west of z and have a vertical overlap with z.
For x to be B of z, it needs to be completely within the bounding box of z.

Let me check if given the constraints, any of these directions are possible.

Since x B y, x is within the bounding box of y.
Since y E z, y is completely to the east of z.

Since y is completely to the east of z, and x is within the bounding box of y, x is also completely to the east of z. This immediately rules out directions that involve x being to the west of z: W, NW, SW, B of z. It also rules out directions that involve x having a horizontal overlap with z: N, S.

So, the possible directions are E, NE, and SE.

For x to be E of z, it needs to have a vertical overlap with z.
For x to be NE of z, it needs to be completely above z.
For x to be SE of z, it needs to be completely below z.

The vertical relationship between x and z depends on the vertical relationship between y and z, and the vertical position of x within y's bounding box. Without more constraints, all three possibilities (E, NE, SE) are valid.

In summary, the possible relations between x and z are:
- x E z: x is to the east of z with a vertical overlap
- x NE z: x is to the northeast of z
- x SE z: x is to the southeast of z

But wait, I need to double-check. For x to be B of z, x must be within the bounding box of z, meaning:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given our constraints:
- x B y: x is within the bounding box of y
- y E z: y is to the east of z

For y E z, we have supx(z) ≤ infx(y). Since x is to the east of y (or at the same level), we have infx(y) ≤ infx(x). This means supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which contradicts supx(x) ≤ supx(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

It's already clear from the constraint that y is to the east of z, and x is within the bounding box of y, that x is also to the east of z. But let me explicitly check all direction possibilities.

For x B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Given our constraints:
- x B y: x is within the bounding box of y
- y E z: y is to the east of z, which means supx(z) ≤ infx(y)

Since x is within the bounding box of y, infx(y) ≤ infx(x). This gives us supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x). But for x B z, we need infx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ infx(z). This is a contradiction because we can't have supx(z) ≤ infx(z). So, x cannot be B of z.

For x W z, NW z, or SW z, we need supx(x) ≤ infx(z). But given supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (derived from our constraints), this would lead to a contradiction. So, x cannot be W, NW, or SW of z.

For x N z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z). The first two inequalities can be satisfied based on our constraints, but we already saw that supx(x) ≤ supx(z) leads to a contradiction with supx(z) ≤ infx(x). So, x cannot be N of z.

Similarly, for x S z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z) and infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(z). Again, this is contradictory because of the horizontal constraints.

For x E z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z). From our constraints, supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which satisfies the first inequality. Also, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) from the vertical constraints of y E z and x B y. So, x can be E of z.

For x NE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x). The first inequality is satisfied as seen above. For the second, while we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), there's no direct constraint ensuring supy(z) ≤ infy(x). However, it's not contradictory either. So, x can be NE of z.

Similarly, for x SE z, we need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z). The first is satisfied, and while there's no direct constraint ensuring supy(x) ≤ infy(z), it's not contradictory. So, x can be SE of z.

In conclusion, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Actually, hold on. Let me clarify one more thing. The cardinal directions are determined not just by the position of the regions but also by their spatial overlap.

For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x is vertically bounded by z)

For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

Given our constraints:
- x B y: implies infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y E z: implies supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining, we get:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is above or at the same level as z's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (x's top is below or at the same level as z's top)

For x E z, we also need infy(x) ≤ supy(z) (which is clearly true) and supy(x) ≥ infy(z) (which is a bit trickier). From our constraints, infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which means infy(z) ≤ supy(x). Therefore, x can be E of z.

For x NE z, we need supy(z) ≤ infy(x). This is not directly enforced by our constraints, but it's not contradictory either. So, x can be NE of z if z's top is below x's bottom.

For x SE z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). This contradicts the constraint infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which gives us infy(z) ≤ supy(x). Therefore, x cannot be SE of z.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-evaluate.

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

From our constraints, we have infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x). For x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But this seems contradictory because infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which gives us infy(z) ≤ supy(x). This seems to preclude SE as a possibility.

But wait, the constraints for y E z are:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means y is to the east of z, but the vertical relationship is more flexible. It implies a vertical overlap but doesn't specify the exact positioning. In particular, it doesn't guarantee that infy(z) ≤ infy(y).

Let me re-read the definition of E:

a E b if and only if supx(b) ≤ infx(a), infy(b) ≤ infy(a) and supy(a) ≤ supy(b).

OK. So for y E z, we must have:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (the bottom of y is at or above the bottom of z)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (the top of y is at or below the top of z)

This indicates that y is to the east of z and there's a vertical overlap between y and z. The key question for the SE direction is whether supy(x) ≤ infy(z) is feasible.

Let's consolidate our constraints:
- x B y: implies infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y E z: implies supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Now, for x to be SE of z, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). But we have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y). To satisfy the SE condition, we'd need supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(y). But this is contradictory because we can't have infy(y) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z) ≤ infy(y), since that would imply supy(y) ≤ infy(y), which is impossible for any region.

This suggests that x cannot be SE of z given our constraints. Maybe let's just try all of them from first principles and see.

First, let's examine if x can be SE of z:
For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is to the south of z)

From x B y and y E z, we derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which satisfies the first condition.
- But from y E z, we know infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and from x B y, we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x). This gives us infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x), which contradicts the second condition supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

So, x cannot be SE of z.

Similarly, if we check for NE:
For x NE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

From our constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which satisfies the first condition.
- From y E z, we know supy(y) ≤ supy(z), and from x B y, we know infy(y) ≤ infy(x). These don't directly enforce or contradict supy(z) ≤ infy(x).

To explicitly check the feasibility of supy(z) ≤ infy(x), we'd have, from y E z, supy(y) ≤ supy(z), and from x B y, infy(y) ≤ infy(x). If supy(y) ≤ infy(x), then supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) gives us supy(y) ≤ min(infy(x), supy(z)). If supy(y) ≤ infy(x), then supy(z) might or might not be ≤ infy(x).

Let's take a different approach. Let's consider concrete examples:

Example 1:
- z: [0, 1] x [0, 3]
- y: [2, 3] x [1, 2] (to the east of z)
- x: [2.5, 2.8] x [1.2, 1.8] (within the bounding box of y)

In this example, x is to the east of z, and its vertical extent partially overlaps with z. So, the relation would be x E z.

Example 2:
- z: [0, 1] x [0, 1]
- y: [2, 3] x [2, 3] (to the east and north of z)
- x: [2.5, 2.8] x [2.5, 2.8] (within the bounding box of y)

In this example, x is to the east of z and completely to the north. So, the relation would be x NE z.

Example 3:
- z: [0, 1] x [2, 3]
- y: [2, 3] x [0, 1] (to the east and south of z)
- x: [2.5, 2.8] x [0.2, 0.8] (within the bounding box of y)

In this example, x is to the east of z and completely to the south. So, the relation would be x SE z.

Wait, but I said earlier that x can't be SE of z! I need to check my reasoning.

Given (from y E z):
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

And (from x B y):
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

For x SE z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

The first condition, supx(z) ≤ infx(x), is met because supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x).

For the second condition, we have supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x). For SE, we need supy(x) ≤ infy(z). These constraints don't directly enforce or contradict supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Hmm, I think I was being sloppy. The constraints don't prevent the possibility of x being SE of z. They just don't guarantee it.

For completeness, let's also check if x can be E of z:
For x E z, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is at or above z's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's top is at or below z's top)

From our constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which meets the first condition.
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which meets the second condition.
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which meets the third condition.

So, x can indeed be E of z.

So, the final answer is that the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

Let's try to distill this one more time.

Given:
- x B y (x is within the bounding box of y)
- y E z (y is to the east of z)

The constraints from these relations are:
- x B y: implies infx(y) ≤ infx(x) ≤ supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x) ≤ supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y E z: implies supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These constraints enforce:
1. x is to the east of z (since supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)).
2. The bottom of x is at or above the bottom of z (since infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)).
3. The top of x is at or below the top of z (since supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)).

With these constraints, the possible cardinal direction relations are:
- E: If x overlaps vertically with z. This is possible (and consistent with our constraints).
- NE: If x is completely to the north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). This is possible but not enforced by the constraints.
- SE: If x is completely to the south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)). This is also possible but not enforced.

The constraints don't guarantee NE or SE, but they also don't prevent them. That means, depending on the specific regions, x could be E, NE, or SE of z.

So, the possible relations between x and z are E, NE, and SE.

ANSWER:

Based on the given constraints:
- x B y (region x is in the bounding box of region y)
- y E z (region y is East of region z)

Let me analyze what this means for the relationship between x and z:

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of x is at or above bottom of z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (top of x is at or below top of z)

These constraints guarantee that x is east of z, but the vertical relationship can vary:

1. E: If x vertically overlaps with z
2. NE: If x is completely above z
3. SE: If x is completely below z

The possible relations between region x and region z are: E, NE, SE
