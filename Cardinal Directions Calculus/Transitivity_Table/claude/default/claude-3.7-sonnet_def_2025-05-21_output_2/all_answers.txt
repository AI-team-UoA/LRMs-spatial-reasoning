For r1: N, r2: N, answer: N is the only possible relation between region x and region z.

When region x is N of region y, we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y is below x)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or aligned with y's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right boundary is to the left of or aligned with y's right boundary)

When region y is N of region z, we know:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left boundary is to the right of or aligned with z's left boundary)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right boundary is to the left of or aligned with z's right boundary)

By transitivity:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (z is below x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of or aligned with z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of or aligned with z's right boundary)

These constraints exactly satisfy the definition of N (North), making it the only possible relation between x and z.
For r1: N, r2: W, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is W of region z

First, I'll analyze what these statements tell us about the relative positions:

From x is N of y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is above y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x is horizontally contained within y's extent)

From y is W of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y is vertically contained within z's extent)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means bottom of x is above bottom of z

Given these constraints, the possible relations between x and z are:

NW: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is completely above z)
W: If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x and z overlap vertically)

The possible relations are: NW, W
For r1: N, r2: E, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal direction relations, I'll analyze the constraints and determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- Region y is E of region z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supx(z) 
For r1: N, r2: S, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

N, S, B

Explanation:
From the given information, we know:
- x is North of y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y is South of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, we can derive:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

This means x's x-range is contained within z's x-range. However, we don't know the exact relationship between their y-coordinates.

Three possibilities exist:
- N: x could be above z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- S: x could be below z (if supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
- B: x could be contained within z (if infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z))
For r1: N, r2: NW, answer: Based on the definitions provided, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y
- y is NW of z

Let me analyze what we know:

1. From "x is N of y":
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) [x is above y]
   - infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) [x's horizontal extent is within y's bounds]

2. From "y is NW of z":
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(z) [y is to the left of z]
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y) [y is above z]

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) [x is above z]
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) [x is to the left of z]

For region x to be NW of region z, we need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) [x is to the left of z] - This is satisfied
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) [x is above z] - This is satisfied

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is NW.
For r1: N, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- x N y: Region x is north of region y
- y SW z: Region y is southwest of region z

From x N y, we know:
- x is above y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- x's x-projection is contained within y's x-projection (infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y))

From y SW z, we know:
- y is to the left of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z))
- y is below z (supy(y) ≤ infy(z))

Combining these constraints:
- Since supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we can deduce that supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x is to the left of z.
- We cannot determine the exact vertical relationship between x and z, as both are above y, but their relative vertical positions to each other are unconstrained.

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are:
NW, W, SW
For r1: N, r2: SE, answer: Based on the definitions provided, I'll determine which cardinal direction relations are possible between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is N of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

For x N y:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)

This means x is strictly to the right of z (no x-axis overlap), which immediately rules out W, SW, NW, B, N, and S relations.

Let me check the remaining possibilities:

1. NE: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
   - First condition is satisfied
   - Second condition is possible in certain configurations

2. E: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)
   - First condition is satisfied
   - Other conditions are possible in certain configurations

3. SE: Requires supx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
   - First condition is satisfied
   - Second condition is possible in certain configurations

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE
For r1: N, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given constraints:
- x is N of region y
- y is NE of region z

I need to determine the possible relation between x and z.

Let's analyze what these constraints tell us:

For x N y:
- x is directly above y
- The horizontal projection of x is contained within y's horizontal projection
- Formally: supy(y) ≤ infy(x), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

For y NE z:
- y is completely to the right of z
- y is completely above z
- Formally: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these constraints, we can derive:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right of z

Since x is both above and to the right of z, the only possible relation is:

NE
For r1: N, r2: B, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is N of y: This means x is entirely north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- y is B of z: This means y is entirely within the bounding box of z

From analyzing these constraints:

1. Since y is inside z's bounding box, and x is north of y, region x must be within the x-projection of z:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

2. For the y-coordinates, we know:
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y B z)
   - supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (from x N y)
   
This gives us three possible relations:

1. N: If z doesn't extend north beyond y (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), x will be entirely north of z.

2. B: If z extends far enough north to completely contain x (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)), x will be inside z's bounding box.

3. N:B: If z extends partially into x's area (infy(z) ≤ infy(x), infy(x) ≤ supy(z), but supy(x) > supy(z)), x will be partly inside z and partly north of z.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: N, B, and N:B.
For r1: W, r2: N, answer: The question asks for possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z given that x is W of y and y is N of z.

Let me analyze what these constraints mean:

When x is W of y:
- x is completely to the left of y
- The vertical extent of x is within the vertical range of y

When y is N of z:
- y is completely above z
- The horizontal extent of y is within the horizontal range of z

From these constraints, I need to determine where x could be in relation to z.

The possible relations are:

- NW (North West): x can be to the left and above z
- W (West): x can be directly to the left of z with vertical overlap
- SW (South West): x can be to the left and below z
- N (North): x can be directly above z with horizontal overlap
- S (South): x can be directly below z with horizontal overlap
For r1: W, r2: W, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

Given:
- x is W of y (x W y)
- y is W of z (y W z)

From these, I can derive:
- From x W y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- From y W z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
1. supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
2. infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
3. supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

These three derived constraints match exactly the definition of the W relation:
x W z if and only if supx(x) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

All other cardinal direction relations would violate at least one of these constraints.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: W
For r1: W, r2: E, answer: Based on the definitions and given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From the definition of W relation:
x W y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From the definition of E relation:
y E z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- Both x and z are to the left of y on the x-axis (but we don't know their relative positions)
- For the y-coordinates: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

This means z's vertical extent "contains" x's vertical extent (z has a lower bottom and a higher top than x).

Checking each possible relation:
- N, NE, NW relations require x to be above z, which contradicts our constraints
- S, SE, SW relations require x to be below z, which contradicts our constraints
- W relation is possible if x is to the left of z
- E relation is possible if x is to the right of z
- B relation is possible if x is contained within z's horizontal extent

The possible relations are: W, B, E
For r1: W, r2: S, answer: Based on the definitions of cardinal directions, I need to analyze what relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

We know:
- x is W of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x is strictly south of z in the y-dimension

Let's check each possible relation:

SW relation: Requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- The y-dimension requirement is satisfied
- For the x-dimension, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- If infx(z) is small enough, we can have supx(x) ≤ infx(z), making SW possible

S relation: Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- The y-dimension requirement is satisfied
- For the x-dimension, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z) is satisfied
- If infx(z) is small enough that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), then S is possible

The possible relations are: S, SW
For r1: W, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given relationships, I need to find the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is W of y
- y is NW of z

From "x W y", I know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's southern bound ≤ x's southern bound)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's northern bound ≤ y's northern bound)

From "y NW z", I know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is to the south of y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is west of z
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so z is entirely south of x

The only cardinal direction relation that satisfies both "x is west of z" and "z is entirely south of x" is NW.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is:
NW
For r1: W, r2: SW, answer: To answer this question, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z based on the given information.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

Let me analyze what these relations mean:

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the left of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y doesn't extend below x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x doesn't extend above y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  Therefore: supx(x) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
  Therefore: supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

For relation SW, I need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓

For relation W, I would need:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z) ✓
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✗
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) ✓

For relation S, I would need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✗
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✓

The answer is: SW
For r1: W, r2: SE, answer: S, SW, SE
For r1: W, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

From x W y, I know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x overlaps with y in the y-direction)

From y NE z, I know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z is completely to the west of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is completely to the south of y)

Combining these constraints:
- x and z are both to the west of y, but their east-west relationship is not fixed
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is completely north of z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
- NW (if x is west of z)
- N (if x's x-range is contained within z's x-range)
- NE (if x is east of z)
For r1: W, r2: B, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z when:
- Region x is W of region y
- Region y is B of region z

Let me analyze the constraints systematically:

From x W y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom is below or at x's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is below or at y's top)

From y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z's left boundary is to the left of y's left boundary)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z's bottom is below or at y's bottom)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's top is below or at z's top)

Combining these constraints:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)

Now checking possible relations:

1. W: If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is west of z. The y-dimension constraints (infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z)) are already satisfied from our derivation.

2. B: If infx(z) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is in the bounding box of z. The last three conditions are satisfied based on our derivation.

Other cardinal directions create contradictions with our derived constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: W, B
For r1: E, r2: N, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine what cardinal direction(s) region x could be in relation to region z, given the existing relationships.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From these relationships, I can derive the following constraints:

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (y and x have vertical overlap/containment)

For y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z and y have horizontal overlap/containment)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- Vertically: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z
- Horizontally: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) < supx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means x starts to the right of where y ends

These derived constraints indicate that:
- x must be above z (restricting to N, NE, or NW directions)
- x must start to the right of y, which is horizontally contained within z (ruling out NW)

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
- N (when x overlaps horizontally with z)
- NE (when x is entirely to the right of z)
For r1: E, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

B, E, W

This is because:

1. From "x E y": we know supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)
2. From "y W z": we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these constraints, we can derive for the y-axis:
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

For the x-axis, we know y is to the left of both x and z, but the relationship between x and z isn't directly determined.

Therefore:
- B is possible (x inside z's bounding box)
- E is possible (x entirely to the east of z)
- W is possible (x entirely to the west of z)

The other cardinal directions aren't possible because they all violate the y-axis constraints we derived.
For r1: E, r2: E, answer: Based on the properties of cardinal directions, I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z given the constraints.

If x is E of y and y is E of z, I can derive the following:

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

By transitivity, I can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (lower bound constraint)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (upper bound constraint)

These constraints allow for two possible relations:

1. E: When x and z have vertical overlap, all constraints are satisfied.

2. NE: When x is entirely above z (if supy(z) ≤ infy(x)), the constraints are still satisfied.

Other relations like SE are impossible because they would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which would contradict infy(z) ≤ infy(x) (since for any valid region, infy(x) < supy(x)).

The possible relations between x and z are: E, NE
For r1: E, r2: S, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z based on the given constraints.

Given:
- x is E of y
- y is S of z

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:

From "x is E of y", we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of x is not below bottom of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x is not above top of y)

From "y is S of z", we have:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (left of y is not to the left of left of z)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (right of y is not to the right of right of z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)

Now I'll check each possible relation:

For SE relation, we need:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
The second condition is satisfied. The first condition is possible but not guaranteed.

For S relation, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
The first condition is satisfied. The second and third conditions are possible but not guaranteed.

For all other relations (E, NE, N, NW, W, SW, B), at least one required condition is contradicted by our constraints.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SE
For r1: E, r2: NW, answer: Looking at the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine what relationships are possible between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (bottom of x is at or above bottom of y)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (top of x is at or below top of y)

From y NW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (z is to the right of y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)

From these constraints, I can determine:
- From supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and infy(y) ≤ infy(x), we get supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is above z
- Both x and z are to the right of y, but their relative horizontal positioning is not constrained

Therefore, the possible relations are:

N, NE, NW
For r1: E, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction relations, I need to determine what's possible between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From these, I can derive:

First, let's analyze what these relations tell us:
- y SW z means: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
- x E y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), and supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From these constraints:
- Since supy(x) ≤ supy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we know that supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- This means region x is definitely below region z on the y-axis

For the x-axis relationship, we have:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is left of z)
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is right of y)

But these don't directly constrain how x and z relate on the x-axis. Region x could be:
- To the left of z (giving SW relation)
- Directly below z with x-projections overlapping appropriately (giving S relation)
- To the right of z (giving SE relation)

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
S, SW, SE
For r1: E, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the right of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (y's bottom is below or at the same level as x's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is below or at the same level as y's top)

From y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

By transitivity:
1. For x-coordinates: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
   Therefore: supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right of z.

2. For y-coordinates: supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z)
   Therefore: supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z.

Since region x is both to the right of and below region z, the only possible cardinal direction relation between them is SE.
For r1: E, r2: NE, answer: The question asks which relations are possible between region x and region z, given the constraints:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Let me analyze what we know from these constraints:

From x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's y-coordinates are within y's y-range)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

By transitivity, I can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), therefore supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of z)

These constraints show that x is both to the east and north of z, which precisely defines the NE relation.

The answer is: NE
For r1: E, r2: B, answer: Given that:
- Region x is E of region y
- Region y is B of region z

Let me analyze the possible relations between x and z by considering the constraints.

For x E y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x's bottom is at or above y's bottom)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) (x's top is at or below y's top)

For y B z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left is at or right of z's left)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right is at or left of z's right)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y's bottom is at or above z's bottom)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's top is at or below z's top)

Combining these constraints:
1. For the vertical dimension: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)
   This means x is vertically contained within z's extent.

2. For the horizontal dimension, we have:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is east of y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is within z horizontally)

Two possible relations emerge:
- B: If z extends far enough east to contain x (infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z))
- E: If x is completely east of z (supx(z) < infx(x))

The answer is: B, E
For r1: S, r2: N, answer: The correct answer is: N, S, B

When analyzing this problem, I need to determine how the given relations constrain the possible relationships between x and z.

From x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x doesn't extend to the left of y)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x doesn't extend to the right of y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is below y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far left as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y)

Combining these constraints:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left boundary is to the right of z's left boundary)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (x's right boundary is to the left of z's right boundary)

This means x is "horizontally contained" within z.

For the vertical relationship, we know both x and z are below y, but their vertical relationship with each other is not determined by the given constraints.

Given the horizontal constraint and the undetermined vertical relationship, x can only have three possible relationships with z:

1. N: If z is completely below x (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
2. S: If x is completely below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
3. B: If x is horizontally inside z and also vertically contained within z

The other 6 relations are impossible because they would require x to extend horizontally beyond z in some way, which contradicts our established constraints.
For r1: S, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

SW, W, NW

Explanation:
- When x is S of y, x is completely below y
- When y is W of z, y is completely to the left of z
- Combining these constraints, we know that x must be to the left of z (because x is at most as far right as y, and y is to the left of z)
- However, the vertical relationship between x and z can vary:
  - x could be below z (giving SW relation)
  - x could overlap with z vertically (giving W relation)
  - x could be above z (giving NW relation)
For r1: S, r2: E, answer: 
For r1: S, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- region x is S of region y
- region y is S of region z

From the first relation (x is S of y), we know:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x's left edge is to the right of or at y's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's right edge is to the left of or at y's right edge)

From the second relation (y is S of z), we know:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y's left edge is to the right of or at z's left edge)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y's right edge is to the left of or at z's right edge)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) → supy(x) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) → infx(z) ≤ infx(x) (z's left edge is to the left of x's left edge)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z) → supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's right edge is to the left of z's right edge)

These three conditions exactly match the requirements for the S relation between x and z.

The answer is: S
For r1: S, r2: NW, answer: Based on the given information, I need to find the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is NW of region z

From the definition of S relation: 
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)

From the definition of NW relation:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- From supx(x) ≤ supx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(z), we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- This means x is strictly to the left of z (no horizontal overlap)

Vertically, both x and z are below y, but their vertical relationship is not directly constrained. Therefore:

1. If x is above z: x NW z (x is to the left and above z)
2. If x vertically overlaps with z: x W z (x is to the left and at the same vertical level as z)
3. If x is below z: x SW z (x is to the left and below z)

The possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, W, SW
For r1: S, r2: SW, answer: Based on the definitions, I'll analyze the possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x being S of y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's horizontal span is within y's horizontal span)

From y being SW of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the left of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is below z)

From these, we can derive:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) (x is below z)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (x is to the left of z)

Checking these against all cardinal direction definitions:
- For SW: requires supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which are both satisfied

Other relations either contradict the horizontal constraint (S, SE, B, NE, E) or the vertical constraint (W, NW, N).

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is: SW
For r1: S, r2: SE, answer: Looking at the given relations, I need to determine the possible cardinal directions between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

Let me analyze what these relations tell us:

For x S y:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is completely below y)
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(y) (x's x-range is within y's x-range)

For y SE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is completely to the right of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is completely below z)

Combining these constraints:
- From supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and infx(y) ≤ infx(x), we get supx(z) ≤ infx(x), which means x is to the right of z.
- From supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), we get supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which means x is below z.

When a region is both to the right of and below another region, it is in the SE direction.

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.
For r1: S, r2: NE, answer: Looking at the given conditions, I need to determine what relations are possible between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is S of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

From the definitions:
- x S y means: supy(x) ≤ infy(y), infx(y) ≤ infx(x), and supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
1. From y NE z, we get supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
2. From x S y, we get infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
3. Therefore, supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This means x must be to the east of z in some way.

For the y-coordinate relationship, we have:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x S y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (from y NE z)

These don't give us a direct constraint between x and z in the y-direction, so x could be above, below, or at the same level as z.

Checking each possible relation and considering the constraint supx(z) ≤ infx(x):
- N, NW, W, SW, S, and B relations are impossible because they require x to overlap with z in the x-direction
- Only NE, E, and SE are possible

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE.
For r1: S, r2: B, answer: 
For r1: NW, r2: N, answer: Looking at the given information:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

For x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) [x is entirely to the left of y]
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) [x is entirely above y]

For y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) [y is entirely above z]
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [y's x-projection within z's x-projection]

From these constraints, I can deduce:
- Since supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y), by transitivity: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
  This means x is definitely above z, which narrows possibilities to N, NW, or NE.

For x to be NW of z:
- If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is entirely to the left of z, making the relation NW.

For x to be N of z:
- If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x's x-projection is within z's x-projection, making the relation N.

For x to be NE of z:
- This would require supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- But from our constraints: supx(x) ≤ infx(y), y_r ≤ supx(z), which creates a contradiction where y_r < y_l.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: NW, N
For r1: NW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given conditions:
- x is NW of y
- y is W of z

Let me analyze what these conditions tell us about the possible relations between x and z.

From x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

From y W z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is west of z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (y's vertical extent is within z's)

Combining these:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
  → x is definitely west of z

- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y), which means infy(z) < infy(x)
  → x is at least partially north of z's lower bound

This allows for two possible relations:
1. NW: If supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely north of z)
2. W: If infy(x) < supy(z) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z) (x's vertical extent is within z's)

NW, W
For r1: NW, r2: E, answer: To solve this problem, I need to analyze what constraints are placed on the positions of regions x, z, and y based on the given relations.

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y E z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

From these, we can determine:
1. x is to the west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
2. x is to the north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
3. z is to the west of y (supx(z) ≤ infx(y))
4. z extends below or equal to y at the bottom (infy(z) ≤ infy(y))
5. z extends above or equal to y at the top (supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

Combining points 2, 4, and 5:
- Since x is north of y (supy(y) ≤ infy(x))
- And z extends below y (infy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- We can infer: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) < supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This means the bottom of x is above some part of z, making it impossible for x to be completely south of z. Therefore, the relations SW, S, and SE are ruled out.

For the x-dimension, both x and z are west of y, but we cannot determine their exact relative positions.

The possible relations between x and z are: NW, N, NE, W, E, B
For r1: NW, r2: S, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is S of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z.

Let me analyze each relationship:

For x NW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is west of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is north of y)

For y S z:
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is south of z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (y is horizontally within z)

Checking each possible relation:

1. W relation: 
   - x can be west of z and vertically aligned with it
   - This is possible when x is west of y, y is horizontally within z, and x is vertically aligned with z

2. NW relation:
   - x can be northwest of z (both north and west)
   - This is possible when x is northwest of y and y is south of z

3. SW relation:
   - x can be southwest of z (both south and west)
   - This is possible when x is west of y but positioned such that it's south of z

Other relations (N, NE, E, SE, S, B) are not possible due to the constraints.

The answer is: W, NW, SW
For r1: NW, r2: NW, answer: The possible relation between region x and region z is:

NW

Here's the reasoning:

Given:
- x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

For the x-coordinate:
- From x NW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- By transitivity: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- Therefore: supx(x) ≤ infx(z)

For the y-coordinate:
- From x NW y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y NW z: supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- By transitivity: supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Therefore: supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

The conditions supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(x) match exactly the definition of NW relation. This means region x is entirely to the west of region z and entirely to the north of region z.
For r1: NW, r2: SW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

W
NW
SW

These are the only possible relations because:

1. From x being NW of y, we know supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
2. From y being SW of z, we know supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
3. Combining these, we get supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which means x must be to the west of z

For the north-south positioning:
- x could be north of z (NW relation)
- x could overlap with z in the y-direction (W relation)
- x could be south of z (SW relation)

No other cardinal relations are possible because x must be strictly to the west of z.
For r1: NW, r2: SE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to analyze the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is SE of region z

From the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these constraints, both x and z are positioned to the left of y (in terms of x-coordinate) and above y (in terms of y-coordinate). However, the constraints don't determine the exact relationship between x and z.

I can verify through coordinate examples that any of the cardinal directions could be satisfied while maintaining the given constraints.

The possible relations between region x and region z are:
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: NW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given conditions:
- Region x is NW of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

I need to determine what cardinal direction relation(s) could exist between region x and region z.

From the definitions:
- x NW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can infer:
1. x is to the left of y (from x NW y)
2. x is above y (from x NW y)
3. z is to the left of y (from y NE z)
4. z is below y (from y NE z)

Combining these facts, especially (2) and (4), we can deduce:
supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(x)

Therefore supy(z) ≤ infy(x), which means x is definitely above z.

The horizontal relationship between x and z is not directly constrained - they are both to the left of y but could be positioned in different ways relative to each other.

The possible relations are:
- N (if z's x-extent contains x's x-extent)
- NE (if z is to the left of x)
- NW (if x is to the left of z)
For r1: NW, r2: B, answer: 
For r1: SW, r2: N, answer: Based on the given constraints, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From the SW relation:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is completely to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is completely to the south of y)

From the N relation:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z is completely to the south of y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)

Analyzing the constraints:
1. We know x is west of y (supx(x) ≤ infx(y))
2. We know z extends at least as far west as y (infx(z) ≤ infx(y))
3. Given these constraints, x can never be east of z because x's eastern edge is west of y's western edge, while z extends at least as far east as y

Looking at vertical positioning:
- Both x and z are south of y, but their relative positions to each other aren't fully constrained

The possible relations are:
SW, W, NW, S, B, N
For r1: SW, r2: W, answer: Based on the given constraints, I'll determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is W of region z

From these, I can derive:

For x SW of y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y)

For y W of z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

By transitivity:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so x is always to the west of z
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) and infy(z) ≤ infy(y)

This gives us two possibilities:

1. If supy(x) ≤ infy(z), then x is SW of z
2. If infy(z) < supy(x) and infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z), then x is W of z

I can verify no other relations are possible because x must be to the west of z, and constraints prevent other arrangements.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, W
For r1: SW, r2: E, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible spatial relationships between region x and region z, given the constraints:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From these constraints, I know:
- x is SW of y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is E of z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y), and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Let me analyze which cardinal directions are possible for x relative to z:

For N, NE, NW directions:
These all require x to be above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x)). However, we know x is below y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y)), and z can extend above y (supy(y) ≤ supy(z)). This creates the chain: supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), making it impossible for x to be above z.

For E, SE, S, SW, W, and B directions:
None of these are ruled out by our constraints. Since both x and z are positioned to the left of y (but with no direct constraint between them horizontally), and x is below y while z can extend both above and below y, all these directions remain possible.

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are: E, SE, S, SW, W, B
For r1: SW, r2: S, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between regions x and z.

Given:
- x is SW of y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y is S of z: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these, I can determine:
1. supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(z) - this means x is definitely south of z

For the east-west relationship:
- From x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y)
- From y S z: infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Two possible scenarios exist:
1. If supx(x) ≤ infx(z), then x is west of z, making x SW of z
2. If infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection, making x S of z

Therefore, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
S, SW
For r1: SW, r2: NW, answer: Given:
- x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y NW z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these constraints:

1. For the east-west relationship:
   - supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
   - This means supx(x) ≤ infx(z), which implies x is west of z

2. For the north-south relationship:
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
   - supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
   - This means both x and z are south of y, but their north-south relationship with each other is not fixed

Possible relations:
- NW (if x is north of z)
- W (if x and z overlap in the north-south direction according to W relation constraints)
- SW (if x is south of z)
- W:NW (if x extends north of z while being west)
- W:SW (if x extends south of z while being west)
- W:NW:SW (if x extends both north and south of z while being west)
For r1: SW, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given relations, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
1. Region x is SW of region y
2. Region y is SW of region z

From x SW y:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) (x is to the west of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

From y SW z:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is to the south of z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), which means supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These two constraints (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) define exactly the SW relation.

SW
For r1: SW, r2: SE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

SW, S, SE

I arrived at these by analyzing what we know:
- x SW y means: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- y SE z means: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From these, we can deduce that supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means x must be below z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z)).

This immediately rules out B, W, NW, N, NE, E as they all require x to at least partially align with z vertically.

For the x-coordinates, we cannot directly determine a relationship, allowing for three possibilities:
- SW: x is to the left and below z
- S: x is directly below z
- SE: x is to the right and below z
For r1: SW, r2: NE, answer: Based on the given information, I need to find all possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

This means:
- For x SW y: supx(x) ≤ infx(y) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- For y NE z: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these constraints, we know that both x and z are positioned to the southwest of y, but their exact relationship to each other can vary.

I'll verify each possible relation by checking if it can be satisfied without violating the given constraints:

For each relation, we can create a valid configuration. For example:
- x SW z: Place x further southwest than z, while both remain southwest of y
- x S z: Place x directly south of z, while both remain southwest of y
- x SE z: Place x southeast of z, while both remain southwest of y
- And so on for all other directions

After checking all cardinal directions, the possible relations between region x and region z are:
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, B
For r1: SW, r2: B, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is SW of region y
- Region y is B of region z

I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

From x SW y, we know:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(y) [x is to the left of y]
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) [x is below y]

From y B z, we know:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) [z extends at least as far left as y]
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) [z extends at least as far right as y]
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) [z extends at least as far down as y]
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) [z extends at least as far up as y]

Depending on how far z extends beyond y's boundaries, four relationships are possible:

1. SW: If z has similar boundaries to y, x remains southwest of z
2. W: If z extends further down (beyond x) but not far enough left
3. S: If z extends further left (beyond x) but not far enough down
4. B: If z extends both further left and further down (containing x)

The possible relations are: SW, W, S, B
For r1: SE, r2: N, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is SE of y
- y is N of z

Let me analyze what cardinal direction relations are possible between x and z. I'll check each possibility systematically.

The possible relations are:

**E (East)**: 
Region x can be to the east of z, with their y-projections overlapping.

**NE (Northeast)**:
Region x can be to the northeast of z (both east and north).

**SE (Southeast)**:
Region x can be to the southeast of z (both east and south).

**S (South)**:
Region x can be south of z, with their x-projections overlapping.

**N (North)**:
Region x can be to the north of z, with their x-projections overlapping.

**B (Bounding box)**:
Region x can be inside the bounding box of z.

The answer is: E, NE, SE, S, N, B
For r1: SE, r2: W, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are: SW, S, SE, W, B, E.

To determine this, I analyzed the constraints:

For x SE y:
- x is east of y (supx(y) ≤ infx(x))
- x is south of y (supy(x) ≤ infy(y))

For y W z:
- y is west of z (supx(y) ≤ infx(z))
- z's bottom is at or below y's bottom (infy(z) ≤ infy(y))
- y's top is at or below z's top (supy(y) ≤ supy(z))

From these constraints:
1. East-west relationship: x is east of y, and z is east of y. This means x could be west of z, aligned with z, or east of z.
2. North-south relationship: x is south of y, and z vertically contains or aligns with y. This means x could be entirely south of z, or x could vertically overlap with z.

Combining these possible arrangements gives us the six possible relations: SW, S, SE, W, B, E.
For r1: SE, r2: E, answer: 
For r1: SE, r2: S, answer: To solve this problem, I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given that x is SE of y and y is S of z.

Let me analyze what these given relations tell us:

1) x is SE of y means:
   - supx(y) <= infx(x) [x is to the east of y]
   - supy(x) <= infy(y) [x is to the south of y]

2) y is S of z means:
   - supy(y) <= infy(z) [y is to the south of z]
   - infx(z) <= infx(y) [z and y are aligned in the east-west direction]
   - supx(y) <= supx(z) [z and y are aligned in the east-west direction]

From these, I can deduce:
- supy(x) <= infy(y) <= infy(z)
This means x must be to the south of z.

For the east-west relationship:
- From infx(z) <= infx(y) and supx(y) <= infx(x), I can derive that infx(z) <= infx(x)
- But there's no direct constraint between supx(x) and supx(z)

Let's check each possible relation:

For S relation:
- We already established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- We derived infx(z) <= infx(x)
- supx(x) <= supx(z) is possible but not guaranteed

For SE relation:
- We already established supy(x) <= infy(z)
- supx(z) <= infx(x) is possible but not guaranteed

All other relations are impossible given the constraints.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: S, SE
For r1: SE, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

N
NE
E
SE
S
SW
W
NW
B

All cardinal direction relations are possible. Since we know x is SE of y and y is NW of z, both x and z are in the southeast quadrant relative to y, but their positions relative to each other are not constrained. For each possible relation, we can construct a valid configuration of regions that satisfies the given constraints.
For r1: SE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given constraints:
1. Region x is SE of region y
2. Region y is SW of region z

I need to determine the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z.

From these constraints:
- Since x is SE of y: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(x) ≤ infy(y)
- Since y is SW of z: supx(y) ≤ infx(z) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

From the y-coordinate constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (from x is SE of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (from y is SW of z)
This yields: supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
So in the y-direction, x is definitely south of z.

For the x-direction:
The constraints don't directly determine whether x is east, west, or overlapping with z.

Therefore, the possible cardinal direction relations between x and z are:
S, SW, SE
For r1: SE, r2: SE, answer: If region x is SE of region y and region y is SE of region z, then the only possible relation between region x and region z is SE.

To verify this:

When x is SE of y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of y)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is entirely to the south of y)

When y is SE of z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (y is entirely to the east of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z) (y is entirely to the south of z)

By transitivity:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x), therefore supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ infy(y) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), therefore supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These two conditions together satisfy exactly the definition of SE relation between x and z.

SE
For r1: SE, r2: NE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

E, NE, SE

When x is SE of y and y is NE of z, we know that:
- x must be to the east of y
- x must be to the south of y
- y must be to the east of z
- y must be to the north of z

From these constraints, we can determine that x must be to the east of z (since x is east of y, and y is east of z).

However, the north-south relationship between x and z can vary:
- x could be at the same latitude as z (giving relation E)
- x could be north of z (giving relation NE)
- x could be south of z (giving relation SE)
For r1: SE, r2: B, answer: The question asks for the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z, given that region x is SE of region y and region y is B of region z.

Let me analyze what these constraints tell us:

1) x is SE of y means:
   - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
   - supy(x) ≤ infy(y) (x is to the south of y)

2) y is B of z means:
   - infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far left as y)
   - supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far right as y)
   - infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far down as y)
   - supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far up as y)

Based on these constraints, let me check each possible relation between x and z:

- SE: Possible if z doesn't extend too far east or south beyond y
- E: Possible if z extends far enough south to overlap with x in the y-dimension
- S: Possible if z extends far enough east to overlap with x in the x-dimension
- B: Possible if z extends far enough in both directions to completely contain x

For the other directions:
- SW, W, NW: Impossible because x must be to the east of z's western boundary
- N, NE: Impossible because x must be to the south of z's northern boundary

The answer is: SE, E, S, B
For r1: NE, r2: N, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- x is NE of y: This means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is N of z: This means supy(z) ≤ infy(y), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I can derive:
1. Since supy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x), it follows that supy(z) ≤ infy(x), meaning x is to the north of z.
2. Since infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ infx(x), it follows that infx(z) ≤ infx(x), meaning x's leftmost boundary is to the right of z's leftmost boundary.

For x to be N of z:
- We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓
- We need infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓
- We need supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (not guaranteed by constraints)

For x to be NE of z:
- We need supx(z) ≤ infx(x) (not guaranteed by constraints)
- We need supy(z) ≤ infy(x) ✓

Depending on the exact positions of the regions, either relation is possible:
- If supx(x) ≤ supx(z), then x could be N of z
- If supx(z) ≤ infx(x), then x could be NE of z

The possible relations are: N, NE
For r1: NE, r2: W, answer: Based on the given information, I'll determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is W of region z

From these constraints:
- x is to the northeast of y, so x is both north and east of y
- y is to the west of z and vertically aligned with z

From the relations above, I can deduce that:
- Since y is vertically aligned with z, and x is north of y, the southern boundary of x must be at or above the southern boundary of z
- The east-west relationship between x and z isn't fully constrained

The possible relations between x and z are:

- NE (Northeast): If x is both north of and east of z
- N (North): If x is directly north of z (horizontally aligned)
- NW (Northwest): If x is both north of and west of z
- E (East): If x is directly east of z (vertically aligned)
- W (West): If x is directly west of z (vertically aligned)
- B (Bounding box): If x is contained within z's bounding box
For r1: NE, r2: E, answer: Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine possible relations between x and z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y: 
  - supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- Region y is E of region z:
  - supx(z) ≤ infx(y), infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

First, let's determine the east-west relationship:
From the given relations, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) (from y E z)
- infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (from x NE y)

By transitivity: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
This means x must be to the east of z.

For the north-south relationship:
- From x NE y: supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- From y E z: infy(z) ≤ infy(y) and supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
1. If supy(z) ≤ infy(x): then x is NE of z
2. If infy(z) ≤ infy(x) and supy(x) ≤ supy(z): then x is E of z

The SE relation isn't possible because the constraints imply infy(z) ≤ supy(x), which contradicts the SE requirement of supy(x) ≤ infy(z).

Therefore, the possible relations between x and z are: NE, E
For r1: NE, r2: S, answer: Based on the given constraints, I need to determine all possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is S of region z

First, let me break down what these relations mean:
- x is NE of y means: supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is S of z means: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

From these constraints, I'll analyze what positions x can have relative to z:

1. N: x can be strictly north of z if it's within z's horizontal extent but above it
2. NE: x can be strictly northeast of z if it's both east and north of z
3. E: x can be strictly east of z if it's within z's vertical extent but to the right of it
4. SE: x can be strictly southeast of z if x is far enough east of y and not too far north
5. S: x can be strictly south of z while still being NE of y (if x is just above y but still below z)
6. B: x can be inside z's bounding box if z is large enough

For example, if:
- z is at (0,10)-(10,20)
- y is at (3,5)-(7,9)
- x is at (8,9.5)-(9,10)

Then x is NE of y and y is S of z, while x is S of z.

The possible relations between region x and region z are: N, NE, E, SE, S, B
For r1: NE, r2: NW, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are:

N, NE, NW

Since x is NE of y, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is to the north of y)

Since y is NW of z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), which means x must be to the north of z
- The east-west relationship between x and z remains unconstrained

Therefore, x must be in one of the northern positions relative to z: N, NE, or NW.
For r1: NE, r2: SW, answer: Based on the given information:
- Region x is NE of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

Let me analyze the possible relations between regions x and z:

When x is NE of y, it means x is to the right and above y.
When y is SW of z, it means y is to the left and below z.

Given these constraints, x could be in any of the following positions relative to z:

1. N: x could be directly north of z
2. NE: x could be northeast of z
3. E: x could be directly east of z 
4. SE: x could be southeast of z
5. S: x could be directly south of z
6. SW: x could be southwest of z
7. W: x could be directly west of z
8. NW: x could be northwest of z
9. B: x could be inside the bounding box of z

All cardinal direction relations are possible because knowing that x is NE of y and y is SW of z doesn't constrain the position of x relative to z in any way. The relationship depends on exactly how far x is from y in the northeast direction compared to how far z is from y in the northeast direction.
For r1: NE, r2: SE, answer: The possible relations between region x and region z are: NE, E, SE.

I'll analyze the constraints to determine this:

Given:
- x is NE of y ⟹ supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y is SE of z ⟹ supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

For the east-west relationship:
From transitivity: supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(x)
Therefore: supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

This means x must be strictly east of z, which eliminates all possibilities except NE, E, and SE.

For the north-south relationship:
We know supy(y) ≤ infy(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(z), but this doesn't directly constrain the relationship between x and z in the north-south dimension.

Therefore, all three remaining possibilities are valid:
- NE: if x is north of z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))
- E: if x overlaps with z in the north-south dimension
- SE: if x is south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z))
For r1: NE, r2: NE, answer: The only possible relation between region x and region z is NE.

Let me explain why:

Given:
- x NE y means supx(y) ≤ infx(x) and supy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- y NE z means supx(z) ≤ infx(y) and supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

From these, we can derive:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), therefore supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), therefore supy(z) ≤ infy(x)

These two conditions together satisfy exactly the definition of the NE relation between x and z.
For r1: NE, r2: B, answer: The cardinal direction relations between x and z can be determined by analyzing the constraints.

Given:
- x is NE of y
- y is B of z

For x to be NE of y:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(x) (x is entirely to the east of y)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(x) (x is entirely to the north of y)

For y to be B of z:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) (z extends at least as far west as y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z) (z extends at least as far east as y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) (z extends at least as far south as y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z) (z extends at least as far north as y)

Analyzing possible relations:

1. B: If y is a small region inside z and x is just northeast of y but still inside z, then x B z is possible.

2. N: If y is in the southern part of z and x is northeast of y extending north of z, then x N z is possible.

3. NE: If y is in the southwest corner of z and x is northeast of y extending outside z, then x NE z is possible.

4. E: If y is in the western part of z and x is northeast of y extending east of z, then x E z is possible.

Relations that are not possible:
- S, SE: Since x is north of y and y is inside z, x cannot be south of z
- SW, W: Since x is east of y and y is inside z, x cannot be west of z
- NW: Since x is northeast of y and y is inside z, x cannot be northwest of z

Possible relations: B, N, NE, E
For r1: B, r2: N, answer: Based on the given information, I need to determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is N of region z

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y N z:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

These constraints match exactly with the N relation:
- supy(z) ≤ infy(x) (x is strictly above z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z) (x's x-projection is contained within z's x-projection)

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is N.
For r1: B, r2: W, answer: The question is asking for all possible cardinal direction relations between regions x and z, given the constraints:

1. Region x is B (bounding box) of region y
2. Region y is W (West) of region z

First, let's analyze what these constraints tell us:

x B y means:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

y W z means:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z), so supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x), so infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z), so supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

These three conditions exactly satisfy the definition of the W relation: x W z if and only if:
- supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(z)

Let me verify if other relations are possible:

For SW: Would require supy(x) ≤ infy(z), but we know infy(z) ≤ infy(x), which would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(x), contradicting the definition of a valid region.

For NW: Would require supy(z) ≤ infy(x), but we know supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which would mean supy(x) ≤ infy(x), again contradicting the definition of a valid region.

The answer is: W
For r1: B, r2: E, answer: Based on the given definitions and the conditions, I'll determine the possible cardinal direction relations between region x and region z.

Given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is E of region z

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y E z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x) → x is entirely to the right of z
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x) → bottom of x is above bottom of z
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z) → top of x is below top of z

Checking each relation:
- E: All requirements satisfied (x is right of z, y-extent of x within z)
- NE: Possible in special case where supy(z) = infy(x)
- SE: Possible in special case where supy(x) = infy(z)
- N: Possible in special case where supy(z) = infy(x) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)
- S: Possible in special case where supy(x) = infy(z) and supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

The answer is: E, NE, SE, N, S
For r1: B, r2: S, answer: To determine the possible relations between region x and region z based on the given conditions, I'll analyze what we know:

1. Region x is B of region y
   - This means x is inside y's bounding box
   - Formally: infx(y) ≤ infx(x), supx(x) ≤ supx(y), infy(y) ≤ infy(x), supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

2. Region y is S of region z
   - This means y is south of z
   - Formally: supy(y) ≤ infy(z), infx(z) ≤ infx(y), supx(y) ≤ supx(z)

Combining these constraints:
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), so supy(x) ≤ infy(z)
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), so infx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z), so supx(x) ≤ supx(z)

For x to be S of z, we need:
- supy(x) ≤ infy(z) ✓
- infx(z) ≤ infx(x) ✓
- supx(x) ≤ supx(z) ✓

All conditions for S are satisfied. Let's check if any other relations are possible:
- B: Impossible because supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts the requirement infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- SW, W, NW: Impossible because infx(z) ≤ infx(x) contradicts supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- N, NE, NW: Impossible because supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts supy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- E: Impossible because supy(x) ≤ infy(z) contradicts infy(z) ≤ infy(x)
- SE: Impossible because supx(x) ≤ supx(z) contradicts supx(z) ≤ infx(x)

Therefore, the only possible relation is: S
For r1: B, r2: NW, answer: Based on the definitions provided, I need to determine the possible relation(s) between region x and region z given that x B y and y NW z.

Let me analyze the constraints:

From y NW z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z) (y is to the west of z)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) (y is to the north of z)

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
  This means x is to the west of z
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
  This means x is to the north of z

When a region is both to the west and to the north of another region, it is in the NW direction.

Therefore, the relation between region x and region z is NW.
For r1: B, r2: SW, answer: Based on the cardinal direction definitions, I'll determine the possible relations between region x and region z.

Given information:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is SW of region z

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y SW z, we know:
- supx(y) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)

By combining these constraints:
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ infx(z) → supx(x) ≤ infx(z)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z) → supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These derived conditions (supx(x) ≤ infx(z) and supy(x) ≤ infy(z)) precisely match the definition of the SW relation.
For r1: B, r2: SE, answer: The question asks for the possible relations between regions x and z, given:
- x is B (bounding box) of y
- y is SE (south east) of z

Let's analyze what these constraints tell us:

From y SE z, we know:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)  (y is to the east of z)
- supy(y) ≤ infy(z)  (y is below z)

From x B y, we know:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x), which means supx(z) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ infy(z), which means supy(x) ≤ infy(z)

These two derived constraints match exactly the definition of the SE relation:
- x is to the east of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
- x is to the south of z (supy(x) ≤ infy(z))

Therefore, the only possible relation between region x and region z is:

SE
For r1: B, r2: NE, answer: The question asks for possible relations between region x and region z given:
- Region x is B of region y
- Region y is NE of region z

Let me analyze this systematically by deriving constraints from the given information.

From x B y:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

From y NE z:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y)

Combining these constraints:
- supx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)

This means:
1. x is strictly to the right of z (supx(z) ≤ infx(x))
2. x is strictly above z (supy(z) ≤ infy(x))

Let's check each possible cardinal direction:
- For B, N, S, W, NW, SW: These require x to at least partially overlap with z horizontally or vertically, which contradicts our derived constraints.
- For E: Requires supy(x) ≤ supy(z), which contradicts our constraint that x is strictly above z.
- For SE: Requires supy(x) ≤ infy(z), which contradicts our constraint that x is strictly above z.

The only relation that satisfies both constraints is NE.

Therefore, the possible relation between region x and region z is: NE
For r1: B, r2: B, answer: Based on the given cardinal direction definitions, I need to determine the possible relations between regions x and z given that x is B of y and y is B of z.

If x is B of y, the following must be true:
- infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y)
- infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y)

If y is B of z, the following must be true:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y)
- supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y)
- supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

Combining these inequalities by transitivity:
- infx(z) ≤ infx(y) ≤ infx(x)
- supx(x) ≤ supx(y) ≤ supx(z)
- infy(z) ≤ infy(y) ≤ infy(x)
- supy(x) ≤ supy(y) ≤ supy(z)

These combined inequalities exactly match the definition of the B relation between x and z. Testing against other relations shows contradictions with these established inequalities.

Therefore, B is the only possible relation between region x and region z.
